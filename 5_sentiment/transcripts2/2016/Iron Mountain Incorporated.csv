We are pleased to report strong fourth quarter and full year financial and operating results that in every respect met and exceeded our expectations in constant dollars with reported EPS for the quarter beating expectations. Our results continued to demonstrate the durability of our core storage rental business even in this volatile times. Total revenue in constant dollars was in line with our guidance, and constant dollar adjusted OIBDA was at the upper end of our range. We continued to achieve solid growth in storage rental revenue as well as consistent volume growth in new records from existing customers. We also achieved service gross margins in line with our year-end exit rate goal as well as growth in adjusted OIBDA. All of these accomplishments resulted in a very good 2015. 
I believe most of your familiar with the strategic plan we outlined at our Investor Day last fall. To assist in tracking our progress against that plan, we've modified the earnings commentary at the beginning of our supplemental disclosure to highlight key performance metrics. You'll note that in addition to our solid financial performance in 2015, we made good progress against our objectives in each of the 3 pillars and in the foundational at that support our strategy. As anticipated, the strength of the U.S. dollar continued to impact our reported revenue. However, when looking through to fundamental performance, we've achieved a significant turnaround in the business in the last 2 years. We've gone from negative internal growth internal revenue in both 2012 and 2013 to 1% positive internal growth or prior to acquisitions in 2014. And in 2015, we achieved further improvement with 1.5% positive internal growth. This is a testament to the hard work our organization has undertaken to: first, achieve net records management volume growth in all major markets; enhance customer service in retention whilst attracting new customers; stabilize service revenue declines in records management; penetrate new emerging markets and advancing adjacent business opportunities. 
Turning to the pillars of our strategic plan in developed markets. Our focus over the last 2 years on getting more growth from these regions has driven improved performance with positive internal storage growth, stabilizing records management service revenues and adding roughly 3 million cubic feet of net new records in 2015 prior to acquisitions. In emerging markets, revenue has grown from 10% of the total in 2013 to 14.6% of total revenue at the end of 2015 on a constant dollar basis. We have a sizable deal pipeline and are confident we will reach our goal of 16% of total revenue from these markets by 2016 and 20% by 2020. Importantly, we're driving internal growth in these markets of roughly 10% per year, so just 2 points of our 20% goal comes from acquisition. 
We resumed M&A activity in select emerging markets in the fourth quarter, closing on a transaction in India. We have adjusted our focus to account for Recalls footprint and expect to close a few transactions in the first half of 2016, including a couple in fast-growing, new emerging markets with underserved demand for records management. As we've noted in recent calls, despite the impact of the strong dollar on reported revenue, we mitigate our FX exposure at the income level because our expenses are denominated in the same local currencies as our revenues and we are increasingly moving more of our debt outside the United States. The net of this is that we exceeded earnings expectations for the fourth quarter. Additionally, using strong dollar to invest in high-growth markets outside the U.S. gives us a lower cost basis and sets was up to realize significant value creation as the economic growth in these markets over the longer term will typically outpace that of the United States. I should note that in our other international segment, which is emerging markets plus Australia, we did see a higher level of destructions in Q4, driven by a single large customer, which will carry over into Q1 of 2016. However, we do not see any other such unusual destructions on the horizon and expect that destructions for the remainder of the year will return to more typical levels. But we do report volume change on a trailing 12-month basis, and therefore, this level will remain slightly elevated over the next few quarters. 
We also have a goal to generate 5% of our total worldwide revenue from adjacent businesses by the end of 2020, up from just 2% at the end of 2015. Today, our adjacent businesses consist of our data center operations in our recently acquired art storage business. We closed on Crozier Fine Arts storage in December and are pleased with how it is being integrated into our business whilst retaining the DNA and key management talent that made it the leading art storage business in the United States. We believe the $1 billion estimated global market is poised for the same type of consolidation opportunity we saw in the records management business years ago, and we have a plan that can take it to $100 million within 3 years. We had a fairly aggressive goal for 2015 to finish with an adjacent business revenue run rate of $50 million from a starting point below $20 million. We achieved that with roughly a $20 million revenue run rate from our data center business and $30 million from art storage. This all supports our planned shift in mix by 2020 to have 25% of our revenue coming from both emerging markets and adjacent businesses that have internal growth rates closer to 10%, up from 15% of our revenue in these higher-growth businesses today. 
In terms of the foundational elements of our strategy, we have made significant progress on our transformation initiative affecting changes that have resulted in $50 million of net savings in 2016. We are finalizing the next set of initiatives that will deliver an additional $50 million of savings by year-end 2016. As previously disclosed, the remainder of the total $125 million of overhead savings will be actioned in 2017, and the full amount for the transformation program will be reflected in our 2018 adjusted OIBDA. Importantly, the cost to achieve these savings in each year is offset by the savings. As a reminder, we don't exclude the transformation cost from our adjusted financial measures, but we do detail the amounts in bridging schedules in the supplemental. Rod will have more on the timing of expected transformation-related cost for 2016 in a few minutes. 
We continue to work toward closing of the Recall transaction and related integration planning. As outlined at our Investor Day, we have detailed work streams from virtually every functional area of the combined companies, and I am pleased with what I am seeing in the way our teams are working together on integration planning to create a dynamic combined entity and facilitate a smooth transition. Obviously, this transaction is compelling in terms of strategic fit and is supported by meaningful synergies that drive accretion. As we work through the regulatory process, we will refine our views based upon a clear understanding of the outcome. We are constructively engaged with the 4 principal regulators and are working hard towards closing the transaction in a timely manner. As you know, it is necessary for us to close early in a given quarter in order to convert Recall's operations in certain countries into our REIT structure. We will provide updates with respect to the timetable when we have substantially completed the regulatory review process. But at this time, we cannot and answer any questions about regulatory outcomes on today's call beyond what we have already said. 
In addition, we view real estate as the foundation to our strategy. During the year, we invested roughly $171 million in real estate. We remain keenly focused on our capital allocation opportunity and think about real estate investment in 4 major buckets. Our first priority is to invest in growth racking to accommodate net new volume growth we achieve annually. This investment yields average IRRs in the high-teens. Our next priority is real estate consolidation, which may include both buildings and racking to improve real estate and operating efficiency and enhance utilization. This is characterized by mid-teens IRRs. Third, we plan to continue to invest in data center in a success-based manner, driven by customer commitments. We continue to see good opportunity here with low double-digit IRRs and stabilized mid-teens return on invested capital. Fourth, we also look to complete select opportunistic leased buy-ins where we can acquire buildings at attractive valuations relative to market pricing or where it is strategically important to own. Rod will have more on how we view our real estate investment opportunities for the coming year. 
Now touching on some key financial and operating achievements before turning it over to Rod. On a constant dollar basis, we grew total revenue in 2015 by 2%, reflecting continued storage rental gains of 4%. This was driven primarily by storage rental internal growth of 2.7% for the year, reflecting continued strong growth from data management, other international and Western Europe. As we look out the 2016, we are seeing consistent trends and maintaining our view for internal storage rental revenue growth in the mid-2% range. Service revenue growth for the year was negative 0.4%, and we delivered positive at 0.3% internal service growth revenue for the quarter. We made good progress on our service margin initiative exiting the year at 27.2%, right in the middle of our range. There will be ups and downs as the mix shifts to more nonrecurring projects, and there will be a downtick in service margin early in the year. But we expect it to ramp up again throughout the year and to result in a similar average margin for the full year. Also, as previously mentioned, in 2016, we will also focus on growing overall service gross profit as we move forward and our service mix evolves. Although some of our new offerings have lower margins in our core, activity-based services such as transportation and handling, they are also less capital-intensive so they have very similar returns. Storage volume growth is another important indicator in our business. During the year, we once again grew net worldwide storage volume by 8 million cubic feet or 2.3% net growth and 1.6% prior to acquisitions, and gross volume of record from new and existing customers was roughly 42 million cubic feet over the trailing 12 months. Our customer retention remained strong at 98%, underscoring the stability of our customer base and supporting the durability of the storage revenue stream. This level has been stable over the past 6 quarters and represents an appropriate level in our business. Lastly, and most importantly, our cash generation is an important metric as it supports growth in dividends and investments. In recent presentations, we laid out our expectations for cash available to support the dividend both on a stand-alone basis and including Recall. We expect to fund additional growth through debt in amounts that allow us to continue to de-lever the business on a debt-to-EBITDA basis. On a stand-alone basis, the continued strong and durable cash of the base business, coupled with de transformation program, will at a minimum allow us to increase the dividend per share by 15% between 2015 and 2018 whilst reducing leverage by 0.4 of a turn. Even with an increased dividend in Q4, we improved our year-end 2015 payout as a percentage of our AFFO from 82% at Investor Day to 78% at year-end. Including Recall, our minimum dividend per share delivers 24% growth between 2015 and 2018. This is all without issuing equity beyond the shares issued to purchase Recall. 
Looking ahead, all of these drivers support our updated constant dollar guidance for 2016. On a like-for-like basis or comparing our 2016 constant dollar guidance with our 2015 results using 2016 FX budget rates, you can see our growth expectations are very consistent with what we showed at Investor Day. We expect 3% to 6% constant dollar growth in revenue, 6% to 8% growth in adjusted OIBDA and 6% to 13% growth in adjusted EPS. This growth is underpinned by nearly $1.5 billion of storage net operating income, which is comparable to that generated by leaders in both the industrial and self-storage sectors. What distinguishes our business is its inherent durability, and it's this durability that delivers consistent levels of operating performance in good and bad times. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call over now to Rod."

I'll begin today with an overview of our 2015 performance, including a review of results by segment and updates on our service gross margin initiatives as well as our transformation program. Finally, I will address our outlook for 2016, including a review of our capital allocation plans. 
Let's turn to our worldwide financial results. For the full year, reported revenues were $3.01 billion compared with $3.12 billion in 2014. Excluding the full year FX impacts of 6% or $171 million year-over-year, on a constant dollar basis, revenues grew by 2.1%. Consistent with the full year picture, revenues for the fourth quarter also grew by 2.1% on a constant dollar basis. As Bill noted, we did not any meaningful acquisition activity for the most of 2015, so our revenues for the year had a very limited contribution from external growth. Total revenues were driven by good constant dollars storage rental revenue growth of more than 3% for the quarter and 4% for the year. Service revenues were flat for the quarter and down 1% for the year. The decline in our constant dollars service revenue for the year was driven by the disposition of our strutting businesses in the U.K. and Australia in late 2014. Consistent with prior quarters, we have provided bridging schedules for total revenue, adjusted OIBDA and adjusted earnings per share, which explain key variances in year-on-year performance for the quarter and the full year. These schedules are on Pages 22 through 26 of the supplemental. 
Similar to last quarter, we've also provided a bridging schedule on Page 27 to explain the sequential movement in our total service business gross margins. Through our focused initiative, we're continuing to align service cost with activity levels and revenue mix. Looking ahead, we expect modest reductions in our service gross profits during Q1, reflecting one-off severance costs and the timing of costs related to our ground mix of special projects. However, we expect service margins will recover to current levels throughout the year. 
Total adjusted OIBDA for the quarter was $238 million compared with $220 million in 2014. Despite FX headwinds, we grew adjusted OIBDA by 8% and excluding FX by 14%. For the full year, adjusted OIBDA grew by 4.4% on a constant dollar basis. 
As Bill noted, our transformation program continues in 2016. In the first quarter of 2016, we expect to incur roughly $7 million of net charges related to this initiative. During Q2 and Q3, we expect the transformation program to be $1 million to $2 million net negative to adjusted OIBDA with in-quarter costs sly offsetting benefits. In Q4, we expect net upside of up to around $10 million though providing a strong run rate platform for year-on-year benefits in 2017. As Bill noted, we continue to expect run rate savings of $50 million to flow through to 2017. Our overall savings outlook for transformation remains consistent with what we laid in our Investor Day in October with $125 million of cumulative savings by 2018. 
Looking at the overall phasing of contribution for 2016. We expect this to ramp up during the year for 2 reasons. Firstly, as I just discussed, the cost associated with our transformation program are frontloaded, with offsetting net benefits coming later in the year. Secondly, our storage volumes and revenues will grow through the year as they typically do. As such, excluding any extraordinary events, we believe that Q1 adjusted OIBDA will represent roughly 21% to 23% total adjusted OIBDA effected in 2016. Furthermore, Q2 and Q3 will make up roughly 24% to 26% each, and Q4 will represent roughly 26% to 28%. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.33 compared to $0.25 in fourth quarter of 2014. For the full year, adjusted EPS was $1.21 compared to $1.36 for 2014. The decline in adjusted EPS year-on-year is driven by an 8% increase in share count related to the distribution we made in Q4 2014 following our reconversion, charges related transformation and a higher structural tax rate for the year. The increase in share count and restructuring cost in both periods as well as holding the tax rate constant, normalized adjusted EPS grew by $0.02 for the year. Our structural tax rate for this quarter came out at 16.8% compared with 14.4% in the prior year to 16.5% in Q3 of 2015. The year-over-year increase on our structural tax rate was primarily driven by higher income from foreign jurisdictions. We continue to believe that our tax rate will be approximately 15% to 17% in the short term. 
Normalized funds from operations, or FFO, per share was $0.57 for the quarter compared with $0.52 in the year-ago period, driven by improved performance.  For the full year, FFO per share was $2.10 per share compared with $2.28 in 2014. The decline was driven by FX headwinds, the increase in share count as well as restructuring charges related to our transformation program. Excluding share count increases, FX and restructuring charges in both periods, FX per share grew by -- FFO per share grew by 3%. Adjusted funds from operations, or AFFO, was $125 million for the fourth quarter compared with $112 million in the year-ago period. For the full year, AFFO was $522 million compared with $527 million in 2014. If we adjust for FX and the items mentioned earlier, the impact in FFO per share counts, then AFFO grew by 3% year-on-year. 
On Page 21 of the supplemental, we're now providing the reconciliation between AFFO and cash flow from operations as presented in our GAAP cash flow statements so you can more readily see the cash items are not typical recurring nature. 
Let's turn to our financial performance by segments. In North American Records and Information Management, or RIM, internal storage record revenue was up 0.2% of the fourth quarter and 0.1% for the full year. North American RIM internal service revenue declined this quarter due to the continued decrease in transportation retrieved and recall activity levels. In addition, we saw more of a precipitous decline in average price of recycled sources office paper towards the end of the year leading to a decline of over 19% quarter-over-quarter in average pricing. This impacted the paper revenue in our shred business and will have a follow-on impacts into 2016. Adjusted OIBDA margins in RIM remain solid at 41% for the quarter and 40% for the year, up from 39% in 2014. The year-over-year improvement in North American RIM adjusted OIBDA margins is driven by the service gross margin actions and better operational performance. 
North American Data Management, or DM, delivered storage rental internal growth of 1.0% for the fourth quarter and 4.2% for the year. The growth in DM storage rental internal growth for the quarter was lower than recent periods due to a strong comparator from Q4 last year. Looking forward, we expect DM internal storage growth to be in line with the growth in total company storage internal growth of around 2.5%. 
Internal service revenue in DM declined by 8% in the fourth quarter and 5.1% for the year as we continue to see declines in the frequency of tape rotation and related transportation activity in the business. During the fourth quarter, DM adjusted OIBDA margins remained strong at 53.7% compared to 51.6% in Q3. For the full year, DM adjusted OIBDA margins were 52.2%. We expect DM adjusted OIBDA margins will remain in the low- to mid-50% range as we continue to invest in new service offerings. Margins on new services, although high at 35% to 40%, are lower than core storage margins of approximately 75%. The Western Europe segment generated solid results with 2.4% internal storage rental growth for the quarter and 2.7% for the year. 
Looking at internal service revenue. Declines in activity were partially offset by increases in nonrecurring ticketing and other projects. Adjusted OIBDA margins remained solid in Western Europe at 33.1% for the quarter and 34.4% for the year. 
Finally, the other international segment, which is made up primarily of emerging markets and Australia, had strong growth in both storage and service revenues. Storage rental internal growth was 9.6% for the fourth quarter and 10.8% for the year. Service internal growth was 8.4% for the quarter and 9.0% for the year. Other international adjusted OIBDA margins were 23% for the quarter and 21% for the year. We expect to see adjusted OIBDA for this segment to deliver profitability on a portfolio basis in a low-20s range in the short term as we continue to expand our exposure in these fast-growing markets. 
Let's touch on the Recall acquisition briefly. To prepare for integration, in 2015, we incurred approximately $25 million of deal close costs and $22 million to prepare for integration, which brings total Recall-related costs in 2015 to $47 million. For the first quarter 2016, we expect $5 million to $8 million of deal close costs and $8 million to $12 million of integration-related costs, bringing the total costs in Q1 to roughly $15 million to $20 million. Please note these expenses are excluded from our adjusted OIBDA calculation of they are onetime in nature. Importantly, these costs were outlined in our guidance related to the recall acquisition when we announced the deal. 
Let's turn to our outlook for 2016 on page 13 of the supplemental. Business trends remain -- and fundamentals remain consistent, and operationally, we remain on track to achieve our long-term financial objectives given the durability and strong fundamentals of the business. Please note, I'm referring to the corrected version of the supplemental that was posted just prior to the call. Our guidance for 2016 growth on a constant dollar basis remains fairly consistent with the preliminary guidance we provided during our Q3 earnings call. We made 2 changes. Firstly, we updated our outlook to reflect the new constant dollar budget foreign exchange rates, which was set in January 2016. Note that at this point that our 2016 constant dollar budget rate is now equivalent to our dollar rate that is set last month. Secondly, we have reduced revenue and adjusted OIBDA by approximately $10 million at the midpoint as a result of the decline in the shred recycle paper prices I noted earlier. Paper -- revenue from paper recycling is almost all margin with the vast majority flows through to adjusted OIBDA. 
To provide further clarity, I'd now like to share with you additional detail about FX impacted 2016 guidance and walk you through the components of our expected 2016 adjusted OIBDA growth on a constant dollar basis. The FX headwinds was primarily driven by significant declines against of the U.S. dollar in the following 5 currencies: Australian dollar, Brazilian real, British pound sterling, Canadian dollar and the euro. These represents about 28% of our total revenue. As a reminder, approximately 40% of our total revenues are denominated in non-U.S. dollars. our 2016 FX rates remain constant throughout the year, our guidance reflects a 5% decline in revenues from FX. At our Investor Day, we anticipated a decline of 3.5% based on rates at that time. Given continuing strength of the U.S. dollar, our outlook represents an additional decline at the end of the year of 1.5%. This total decline translates into roughly $165 million for this year on the top line. 
As we move down to P&L, FX headwinds continue to impact our guidance, albeit at a lower dollar amount. The FX headwinds impacting the top line translates into approximately $50 million on adjusted OIBDA for 2016. As you can see on Page 12 of the supplemental, we reported constant dollar 2015 adjusted OIBDA of $940 million at 2015 constant dollar budget rates starting January 2015. But our 2015 numbers are translated into 2016 budget rates, adjusted OIBDA would have been $900 million. However, we're also expecting an additional impact related to FX of roughly $10 million as a result of the change in our contribution mix.
As we noted earlier, we're also expecting a $10 million constant dollar impact from paper price declines. On a more positive note, we can add a $50 million benefit from transformation. Adding all that up, we get to an adjusted OIBDA for 2016 based on January '16 rates of roughly $930 million. Adding on to that our expectation of roughly 2% to 4% constant growth will get you the $950 million to $970 million, which is our 2016 guidance range. 
Lastly, moving to our expected cash available for distributions and investments for 2016. We expect it to be roughly $495 million at the midpoint of 2016 as we continue to provide ample dividend coverage and funds from our core growth racking investment. 
Let's turn to our capital deployment plans. We expect our capital expenditures, which include maintenance and nonreal estate investments to be in line with a range as we provided at our Investor Day. Real estate investment spend is expected to be about $265 million, driven by growth racking spend of about $60 million, data center investment of $35 million. We also plan on investing $170 million in real estate consolidation and lease conversions. In M&A, our plan is roughly $100 million in emerging markets and $50 million in the developed markets. Our dividend expectation also remains consistent with the guidance we laid out that our Investor Day. As you saw last week, we announced our first quarter dividends of $0.485 per share, which is consistent with the $1.94 per share run rate in Q4 last year when we increased the quarterly rate by $0.01 per share. In addition, the $1.94 per share is the minimum projected dividend for 2016 on a combined basis with the Recall. Importantly, we ended the year with a dividend payout ratio of AFFO of 78% to support the strength of our dividend coverage. 
Turning briefly to the balance sheet. At the year-end, we had liquidity of approximately $1.7 billion and a lease adjusted debt ratio of 5.6x as expected. Before concluding, I'd like to point out that we are updating our shelf registration statement with the SEC. You will likely see this filing next week. Please note that this update is far from our regular cycle. As we've said in the past, at this time, we don't plan on issuing an equity to fund the investment outside the potential Recall acquisition. Overall, we delivered good results for the year supported by continued execution on our strategic plan, the progress we've made in our transformation initiative as well as the stabilization of our service gross margins. Looking ahead, we're well positioned to deliver on our short- and long-term goals. We remain focused on creating shareholder value by sending the [indiscernible] rental business, which show growth in cash available to fund dividends and core growth investments. 
With that, I hand back to Bill to sum up."

It's pretty much at the same as we said, I think, on the last call. It's bouncing between kind of the high single-digit to low double-digit declines in terms of what I would say our core service revenue associated with the transport of the tapes. And I think as we called out the last few quarters is that where we were on the paper record side of the business maybe 2 or 3 years ago, we're still watching that till it starts flattening out or we see the inflection point. And we don't see that inflection point right now, but at the same time, we don't see it getting worse than what it is. I think what you'll see is, you'll see some bouncing around in terms of the net service revenue on the data management. Quite frankly, I think we've done a pretty good job on building up some of these new service lines in the tape management, which includes the secured IT asset distraction, for instance, and also the restoration assurance business, just to call out 2. So on the transportation side, again, which is our highest margin in that type of business, we don't see a slowdown of that decline. We don't see an acceleration neither. But I think what we're making some good progress in some of the new services, which generally have lower margins than transport, but at the same time, they have much less invested capital associated with it so we're getting some of the returns. So when those -- is that these pieces are going to overtake the decline that we're seeing in the transportation, but we're making good progress."

I think it's a good call out, Andrew. I think one of the things you probably caught in my remarks and a little bit to Rod's is that as we're shifting from the core transportation services that are associated with the ins and outs in our storage business to some of the new service areas, a lot of these new service areas are project-based, which is also the reason why we said we expect kind of a downtick in Q1 is some of our service revenue. As those projects have any lead time in terms of the sell and on-boarding of those cycles and then they come through it in a next quarter or quarters. And that's what you've seen actually in Western Europe. What you'll have seen is there is an investment earlier in the year, and that project revenue kind of flows through. So that's part of the new services. It's less smooth than, say, the transportation side of the business, so you have these ups and downs. So what we tend to do as we look at it over the course of the year. And it just so happened that in Western Europe, you saw that spike as part of that normal cyclicality of these projects."

Good morning, George. So I think there's a couple of aspects there. There are some -- there's a number of things that I think you're touching on an referring to that Patrick Keddy went through on Investor Day, things that we're doing just to get more margin out of some of our existing core service areas which had seen a drop in activity, so that's really around the transportation side. And I think we feel pretty good about coming out. You'll continue to see some improvement during the course of the year, but a lot of that has been slight. I think the bigger part of it is how we bring on some of the new service areas, which are less smooth. But on a year basis, these are project-driven, so you can think of it as like a defense contractor. There's certain amount of prospecting, and there's a certain amount of reaping or harvesting. So you'll see on a quarter-by-quarter basis, you'll see some movement around that, but we have good visibility over the course of the year to be able to predict where the year will end up. So I think what you can expect as we go through the course of the year is, we think that we will have similar slight uptick in terms of where we came in for the year in 2015, so slight improvement but kind of in the same postal code for 2016 in service that you will see as we shift away from the volume coming from almost exclusively to transportation side of the business to some of these services that are more project-based, you will see more ups and downs on a quarter-by-quarter basis just like Andrew called out for the uptick in Western Europe in Q4. And we're saying that Q1, you'll see a downtick in some of those services. But we have very good visibility over the course of the year where we'll come out."

So that's kind of one dimension. So you saw, for instance, our acquisition, the last quarter of last year in India, and there's a couple of more like that as we called out in emerging markets, right? The other aspect of that is, of course, you won't see us doing any M&A activity in the 4 regulatory jurisdictions that we're working with right now to close the Recall transaction because we don't want any delay in those discussions with the regulator, right, because if you start doing acquisitions at the same time you're having discussions, you're going to delay it.

But at the same time, people can get rid of a lot of the OpEx and CapEx costs associated with cutting the tapes themselves and you reduce the need to transport these things over the road. And in many cases, these tapes are not encrypted. So that adds a much more secured environment. And than the other service, of course, we apply to that is we tell the customer independent of any change in generational tape drives, we give them guarantee assurance that we will restore that data whenever they needed and whatever format they need.

I think the way to think about that is and if the FX movement is against markets where our business is more mature, so let's say, for example, Canada and the U.K., they're obviously we have higher margin and so that has sort of a disproportional effect on OIBDA. If the FX movement is against some of our businesses in emerging markets, it tends to be more dampened, the ordinary level because obviously they're earlier stages and so the contributions margin is lower, sort of that helps."

And then you add 4 12 of the dividend, I mean it's 4 11, 4 12, so you subtract that out. And then there's about $65 million for growth racking, but that is actually for growth. So actually, if you think about it, it's the 4 95 less the 4 11, and that gives you a number that's available for growth basically for investment in growth. And so the first 65 -- the first call in that cash available is $65 million, which is for the organic growth that we get from our customers every years. So even if you take out and add for 2017 revenue, if you know what I mean, right, because you're putting the racking investment in '16, so that when the growth hits you in '17, you can actually put those boxes on the shelf. So then even after you take the growth racking, which gives you the mid-2% range that we highlight in terms of internal growth in terms of our storage business, that leads you about $19 million for cash available for discretionary investment. Now that's versus 2015 actuals of about $3 million left over after you pay for racking. So we've actually even with the further FX headwinds coming into 2016 based on January rate, you see the improvement from 3 to 19. But again, that's also already including $65 million for growth for that 2.5% organic storage volume growth that's coming in. Now when you come down and you're trying to -- to your point about M&A is, well, you say how your be able to leverage and still be able to do the M&A because, of course, when we're doing the M&A, we're buying EBITDA as well associated with that. So that's how the whole thing works. So we are issuing debt to do the M&A. Because obviously, $19 million doesn't fuel our whole M&A program. But between the $19 million that we have for beyond internal growth of storage, we also borrow but on a net-net basis in terms of what it does is that to EBITDA, you see deleveraging as well."

We are pleased to report strong fourth quarter and full year financial and operating results that, in every respect, met or exceeded our expectations in constant dollars with reported EPS for the quarter beating expectations. Our results continued to demonstrate the durability of our core storage rental business even in these volatile times. Total revenue in constant dollars was in line with our guidance, and constant dollar adjusted OIBDA was at the upper end of our range. We continued to achieve solid growth in storage rental revenue as well as consistent volume growth in new records from existing customers. We also achieved service gross margins in line with our year-end exit rate goal as well as growth in adjusted OIBDA. All of these accomplishments resulted in a very good 2015. 
I believe most of you are familiar with the strategic plan that we outlined at our Investor Day last fall. To assist in tracking our progress against that plan, we've modified the earnings commentary at the beginning of our supplemental disclosure to highlight key performance metrics. You'll note that in addition to our solid financial performance in 2015, we've made good progress against our objectives in each of the 3 pillars and in the foundational elements that support our strategy. 
As anticipated, the strength of the U.S. dollar continued to impact our reported revenue. However, when looking through to fundamental performance, we've achieved a significant turnaround in the business in the last 2 years. We've gone from negative internal growth internal revenue in both 2012 and 2013 to 1% positive internal growth or prior to acquisitions in 2014. And in 2015, we achieved further improvement with 1.5% positive internal growth. This is a testament to the hard work our organization has undertaken to, first, achieve net records management volume growth in all major markets; enhance customer service and retention whilst attracting new customers; stabilize service revenue declines in records management; penetrate new emerging markets; and advancing adjacent business opportunities. 
Turning to the pillars of our strategic plan in developed markets. Our focus over the last 2 years on getting more growth from these regions has driven improved performance with positive internal storage growth, stabilizing records management service revenues and adding roughly 3 million cubic feet of net new records in 2015 prior to acquisitions. 
In Emerging Markets, our revenue has grown from 10% of the total in 2013 to 14.6% of total revenue at the end of 2015 on a constant dollar basis. We have a sizable deal pipeline and are confident we will reach our goal of 16% of total revenue from these markets by 2016 and 20% by 2020. Importantly, we're driving internal growth in these markets of roughly 10% per year, so just 2 points of our 20% goal comes from acquisitions. 
We resumed M&A activity in select emerging markets in the fourth quarter, closing on a transaction in India. We have adjusted our focus to account for Recall's footprint and expect to close a few transactions in the first half of 2016, including a couple and fast-growing new emerging markets with underserved demand for records management. 
As we've noted in recent calls, despite the impact of the strong dollar on reported revenue, we mitigate our FX exposure at the income level because our expenses are denominated in the same local currencies as our revenues, and we are increasingly moving more of our debt outside the United States. The net of this is that we exceeded earnings expectations for the fourth quarter. Additionally, using strong dollars to invest in high-growth markets outside the U.S. gives us a lower-cost base -- basis and sets us up to realize significant value creation as the economic growth in these markets over the longer term will typically outpace that of the United States. 
I should note that in our other international segment, which is Emerging Markets plus Australia, we did see a higher level of destructions in Q4, driven by a single large customer which will carry over into Q1 of 2016. However, we do not see any other such unusual destructions on the horizon and expect that destructions for the remainder of the year will return to more typical levels. But we do report volume change on a trailing 12-month basis, and therefore this level will remain slightly elevated over the next few quarters. 
We also have a goal to generate 5% of our total worldwide revenue from adjacent businesses by the end of 2020, up from just 2% at the end of 2015. Today, our adjacent businesses consist of our data center operations in our recently acquired art storage business. We closed on Crozier Fine Arts storage in December and are pleased with how it is being integrated into our business whilst retaining the DNA and key management talent that made it the leading art storage business in the United States. We believe the $1 billion estimated global market is poised for the same type of consolidation opportunity we saw in the records management business years ago, and we have a plan that can take it to $100 million within 3 years. 
We had a fairly aggressive goal for 2015 to finish with an adjacent business revenue run rate of $50 million from a starting point below $20 million. We achieved that with roughly a $20 million revenue run rate from our data center business and $30 million from art storage. This all supports our planned shift in mix by 2020 to have 25% of our revenue coming from both emerging markets and adjacent businesses that have internal growth rates closer to 10%, up from 15% of our revenue in these higher-growth businesses today. 
In terms of the foundational elements of our strategy, we have made significant progress on our transformation initiative, affecting changes that have resulted in $50 million of net savings in 2016. We are finalizing the next set of initiatives that will deliver an additional $50 million of savings by year-end 2016. 
As previously disclosed, the remainder of the total $125 million of overhead savings will be actioned in 2017, and the full amount for the Transformation Program will be reflected in our 2018 adjusted OIBDA. Importantly, the cost to achieve these savings in each year is offset by the savings. As a reminder, we don't exclude the transformation costs from our adjusted financial measures, but we do detail the amounts in the bridging schedules in the supplemental. Rod will have more on the timing of expected transformation-related costs for 2016 in a few minutes. 
We continued to work toward closing of the Recall transaction and related integration planning. As outlined at our Investor Day, we have detailed work streams for virtually every functional area of the combined companies, and I am pleased with what I am seeing in the way our teams are working together on integration planning to create a dynamic, combined entity and facilitate a smooth transition. Obviously, this transaction is compelling in terms of strategic fit and is supported by meaningful synergies that drive accretion. As we work through the regulatory process, we will refine our views based upon a clear understanding of the outcome.  We are constructively engaged with the 4 principal regulators and are working hard towards closing the transaction in a timely manner. As you know, it is necessary for us to close early in a given quarter in order to convert Recall's operations in certain countries into our REIT structure. We will provide updates with respect to the timetable when we have substantially completed the regulatory review process. But at this time, we cannot answer any questions about regulatory outcomes on today's call beyond what we have already said. 
In addition, we view real estate as a foundation to our strategy. During the year, we invested roughly $171 million in real estate. We remain keenly focused on our capital-allocation opportunity and think about real estate investment in 4 major buckets. Our first priority is to invest in growth racking to accommodate net new volume growth we achieve annually. This investment yields average IRRs in the high teens. Our next priority is real estate consolidation, which may include both buildings and racking to improve real estate and operating efficiency and enhanced utilization. This is characterized by mid-teens IRRs. Third, we plan to continue to invest in data center in a success-based manner, driven by customer commitments. We continue to see good opportunity here with low double-digit IRRs and stabilized mid-teens return on invested capital. Fourth, we also look to complete select opportunistic leased buy-ins where we can acquire buildings at attractive valuations relative to market pricing or where it is strategically important to own. Rod will have more on how we view our real estate investment opportunities for the coming year. 
Now touching on some key financial and operating achievements before turning it over to Rod. On a constant dollar basis, we grew total revenue in 2015 by 2%, reflecting continued storage rental gains of 4%. This was driven primarily by storage rental internal growth of 2.7% for the year, reflecting continued strong growth from data management, other international and Western Europe. As we look out into 2016, we are seeing consistent trends and are -- and maintaining our view for internal storage rental revenue growth in the mid-2% range. Service revenue growth for the year was negative 0.4%, and we delivered positive at 0.3% internal service growth revenue for the quarter. 
We made good progress on our service margin initiative, exiting the year at 27.2%, right in the middle of our range. There will be ups and downs as the mix shifts to more nonrecurring projects, and there will be a downtick in service margin early in the year. But we expect it to ramp up again throughout the year and to result in a similar average margin for the full year. Also, as previously mentioned, in 2016, we will also focus on growing overall service gross profit as we move forward and our service mix evolves. Although some of our new offerings have lower margins than our core, activity-based services such as transportation and handling, they are also less capital-intensive, so they have very similar returns. 
Storage volume growth is another important indicator in our business. During the year, we once again grew net worldwide storage volume by 8 million cubic feet or 2.3% net growth and 1.6% prior to acquisitions, and gross volume of records from new and existing customers was roughly 42 million cubic feet over the trailing 12 months. 
Our customer retention remained strong at 98%, underscoring the stability of our customer base and supporting the durability of the storage revenue stream. This level has been stable over the past 6 quarters and represents an appropriate level in our business. 
Lastly, and most importantly, our cash generation is an important metric as it supports growth in dividends and investment. In recent presentations, we laid out our expectations for cash available to support the dividend, both on a stand-alone basis and including Recall. We expect to fund additional growth through debt in amounts that allow us to continue to de-lever the business on a debt-to-EBITDA basis. On a stand-alone basis, the continued strong and durable cash of the base business, coupled with the Transformation Program, will, at a minimum, allow us to increase the dividend per share by 15% between 2015 and 2018 whilst reducing leverage by 0.4 of a turn. 
Even with an increased dividend in Q4, we improved our year-end 2015 payout as a percentage of our AFFO from 82% at Investor Day to 78% at year-end. Including Recall, our minimum dividend per share delivers 24% growth between 2015 and 2018. This is all without issuing equity beyond the shares issued to purchase Recall. 
Looking ahead, all of these drivers support our updated constant dollar guidance for 2016. On a like-for-like basis or comparing our 2016 constant dollar guidance with our 2015 results using 2016 FX budget rates, you can see our growth expectations are very consistent with what we showed at Investor Day. We expect 3% to 6% constant dollar growth in revenue, 6% to 8% growth in adjusted OIBDA and 6% to 13% growth in adjusted EPS. This growth is underpinned by nearly $1.5 billion of storage net operating income, which is comparable to that generated by leaders in both the industrial and self-storage sectors. 
What distinguishes our business is its inherent durability, and it is this durability that delivers consistent levels of operating performance in good and bad times.

I'll begin today with an overview of our 2015 performance, including a review of results by segment and updates on our service gross margin initiative as well as our Transformation Program. Finally, I will address our outlook for 2016, inclu",2489,"Thanks, Bill. I'll begin today with an overview of our 2015 performance, including a review of results by segment and updates on our service gross margin initiative as well as our Transformation Program. Finally, I will address our outlook for 2016, including a review of our capital allocation plans. 
Let's turn to our worldwide financial results. For the full year, reported revenues were $3.01 billion compared with $3.12 billion in 2014. Excluding the full year FX impacts of 6% or $171 million year-over-year, on a constant dollar basis, revenues grew by 2.1%. Consistent with the full year picture, revenues for the fourth quarter also grew by 2.1% on a constant dollar basis. As Bill noted, we did not have any meaningful acquisition activity for most of 2015, so our revenues for the year had a very limited contribution from external growth. 
Total revenues were driven by good constant dollar storage rental revenue growth of more than 3% for the quarter and 4% for the year. Service revenues were flat for the quarter and down 1% for the year. The decline in our constant dollar service revenue for the year was driven by the disposition of our shredding businesses in the U.K. and Australia in late 2014. 
Consistent with prior quarters, we have provided bridging schedules for total revenue, adjusted OIBDA and adjusted earnings per share, which explain key variances in year-on-year performance for the quarter and the full year. These schedules are on Pages 22 through 26 of the supplemental.  Similar to last quarter, we have also provided a bridging schedule on Page 27 to explain the sequential movement in our total service business gross margins. 
Through our focused initiative, we're continuing to align service costs with activity levels and revenue mix. Looking ahead, we expect modest reductions in our service gross profits during Q1, reflecting one-off severance costs and the timing of costs related to our growing mix of special projects. However, we expect service margins will recover to current levels throughout the year. 
Total adjusted OIBDA for the quarter was $238 million compared with $220 million in 2014. Despite FX headwinds, we grew adjusted OIBDA by 8% and excluding FX by 14%. For the full year, adjusted OIBDA grew by 4.4% on a constant dollar basis. 
As Bill noted, our Transformation Program continues in 2016. In the first quarter of 2016, we expect to incur roughly $7 million of net charges related to this initiative. During Q2 and Q3, we expect the Transformation Program to be $1 million to $2 million net negative to adjusted OIBDA with in-quarter costs slightly offsetting benefits. In Q4, we expect net upside of up to around $10 million though providing a strong run rate platform for year-on-year benefits in 2017. As Bill noted, we continue to expect run rate savings of $50 million to flow through to 2017. Our overall savings outlook for transformation remains consistent with what we laid out on our Investor Day in October with $125 million of cumulative savings by 2018. 
Looking at the overall phasing of contribution for 2016. We expect this to ramp up during the year for 2 reasons. Firstly, as I just discussed, the costs associated with our Transformation Program are front-loaded with offsetting net benefits coming later in the year. Secondly, our storage volumes and revenues will grow through the year as they typically do. As such, excluding any extraordinary events, we believe that Q1 adjusted OIBDA will represent roughly 21% to 23% total adjusted OIBDA effective in 2016. Furthermore, Q2 and Q3 will make up roughly 24% to 26% each, and Q4 will represent roughly 26% to 28%. 
Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.33 compared with $0.25 in the fourth quarter of 2014. For the full year, adjusted EPS was $1.21 compared with $1.36 for 2014. The decline in adjusted EPS year-on-year is driven by an 8% increase in share count related to the special distribution we made in Q4 2014 following our reconversion, charges related to transformation and a higher structural tax rate for the year. Excluding the increase in share count and restructuring costs in both periods as well as holding the tax rate constant, normalized adjusted EPS grew by $0.02 for the year. 
Our structural tax rate for this quarter came out at 16.8% compared with 14.4% in the prior year and 16.5% in Q3 of 2015. The year-over-year increase on our structural tax rate was primarily driven by higher income from foreign jurisdictions. We continue to believe that our tax rate will be approximately 15% to 17% in the short term. 
Normalized funds from operations, or FFO, per share was $0.57 for the quarter compared with $0.52 in the year-ago period, driven by improved performance.  For the full year, FFO per share was $2.10 per share compared with $2.28 in 2014. The decline was driven by FX headwinds, the increase in share count as well as restructuring charges related to our Transformation Program. Excluding share count increases, FX and restructuring charges in both periods, FX per share grew by -- FFO per share grew by 3%. 
Adjusted funds from operations, or AFFO, was $125 million for the fourth quarter compared with $112 million in the year-ago period. For the full year, AFFO was $522 million compared with $527 million in 2014. If we adjust for FX and the items mentioned earlier, the impacted FFO, except for share counts, then AFFO grew by 3% year-on-year. 
On Page 21 of the supplemental, we're now providing a reconciliation between AFFO and cash flow from operations, as presented in our GAAP cash flow statements. So you can more readily see the cash items that are not of a typical recurring nature. 
Let's turn to our financial performance by segment. In North American Records and Information Management, or RIM, internal storage rental revenue was up 0.2% of the fourth quarter and 0.1% for the full year. North American RIM internal service revenue declined this quarter due to the continued decrease in transportation, retrieve and refile activity levels. In addition, we saw more of a precipitous decline in average price of recycled-sorted office paper towards the end of the year, leading to a decline of over 19% quarter-over-quarter in average pricing. This impacted the paper revenue in our shred business and will have a follow-on impact into 2016. Adjusted OIBDA margins in RIM remained solid at 41% for the quarter and 40% for the year, up from 39% in 2014. The year-over-year improvement in North American RIM adjusted OIBDA margins is driven by the service gross margin actions and better operational performance. 
North American Data Management, or DM, delivered storage rental internal growth of 1.0% for the fourth quarter and 4.2% for the year. The growth in DM storage rental internal growth for the quarter was lower than recent periods due to a strong comparator from Q4 last year. Looking forward, we expect DM internal storage growth to be in line with the growth in total company storage internal growth of around 2.5%. Internal service revenue in DM declined by 8% in the fourth quarter and 5.1% for the year as we continue to see declines in the frequency of tape rotation and related transportation activity in the business. During the fourth quarter, DM adjusted OIBDA margins remained strong at 53.7% compared to 51.6% in Q3. For the full year, DM adjusted OIBDA margins were 52.2%. We expect DM adjusted OIBDA margins will remain in the low to mid-50% range as we continue to invest in new service offerings. Margins on new services, although high at 35% to 40%, are lower than core storage margins of approximately 75%. 
The Western Europe segment generated solid results with 2.4% internal storage rental growth for the quarter and 2.7% for the year. Looking at internal service revenue, declines in activity were partially offset by increases in nonrecurring imaging and other projects. Adjusted OIBDA margins remained solid in Western Europe at 33.1% for the quarter and 34.4% for the year. 
Finally, the other international segment, which is made up primarily of emerging markets and Australia, had strong growth in both storage and service revenues. Storage rental internal growth was 9.6% for the fourth quarter and 10.8% for the year. Service internal growth was 8.4% for the quarter and 9.0% for the year. Other international adjusted OIBDA margins were 23% for the quarter and 21% for the year. We expect to see adjusted OIBDA for this segment to deliver profitability on a portfolio basis in the low-20s range in the short term as we continue to expand our exposure in these fast-growing markets. 
Let's touch on the Recall acquisition briefly. To prepare for integration, in 2015, we incurred approximately $25 million of deal-close costs and $22 million to prepare for integration, which brings total Recall-related costs in 2015 to $47 million. For the first quarter of 2016, we expect $5 million to $8 million of deal-close costs and $8 million to $12 million of integration-related costs, bringing the total cost in Q1 to roughly $15 million to $20 million. Please note these expenses are excluded from our adjusted OIBDA calculation as they are onetime in nature. Importantly, these costs were outlined in our guidance related to the Recall acquisition when we announced the deal. 
Let's turn to our outlook for 2016 on page 13 of the supplemental. Business trends remain -- and fundamentals remain consistent, and operationally, we remain on track to achieve our long-term financial objectives given the durability and strong fundamentals of our business. Please note, I'm referring to the corrected version of the supplemental that was posted just prior to the call. Our guidance for 2016 growth on a constant dollar basis remains fairly consistent with the preliminary guidance we provided during our Q3 earnings call. We made 2 changes. Firstly, we updated our outlook to reflect the new constant dollar budget foreign exchange rates, which was set in January 2016. Note that at this point that our 2016 constant dollar budget rate is now equivalent to an all [ph] dollar rate since it was just set last month. Secondly, we have reduced revenue and adjusted OIBDA by approximately $10 million at the midpoint as a result of the decline in the shred recycle paper prices I noted earlier. Paper -- revenue from paper recycling is almost all margin and so the vast majority flows through to adjusted OIBDA. 
To provide further clarity, I'd now like to share with you additional detail of how FX was impacted 2016 guidance and walk you through the components of our expected 2016 adjusted OIBDA growth on a constant dollar basis. The FX headwind was primarily driven by significant declines against the U.S. dollar in the following 5 currencies: Australian dollar, Brazilian real, British pound sterling, Canadian dollar and the euro. This represents about 28% of our total revenue. As a reminder, approximately 40% of our total revenues are denominated in non-U.S. dollars. Assuming our 2016 FX rates remain constant throughout the year, our guidance reflects a 5% decline in revenues from FX. At our Investor Day, we anticipated a decline of 3.5% based on rates at that time. Given continuing strength in the U.S. dollar, our outlook represents an additional decline by the end of the year at 1.5%. This total decline translates into roughly $165 million for the year on the top line. 
As we move down the P&L, FX headwinds continue to impact our guidance, albeit at a lower dollar amount. The FX headwinds impacting the top line translates into approximately $50 million on adjusted OIBDA for 2016. As you can see on Page 12 of the supplemental, we reported constant dollar 2015 adjusted OIBDA of $940 million at 2015 constant dollar budget rates starting January 2015. But our 2015 numbers are translated into 2016 budget rates, adjusted OIBDA would have been $900 million. However, we are also expecting an additional impact related to FX of roughly $10 million as a result of a change in our contribution mix.
As we noted earlier, we are also expecting a $10 million constant dollar impact from paper price declines. On a more positive note, we can add a $50 million benefit from the transformation. Adding all that up, we get to an adjusted OIBDA for 2016 based on January '16 rates of roughly $930 million. Adding on to that, our expectation of roughly 2% to 4% constant growth will get you the $950 million to $970 million, which is our 2016 guidance range. 
Lastly, moving to our expected cash available for distributions and investments for 2016. We expect it to be roughly $495 million at the midpoint of 2016. This continues to provide ample dividend coverage and funds from our core growth racking investment. 
Let's turn to our capital deployment plans. We expect our capital expenditures, which include maintenance and non-real estate investment to be in line with the ranges we provided at our Investor Day. Real estate investment spend is expected to be about $265 million, driven by growth racking spend of about $60 million, data center investment of $35 million. We also plan on investing $170 million in real estate consolidation and lease conversions. 
For M&A, our plan is roughly $100 million in emerging markets and $50 million in the developed markets. 
Our dividend expectation also remains consistent with the guidance we laid out on our Investor Day. As you saw last week, we announced our first quarter dividend of $0.485 per share, which is consistent with the $1.94 per share run rate from Q4 last year when we increased the quarterly rate by $0.01 per share. In addition, the $1.94 per share is the minimum projected dividend for 2016 on a combined basis with Recall. Importantly, we ended the year with a dividend payout ratio as a percent of AFFO of 78% to underscore the strength of our dividend coverage. 
Shifting briefly to the balance sheet. At the year-end, we had liquidity of approximately $1.7 billion and a lease-adjusted debt ratio of 5.6x as expected. 
Before concluding, I'd like to point out that we are updating our shelf registration statement with the SEC. You will likely see this filing next week. Please note that this update is part of our regular cycle. As we've said in the past, at this time, we don't plan on issuing equity to fund the investments outside the potential Recall acquisition. 
Overall, we've delivered good results for the year supported by a continued execution on our strategic plan, progress we've made in our transformation initiative as well as the stabilization of our service gross margins. Looking ahead, we're well positioned to deliver on our short- and long-term goals. We remain focused on creating shareholder value by extending the durability of our storage rental business, which drives growth and cash available to fund dividends and core growth investments. 
And with that, I'll hand it back to Bill to sum up."

I think it's pretty much the same as we said, I think, on the last call. I think it's bouncing between kind of the high single-digit to low double-digit declines in terms of what I would say our core service revenue associated with the transport of the tapes. And I think, as we called out the last few quarters, is that where we were on the paper record side of the business, maybe 2 or 3 years ago, we're still watching that till it starts flattening out or we see the inflection point. And we don't see that inflection point right now, but at the same time, we don't see it getting worse than what it is. I think what you'll see is you'll see some bouncing around in terms of the net service revenue on the data management. I mean, quite frankly, I think we've done a pretty good job on building up some of these new service lines that -- in the tape management, which includes the secured IT asset distraction, for instance, and also the restoration assurance business, just to call out 2. So the -- on the transportation side, again, which is our highest margin in that type of business, we don't see a slowdown of that decline, but we don't see an acceleration either. But I think what we're -- we're making some good progress in some of these new services, which generally have lower margins than transport. But at the same time, they have much less invested capital associated with it, so we're getting similar returns. So when those -- I wouldn't expect this year that these new services are going to overtake the decline that we're seeing in the transportation, but we're making good progress."

I think one of the things you probably caught in my remarks and a little bit in Rod's is that as we're shifting from the core transportation services that are associated with the ins and outs in our storage business to some of the new service areas, a lot of these new service areas are project-based, which is also the reason why we said we expect kind of a downtick in Q1 in some of our service revenue. As those projects have a lead time in terms of the sell and on boarding of those cycles, and then they come through it in a -- in the next quarter or quarters. And that's what you've seen actually in Western Europe. What you will have seen is there was an investment earlier in the year, and then that project revenue kind of flows through. So that's part of the new services. It's less smooth than, say, the transportation side of the business, so you have these ups and downs. So what we tend to do as we look at it over the course of the year. And it just so happened that in Western Europe, you saw that spike as part of that normal cyclicality of these projects."

So I think there's a kind of a couple aspects. There are some that -- there's a number of things that you -- I think you're touching upon or referring to that Patrick Keddy went through on Investor Day, things that we're doing just to get more margin out of some of our existing core service areas which have seen a drop in activity. So that's really around the transportation side. And I think we feel pretty good with that. Coming out, I think you'll continue to see some improvement during the course of the year, but a lot of that is in flight. I think the bigger part of it is how we bring on some of the new service areas, which are less smooth. But on a year basis, these are project-driven. So you can think of it as like a defense contractor. There's certain amount of prospecting, and then there's a certain amount of reaping or harvesting. So you'll see -- on a quarter-by-quarter basis, you'll see some movement around that, but we have good visibility over the course of the year to be able to predict where the year will end up. So I think what you can expect as we go through the course of the year is we think that we will have similar slight uptick in terms of where we came in for the year in 2015. So slight improvement but kind of in the same postal code for 2016 in service. But you will see, as we shift away from the volume coming from almost exclusively the transportation side of the business to some of these new services that are more project-based, you will see more ups and downs on a quarter-by-quarter basis, just like Andrew called out, for the uptick in Western Europe in Q4. And we're saying that Q1, you'll see a downtick in some of those services, but we have very good visibility over the course of the year where it will come out."

So you saw, for instance, our acquisition, the last quarter of last year in India, and there's a couple more in flight that are in, as we called out, in the emerging markets, right? The other aspect of that, of course, is you won't see us be doing any M&A activity in the 4 regulatory jurisdictions that we're working with right now to close the Recall transaction because we don't want any delay in those discussions with the regulators, right? Because if you start doing acquisitions at the same time you're having discussions, you're just going to delay it. So we have pretty good visibility now where it make sense, and that's why we've restarted the engine."

The -- I'll just give you kind of a couple examples that are -- to give you an idea. Some of them are large scanning projects, so there are some that are in flight with government contracts, for instance. And they have a certain -- that's why I kind of alluded to kind of like the defense contracts, so these things have a kind of tilling, fertilizing, feeding process and then harvesting side to that. And those are typically very large scanning projects that are associated with storage. So we're not going in to compete with an ACS or a Xerox per se. I mean, they may be competing, but we're going after contracts where we think we really have a strong skill set that's associated with just not the scanning but also the classification of the records and the -- in many, if not most cases, the actual storing of those records. So those are -- but those are long lead-time projects. They come through with different types, and hence you see the kind of spike that we saw in Western Europe when those things come through. Others are, again, what I would call kind of BPM-type projects that are associated with storage. So right now, we have in flight a large project, which is associated with mortgage servicing or helping mortgage originator to process and manage a lot of their documentation and processes associated with mortgages. Again, there's a big up front piece, and we have the relationship with that customer because we do, if not all, most of their storage. So those are the kinds of -- those are kind of 2 different projects, one which I would typically call BPM and the other one I would call scanning. But we come at it and we've been asked to come in and provide these services because of our expertise around records management and records storage."

So the EMC, we're still very excited. We're making good steady progress. And the great thing about it is there's still a high level of engagement, even though, as you can probably imagine, that EMC is going through their own changes right now with the Dell acquisition. But even with all that and through that process, both pre- and post-announcement, we've had a high level of engagement, and both teams are working well. I mean, it's starting on a small base, but we're very excited about that combination to us. This is kind of like the Reese's Peanut Butter Cup, right? It's putting -- or you can say who has the peanut butter and who has the chocolate. But putting those 2 things together and combining it with our raised floor platform using the data center, it's just a -- it's a really unique platform that we can offer to our customers which is very difficult for any competitors to do because we're allowing customers to remove the -- both the OpEx and CapEx associated with their tape drives and their premises. And using EMC's market-leading technology or data-demand technology, we can replicate their data center on our raised floor using our data set and technology and then deliver tapes off the back of that and store it in our vault, which is a perfect cybersecurity play because I think what people have learned is that you're not secure around cybersecurity unless you unplug it completely from any network. So that's where tape comes in. But at the same time, people can get rid of a lot of the OpEx and CapEx costs associated with cutting the tapes themselves, and you reduce the need to transport these things over the road. And many cases, these tapes aren't encrypted. So that adds a much more secure environment. And then the other service, of course, we apply to that is we tell the customer, independent of any change in generational tape drives, we give them guaranteed assurance that we will restore that data whenever they need it and whatever format they need. So if you kind of look at some of the things that are in the core DNA of Iron Mountain, together with our growing data center business and the core DNA of EMC, it's just a -- it is the Reese's Peanut Butter Cup."

I think the way to think about that is -- and if the FX movement is against markets where our businesses are more mature, so I could say, for example, Canada and the U.K., there obviously we earn higher margins. And so the -- that has sort of disproportionate effect on OIBDA. If the FX movement is against some of our businesses in emerging markets, it tends to be more dampened, the OIBDA level because obviously they're in earlier stages.

So if you look at 2016 and you take the midpoint of the guidance, you get down to the -- you should get to a $495 million. And then you add $412 million of the dividend, I mean it's $411 million, $412 million. So you subtract that out, and then there's about $65 million for growth racking. But that is actually for growth. So actually, if you think about it, it's the $495 million less the $411 million, and then that gives you a number that's available for growth, basically for investment in growth. And so the first call, and that cash available was $65 million, which is for the organic growth that we get from our customers every year. So even if you take out -- and that's for 2017 revenue. If you know what I mean, right? Because you're putting the racking investment in '16 so that when the growth hits you in '17, you can actually put those boxes on the shelf. So then even after you take the growth racking, which gives you the mid-2% range that we highlighted in terms of internal growth, in terms of our storage business, that leaves you about $19 million for cash available for discretionary investment. Now that's versus 2015 actuals of about $3 million leftover after you pay for racking. So we've actually -- even with the further FX headwinds coming into 2016 based on January rates, you see the improvement from 3% to 19%. But again, that's also already including $65 million for growth for that 2.5% organic storage volume growth that's coming in. Now when you come down and you're trying to -- to your point about M&A is -- so you say, well, how are we able to de-lever and still be able to do the M&A. Because, of course, when we're doing the M&A, we're buying EBITDA as well associated with that. So where -- that's how that -- that's why the whole thing works. So we are issuing debt to do the M&A. Because obviously, the $19 million doesn't fuel our whole M&A program. But between the $19 million that we have for beyond internal growth of storage, we also borrow but on a net-net basis in terms of what it does debt to EBITDA, you see deleveraging as well."

We are pleased to report strong fourth quarter and full year financial and operating results that, in every respect, met or exceeded our expectations in constant dollars with reported EPS for the quarter beating expectations. Our results continued to demonstrate the durability of our core storage rental business even in these volatile times. Total revenue in constant dollars was in line with our guidance, and constant dollar adjusted OIBDA was at the upper end of our range. We continued to achieve solid growth in storage rental revenue as well as consistent volume growth in new records from existing customers. We also achieved service gross margins in line with our year-end exit rate goal as well as growth in adjusted OIBDA. All of these accomplishments resulted in a very good 2015. 
I believe most of you are familiar with the strategic plan that we outlined at our Investor Day last fall. To assist in tracking our progress against that plan, we've modified the earnings commentary at the beginning of our supplemental disclosure to highlight key performance metrics. You'll note that in addition to our solid financial performance in 2015, we've made good progress against our objectives in each of the 3 pillars and in the foundational elements that support our strategy. 
As anticipated, the strength of the U.S. dollar continued to impact our reported revenue. However, when looking through to fundamental performance, we've achieved a significant turnaround in the business in the last 2 years. We've gone from negative internal growth in total revenue in both 2012 and 2013 to 1% positive internal growth or prior to acquisitions in 2014. And in 2015, we achieved further improvement with 1.5% positive internal growth. This is a testament to the hard work our organization has undertaken to, first, achieve net records management volume growth in all major markets; enhance customer service and retention whilst attracting new customers; stabilize service revenue declines in records management; penetrate new emerging markets; and advancing adjacent business opportunities. 
Turning to the pillars of our strategic plan in developed markets. Our focus over the last 2 years on getting more growth from these regions has driven improved performance with positive internal storage growth, stabilizing records management service revenues and adding roughly 3 million cubic feet of net new records in 2015 prior to acquisitions. 
In Emerging Markets, our revenue has grown from 10% of the total in 2013 to 14.6% of total revenue at the end of 2015 on a constant dollar basis. We have a sizable deal pipeline and are confident we will reach our goal of 16% of total revenue from these markets by 2016 and 20% by 2020. Importantly, we're driving internal growth in these markets of roughly 10% per year, so just 2 points of our 20% goal comes from acquisitions. 
We resumed M&A activity in select emerging markets in the fourth quarter, closing on a transaction in India. We have adjusted our focus to account for Recall's footprint and expect to close a few transactions in the first half of 2016, including a couple in fast-growing new emerging markets with underserved demand for records management. 
As we've noted in recent calls, despite the impact of the strong dollar on reported revenue, we mitigate our FX exposure at the income level because our expenses are denominated in the same local currencies as our revenues, and we are increasingly moving more of our debt outside the United States. The net of this is that we exceeded earnings expectations for the fourth quarter. Additionally, using strong dollars to invest in high-growth markets outside the U.S. gives us a lower-cost base -- basis and sets us up to realize significant value creation as the economic growth in these markets over the longer term will typically outpace that of the United States. 
I should note that in our other international segment, which is Emerging Markets plus Australia, we did see a higher level of destructions in Q4, driven by a single large customer which will carry over into Q1 of 2016. However, we do not see any other such unusual destructions on the horizon and expect that destructions for the remainder of the year will return to more typical levels. But we do report volume change on a trailing 12-month basis, and therefore this level will remain slightly elevated over the next few quarters. 
We also have a goal to generate 5% of our total worldwide revenue from adjacent businesses by the end of 2020, up from just 2% at the end of 2015. Today, our adjacent businesses consist of our data center operations in our recently acquired art storage business. We closed on Crozier Fine Arts storage in December and are pleased with how it is being integrated into our business whilst retaining the DNA and key management talent that made it the leading art storage business in the United States. We believe the $1 billion estimated global market is poised for the same type of consolidation opportunity we saw in the records management business years ago, and we have a plan that can take it to $100 million within 3 years. 
We had a fairly aggressive goal for 2015 to finish with an adjacent business revenue run rate of $50 million from a starting point below $20 million. We achieved that with roughly a $20 million revenue run rate from our data center business and $30 million from art storage. This all supports our planned shift in mix by 2020 to have 25% of our revenue coming from both emerging markets and adjacent businesses that have internal growth rates closer to 10%, up from 15% of our revenue in these higher-growth businesses today. 
In terms of the foundational elements of our strategy, we have made significant progress on our transformation initiative, affecting changes that have resulted in $50 million of net savings in 2016. We are finalizing the next set of initiatives that will deliver an additional $50 million of savings by year-end 2016. 
As previously disclosed, the remainder of the total $125 million of overhead savings will be actioned in 2017, and the full amount for the Transformation Program will be reflected in our 2018 adjusted OIBDA. Importantly, the cost to achieve these savings in each year is offset by the savings. As a reminder, we don't exclude the transformation costs from our adjusted financial measures, but we do detail the amounts in the bridging schedules in the supplemental. Rod will have more on the timing of expected transformation-related costs for 2016 in a few minutes. 
We continued to work toward closing of the Recall transaction and related integration planning. As outlined at our Investor Day, we have detailed work streams for virtually every functional area of the combined companies, and I am pleased with what I am seeing in the way our teams are working together on integration planning to create a dynamic, combined entity and facilitate a smooth transition. Obviously, this transaction is compelling in terms of strategic fit and is supported by meaningful synergies that drive accretion. As we work through the regulatory process, we will refine our views based upon a clear understanding of the outcome.  We are constructively engaged with the 4 principal regulators and are working hard towards closing the transaction in a timely manner. As you know, it is necessary for us to close early in a given quarter in order to convert Recall's operations in certain countries into our REIT structure. We will provide updates with respect to the timetable when we have substantially completed the regulatory review process. But at this time, we cannot answer any questions about regulatory outcomes on today's call beyond what we have already said. 
In addition, we view real estate as a foundation to our strategy. During the year, we invested roughly $171 million in real estate. We remain keenly focused on our capital-allocation opportunity and think about real estate investment in 4 major buckets. Our first priority is to invest in growth racking to accommodate net new volume growth we achieve annually. This investment yields average IRRs in the high teens. Our next priority is real estate consolidation, which may include both buildings and racking to improve real estate and operating efficiency and enhanced utilization. This is characterized by mid-teens IRRs. Third, we plan to continue to invest in data center in a success-based manner, driven by customer commitments. We continue to see good opportunity here with low double-digit IRRs in stabilized mid-teens return on invested capital. Fourth, we also look to complete select opportunistic leased buy-ins where we can acquire buildings at attractive valuations relative to market pricing or where it is strategically important to own. Rod will have more on how we view our real estate investment opportunities for the coming year. 
Now touching on some key financial and operating achievements before turning it over to Rod. On a constant dollar basis, we grew total revenue in 2015 by 2%, reflecting continued storage rental gains of 4%. This was driven primarily by storage rental internal growth of 2.7% for the year, reflecting continued strong growth from data management, other international and Western Europe. As we look out into 2016, we are seeing consistent trends and are -- and maintaining our view for internal storage rental revenue growth in the mid-2% range. Service revenue growth for the year was negative 0.4%, and we delivered positive at 0.3% internal service growth revenue for the quarter. 
We made good progress on our service margin initiative, exiting the year at 27.2%, right in the middle of our range. There will be ups and downs as the mix shifts to more nonrecurring projects, and there will be a downtick in service margin early in the year. But we expect it to ramp up again throughout the year and to result in a similar average margin for the full year. Also, as previously mentioned, in 2016, we will also focus on growing overall service gross profit as we move forward and our service mix evolves. Although some of our new offerings have lower margins than our core, activity-based services such as transportation and handling, they are also less capital-intensive, so they have very similar returns. 
Storage volume growth is another important indicator in our business. During the year, we once again grew net worldwide storage volume by 8 million cubic feet or 2.3% net growth and 1.6% prior to acquisitions, and gross volume of records from new and existing customers was roughly 42 million cubic feet over the trailing 12 months. 
Our customer retention remained strong at 98%, underscoring the stability of our customer base in supporting the durability of the storage revenue stream. This level has been stable over the past 6 quarters and represents an appropriate level in our business. 
Lastly, and most importantly, our cash generation is an important metric as it supports growth in dividends and investment. In recent presentations, we laid out our expectations for cash available to support the dividend, both on a stand-alone basis and including Recall. We expect to fund additional growth through debt in amounts that allow us to continue to de-lever the business on a debt-to-EBITDA basis. On a stand-alone basis, the continued strong and durable cash of the base business, coupled with the Transformation Program, will, at a minimum, allow us to increase the dividend per share by 15% between 2015 and 2018 whilst reducing leverage by 0.4 of a turn. 
Even with an increased dividend in Q4, we improved our year-end 2015 payout as a percentage of our AFFO from 82% at Investor Day to 78% at year-end. Including Recall, our minimum dividend per share delivers 24% growth between 2015 and 2018. This is all without issuing equity beyond the shares issued to purchase Recall. 
Looking ahead, all of these drivers support our updated constant dollar guidance for 2016. On a like-for-like basis or comparing our 2016 constant dollar guidance with our 2015 results using 2016 FX budget rates, you can see our growth expectations are very consistent with what we showed at Investor Day. We expect 3% to 6% constant dollar growth in revenue, 6% to 8% growth in adjusted OIBDA and 6% to 13% growth in adjusted EPS. This growth is underpinned by nearly $1.5 billion of storage net operating income, which is comparable to that generated by leaders in both the industrial and self-storage sectors. 
What distinguishes our business is its inherent durability, and it is this durability that delivers consistent levels of operating performance in good and bad times. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call over now to Rod."

I'll begin today with an overview of our 2015 performance, including a review of results by segment and updates on our service gross margin initiative as well as our Transformation Program. Finally, I will address our outlook for 2016, including a review of our capital allocation plans. 
Let's turn to our worldwide financial results. For the full year, reported revenues were $3.01 billion compared with $3.12 billion in 2014. Excluding the full year FX impacts of 6% or $171 million year-over-year, on a constant dollar basis, revenues grew by 2.1%. Consistent with the full year picture, revenues for the fourth quarter also grew by 2.1% on a constant dollar basis. As Bill noted, we did not have any meaningful acquisition activity for most of 2015, so our revenues for the year had a very limited contribution from external growth. 
Total revenues were driven by good constant dollar storage rental revenue growth of more than 3% for the quarter and 4% for the year. Service revenues were flat for the quarter and down 1% for the year. The decline in our constant dollar service revenue for the year was driven by the disposition of our shredding businesses in the U.K. and Australia in late 2014. 
Consistent with prior quarters, we have provided bridging schedules for total revenue, adjusted OIBDA and adjusted earnings per share, which explain key variances in year-on-year performance for the quarter and the full year. These schedules are on Pages 22 through 26 of the supplemental.  Similar to last quarter, we have also provided a bridging schedule on Page 27 to explain the sequential movement in our total service business gross margins. 
Through our focused initiative, we're continuing to align service costs with activity levels and revenue mix. Looking ahead, we expect modest reductions in our service gross profits during Q1, reflecting one-off severance costs and the timing of costs related to our growing mix of special projects. However, we expect service margins will recover to current levels throughout the year. 
Total adjusted OIBDA for the quarter was $238 million compared with $220 million in 2014. Despite FX headwinds, we grew adjusted OIBDA by 8% and excluding FX by 14%. For the full year, adjusted OIBDA grew by 4.4% on a constant dollar basis. 
As Bill noted, our Transformation Program continues in 2016. In the first quarter of 2016, we expect to incur roughly $7 million of net charges related to this initiative. During Q2 and Q3, we expect the Transformation Program to be $1 million to $2 million net negative to adjusted OIBDA with in-quarter costs slightly offsetting benefits. In Q4, we expect net upside of up to around $10 million though providing a strong run rate platform for year-on-year benefits in 2017. As Bill noted, we continue to expect run rate savings of $50 million to flow through to 2017. Our overall savings outlook for transformation remains consistent with what we laid out on our Investor Day in October with $125 million of cumulative savings by 2018. 
Looking at the overall phasing of contribution for 2016. We expect this to ramp up during the year for 2 reasons. Firstly, as I just discussed, the costs associated with our Transformation Program are front-loaded with offsetting net benefits coming later in the year. Secondly, our storage volumes and revenues will grow through the year as they typically do. As such, excluding any extraordinary events, we believe that Q1 adjusted OIBDA will represent roughly 21% to 23% total adjusted OIBDA affected in 2016. Furthermore, Q2 and Q3 will make up roughly 24% to 26% each, and Q4 will represent roughly 26% to 28%. 
Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.33 compared with $0.25 in the fourth quarter of 2014. For the full year, adjusted EPS was $1.21 compared with $1.36 for 2014. The decline in adjusted EPS year-on-year is driven by an 8% increase in share count related to the special distribution we made in Q4 2014 following our reconversion, charges related to transformation and a higher structural tax rate for the year. Excluding the increase in share count and restructuring costs in both periods as well as holding the tax rate constant, normalized adjusted EPS grew by $0.02 for the year. 
Our structural tax rate for this quarter came out at 16.8% compared with 14.4% in the prior year and 16.5% in Q3 of 2015. The year-over-year increase on our structural tax rate was primarily driven by higher income from foreign jurisdictions. We continue to believe that our tax rate will be approximately 15% to 17% in the short term. 
Normalized funds from operations, or FFO, per share was $0.57 for the quarter compared with $0.52 in the year-ago period, driven by improved performance.  For the full year, FFO per share was $2.10 per share compared with $2.28 in 2014. The decline was driven by FX headwinds, the increase in share count as well as restructuring charges related to our Transformation Program. Excluding share count increases, FX and restructuring charges in both periods, FX per share grew by -- FFO per share grew by 3%. 
Adjusted funds from operations, or AFFO, was $125 million for the fourth quarter compared with $112 million in the year-ago period. For the full year, AFFO was $522 million compared with $527 million in 2014. If we adjust for FX and the items mentioned earlier, the impacted FFO, except for share counts, then AFFO grew by 3% year-on-year. 
On Page 21 of the supplemental, we're now providing a reconciliation between AFFO and cash flow from operations, as presented in our GAAP cash flow statements. So you can more readily see the cash items that are not of a typical recurring nature. 
Let's turn to our financial performance by segment. In North American Records and Information Management, or RIM, internal storage rental revenue was up 0.2% of the fourth quarter and 0.1% for the full year. North American RIM internal service revenue declined this quarter due to the continued decrease in transportation, retrieve and refile activity levels. In addition, we saw more of a precipitous decline in average price of recycled-sorted office paper towards the end of the year, leading to a decline of over 19% quarter-over-quarter in average pricing. This impacted the paper revenue in our shred business and will have a follow-on impact into 2016. Adjusted OIBDA margins in RIM remained solid at 41% for the quarter and 40% for the year, up from 39% in 2014. The year-over-year improvement in North American RIM adjusted OIBDA margins is driven by the service gross margin actions and better operational performance. 
North American Data Management, or DM, delivered storage rental internal growth of 1.0% for the fourth quarter and 4.2% for the year. The growth in DM storage rental internal growth for the quarter was lower than recent periods due to a strong comparator from Q4 last year. Looking forward, we expect DM internal storage growth to be in line with the growth in total company storage internal growth of around 2.5%. Internal service revenue in DM declined by 8% in the fourth quarter and 5.1% for the year as we continue to see declines in the frequency of tape rotation and related transportation activity in the business. During the fourth quarter, DM adjusted OIBDA margins remained strong at 53.7% compared to 51.6% in Q3. For the full year, DM adjusted OIBDA margins were 52.2%. We expect DM adjusted OIBDA margins will remain in the low to mid-50% range as we continue to invest in new service offerings. Margins on new services, although high at 35% to 40%, are lower than core storage margins of approximately 75%. 
The Western Europe segment generated solid results with 2.4% internal storage rental growth for the quarter and 2.7% for the year. Looking at internal service revenue, declines in activity were partially offset by increases in nonrecurring imaging and other projects. Adjusted OIBDA margins remained solid in Western Europe at 33.1% for the quarter and 34.4% for the year. 
Finally, the other international segment, which is made up primarily of emerging markets and Australia, had strong growth in both storage and service revenues. Storage rental internal growth was 9.6% for the fourth quarter and 10.8% for the year. Service internal growth was 8.4% for the quarter and 9.0% for the year. Other international adjusted OIBDA margins were 23% for the quarter and 21% for the year. We expect to see adjusted OIBDA for this segment to deliver profitability on a portfolio basis in the low-20s range in the short term as we continue to expand our exposure in these fast-growing markets. 
Let's touch on the Recall acquisition briefly. To prepare for integration, in 2015, we incurred approximately $25 million of deal-close costs and $22 million to prepare for integration, which brings total Recall-related costs in 2015 to $47 million. For the first quarter of 2016, we expect $5 million to $8 million of deal-close costs and $8 million to $12 million of integration-related costs, bringing the total cost in Q1 to roughly $15 million to $20 million. Please note these expenses are excluded from our adjusted OIBDA calculation as they are onetime in nature. Importantly, these costs were outlined in our guidance related to the Recall acquisition when we announced the deal. 
Let's turn to our outlook for 2016 on page 13 of the supplemental. Business trends remain -- and fundamentals remain consistent, and operationally, we remain on track to achieve our long-term financial objectives given the durability in strong fundamentals of our business. Please note, I'm referring to the corrected version of the supplemental that was posted just prior to the call. Our guidance for 2016 growth on a constant dollar basis remains fairly consistent with the preliminary guidance we provided during our Q3 earnings call. We made 2 changes. Firstly, we updated our outlook to reflect the new constant dollar budget foreign exchange rates, which was set in January 2016. Note that at this point that our 2016 constant dollar budget rate is now equivalent to an odd dollar rate since it was just set last month. Secondly, we have reduced revenue and adjusted OIBDA by approximately $10 million at the midpoint as a result of the decline in the shred recycle paper prices I noted earlier. Paper -- revenue from paper recycling is almost all margin and so the vast majority flows through to adjusted OIBDA. 
To provide further clarity, I'd now like to share with you additional detail of how FX was impacted 2016 guidance and walk you through the components of our expected 2016 adjusted OIBDA growth on a constant dollar basis. The FX headwind was primarily driven by significant declines against the U.S. dollar in the following 5 currencies: Australian dollar, Brazilian real, British pound sterling, Canadian dollar and the euro. This represents about 28% of our total revenue. As a reminder, approximately 40% of our total revenues are denominated in non-U.S. dollars. Assuming our 2016 FX rates remain constant throughout the year, our guidance reflects a 5% decline in revenues from FX. At our Investor Day, we anticipated a decline of 3.5% based on rates at that time. Given continuing strength in the U.S. dollar, our outlook represents an additional decline by the end of the year at 1.5%. This total decline translates into roughly $165 million for the year on the top line. 
As we move down the P&L, FX headwinds continue to impact our guidance, albeit at a lower dollar amount. The FX headwinds impacting the top line translates into approximately $50 million on adjusted OIBDA for 2016. As you can see on Page 12 of the supplemental, we reported constant dollar 2015 adjusted OIBDA of $940 million at 2015 constant dollar budget rates set in January 2015. But our 2015 numbers are translated into 2016 budget rates, adjusted OIBDA would have been $900 million. However, we are also expecting an additional impact related to FX of roughly $10 million as a result of a change in our contribution mix.
As we noted earlier, we are also expecting a $10 million constant dollar impact from paper price declines. On a more positive note, we can add a $50 million benefit from the transformation. Adding all that up, we get to an adjusted OIBDA for 2016 based on January '16 rates of roughly $930 million. Adding on to that, our expectation of roughly 2% to 4% constant growth will get you the $950 million to $970 million, which is our 2016 guidance range. 
Lastly, moving to our expected cash available for distributions and investments for 2016. We expect it to be roughly $495 million at the midpoint of 2016. This continues to provide ample dividend coverage and funds from our core growth racking investment. 
Let's turn to our capital deployment plans. We expect our capital expenditures, which include maintenance and non-real estate investment to be in line with the ranges we provided at our Investor Day. Real estate investment spend is expected to be about $265 million, driven by growth racking spend of about $60 million, data center investment of $35 million. We also plan on investing $170 million in real estate consolidation and lease conversions. 
For M&A, our plan is roughly $100 million in emerging markets and $50 million in the developed markets. 
Our dividend expectation also remains consistent with the guidance we laid out on our Investor Day. As you saw last week, we announced our first quarter dividend of $0.485 per share, which is consistent with the $1.94 per share run rate from Q4 last year when we increased the quarterly rate by $0.01 per share. In addition, the $1.94 per share is the minimum projected dividend for 2016 on a combined basis with Recall. Importantly, we ended the year with a dividend payout ratio as a percent of AFFO of 78% to underscore the strength of our dividend coverage. 
Shifting briefly to the balance sheet. At the year-end, we had liquidity of approximately $1.7 billion and a lease-adjusted debt ratio of 5.6x as expected. 
Before concluding, I'd like to point out that we are updating our shelf registration statement with the SEC. You will likely see this filing next week. Please note that this update is part of our regular cycle. As we've said in the past, at this time, we don't plan on issuing equity to fund the investments outside the potential Recall acquisition. 
Overall, we've delivered good results for the year supported by a continued execution on our strategic plan, progress we've made in our transformation initiative as well as the stabilization of our service gross margins. Looking ahead, we're well positioned to deliver on our short- and long-term goals. We remain focused on creating shareholder value by extending the durability of our storage rental business, which drives growth and cash available to fund dividends and core growth investments. 
And with that, I'll hand it back to Bill to sum up."

I think it's pretty much the same as we said, I think, on the last call. I think it's bouncing between kind of the high single-digit to low double-digit declines in terms of what I would say are core service revenue associated with the transport of the tapes. And I think, as we called out the last few quarters, is that where we were on the paper record side of the business, maybe 2 or 3 years ago, we're still watching that till it starts flattening out or we see the inflection point. And we don't see that inflection point right now, but at the same time, we don't see it getting worse than what it is. I think what you'll see is you'll see some bouncing around in terms of the net service revenue on the data management. I mean, quite frankly, I think we've done a pretty good job on building up some of these new service lines that -- in the tape management, which includes the secured IT asset destruction, for instance, and also the restoration assurance business, just to call out 2. So the -- on the transportation side, again, which is our highest margin in that type of business, we don't see a slowdown of that decline, but we don't see an acceleration either. But I think what we're -- we're making some good progress in some of these new services, which generally have lower margins than transport. But at the same time, they have much less invested capital associated with it, so we're getting similar returns. So when those -- I wouldn't expect this year that these new services are going to overtake the decline that we're seeing in the transportation, but we're making good progress."

I think one of the things you probably caught in my remarks and a little bit in Rod's is that as we're shifting from the core transportation services that are associated with the ins and outs in our storage business to some of the new service areas, a lot of these new service areas are project-based, which is also the reason why we said we expect kind of a downtick in Q1 in some of our service revenue. As those projects have a lead time in terms of the sell and on boarding of those cycles, and then they come through it in a -- in the next quarter or quarters. And that's what you've seen actually in Western Europe. What you will have seen is there was an investment earlier in the year, and then that project revenue kind of flows through. So that's part of the new services. It's less smooth than, say, the transportation side of the business, so you have these ups and downs. So what we tend to do as we look at it over the course of the year. And it just so happened that in Western Europe, you saw that spike as part of that normal cyclicality of these projects."

So I think there's a kind of a couple aspects. There are some that -- there's a number of things that you -- I think you're touching upon or referring to that Patrick Keddy went through on Investor Day, things that we're doing just to get more margin out of some of our existing core service areas which have seen a drop in activity. So that's really around the transportation side. And I think we feel pretty good where that's coming out. I think you'll continue to see some improvement during the course of the year, but a lot of that is in flight. I think the bigger part of it is how we bring on some of the new service areas, which are less smooth. But on a year basis, these are project-driven. So you can think of it as like a defense contractor. There's certain amount of prospecting, and then there's a certain amount of reaping or harvesting. So you'll see -- on a quarter-by-quarter basis, you'll see some movement around that, but we have good visibility over the course of the year to be able to predict where the year will end up. So I think what you can expect as we go through the course of the year is we think that we will have similar slight uptick in terms of where we came in for the year in 2015. So slight improvement but kind of in the same postal code for 2016 in service. But you will see, as we shift away from the volume coming from almost exclusively the transportation side of the business to some of these new services that are more project-based, you will see more ups and downs on a quarter-by-quarter basis, just like Andrew called out, for the uptick in Western Europe in Q4. And we're saying that Q1, you'll see a downtick in some of those services, but we have very good visibility over the course of the year where it will come out."

So you saw, for instance, our acquisition, the last quarter of last year in India, and there's a couple more in flight that are in, as we called out, in the emerging markets, right? The other aspect of that, of course, is you won't see us be doing any M&A activity in the 4 regulatory jurisdictions that we're working with right now to close the Recall transaction because we don't want any delay in those discussions with the regulators, right? Because if you start doing acquisitions at the same time you're having discussions, you're just going to delay it.

The -- I'll just give you kind of a couple examples that are -- to give you an idea. Some of them are large scanning projects, so there are some that are in flight with government contracts, for instance. And they have a certain -- that's why I kind of alluded to kind of like the defense contracts, so these things have a kind of tilling, fertilizing, feeding process and then harvesting side to that. And those are typically very large scanning projects that are associated with storage. So we're not going in to compete with an ACS or a Xerox per se. I mean, they may be competing, but we're going after contracts where we think we really have a strong skill set that's associated with just not the scanning but also the classification of the records and the -- in many, if not most cases, the actual storing of those records. So those are -- but those are long lead-time projects. They come through with different types, and hence you see the kind of spike that we saw in Western Europe when those things come through. Others are, again, what I would call kind of BPM-type projects that are associated with storage. So right now, we have in flight a large project, which is associated with mortgage servicing or helping mortgage originator to process and manage a lot of their documentation and processes associated with mortgages. Again, there's a big up front piece, and we have the relationship with that customer because we do, if not all, most of their storage. So those are the kinds of -- those are kind of 2 different projects, one which I would typically call BPM and the other one I would call scanning. But we come at it and we've been asked to come in and provide these services because of our expertise around records management and records storage."

So the EMC, we're still very excited. We're making good steady progress. And the great thing about it is there's still a high level of engagement, even though, as you can probably imagine, that EMC is going through their own changes right now with the Dell acquisition. But even with all that and through that process, both pre- and post-announcement, we've had a high level of engagement, and both teams are working well. I mean, it's starting on a small base, but we're very excited about that combination to us. This is kind of like the Reese's Peanut Butter Cup, right? It's putting -- or you can say who has the peanut butter and who has the chocolate. But putting those 2 things together and combining it with our raised floor platform using the data center, it's just a -- it's a really unique platform that we can offer to our customers which is very difficult for any competitors to do because we're allowing customers to remove the -- both the OpEx and CapEx associated with their tape drives and their premises. And using EMC's market-leading technology or data-domain type technology, we can replicate their data center on our raised floor using our data set and technology and then deliver tapes off the back of that and store it in our vault, which is a perfect cybersecurity play because I think what people have learned is that you're not secure around cybersecurity unless you unplug it completely from any network. So that's where tape comes in. But at the same time, people can get rid of a lot of the OpEx and CapEx costs associated with cutting the tapes themselves, and you reduce the need to transport these things over the road. And many cases, these tapes aren't encrypted. So that adds a much more secure environment. And then the other service, of course, we apply to that is we tell the customer, independent of any change in generational tape drives, we give them guaranteed assurance that we will restore that data whenever they need it and whatever format they need. So if you kind of look at some of the things that are in the core DNA of Iron Mountain, together with our growing data center business and the core DNA of EMC, it's just a -- it is the Reese's Peanut Butter Cup."

I think the way to think about that is -- and if the FX movement is against markets where our businesses are more mature, so I could say, for example, Canada and the U.K., there obviously we earn higher margins. And so the -- that has sort of disproportionate effect on OIBDA. If the FX movement is against some of our businesses in emerging markets, it tends to be more dampened at the OIBDA level because obviously they're in earlier stages. And so the contribution margins is lower. Don't know if that helps."

So if you look at 2016 and you take the midpoint of the guidance, you get down to the -- you should get to a $495 million. And then you add $412 million of the dividend, I mean it's $411 million, $412 million. So you subtract that out, and then there's about $65 million for growth racking. But that is actually for growth. So actually, if you think about it, it's the $495 million less the $411 million, and then that gives you a number that's available for growth, basically for investment in growth. And so the first call, and that cash available was $65 million, which is for the organic growth that we get from our customers every year. So even if you take out -- and that's for 2017 revenue. If you know what I mean, right? Because you're putting the racking investment in '16 so that when the growth hits you in '17, you can actually put those boxes on the shelf. So then even after you take the growth racking, which gives you the mid-2% range that we highlighted in terms of internal growth, in terms of our storage business, that leaves you about $19 million for cash available for discretionary investment. Now that's versus 2015 actuals of about $3 million leftover after you pay for racking. So we've actually -- even with the further FX headwinds coming into 2016 based on January rates, you see the improvement from 3% to 19%. But again, that's also already including $65 million for growth for that 2.5% organic storage volume growth that's coming in. Now when you come down and you're trying to -- to your point about M&A is -- so you say, well, how are we able to de-lever and still be able to do the M&A. Because, of course, when we're doing the M&A, we're buying EBITDA as well associated with that. So where -- that's how that -- that's how the whole thing works. So we are issuing debt to do the M&A. Because obviously, the $19 million doesn't fuel our whole M&A program. But between the $19 million that we have for beyond internal growth of storage, we also borrow but on a net-net basis in terms of what it does is debt to EBITDA, you see deleveraging as well."

What does this acquisition means for Iron Mountain? From a commercial perspective, it enhances our global footprint, both strengthening our existing country presence as well as expanding our reach from 41 countries to 45 countries and strengthens our ability to reach both global organizations in mid-market businesses looking to benefit from our industry-leading expertise and solutions appropriate for their scale. 
The combined strength of our companies expands our ability to meet customer's information management and storage needs as they face increasing regulation, ongoing security threats and seek to turn information into business value. 
You may remember a video we featured in our Investor Day last fall, with customer stories about the trust they place in us. Today, the stakes have never been higher for organizations of all sizes to ensure their most critical assets are protected and accessible. The see us as their partner protecting what matters, while also providing expertise, products and services designed to get the most out of those assets. That trust is a cornerstone of our business. 
A big part of this trust is based not only on our dedication to high quality service, but it is also derived from confidence our customers have in us to leverage our scale for the kind of innovation that allows us to serve them long into the future. The industrial logic of this deal is undisputable. And from a financial perspective, it enhances our 2020 strategic plan, delivering cash benefits that drive accretion, both on an FFO and an AFFO basis. This in turn supports attractive long-term durable dividend growth, averaging 10% per year through 2018 as the synergies and benefits from transformation begin to flow through and approximately 4% growth per year annually thereafter through 2020. 
I won't go into the detail of synergies and accretion here, as I believe we covered that thoroughly in the call we hosted on April 1  to announce the conclusion of regulatory reviews in the U.S, Canada and Australia. But I do wish to reiterate that the benefits of the transaction are compelling, consistent with our strategy and importantly, consistent with our expectations in terms of the financial contribution. 
Now that closing is imminent, the challenging work of integration can begin. We have been refining and advancing integration plans across all functional areas of the combined companies and it is encouraging to see how well the teams have come together to support the closing and prepare for a smooth combination. We look forward to welcoming Recall customers, and shareholders. 
Starting in Iron Mountain standalone results, first quarter financial and operating results were strong. Our financial results continued to demonstrated the durability of our core storage rental business. Total revenue growth in constant dollars of roughly 4% was in line with our longer-term expectations, driven by constant dollar growth of 4% in both storage and service. 
Adjusted OIBDA constant dollar growth was about 7%, excluding charges associated with our Transformation Program and service initiative. We see consistent trends in constant dollar storage revenue growth for the remainder of the year, while constant dollar service revenue growth will continue to be a bit lumpy. Even with this lumpiness, we continue to expect positive internal service revenue as well as service gross profit growth for the full year. 
Our results from the first quarter reflect the service revenue mix shift we've discussed in recent calls with declines in transportation and handling-related services, largely offset by growth in trading, project revenue and DMS, which for Iron Mountain refers to our imaging or scanning businesses. 
We are also beginning to gain some traction with new data management service offerings, such as our Secure IT asset destruction offering and our data domain venture with EMC. You may have also seen that yesterday, we announced a new Iron Mountain cloud archive offering, a cost-effective, near infinitely-scalable repository for organizations needing to protect and preserve data for compliance, legal or value creation purposes. We'll be debuting this new solution at EMC World Conference next week. 
As our mix shift continues, we will focus more on enhancing gross profit rather than gross margins as these new service offerings are often lower-margin but still generate attractive returns due to the minimal capital investment required. 
Turning to internal storage revenue, growth of 2.2% for the quarter was in line with the fourth quarter of last year and is compared with a particularly strong quarter in 2015. We continue to expect average storage rental internal growth to be north of 2.5% for the full year. Internal volume growth or net of acquisitions was positive in all segments and consistent with recent quarters' performance at 1 2 -- 1.6% worldwide growth. Total gross volume or records from new and existing customers was roughly 30.5 million cubic feet over the trailing 12 months, also very consistent with what we've seen over the past few years. 
Turning to progress on our strategic plan, during the quarter, we continue to advance each of the 3 pillars of the plan as well as in the foundational elements that support it. Let me briefly highlight progress in each of the 3 pillars, namely getting the most out of our developed markets; expanding our presence in the fast-growing emerging markets; and expansion in faster growing adjacent businesses. 
In developed markets, we achieved consistent performance from North America RIM with positive internal storage and volume growth, while North American data management and our Western Europe segment both generated internal volume growth of roughly 3% and total internal revenue growth of about 2%. 
In emerging markets, our goal is to expand our presence and leverage our scale, driving these markets to 20% of our total revenue by 2020. Recall footprint in Southeast Asia will support that objective but prior to the combination, we already have driven our emerging market business to 15% of total revenue on a constant dollar basis as of the end of Q1. 
During the quarter, we continue to achieve total internal revenue growth in these markets of 10%, with internal volume growth of 7%. Additionally, as our visibility on closing of the Recall transaction became clear, we resumed acquisition activity, moving into 2 new emerging markets during the quarter. We acquired a 75% interest in the largest privately-owned and the #2 overall records management company in South Africa, a company with more than 2 million cubic feet of storage and a range of offering similar to ours. 
We also acquired a Lithuanian-based document storage and archiving firm during the quarter, expanding our presence into 3 new countries in the Baltics, with the acquisition of this market leader. 
With these acquisitions, we expand our global reach and now operate in 41 countries on 6 continents. But it's not about putting pins in the map. It's about leveraging our global footprint, and capturing the first wave of records management outsourcing occurring in these faster growing markets. 
As we noted last quarter, we did see the carryover of the large single customer destruction in our Other International segment, which drove destructions up to 4.2% in this segment, in line with what we saw last quarter. Again, we do not see any other such unusual destructions on the horizon and expect that the remainder of the year, we'll return to more typical levels of less than 4%. We do report volume change on a trailing 12 month basis and if this level will remain slightly elevated over the next few quarters. 
As for adjacent businesses, we are on track to achieve our stated goal to generate 5% of our total worldwide revenue from adjacent businesses by the end of 2020, up from just 2% at the end of 2015. You can now see a full quarter of contribution from Crozier Fine Arts acquired last December, which is performing in line with our expectations. 
Additionally, you may have noted our plans to expand our data center business into Northern Virginia, North America's largest data center market. Northern Virginia is also home to federal government data centers and large bio data centers owned by the major data center REITs. 
During Q2, we plan to resolve this land to an industrial developer, who will undertake land development and shell construction, whilst we focus on expanding our data center product offering in this highly desirable location. We are early in the planning for this multiyear, multi-phased project. Whilst we are not yet showing specific projections, we wanted to share our plans, provide some insight into one of the ways in which we are able to strategically fund our growth opportunities. 
The result is that whilst we will achieve slightly lower-margins through this approach to funding, the impact on our balance sheet has improved and our stabilized ROIC is similar to that of data centers we own outright. 
To sum up, we are well on track to achieve our combined goal of having the expansion of our emerging market presence and adjacent businesses yield 25% of our total revenue mix by 2020, with the internal growth rates in the 10% plus range, which is up from a little over 17% of our business mix today. 
I should also add, we continue to make progress in our transformation initiatives. Actions in 2015 resulted in run rate savings of $50 million, which is visible in a 120-basis point improvement in year-over-year OIBDA margins this quarter, after adjusting for transformation. 
We have undertaken additional action in the first quarter that support the additional $50 million of savings we expect to achieve by year end 2016. 
We incurred total charges of $5.7 million in the quarter related to these actions and we're able to pull forward a bit of the run rate savings that contributed to our strong performance this quarter. 
Also, as previously disclosed, the remainder of the total $125 million of overhead savings will be actioned [ph] in 2017 and the full amount for the transformation program will be reflected in our 2018 adjusted OIBDA. 
The all-important cash flow result for both today and growth into the future is in line with the growth expectations we highlighted during Investor Day, and again, on our April 1 call, and continues to provide the foundation for our expected dividend growth. We also updated the high-level goals associated with our 2020 plan. What we've communicated is that we continue to expect to achieve similar top line and adjusted OIBDA compound annual growth. We also expect to generate similar levels of cash available to grow the dividend by an average of about 10% per year through 2018 and 4% annual growth thereafter, fund organic growth racking investment and increase the amount of remaining cash available to support discretionary investment. And we will do so whilst both reducing our payout ratio as a percentage of AFFO and deleveraging. 
We expect to fund additional growth through debt financing in amounts that allows us to continue to delever the business on a debt-to-EBITDA basis. 
Our expectations are underpinned by the continued demonstration of a very durable growing business that performs consistently throughout business cycles. 
In addition, we are extending that durability through solid execution of our plan in developed market, identifying and capturing opportunities in both emerging markets and adjacent businesses and continuing to enhance our cost structure in both service and overhead. Our durable storage business generates more than $1.5 billion of annual storage net operating income, which is comparable to that generated by leaders in both the industrial and self-storage sectors. 
What distinguishes our business is its inherent durability and this durability that delivers consistent levels of operating performance in good and bad times. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Rod."

I'll begin today with an overview of our first quarter performance, including an update on our transformation initiative and the review of results by segments. Then I will provide color on the Recall transaction and progress we've made so far in preparing for integration as well as discuss our plans for funding the transaction. 
Let's turn to our worldwide financial results. For the first quarter, reported revenues were $751 million compared with $749 million in 2015. Excluding the year-over-year FX impact of approximately 3.6% or $26 million on a constant dollar basis, revenues grew by 3.8%. 
Total revenues were driven by a strong constant dollar storage rental revenue growth of approximately 3.9%. 
Service revenues also performed well in the quarter, up by 3.7%. This was primarily the result of project revenue in North American Records and Information Management and growth in shred revenues, driven by new customer wins. This service revenue growth reflects the mix shift in our business, with service revenues are more heavily weighted towards projects, which can result in more volatility in year-over-year growth rates. 
During the quarter, we saw a reduction in service gross profits and service gross margin. This decline was driven by an increase in medical expenses and severance costs related to our service gross margin initiative. Excluding these costs, service gross margins would've been flat on a year-over-year basis. 
Consistent with prior quarters, we have provided Britain schedules for total revenue, adjusted OIBDA and adjusted earnings per share, which explain key variances in year-on-year performance for the quarter. 
This quarter, we've also added a similar bridge for Echo focus [ph] share. These schedules on Page 20 through 23 of the supplemental. 
Total adjusted OIBDA for the quarter was $235 million compared to $231 million in 2015. Despite FX headwinds earlier in the year, we grew adjusted OIBDA by 1.7% and by 4.5% on a constant dollar basis, and growth was 7%, if we exclude the $5.7 million of transformation initiative charges we took in the quarter. 
As evidenced by improvements at the whole adjusted OIBDA margins, we continue to execute on our transformation initiative. As just stated, during this quarter, we incurred roughly $6 million of net charges related to this initiative. 
During Q2 and Q3, prior to any adjustments from Recall, we continue to expect the transformation initiative to be $1 million to $2 million net negative to adjusted OIBDA, with in-quarter costs slightly offsetting benefits. 
In Q4, we expect a net upside of roughly $7 million, providing a strong run rate platform for year-on-year benefits, 2017. 
We continue to expect exit rate savings from actions taken in 2016 of $50 million to flow through to 2017. Our overall savings outlook for transformation remains consistent with what we laid out on our Investor Day in October, with $125 million of cumulative savings by 2018. 
Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.33 compared to $0.32 in 2010. Excluding the cost for the transformation and after normalizing for the tax rate benefit, adjusted EPS would've grown by roughly 9%. 
Our adjusted OIBDA on an adjusted EPS results for the quarter came in ahead of the phasing expectations we laid out on the February conference call. This OIBDA performance in the first quarter was driven by pulling forward a portion of transformation benefits as well as lower overall G&A expenses as we delayed certain costs and hires in anticipation of the Recall transaction.  In addition, adjusted EPS benefited from a lower tax rate. 
Our structural tax rate for this quarter came out at 14.0% compared to 16.2% in the prior year. The year-over-year decrease in our structural tax rate was primarily driven by earnings mix skewed more towards our qualified nontaxable entities. 
We continue to believe that our tax rate will be roughly 20% once Recall closes due to their exposure in International markets. 
Normalized funds from operations or FFO per share was $0.51 for the quarter compared to $0.50 in the year-ago period. As noted in the cost associated with the transformation, FFO per share would have grown by roughly 8%. 
Adjusted funds from operations or AFFO was $142 million compared with $128 million in the year-ago period. AFFO is at the high-end of expectations due to the timing of maintenance capital expenses and nonreal estate investments which are typically incurred towards the second half of the year. 
Similar to the prior quarter, on Page 19 of the supplemental, we're providing a reconciliation between AFFO and cash flow from operations as presented in our GAAP cash flow statement, so you can more readily see the cash items that are not of the typical recurring nature. 
Let's turn to our financial performance by segment. In North American Records and Information Management or RIM, internal storage rental revenue increased by 0.2% for the first quarter. North American RIM internal service revenue increased by 3.8% due to an increase in project rate revenue and new customer wins from the shred business, as noted earlier. 
North American RIM adjusted OIBDA margins declined year-over-year, primarily due to increased medical costs and severance charges related to our service margin initiative. 
North American Data Management or DM delivered storage rental internal growth of 1.8% for the first quarter. Internal service revenue in DM declined by 6.9%, as we continue to see reductions in the frequency of tape rotation on related transportation activity in the business. 
The high single-digit decline in transportation and handling services was partially offset by mid-single digit growth in the new data management service offerings and other DM project-related revenue. 
DM adjusted OIBDA margins improved year-over-year due to an increase -- due to decrease in overhead costs, primarily associated with lower G&A expense. 
The Western European segment generated solid results, with 2.1% internal storage rental growth. Internal service revenue growth decline in this segment, primarily as a result of activity declines in retrieved refund in transportation and a relatively weak quarter for projects. 
Adjusted OIBDA margins improved in Western Europe as a result of a decrease in overhead expense, specifically compensation expense. In addition, Western Europe benefited from a one-off real estate tax benefit of roughly $3 million. 
The other International segments, which is made up primarily of emerging markets in Australia, showed strong growth in both storage and service revenues. Storage rental internal growth was 9.6% and service internal growth, 11.3% for the quarter. Other International adjusted OIBDA margins were 21% for the quarter, in line with expectations. 
We continue to expect adjusted OIBDA in this segment to deliver profitability on a portfolio basis in the low 20s range in the short-term as we expand our exposure in these fast-growing markets. 
Let me talk about the Recall acquisition to provide details on the cost we have incurred so far in 2016. We're working diligently on integration planning as well as preparing to convert portions of Recall's business to our infrastructure. 
As a result of all this hard work, we are well-positioned to achieve our synergies quicker in 2016 than we have originally anticipated when we announced the deal back in June 2015. Our expectations of cost to achieve the deal still consistent with prior projections. 
In the first quarter, we incurred $7 million of deal closed cost and $11 million of integration related cost, bringing the total of Recall costs in Q1 to roughly $18 million in operating expenses. Please note these expenses are excluded from our adjusted OIBDA calculations that are onetime in nature. 
Let's turn to our outlook for 2016 on Page 12 of the supplemental. Business trends and fundamentals remain consistent. We remain on track to achieve our long-term financial objectives, given the durability and strong fundamentals of our business. As we noted, our 2016 guidance reflects a partial year benefit from Recall as well as the net synergies we are expecting in 2016. Please note, this is a preliminary view of the combined group and assumes that all divestitures are effective on May 1. We'll continue to refine our estimates and provide updates as necessary once the transaction is closed. 
Another point about the guidance, as you might expect, even though we're combining our higher-margin business with Recall's slightly lower-margin business, in the near term, adjusted OIBDA margins will be slightly lower and our standalone margins until we realize synergies. 
Lastly, I'd like to note that we are starting to see improvement in foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar, which may potentially add some favorability to our 2016 guidance. The top currencies that have improved since the beginning of the year are the Canadian dollar, euro, Brazilian rail [ph] and Australian dollar, partially offset by the declines in the British pound. We're continuing to watch these trends closely and we'll update our guidance once warranted. 
Moving to our expected cash available for distribution investment for 2016, we continue to estimate that it will be roughly $600 million for 2016. This continues to provide ample dividend coverage and funds our core growth racking investments. Our capital deployment plans remain unchanged. We continue to expect capital expenditures, which include real estate and nonreal estate maintenance and nonreal estate investment to be in line with the figures we provided on April 1. We expect to send -- spend $70 million in core growth racking and approximately $35 million in the data center business. 
For M&A, our plan continues to be roughly $100 million spend in emerging markets and $50 million in developed markets. We also plan on investing where value creation is compelling in real estate development consolidation and lease conversions. 
Dividend expectations remain consistent with the guidance we laid out on our Investor Day. Dividend per share is expected to grow in the double digits on average in 2017 and 2018 as we realize the benefits of transformation savings and Recall synergies. Beyond 2018, we expect to grow dividend per share of roughly 4% per year. Importantly, the dividend payout ratio as a percentage of AFFO, is expected to be approximately 78% in 2016 and 70% by 2020, which underscores the strength of our dividend coverage. 
Shifting briefly to the balance sheet, at the year end, we had liquidity of approximately $650 million and our lease adjusted debt ratio was 5.7x as expected. 
We announced last week that we entered into a commitment letter with lenders to provide an unsecured bridge facility of up to $850 million to provide a portion of the financing for the Recall transaction. We expect to enter into definitive loan documentation for the bridge and borrow the full amount on April 29. 
As previously said, we anticipate refinancing the bridge and replenishing capacity on the revolver with long-term debt as soon as practical. 
Overall, we are pleased with the strong performance we saw in the first quarter. Our results are driven by the durability of our business and execution of our 2020 Vision. We are excited to begin the integration of Recall in the second quarter and begin to realize meaningful synergies associated with the deal. 
Looking ahead, we believe we are well-positioned to deliver on our short-term and long term goals. We remain focused on extending the durability of our storage rental business, which drives growth and our cash available to fund dividends in the core growth investments. 
And with that, I'll hand the call back to Bill."

And before I turn the call back over to the operator for questions, let me quickly sum up what you've heard today so far. 
First, this was a very good quarter and we are headed into the Recall integration from a strong position. Our core storage business performed well and remains extremely durable, a characteristic that has been demonstrated both in good economic conditions as well as through downturns. And if you Recall, last year, we finished the year with a 1.5% internal revenue growth rate, before acquisitions and now Q1 results showed a 2% internal revenue growth rate, which also compares favorably to the Q1 of last year at 1.4%.  So it was a good quarter also in terms of revenue growth. 
Second, we're feeling good about the Recall transaction. Our progress in integration and the ability to derive benefits from scale, which supports additional growth in cash flow. 
And finally, our high-margin business coupled with our focus and continuous cost control continues to give us high confidence in our ability to deploy that incremental cash flow into growth investment, deleveraging and near-term double-digit growth in our dividend per share. 
With that, operator, we're now ready for questions."

So 2 [ph] various specifically is what we found in terms of maintenance CapEx, we feel very comfortable that Recall's maintenance CapEx will be in line with what we spend on our [indiscernible] facilities, i.e. around 2.6% of revenue, whereas before we though we were going to have to spend more because they have done a number of acquisitions. So we feel very comfortable based on the integration planning that it's kind of like-for-like integration in terms of level of maintenance Capex. The other area in which we feel very comfortable now, which was an unknown for us, is we had a significant uptick or regional budgeting for IT systems because again we didn't know if our platforms would be big enough to scale efficiently to absorb all of the Recall operations. And again, we feel very confident to see that we still have significant investment to absorb the Recall operations onto our IT platforms. But much more in line that we're taking on a company that's 1/4 of our size, rather than one that we would have to rebuild or relaunch major IT systems. So those are the 2 areas that I would say a positive surprises that we had on the integration side. But Rod, you may want to comment a little bit more in terms of the guidance."

But it is an area, you're right to call it out. It is an area that we're putting more and more discrete focus on as a safe initiative because we're hearing from our customers, they are looking for more and more kinds of what I would call project-related services as we kind of take the full management of their document from creation to storage approach.

And the second is we took some severance cost in a number of our services businesses as part of sort of an ongoing program to drive longer-term improvements in margin. And that has an impact of 0.6%. There's a small other component, which has to do with some vacation accruals, if you were to factor those in, we'd actually would've had a service gross margin of 26.2%. So that would compare to 26.1% from last year. So that's the driver of the difference."

But what we said I think in the last couple of calls, what you see over time is not that we're not focused on margins but we're less focused on specific margin number because we're looking at return on invested capital as the mix of services change. Because as Rod said, answering the question earlier, about what's happening with transportation for instance or our data management or tape business, the tape -- the transportation typically is very high-margin business. So as we plant some of that revenue loss with new service initiatives, many of those have a lower-margin but they also have lower capital associated with similar returns. But I think the bridge year-on-year, you're not going to see a massive change in mix over time. So I think the bridge is important when on a short period of time, assuming that's been happening."

I think I understand the question beyond the question because in some of the markets we highlighted, there are some of the segments we highlighted the volume is growing faster than the revenue, if I understand where your question is coming from. I think the -- I wouldn't read too much into that. I think generally, our guidance is the same, that we're achieving inflation or a little bit more than inflation in terms of pricing in each of our markets. So it does look a little bit odd in this quarter that you see in a couple of segments where we actually achieved higher volume growth and total revenue growth on a storage basis. I think that's more driven by a couple of things. One is that in one of our business lines, we had a major REIT, a very large customer, major renewal. And I think as we talked about before, when we have large customer renewals is you get these sawtooth where at the renewal point is you take a discount and then it climbs up through that period. So it was a little bit of that going on. And then, specifically in Europe, we have a market where we successfully took on a very large public sector customer, which has actually similar pricing as a lot of our other developed markets, but because of the historical volume of some customers just reaching their natural light for some of the box is as natural customers reaching their natural life going out at the same time. You have a -- what actually, looks like a dilution effect. But overall, our pricing still continues to track. If we look at it over a 12 or kind of a trailing basis, we expect it to continue to track to be slightly ahead of inflation. So you'll kind of see that kind of go back into the normal zone."

And overall last year, we had 1.5% and we delivered 2% this quarter. So we feel comfortable with the rep, even at a total revenue basis that we are achieving.

This morning, we'll hear from Bill Meaney, our President and CEO, who will discuss highlights of the quarter and progress toward our strategic initiative; followed by Rod Day, our CFO, who will cover financial results. 
After our prepared remarks, we'll open up the phones for Q&A. And as we have done in the past, we have posted our earnings commentary and supplemental disclosure package on the Investor Relations page of our website, at www.ironmountain.com, under Investor Relations/Financial Information. 
Referring now to Page 2 of the supplemental, today's earnings call and slide presentation will contain a number of forward-looking statements, most notably our outlook for 2016 financial and operating performance. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to today's supplemental, our earnings commentary, the Safe Harbor language on this slide and our most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the major risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those in our forward-looking statements. 
In addition, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results, and the reconciliations to these measures, as required by Reg G, are included in our supplemental reporting  package. 
With that, Bill, would you please begin?"

And thanks to all the investors and analysts on today's call for your continued support during the process of finalizing our acquisition of Recall. In fact, it was one year ago today that we announced the agreement in principle between our 2 firms. 
As you saw last week, we have now satisfied all conditions for closing, and we'll do so next Monday, Australian time. I cannot say enough good things about the dedication and focus required by -- required and demonstrated by our teams on both sides to get this transaction over the goal line. And I should add, it is this dedication of our teams that has set us up to hit the ground running with integration. I wish to thank my fellow team members for continued focus on the core business by delivering another strong quarter across all metrics, but most importantly, our earnings and cash flow results. 
What does this acquisition mean for Iron Mountain? From a commercial perspective, it enhances our global footprint, both strengthening our existing country presence as well as expanding our reach from 41 countries to 45, and strengthens our ability to reach both global organizations in mid-market businesses looking to benefit from our industry-leading expertise and solutions appropriate for their scale. 
The combined strength of our companies expands our ability to meet customers' information management and storage needs as they face increasing regulation, ongoing security threats and seek to turn information into business value. 
You may remember a video we featured at our Investor Day last fall, with customer stories about the trust they place in us. Today, the stakes have never been higher for organizations of all sizes to ensure their most critical assets are protected and accessible. The see us as their partner protecting what matters, whilst also providing expertise, products and services designed to get the most out of those assets. That trust is a cornerstone of our business. 
A big part of this trust is based not only on our dedication to high-quality service, but it is also derived from confidence our customers have in us to leverage our scale for the kind of innovation that allows us to serve them long into the future. The industrial logic of this deal is undisputable. And from a financial perspective, it enhances our 2020 strategic plan, delivering cash benefits that drive accretion, both on an FFO and an AFFO basis. This in turn supports attractive long-term durable dividend growth, averaging 10% per year through 2018 as the synergies and benefits from transformation begin to flow through, and approximately 4% growth per year annually thereafter through 2020. 
I won't go into the detail of synergies and accretion here, as I believe we covered that thoroughly in the call we hosted on April 1, to announce the conclusion of regulatory reviews in the U.S., Canada and Australia. But I do wish to reiterate that the benefits of the transaction are compelling, consistent with our strategy, and importantly, consistent with our expectations in terms of the financial contribution. 
Now that closing is imminent, the challenging work of integration can begin. We have been refining and advancing integration plans across all functional areas of the combined companies, and it is encouraging to see how well the teams have come together to support the closing and prepare for a smooth combination. We look forward to welcoming Recall's customers, employees and shareholders. 
Turning to Iron Mountain's standalone results, first quarter financial and operating results were strong. Our financial results continued to demonstrate the durability of our core storage rental business. Total revenue growth in constant dollars of roughly 4% was in line with our longer-term expectations, driven by constant dollar growth of 4% in both storage and service. 
Adjusted OIBDA constant dollar growth was about 7%, excluding charges associated with our Transformation Program and service initiative. We see consistent trends in constant dollar storage revenue growth for the remainder of the year, while constant dollar service revenue growth will continue to be a bit lumpy. Even with this lumpiness, we continue to expect positive internal service revenue as well as service gross profit growth for the full year. 
Our results in the first quarter reflect the service revenue mix shift we discussed in recent calls, with declines in transportation and handling-related services, largely offset by growth in trading, project revenue and DMS, which for Iron Mountain refers to our imaging or scanning businesses. 
We are also beginning to gain some traction with new data management service offerings, such as our Secure IT asset destruction offering and our data domain venture with EMC. You may have also seen that yesterday, we announced a new Iron Mountain cloud archive offering, a cost-effective, near infinitely-scalable repository for organizations needing to protect and preserve data for compliance, legal or value creation purposes. We'll be debuting this new solution at EMC World Conference next week. 
As our mix shift continues, we will focus more on enhancing gross profit rather than gross margins, as these new service offerings are often lower-margin, but still generate attractive returns due to the minimal capital investment required. 
Turning to internal storage revenue, growth of 2.2% for the quarter was in line with the fourth quarter of last year and is compared with a particularly strong quarter in 2015. We continue to expect average storage rental internal growth to be north of 2.5% for the full year. Internal volume growth or net of acquisitions was positive in all segments and consistent with recent quarter's performance at 1.2 -- 1.6% worldwide growth. Total gross volume or records from new and existing customers was roughly 30.5 million cubic feet over the trailing 12 months, also very consistent with what we've seen over the past few years. 
Turning to progress on our strategic plan, during the quarter, we continued to advance each of the 3 pillars of the plan as well as in the foundational elements that support it. Let me briefly highlight progress in each of the 3 pillars, namely getting the most out of our developed markets; expanding our presence in the fast-growing emerging markets; and expansion in faster growing adjacent businesses. 
In developed markets, we achieved consistent performance from North America RIM, with positive internal storage and volume growth, whilst North American data management and our Western Europe segment both generated internal volume growth of roughly 3% and total internal revenue growth of about 2%. 
In emerging markets, our goal is to expand our presence and leverage our scale, driving these markets to 20% of our total revenue by 2020. Recall footprint in Southeast Asia will support that objective, but prior to the combination, we already have driven our emerging market business to 15% of total revenue on a constant dollar basis as of the end of Q1. 
During the quarter, we continue to achieve total internal revenue growth in these markets of 10%, with internal volume growth of 7%. Additionally, as our visibility on closing of the Recall transaction became clear, we resumed acquisition activity, moving into 2 new emerging markets during the quarter. We acquired a 75% interest in the largest privately-owned and the #2 overall records management company in South Africa, a company with more than 2 million cubic feet of storage and a range of offering similar to ours. 
We also acquired a Lithuanian-based document storage and archiving firm during the quarter, expanding our presence into 3 new countries in the Baltics with the acquisition of this market leader. 
With these acquisitions, we expand our global reach and now operate in 41 countries on 6 continents. But it's not about putting pins in the map. It's about leveraging our global footprint, and capturing the first wave of records management outsourcing occurring in these faster growing markets. 
As we noted last quarter, we did see the carryover of the large single customer destruction in our Other International segment, which drove destructions up to 4.2% in this segment, in line with what we saw last quarter. Again, we do not see any other such unusual destructions on the horizon and expect that the remainder of the year, we'll return to more typical levels of less than 4%. We do report volume change on a trailing 12-month basis, and therefore, this level will remain slightly elevated over the next few quarters. 
As for adjacent businesses, we are on track to achieve our stated goal to generate 5% of our total worldwide revenue from adjacent businesses by the end of 2020, up from just 2% at the end of 2015. You can now see a full quarter's contribution from Crozier Fine Arts acquired last December, which is performing in line with our expectations. 
Additionally, you may have noted our plans to expand our data center business into Northern Virginia, North America's largest data center market. Northern Virginia is also home to federal government data centers and large cloud data centers owned by the major data center REITs. 
During Q2, we plan to resolve this land to an industrial developer, who will undertake land development and shell construction, whilst we focus on expanding our data center product offering in this highly desirable location. We are early in the planning for this multiyear, multi-phased project. Whilst we are not yet sharing specific projections, we wanted to share our plans and provide some insight into one of the ways in which we are able to strategically fund our growth opportunities. 
The result is that whilst we will achieve slightly lower margins through this approach to funding, the impact on our balance sheet has improved and our stabilized ROIC is similar to that of data centers we own outright. 
To sum up, we are well on track to achieve our combined goal of having the expansion of our emerging market presence and adjacent businesses yield 25% of our total revenue mix by 2020, with internal growth rates in the 10% plus range, which is up from a little over 17% of our business mix today. 
I should also add, we continue to make progress on our transformation initiatives. Actions in 2015 resulted in run rate savings of $50 million, which is visible in a 120-basis-point improvement in year-over-year OIBDA margins this quarter, after adjusting for transformation. 
We have undertaken additional action in the first quarter that support the additional $50 million of savings we expect to achieve by year-end 2016. 
We incurred total charges of $5.7 million in the quarter related to these actions, and we're able to pull forward a bit of the run rate savings that contributed to our strong performance this quarter. 
Also as previously disclosed, the remainder of the total $125 million of overhead savings will be actioned in 2017, and the full amount for the transformation program will be reflected in our 2018 adjusted OIBDA. 
The all-important cash flow result for both today and growth into the future is in line with the growth expectations we highlighted during Investor Day, and again on our April 1 call, and continues to provide the foundation for our expected dividend growth. We also updated the high-level goals associated with our 2020 plan. What we've communicated is that we continue to expect to achieve similar top line and adjusted OIBDA compound annual growth. We also expect to generate similar levels of cash available to grow the dividend by an average of about 10% per year through 2018 and 4% annual growth thereafter, fund organic growth racking investment and increase the amount of remaining cash available to support discretionary investment. And we will do so whilst both reducing our payout ratio as a percentage of AFFO and deleveraging. 
We expect to fund additional growth through debt financing in amounts that allows us to continue to delever the business on a debt-to-EBITDA basis. 
Our expectations are underpinned by the continued demonstration of a very durable, growing business that performs consistently throughout business cycles. 
In addition, we are extending that durability through solid execution of our plan in developed market, identifying and capturing opportunities in both emerging markets and adjacent businesses and continuing to enhance our cost structure in both service and overhead. Our durable storage business generates more than $1.5 billion of annual storage net operating income, which is comparable to that generated by leaders in both the industrial and self-storage sectors. 
What distinguishes our business is its inherent durability and it is this durability that delivers consistent levels of operating performance in good and bad times. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Rod."

I'll begin today with an overview of our first quarter performance, including an update on our transformation initiative and a review of results by segments. Then, I will provide color on the Recall transaction and progress we've made so far in preparing for integration as well as discuss our plans for funding the transaction. 
Let's turn to our worldwide financial results. For the first quarter, reported revenues were $751 million compared with $749 million in 2015. Excluding the year-over-year FX impact of approximately 3.6% or $26 million on a constant dollar basis, revenues grew by 3.8%. 
Total revenues were driven by strong constant dollar storage rental revenue growth of approximately 3.9%. 
Service revenues also performed well in the quarter, up by 3.7%. This was primarily the result of project revenue in North American Records and Information Management and growth in shred revenues, driven by new customer wins. This service revenue growth reflects the mix shift in our business, with service revenues are more heavily weighted towards projects, which can result in more volatility in year-over-year growth rates. 
During the quarter, we saw a reduction in service gross profits and service gross margin. This decline was driven by an increase in medical expenses and severance costs related to our service gross margin initiative. Excluding these costs, service gross margins would've been flat on a year-over-year basis. 
Consistent with prior quarters, we have provided bridging schedules for total revenue, adjusted OIBDA and adjusted earnings per share, which explain key variances in year-on-year performance for the quarter. 
This quarter, we've also added a similar bridge for FFO Bridge. These schedule is on Page 20 through 23 of the supplemental. 
Total adjusted OIBDA for the quarter was $235 million compared to $231 million in 2015. Despite FX headwinds earlier in the year, we grew adjusted OIBDA by 1.7% and by 4.5% on a constant dollar basis, and growth was 7%, if we exclude the $5.7 million of transformation initiative charges we took in the quarter. 
As evidenced by improvements of total adjusted OIBDA margins, we continue to execute on our transformation initiative. As just stated, during this quarter, we incurred roughly $6 million of net charges related to this initiative. 
During Q2 and Q3, prior to any adjustments from Recall, we continue to expect the transformation initiative to be $1 million to $2 million net negative to adjusted OIBDA, with in-quarter costs slightly offsetting benefits. 
In Q4, we expect a net upside of roughly $7 million, providing a strong run rate platform for year-on-year benefits, 2017. 
We continue to expect exit rate savings from actions taken in 2016 of $50 million to, flow through to 2017. Our overall savings outlook for transformation remains consistent with what we laid out on our Investor Day in October, with $125 million of cumulative savings by 2018. 
Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.33 compared to $0.32 in 2015. Excluding the cost for the transformation and after normalizing for the tax rate benefit, adjusted EPS would've grown by roughly 9%. 
Our adjusted OIBDA on an adjusted EPS results for the quarter came in ahead of the phasing expectations we laid out on the February conference call. This OIBDA performance in the first quarter was driven by pulling forward a portion of transformation benefits as well as lower overall G&A expenses, as we delayed certain costs and hires in anticipation of the Recall transaction. In addition, adjusted EPS benefited from a lower tax rate. 
Our structural tax rate for this quarter came out at 14.0%, compared to 16.2% in the prior year. The year-over-year decrease in our structural tax rate was primarily driven by earnings mix skewed more towards our qualified nontaxable entities. 
We continue to believe that our tax rate will be roughly 20% once Recall closes due to their exposure in International markets. 
Normalized funds from operations or FFO per share was $0.51 for the quarter compared to $0.50 in the year-ago period. Excluding the cost associated with the transformation, FFO per share would have grown by roughly 8%. 
Adjusted funds from operations or AFFO was $142 million compared with $128 million in the year-ago period. AFFO is at the high-end of expectations due to the timing of maintenance capital expenses and non-real estate investments, which have typically incurred towards the second half of the year. 
Similar to the prior quarter, on Page 19 of the supplemental, we're providing a reconciliation between AFFO and cash flow from operations, as presented in our GAAP cash flow statement, so you can more readily see the cash items that are not of the typical recurring nature. 
Let's turn to our financial performance by segment. In North American Records and Information Management, or RIM, internal storage rental revenue increased by 0.2% for the first quarter. North American RIM internal service revenue increased by 3.8% due to an increase in project revenue and new customer wins in the shred business, as noted earlier. 
North American RIM adjusted OIBDA margins declined year-over-year, primarily due to increased medical costs and severance charges related to our service margin initiative. 
North American Data Management, or DM, delivered storage rental internal growth of 1.8% for the first quarter. Internal service revenue in DM declined by 6.9%, as we continue to see reductions in the frequency of tape rotation and related transportation activity in the business. 
The high single-digit decline in transportation and handling services was partially offset by mid-single-digit growth in the new data management service offerings and other DM project-related revenue. 
DM adjusted OIBDA margins improved year-over-year due to an increase -- due to decrease in overhead costs, primarily associated with lower G&A expense. 
The Western European segment generated solid results, with 2.1% internal storage rental growth. Internal service revenue growth declined in this segment, primarily as a result of activity declines in retrieved refund in transportation and a relatively weak quarter for projects. 
Adjusted OIBDA margins improved in Western Europe as a result of a decrease in overhead expense, specifically compensation expense. In addition, Western Europe benefited from a one-off real estate tax benefit of roughly $3 million. 
The other International segments, which is made up primarily of emerging markets in Australia, showed strong growth in both storage and service revenues. Storage rental internal growth was 9.6% and service internal growth 11.3% for the quarter. Other International adjusted OIBDA margins were 21% for the quarter, in line with expectations. 
We continue to expect adjusted OIBDA in this segment to deliver profitability on a portfolio basis in the low 20s range in the short-term as we expand our exposure in these fast-growing markets. 
Let me now talk about the Recall acquisition and provide details on the cost that we have incurred so far in 2016. We're working diligently on integration planning as well as preparing to convert portions of Recall's business to our REIT structure. 
As a result of all this hard work, we are well positioned to achieve our synergies quicker in 2016 than we had originally anticipated when we announced the deal back in June of 2015. Our expectations of cost to achieve the deal are still consistent with prior projections. 
In the first quarter, we incurred $7 million of deal-closed cost and $11 million of integration-related cost, bringing the total of Recall costs in Q1 to roughly $18 million in operating expenses. Please note, these expenses are excluded from our adjusted OIBDA calculations, as they are onetime in nature. 
Let's turn to our outlook for 2016 on Page 12 of the supplemental. Business trends and fundamentals remain consistent. We remain on track to achieve our long-term financial objectives given the durability and strong fundamentals of our business. As we noted, our 2016 guidance reflects a partial year benefit from Recall as well as the net synergies we are expecting in 2016. Please note, this is a preliminary view of the combined group and assumes that all divestitures are effective on May 1. We'll continue to refine our estimates and provide updates as necessary, once the transaction is closed. 
Another point about the guidance, as you might expect, even though we're combining our higher-margin business with Recall's slightly lower-margin business, in the near term, adjusted OIBDA margins will be slightly lower and our standalone margins until we realize synergies. 
Lastly, I'd like to note that we are starting to see improvement in foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar, which may potentially add some favorability to our 2016 guidance. The top currencies that have improved since the beginning of the year are the Canadian dollar, euro, Brazilian real and Australian dollar, partially offset by the declines in the British pound. We're continuing to watch these trends closely, and we'll update our guidance once warranted. 
Moving to our expected cash available for distribution investment for 2016, we continue to estimate that it'll be roughly $600 million for 2016. This continues to provide ample dividend coverage and funds our core growth racking investments. Our capital deployment plans remain unchanged. We continue to expect capital expenditures, which include real estate and non-real estate maintenance and non-real estate investment to be in line with the figures we provided on April 1. We expect to send -- spend $70 million in core growth racking and approximately $35 million in the data center business. 
For M&A, our plan continues to be roughly $100 million spend in emerging markets and $50 million in developed markets. We also plan on investing where valued creation is compelling in real estate development consolidation and lease conversions. 
Dividend expectations remain consistent with the guidance we laid out on our Investor Day. Dividend per share is expected to grow in the double digits on average in 2017 and 2018, as we realize the benefits of transformation savings and Recall synergies. Beyond 2018, we expect to grow dividend per share roughly 4% per year. Importantly, the dividend payout ratio, as a percentage of AFFO, is expected to be approximately 78% in 2016 and 70% by 2020, which underscores the strength of our dividend coverage. 
Shifting briefly to the balance sheet, at the year-end, we had liquidity of approximately $650 million, and our lease adjusted debt ratio was 5.7x, as expected. 
We announced last week that we entered into a commitment letter with lenders to provide an unsecured bridge facility of up to $850 million to provide a portion of the financing for the Recall transaction. We expect to enter into definitive loan documentation for the bridge and borrow the full amount on April 29. 
As previously said, we anticipate refinancing the bridge and replenishing capacity on the revolver with long-term debt as soon as practical. 
Overall, we are pleased with the strong performance we saw in the first quarter. Our results are driven by the durability of our business and execution of our 2020 vision. We are excited to begin the integration of Recall in the second quarter and begin to realize meaningful synergies associated with the deal. 
Looking ahead, we believe we are well positioned to deliver on our short-term and long-term goals. We remain focused on extending the durability of our storage rental business, which drives growth and our cash available to fund dividends in core growth investments. 
And with that, I'll hand the call back to Bill."

And before I turn the call back to the operator for questions, let me quickly sum up what you've heard today so far. 
First, this was a very good quarter, and we are headed into the Recall integration from a strong position. Our core storage business performed well and remains extremely durable, a characteristic that has been demonstrated both in good economic conditions as well as through downturns. And if you recall, last year, we finished the year with a 1.5% internal revenue growth rate; i.e., before acquisitions, and our Q1 results showed a 2% internal revenue growth rate, which also compares favorably to the Q1 of last year of 1.4%. So it was a good quarter also in terms of revenue growth. 
Second, we're feeling good about the Recall transaction. Our progress on integration and our ability to derive benefits from scale, which supports additional growth in cash flow. 
And finally, our high-margin business, coupled with our focus on continuous cost control, continues to give us high confidence in our ability to deploy that incremental cash flow into growth investment, deleveraging and near-term double-digit growth in our dividend per share.

And I think what we've -- the main difference, I think we've talked about that on the April 1 call, is we found that we've -- what I would call more capital efficiencies. So 2 areas specifically is we found in terms of maintenance CapEx. We feel very comfortable that Recall's maintenance CapEx will be in line with what we spend on our Mountain's facilities; i.e., around 2.6% of revenue, whereas before, we thought we were going to have to spend more, because they had done a number of acquisitions. So we feel very comfortable based on the integration planning that -- it's kind of a like-for-like integration in terms of level of maintenance CapEx. The other area which we feel very comfortable now, which was an unknown for us, is we had a significant uptick or original budgeting for IT systems, because again, we didn't know if our platforms would be big enough to scale efficiently to absorb all of the Recall operations. And again, we feel very comfortable to see that we still have significant investment to absorb the Recall operations onto our IT platforms, but much more in line that we're taking on, on a company that's 1/4 of our size, rather than one that we would have to rebuild or relaunch major IT systems. So those have been the 2 areas, which I would say a positive surprises that we had on the integration side. But Rod, you may want to comment a little bit more in terms of the guidance."

It's a good question. I think, I understand the question beyond the question, because in some of the markets we highlighted, there are some of the segments we highlighted is that volume was growing faster than revenue, if I understand where your question is coming from. I think the -- I wouldn't read too much into that. I think generally, our guidance is the same that we're achieving inflation or a little bit more than inflation in terms of pricing in each of our markets. So it does look a little bit odd in this quarter that you see in a couple of segments, where we actually achieved higher volume growth and total revenue growth on a storage basis. I think that's more by -- driven by a couple of things. One is that in one of our business lines, we had a major REIT, a very large customer, major renewal. And I think, as we've talked about before, is when we have large customer renewals is you get these sawtooth where at the renewal point is you take a discount and then it climbs up through that period. So there was a little bit of that going on. And then, specifically in Europe, we had a market where we successfully took on a very large public sector customer, which has actually similar pricing in, say, a lot of our other developed markets, but because of the historical volume of some customers just reaching their natural life, for some of the boxes of natural -- customers reaching their natural life going out at the same time. You have a what effectively looks like a dilution effect. But overall, our pricing is -- still continues to track. If we look at it over a 12 or kind of a trailing basis, we expect it to continue to track to be slightly ahead of inflation. So you will see that kind of go back into the normal zone."

And thanks to all the investors and analysts on today's call for your continued support during the process of finalizing our acquisition of Recall. In fact, it was one year ago today that we announced the agreement in principle between our 2 firms. 
As you saw last week, we have now satisfied all conditions for closing, and we'll do so next Monday, Australian time. I cannot say enough good things about the dedication and focus required by -- required and demonstrated by our teams on both sides to get this transaction over the goal line. And I should add, it is this dedication of our teams that has set us up to hit the ground running with integration. I wish to thank my fellow team members for continued focus on the core business by delivering another strong quarter across all metrics, but most importantly, our earnings and cash flow results. 
What does this acquisition mean for Iron Mountain? From a commercial perspective, it enhances our global footprint, both strengthening our existing country presence as well as expanding our reach from 41 countries to 45, and strengthens our ability to reach both global organizations in mid-market businesses looking to benefit from our industry-leading expertise and solutions appropriate for their scale. 
The combined strength of our companies expands our ability to meet customers' information management and storage needs as they face increasing regulation, ongoing security threats and seek to turn information into business value. 
You may remember a video we featured at our Investor Day last fall, with customer stories about the trust they place in us. Today, the stakes have never been higher for organizations of all sizes to ensure their most critical assets are protected and accessible. They see us as their partner protecting what matters, whilst also providing expertise, products and services designed to get the most out of those assets. That trust is a cornerstone of our business. 
A big part of this trust is based not only on our dedication to high-quality service, but it is also derived from confidence our customers have in us to leverage our scale for the kind of innovation that allows us to serve them long into the future. The industrial logic of this deal is undisputable. And from a financial perspective, it enhances our 2020 strategic plan, delivering cash benefits that drive accretion, both on an FFO and an AFFO basis. This in turn supports attractive long-term durable dividend growth, averaging 10% per year through 2018 as the synergies and benefits from transformation begin to flow through, and approximately 4% growth per year annually thereafter through 2020. 
I won't go into the detail of synergies and accretion here, as I believe we covered that thoroughly in the call we hosted on April 1, to announce the conclusion of regulatory reviews in the U.S., Canada and Australia. But I do wish to reiterate that the benefits of the transaction are compelling, consistent with our strategy, and importantly, consistent with our expectations in terms of the financial contribution. 
Now that closing is imminent, the challenging work of integration can begin. We have been refining and advancing integration plans across all functional areas of the combined companies, and it is encouraging to see how well the teams have come together to support the closing and prepare for a smooth combination. We look forward to welcoming Recall's customers, employees and shareholders. 
Turning to Iron Mountain's standalone results, first quarter financial and operating results were strong. Our financial results continued to demonstrate the durability of our core storage rental business. Total revenue growth in constant dollars of roughly 4% was in line with our longer-term expectations, driven by constant dollar growth of 4% in both storage and service. 
Adjusted OIBDA constant dollar growth was about 7%, excluding charges associated with our Transformation Program and service initiative. We see consistent trends in constant dollar storage revenue growth for the remainder of the year, while constant dollar service revenue growth will continue to be a bit lumpy. Even with this lumpiness, we continue to expect positive internal service revenue as well as service gross profit growth for the full year. 
Our results in the first quarter reflect the service revenue mix shift we discussed in recent calls, with declines in transportation and handling-related services, largely offset by growth in shredding, project revenue and DMS, which for Iron Mountain refers to our imaging or scanning businesses. 
We are also beginning to gain some traction with new data management service offerings, such as our Secure IT asset destruction offering and our data domain venture with EMC. You may have also seen that yesterday, we announced a new Iron Mountain cloud archive offering, a cost-effective, near infinitely-scalable repository for organizations needing to protect and preserve data for compliance, legal or value creation purposes. We'll be debuting this new solution at EMC World Conference next week. 
As our mix shift continues, we will focus more on enhancing gross profit rather than gross margins, as these new service offerings are often lower-margin, but still generate attractive returns due to the minimal capital investment required. 
Turning to internal storage revenue, growth of 2.2% for the quarter was in line with the fourth quarter of last year and is compared with a particularly strong quarter in 2015. We continue to expect average storage rental internal growth to be north of 2.5% for the full year. Internal volume growth or net of acquisitions was positive in all segments and consistent with recent quarter's performance at 1.2 -- 1.6% worldwide growth. Total gross volume of records from new and existing customers was roughly 30.5 million cubic feet over the trailing 12 months, also very consistent with what we've seen over the past few years. 
Turning to progress on our strategic plan, during the quarter, we continued to advance each of the 3 pillars of the plan as well as in the foundational elements that support it. Let me briefly highlight progress in each of the 3 pillars, namely getting the most out of our developed markets; expanding our presence in the fast-growing emerging markets; and expansion in faster growing adjacent businesses. 
In developed markets, we achieved consistent performance from North America RIM, with positive internal storage and volume growth, whilst North American data management and our Western Europe segment both generated internal volume growth of roughly 3% and total internal revenue growth of about 2%. 
In emerging markets, our goal is to expand our presence and leverage our scale, driving these markets to 20% of our total revenue by 2020. Recall footprint in Southeast Asia will support that objective, but prior to the combination, we already have driven our emerging market business to 15% of total revenue on a constant dollar basis as of the end of Q1. 
During the quarter, we continue to achieve total internal revenue growth in these markets of 10%, with internal volume growth of 7%. Additionally, as our visibility on closing of the Recall transaction became clear, we resumed acquisition activity, moving into 2 new emerging markets during the quarter. We acquired a 75% interest in the largest privately-owned and the #2 overall records management company in South Africa, a company with more than 2 million cubic feet of storage and a range of offering similar to ours. 
We also acquired a Lithuanian-based document storage and archiving firm during the quarter, expanding our presence into 3 new countries in the Baltics with the acquisition of this market leader. 
With these acquisitions, we expand our global reach and now operate in 41 countries on 6 continents. But it's not about putting pins in the map. It's about leveraging our global footprint, and capturing the first wave of records management outsourcing occurring in these faster growing markets. 
As we noted last quarter, we did see the carryover of the large single customer destruction in our Other International segment, which drove destructions up to 4.2% in this segment, in line with what we saw last quarter. Again, we do not see any other such unusual destructions on the horizon and expect that the remainder of the year, we'll return to more typical levels of less than 4%. We do report volume change on a trailing 12-month basis, and therefore, this level will remain slightly elevated over the next few quarters. 
As for adjacent businesses, we are on track to achieve our stated goal to generate 5% of our total worldwide revenue from adjacent businesses by the end of 2020, up from just 2% at the end of 2015. You can now see a full quarter's contribution from Crozier Fine Arts acquired last December, which is performing in line with our expectations. 
Additionally, you may have noted our plans to expand our data center business into Northern Virginia, North America's largest data center market. Northern Virginia is also home to federal government data centers and large cloud data centers owned by the major data center REITs. 
During Q2, we plan to resell this land to an industrial developer, who will undertake land development and shell construction, whilst we focus on expanding our data center product offering in this highly desirable location. We are early in the planning for this multiyear, multi-phased project. Whilst we are not yet sharing specific projections, we wanted to share our plans and provide some insight into one of the ways in which we are able to strategically fund our growth opportunities. 
The result is that whilst we will achieve slightly lower margins through this approach to funding, the impact on our balance sheet has improved and our stabilized ROIC is similar to that of data centers we own outright. 
To sum up, we are well on track to achieve our combined goal of having the expansion of our emerging market presence and adjacent businesses yield 25% of our total revenue mix by 2020, with internal growth rates in the 10% plus range, which is up from a little over 17% of our business mix today. 
I should also add, we continue to make progress on our transformation initiatives. Actions in 2015 resulted in run rate savings of $50 million, which is visible in a 120-basis-point improvement in year-over-year OIBDA margins this quarter, after adjusting for transformation. 
We have undertaken additional action in the first quarter that support the additional $50 million of savings we expect to achieve by year-end 2016. 
We incurred total charges of $5.7 million in the quarter related to these actions, and we're able to pull forward a bit of the run rate savings that contributed to our strong performance this quarter. 
Also as previously disclosed, the remainder of the total $125 million of overhead savings will be actioned in 2017, and the full amount for the transformation program will be reflected in our 2018 adjusted OIBDA. 
The all-important cash flow result for both today and growth into the future is in line with the growth expectations we highlighted during Investor Day, and again on our April 1 call, and continues to provide the foundation for our expected dividend growth. We also updated the high-level goals associated with our 2020 plan. What we've communicated is that we continue to expect to achieve similar top line and adjusted OIBDA compound annual growth. We also expect to generate similar levels of cash available to grow the dividend by an average of about 10% per year through 2018 and 4% annual growth thereafter, fund organic growth racking investment and increase the amount of remaining cash available to support discretionary investment. And we will do so whilst both reducing our payout ratio as a percentage of AFFO and deleveraging. 
We expect to fund additional growth through debt financing in amounts that allows us to continue to delever the business on a debt-to-EBITDA basis. 
Our expectations are underpinned by the continued demonstration of a very durable, growing business that performs consistently throughout business cycles. 
In addition, we are extending that durability through solid execution of our plan in developed market, identifying and capturing opportunities in both emerging markets and adjacent businesses and continuing to enhance our cost structure in both service and overhead. Our durable storage business generates more than $1.5 billion of annual storage net operating income, which is comparable to that generated by leaders in both the industrial and self-storage sectors. 
What distinguishes our business is its inherent durability and it is this durability that delivers consistent levels of operating performance in good and bad times. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Rod."

I'll begin today with an overview of our first quarter performance, including an update on our transformation initiative and a review of results by segments.

I'll begin today with an overview of our first quarter performance, including an update on our transformation initiative and a review of results by segments. Then, I will provide color on the Recall transaction and progress we've made so far in preparing for integration as well as discuss our plans for funding the transaction. 
Let's turn to our worldwide financial results. For the first quarter, reported revenues were $751 million compared with $749 million in 2015. Excluding the year-over-year FX impact of approximately 3.6% or $26 million on a constant dollar basis, revenues grew by 3.8%. 
Total revenues were driven by strong constant dollar storage rental revenue growth of approximately 3.9%. 
Service revenues also performed well in the quarter, up by 3.7%. This was primarily the result of project revenue in North American Records and Information Management and growth in shred revenues, driven by new customer wins. This service revenue growth reflects the mix shift in our business, with service revenues are more heavily weighted towards projects, which can result in more volatility in year-over-year growth rates. 
During the quarter, we saw a reduction in service gross profits and service gross margin. This decline was driven by an increase in medical expenses and severance costs related to our service gross margin initiative. Excluding these costs, service gross margins would've been flat on a year-over-year basis. 
Consistent with prior quarters, we have provided bridging schedules for total revenue, adjusted OIBDA and adjusted earnings per share, which explain key variances in year-on-year performance for the quarter. 
This quarter, we've also added a similar bridge for FFO Bridge. These schedule is on Page 20 through 23 of the supplemental. 
Total adjusted OIBDA for the quarter was $235 million compared to $231 million in 2015. Despite FX headwinds earlier in the year, we grew adjusted OIBDA by 1.7% and by 4.5% on a constant dollar basis, and growth was 7%, if we exclude the $5.7 million of transformation initiative charges we took in the quarter. 
As evidenced by improvements of total adjusted OIBDA margins, we continue to execute on our transformation initiative. As just stated, during this quarter, we incurred roughly $6 million of net charges related to this initiative. 
During Q2 and Q3, prior to any adjustments from Recall, we continue to expect the transformation initiative to be $1 million to $2 million net negative to adjusted OIBDA, with in-quarter costs slightly offsetting benefits. 
In Q4, we expect a net upside of roughly $7 million, providing a strong run rate platform for year-on-year benefits, 2017. 
We continue to expect exit rate savings from actions taken in 2016 of $50 million to flow through to 2017. Our overall savings outlook for transformation remains consistent with what we laid out on our Investor Day in October, with $125 million of cumulative savings by 2018. 
Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.33 compared to $0.32 in 2015. Excluding the cost for the transformation and after normalizing for the tax rate benefit, adjusted EPS would've grown by roughly 9%. 
Our adjusted OIBDA on an adjusted EPS results for the quarter came in ahead of the phasing expectations we laid out on the February conference call. This OIBDA performance in the first quarter was driven by pulling forward a portion of transformation benefits as well as lower overall G&A expenses, as we delayed certain costs and hires in anticipation of the Recall transaction. In addition, adjusted EPS benefited from a lower tax rate. 
Our structural tax rate for this quarter came out at 14.0%, compared to 16.2% in the prior year. The year-over-year decrease in our structural tax rate was primarily driven by earnings mix skewed more towards our qualified nontaxable entities. 
We continue to believe that our tax rate will be roughly 20% once Recall closes due to their exposure in International markets. 
Normalized funds from operations or FFO per share was $0.51 for the quarter compared to $0.50 in the year-ago period. Excluding the cost associated with the transformation, FFO per share would have grown by roughly 8%. 
Adjusted funds from operations or AFFO was $142 million compared with $128 million in the year-ago period. AFFO is at the high-end of expectations due to the timing of maintenance capital expenses and non-real estate investments, which have typically incurred towards the second half of the year. 
Similar to the prior quarter, on Page 19 of the supplemental, we're providing a reconciliation between AFFO and cash flow from operations, as presented in our GAAP cash flow statement, so you can more readily see the cash items that are not of the typical recurring nature. 
Let's turn to our financial performance by segment. In North American Records and Information Management, or RIM, internal storage rental revenue increased by 0.2% for the first quarter. North American RIM internal service revenue increased by 3.8% due to an increase in project revenue and new customer wins in the shred business, as noted earlier. 
North American RIM adjusted OIBDA margins declined year-over-year, primarily due to increased medical costs and severance charges related to our service margin initiative. 
North American Data Management, or DM, delivered storage rental internal growth of 1.8% for the first quarter. Internal service revenue in DM declined by 6.9%, as we continue to see reductions in the frequency of tape rotation and related transportation activity in the business. 
The high single-digit decline in transportation and handling services was partially offset by mid-single-digit growth in the new data management service offerings and other DM project-related revenue. 
DM adjusted OIBDA margins improved year-over-year due to an increase -- due to decrease in overhead costs, primarily associated with lower G&A expense. 
The Western European segment generated solid results, with 2.1% internal storage rental growth. Internal service revenue growth declined in this segment, primarily as a result of activity declines in retrieved refile in transportation and a relatively weak quarter for projects. 
Adjusted OIBDA margins improved in Western Europe as a result of a decrease in overhead expense, specifically compensation expense. In addition, Western Europe benefited from a one-off real estate tax benefit of roughly $3 million. 
The other International segments, which is made up primarily of emerging markets in Australia, showed strong growth in both storage and service revenues. Storage rental internal growth was 9.6% and service internal growth 11.3% for the quarter. Other International adjusted OIBDA margins were 21% for the quarter, in line with expectations. 
We continue to expect adjusted OIBDA in this segment to deliver profitability on a portfolio basis in the low 20s range in the short-term as we expand our exposure in these fast-growing markets. 
Let me now talk about the Recall acquisition and provide details on the cost that we have incurred so far in 2016. We're working diligently on integration planning as well as preparing to convert portions of Recall's business to our REIT structure. 
As a result of all this hard work, we are well positioned to achieve our synergies quicker in 2016 than we had originally anticipated when we announced the deal back in June of 2015. Our expectations of cost to achieve the deal are still consistent with prior projections. 
In the first quarter, we incurred $7 million of deal-closed cost and $11 million of integration-related cost, bringing the total of Recall costs in Q1 to roughly $18 million in operating expenses. Please note, these expenses are excluded from our adjusted OIBDA calculations, as they are onetime in nature. 
Let's turn to our outlook for 2016 on Page 12 of the supplemental. Business trends and fundamentals remain consistent. We remain on track to achieve our long-term financial objectives given the durability and strong fundamentals of our business. As we noted, our 2016 guidance reflects a partial year benefit from Recall as well as the net synergies we are expecting in 2016. Please note, this is a preliminary view of the combined group and assumes that all divestitures are effective on May 1. We'll continue to refine our estimates and provide updates as necessary, once the transaction is closed. 
Another point about the guidance, as you might expect, given that we're combining our higher-margin business with Recall's slightly lower-margin business, in the near term, adjusted OIBDA margins will be slightly lower and our standalone margins until we realize synergies. 
Lastly, I'd like to note that we are starting to see improvement in foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar, which may potentially add some favorability to our 2016 guidance. The top currencies that have improved since the beginning of the year are the Canadian dollar, euro, Brazilian real and Australian dollar, partially offset by the declines in the British pound. We're continuing to watch these trends closely, and we'll update our guidance once warranted. 
Moving to our expected cash available for distribution investment for 2016, we continue to estimate that it'll be roughly $600 million for 2016. This continues to provide ample dividend coverage and funds our core growth racking investments. Our capital deployment plans remain unchanged. We continue to expect capital expenditures, which include real estate and non-real estate maintenance and non-real estate investment to be in line with the figures we provided on April 1. We expect to send -- spend $70 million in core growth racking and approximately $35 million in the data center business. 
For M&A, our plan continues to be roughly $100 million spend in emerging markets and $50 million in developed markets. We also plan on investing where valued creation is compelling in real estate development consolidation and lease conversions. 
Dividend expectations remain consistent with the guidance we laid out on our Investor Day. Dividend per share is expected to grow in the double digits on average in 2017 and 2018, as we realize the benefits of transformation savings and Recall synergies. Beyond 2018, we expect to grow dividend per share roughly 4% per year. Importantly, the dividend payout ratio, as a percentage of AFFO, is expected to be approximately 78% in 2016 and 70% by 2020, which underscores the strength of our dividend coverage. 
Shifting briefly to the balance sheet, at the year-end, we had liquidity of approximately $650 million, and our lease adjusted debt ratio was 5.7x, as expected. 
We announced last week that we entered into a commitment letter with lenders to provide an unsecured bridge facility of up to $850 million to provide a portion of the financing for the Recall transaction. We expect to enter into definitive loan documentation for the bridge and borrow the full amount on April 29. 
As previously said, we anticipate refinancing the bridge and replenishing capacity on the revolver with long-term debt as soon as practical. 
Overall, we are pleased with the strong performance we saw in the first quarter. Our results are driven by the durability of our business and execution of our 2020 vision. We are excited to begin the integration of Recall in the second quarter and begin to realize meaningful synergies associated with the deal. 
Looking ahead, we believe we are well positioned to deliver on our short-term and long-term goals. We remain focused on extending the durability of our storage rental business, which drives growth and our cash available to fund dividends in core growth investments. 
And with that, I'll hand the call back to Bill."

First, this was a very good quarter, and we are headed into the Recall integration from a strong position. Our core storage business performed well and remains extremely durable, a characteristic that has been demonstrated both in good economic conditions as well as through downturns. And if you recall, last year, we finished the year with a 1.5% internal revenue growth rate; i.e., before acquisitions, and our Q1 results showed a 2% internal revenue growth rate, which also compares favorably to the Q1 of last year of 1.4%. So it was a good quarter also in terms of revenue growth. 
Second, we're feeling good about the Recall transaction. Our progress on integration and our ability to derive benefits from scale, which supports additional growth in cash flow.

I mean, it's -- as I think I've said a few times, it's -- on the records management side, we have seen a flattening out, but on the tape, it's a little bit behind the curve. What's encouraging is that we see high single-digit, low double-digit quarter declines in the -- what I would call the transportation or rotating the tapes, as you say, part of the service business. But we see mid-single-digit growth in those new services, which is what allows us to offset the rate of decline. So we do see -- albeit off a small base, but we do see significant impact in terms of growth at some of these new service offerings, like the service offering I highlighted on the call with EMC."

But I think I'll just touch a bit upon your last -- the last part of your question in terms of what we found through the integration planning with Recall. And I think what we've -- the main difference, I think we've talked about that on the April 1 call, is we found that we've -- what I would call more capital efficiencies. So 2 areas specifically is we found in terms of maintenance CapEx. We feel very comfortable that Recall's maintenance CapEx will be in line with what we spend on Iron Mountain's facilities; i.e., around 2.6% of revenue, whereas before, we thought we were going to have to spend more, because they had done a number of acquisitions. So we feel very comfortable based on the integration planning that -- it's kind of a like-for-like integration in terms of level of maintenance CapEx. The other area which we feel very comfortable now, which was an unknown for us, is we had a significant uptick or original budgeting for IT systems, because again, we didn't know if our platforms would be big enough to scale efficiently to absorb all of the Recall operations. And again, we feel very comfortable. So you'll see that we still have significant investment to absorb the Recall operations onto our IT platforms, but much more in line that we're taking on, on a company that's 1/4 of our size, rather than one that we would have to rebuild or relaunch major IT systems. So those have been the 2 areas, which I would say are positive surprises that we had on the integration side. But Rod, you may want to comment a little bit more in terms of the guidance."

And the second is, we took some severance costs in a number of our services businesses as part of an sort of ongoing program to drive longer-term improvements in margin. And that has an impact of 0.6%. There's a small other component, which has to do with some vacation accruals.

So as we -- to plant some of that revenue loss with new service initiatives, many of those have a lower margin, but they also have lower capital associated with them so similar returns.

I think, I understand the question behind the question, because in some of the markets we highlighted, or some of the segments we highlighted is that volume was growing faster than revenue, if I understand where your question is coming from. I think the -- I wouldn't read too much into that. I think generally, our guidance is the same that we're achieving inflation or a little bit more than inflation in terms of pricing in each of our markets. So it does look a little bit odd in this quarter that you see in a couple of segments, where we actually achieved higher volume growth and total revenue growth on a storage basis. I think that's more by -- driven by a couple of things. One is that in one of our business lines, we had a major REIT, a very large customer, major renewal. And I think, as we've talked about before, is when we have large customer renewals is you get these sawtooth where at the renewal point is you take a discount and then it climbs up through that period. So there was a little bit of that going on. And then, specifically in Europe, we had a market where we successfully took on a very large public sector customer, which has actually similar pricing in, say, a lot of our other developed markets, but because of the historical volume of some customers just reaching their natural life, for some of the boxes of natural -- customers reaching their natural life going out at the same time. You have a what effectively looks like a dilution effect. But overall, our pricing is -- still continues to track. If we look at it over a 12 or kind of a trailing basis, we expect it to continue to track to be slightly ahead of inflation. So you will see that kind of go back into the normal zone."

And thanks to all the investors and analysts on today's call for your continued support during the process of finalizing our acquisition of Recall. In fact, it was one year ago today that we announced the agreement in principle between our 2 firms. 
As you saw last week, we have now satisfied all conditions for closing, and we'll do so next Monday, Australian time. I cannot say enough good things about the dedication and focus required by -- required and demonstrated by our teams on both sides to get this transaction over the goal line. And I should add, it is this dedication of our teams that has set us up to hit the ground running with integration. I wish to thank my fellow team members for continued focus on the core business by delivering another strong quarter across all metrics, but most importantly, our earnings and cash flow results. 
What does this acquisition mean for Iron Mountain? From a commercial perspective, it enhances our global footprint, both strengthening our existing country presence as well as expanding our reach from 41 countries to 45, and strengthens our ability to reach both global organizations in mid-market businesses looking to benefit from our industry-leading expertise and solutions appropriate for their scale. 
The combined strength of our companies expands our ability to meet customers' information management and storage needs as they face increasing regulation, ongoing security threats and seek to turn information into business value. 
You may remember a video we featured at our Investor Day last fall, with customer stories about the trust they place in us. Today, the stakes have never been higher for organizations of all sizes to ensure their most critical assets are protected and accessible. They see us as their partner protecting what matters, whilst also providing expertise, products and services designed to get the most out of those assets. That trust is a cornerstone of our business. 
A big part of this trust is based not only on our dedication to high-quality service, but it is also derived from confidence our customers have in us to leverage our scale for the kind of innovation that allows us to serve them long into the future. The industrial logic of this deal is undisputable. And from a financial perspective, it enhances our 2020 strategic plan, delivering cash benefits that drive accretion, both on an FFO and an AFFO basis. This in turn supports attractive long-term durable dividend growth, averaging 10% per year through 2018 as the synergies and benefits from transformation begin to flow through, and approximately 4% growth per year annually thereafter through 2020. 
I won't go into the detail of synergies and accretion here, as I believe we covered that thoroughly in the call we hosted on April 1, to announce the conclusion of regulatory reviews in the U.S., Canada and Australia. But I do wish to reiterate that the benefits of the transaction are compelling, consistent with our strategy, and importantly, consistent with our expectations in terms of the financial contribution. 
Now that closing is imminent, the challenging work of integration can begin. We have been refining and advancing integration plans across all functional areas of the combined companies, and it is encouraging to see how well the teams have come together to support the closing and prepare for a smooth combination. We look forward to welcoming Recall's customers, employees and shareholders. 
Turning to Iron Mountain's standalone results, first quarter financial and operating results were strong. Our financial results continued to demonstrate the durability of our core storage rental business. Total revenue growth in constant dollars of roughly 4% was in line with our longer-term expectations, driven by constant dollar growth of 4% in both storage and service. 
Adjusted OIBDA constant dollar growth was about 7%, excluding charges associated with our Transformation Program and service initiative. We see consistent trends in constant dollar storage revenue growth for the remainder of the year, while constant dollar service revenue growth will continue to be a bit lumpy. Even with this lumpiness, we continue to expect positive internal service revenue as well as service gross profit growth for the full year. 
Our results in the first quarter reflect the service revenue mix shift we discussed in recent calls, with declines in transportation and handling-related services, largely offset by growth in shredding, project revenue and DMS, which for Iron Mountain refers to our imaging or scanning businesses. 
We are also beginning to gain some traction with new data management service offerings, such as our Secure IT asset destruction offering and our data domain venture with EMC. You may have also seen that yesterday, we announced a new Iron Mountain cloud archive offering, a cost-effective, near infinitely-scalable repository for organizations needing to protect and preserve data for compliance, legal or value creation purposes. We'll be debuting this new solution at EMC World Conference next week. 
As our mix shift continues, we will focus more on enhancing gross profit rather than gross margins, as these new service offerings are often lower-margin, but still generate attractive returns due to the minimal capital investment required. 
Turning to internal storage revenue, growth of 2.2% for the quarter was in line with the fourth quarter of last year and is compared with a particularly strong quarter in 2015. We continue to expect average storage rental internal growth to be north of 2.5% for the full year. Internal volume growth or net of acquisitions was positive in all segments and consistent with recent quarter's performance at 1.2 -- 1.6% worldwide growth. Total gross volume of records from new and existing customers was roughly 30.5 million cubic feet over the trailing 12 months, also very consistent with what we've seen over the past few years. 
Turning to progress on our strategic plan, during the quarter, we continued to advance each of the 3 pillars of the plan as well as in the foundational elements that support it. Let me briefly highlight progress in each of the 3 pillars, namely getting the most out of our developed markets; expanding our presence in the fast-growing emerging markets; and expansion in faster growing adjacent businesses. 
In developed markets, we achieved consistent performance from North America RIM, with positive internal storage and volume growth, whilst North American data management and our Western Europe segment both generated internal volume growth of roughly 3% and total internal revenue growth of about 2%. 
In emerging markets, our goal is to expand our presence and leverage our scale, driving these markets to 20% of our total revenue by 2020. Recall footprint in Southeast Asia will support that objective, but prior to the combination, we already have driven our emerging market business to 15% of total revenue on a constant dollar basis as of the end of Q1. 
During the quarter, we continue to achieve total internal revenue growth in these markets of 10%, with internal volume growth of 7%. Additionally, as our visibility on closing of the Recall transaction became clear, we resumed acquisition activity, moving into 2 new emerging markets during the quarter. We acquired a 75% interest in the largest privately-owned and the #2 overall records management company in South Africa, a company with more than 2 million cubic feet of storage and a range of offering similar to ours. 
We also acquired a Lithuanian-based document storage and archiving firm during the quarter, expanding our presence into 3 new countries in the Baltics with the acquisition of this market leader. 
With these acquisitions, we expand our global reach and now operate in 41 countries on 6 continents. But it's not about putting pins in the map. It's about leveraging our global footprint, and capturing the first wave of records management outsourcing occurring in these faster growing markets. 
As we noted last quarter, we did see the carryover of the large single customer destruction in our Other International segment, which drove destructions up to 4.2% in this segment, in line with what we saw last quarter. Again, we do not see any other such unusual destructions on the horizon and expect that the remainder of the year, we'll return to more typical levels of less than 4%. We do report volume change on a trailing 12-month basis, and therefore, this level will remain slightly elevated over the next few quarters. 
As for adjacent businesses, we are on track to achieve our stated goal to generate 5% of our total worldwide revenue from adjacent businesses by the end of 2020, up from just 2% at the end of 2015. You can now see a full quarter's contribution from Crozier Fine Arts acquired last December, which is performing in line with our expectations. 
Additionally, you may have noted our plans to expand our data center business into Northern Virginia, North America's largest data center market. Northern Virginia is also home to federal government data centers and large cloud data centers owned by the major data center REITs. 
During Q2, we plan to resell this land to an industrial developer, who will undertake land development and shell construction, whilst we focus on expanding our data center product offering in this highly desirable location. We are early in the planning for this multiyear, multi-phased project. Whilst we are not yet sharing specific projections, we wanted to share our plans and provide some insight into one of the ways in which we are able to strategically fund our growth opportunities. 
The result is that whilst we will achieve slightly lower margins through this approach to funding, the impact on our balance sheet has improved and our stabilized ROIC is similar to that of data centers we own outright. 
To sum up, we are well on track to achieve our combined goal of having the expansion of our emerging market presence and adjacent businesses yield 25% of our total revenue mix by 2020, with internal growth rates in the 10% plus range, which is up from a little over 17% of our business mix today. 
I should also add, we continue to make progress on our transformation initiatives. Actions in 2015 resulted in run rate savings of $50 million, which is visible in a 120-basis-point improvement in year-over-year OIBDA margins this quarter, after adjusting for transformation. 
We have undertaken additional action in the first quarter that support the additional $50 million of savings we expect to achieve by year-end 2016. 
We incurred total charges of $5.7 million in the quarter related to these actions, and we're able to pull forward a bit of the run rate savings that contributed to our strong performance this quarter. 
Also as previously disclosed, the remainder of the total $125 million of overhead savings will be actioned in 2017, and the full amount for the transformation program will be reflected in our 2018 adjusted OIBDA. 
The all-important cash flow result for both today and growth into the future is in line with the growth expectations we highlighted during Investor Day, and again on our April 1 call, and continues to provide the foundation for our expected dividend growth. We also updated the high-level goals associated with our 2020 plan. What we've communicated is that we continue to expect to achieve similar top line and adjusted OIBDA compound annual growth. We also expect to generate similar levels of cash available to grow the dividend by an average of about 10% per year through 2018 and 4% annual growth thereafter, fund organic growth racking investment and increase the amount of remaining cash available to support discretionary investment. And we will do so whilst both reducing our payout ratio as a percentage of AFFO and deleveraging. 
We expect to fund additional growth through debt financing in amounts that allows us to continue to delever the business on a debt-to-EBITDA basis. 
Our expectations are underpinned by the continued demonstration of a very durable, growing business that performs consistently throughout business cycles. 
In addition, we are extending that durability through solid execution of our plan in developed market, identifying and capturing opportunities in both emerging markets and adjacent businesses and continuing to enhance our cost structure in both service and overhead. Our durable storage business generates more than $1.5 billion of annual storage net operating income, which is comparable to that generated by leaders in both the industrial and self-storage sectors. 
What distinguishes our business is its inherent durability and it is this durability that delivers consistent levels of operating performance in good and bad times. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Rod."

I'll begin today with an overview of our first quarter performance, including an update on our transformation initiative and a review of results by segments. Then, I will provide color on the Recall transaction and progress we've made so far",1874,"Thanks, Bill. I'll begin today with an overview of our first quarter performance, including an update on our transformation initiative and a review of results by segments. Then, I will provide color on the Recall transaction and progress we've made so far in preparing for integration as well as discuss our plans for funding the transaction. 
Let's turn to our worldwide financial results. For the first quarter, reported revenues were $751 million compared with $749 million in 2015. Excluding the year-over-year FX impact of approximately 3.6% or $26 million on a constant dollar basis, revenues grew by 3.8%. 
Total revenues were driven by strong constant dollar storage rental revenue growth of approximately 3.9%. 
Service revenues also performed well in the quarter, up by 3.7%. This was primarily the result of project revenue in North American Records and Information Management and growth in shred revenues, driven by new customer wins. This service revenue growth reflects the mix shift in our business, with service revenues are more heavily weighted towards projects, which can result in more volatility in year-over-year growth rates. 
During the quarter, we saw a reduction in service gross profits and service gross margin. This decline was driven by an increase in medical expenses and severance costs related to our service gross margin initiative. Excluding these costs, service gross margins would've been flat on a year-over-year basis. 
Consistent with prior quarters, we have provided bridging schedules for total revenue, adjusted OIBDA and adjusted earnings per share, which explain key variances in year-on-year performance for the quarter. 
This quarter, we've also added a similar bridge for FFO Bridge. These schedule is on Page 20 through 23 of the supplemental. 
Total adjusted OIBDA for the quarter was $235 million compared to $231 million in 2015. Despite FX headwinds earlier in the year, we grew adjusted OIBDA by 1.7% and by 4.5% on a constant dollar basis, and growth was 7%, if we exclude the $5.7 million of transformation initiative charges we took in the quarter. 
As evidenced by improvements of total adjusted OIBDA margins, we continue to execute on our transformation initiative. As just stated, during this quarter, we incurred roughly $6 million of net charges related to this initiative. 
During Q2 and Q3, prior to any adjustments from Recall, we continue to expect the transformation initiative to be $1 million to $2 million net negative to adjusted OIBDA, with in-quarter costs slightly offsetting benefits. 
In Q4, we expect a net upside of roughly $7 million, providing a strong run rate platform for year-on-year benefits, 2017. 
We continue to expect exit rate savings from actions taken in 2016 of $50 million to flow through to 2017. Our overall savings outlook for transformation remains consistent with what we laid out on our Investor Day in October, with $125 million of cumulative savings by 2018. 
Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.33 compared to $0.32 in 2015. Excluding the cost for the transformation and after normalizing for the tax rate benefit, adjusted EPS would've grown by roughly 9%. 
Our adjusted OIBDA on an adjusted EPS results for the quarter came in ahead of the phasing expectations we laid out on the February conference call. This OIBDA performance in the first quarter was driven by pulling forward a portion of transformation benefits as well as lower overall G&A expenses, as we delayed certain costs and hires in anticipation of the Recall transaction. In addition, adjusted EPS benefited from a lower tax rate. 
Our structural tax rate for this quarter came out at 14.0%, compared to 16.2% in the prior year. The year-over-year decrease in our structural tax rate was primarily driven by earnings mix skewed more towards our qualified nontaxable entities. 
We continue to believe that our tax rate will be roughly 20% once Recall closes due to their exposure in International markets. 
Normalized funds from operations or FFO per share was $0.51 for the quarter compared to $0.50 in the year-ago period. Excluding the cost associated with the transformation, FFO per share would have grown by roughly 8%. 
Adjusted funds from operations or AFFO was $142 million compared with $128 million in the year-ago period. AFFO is at the high-end of expectations due to the timing of maintenance capital expenses and non-real estate investments, which have typically incurred towards the second half of the year. 
Similar to the prior quarter, on Page 19 of the supplemental, we're providing a reconciliation between AFFO and cash flow from operations, as presented in our GAAP cash flow statement, so you can more readily see the cash items that are not of the typical recurring nature. 
Let's turn to our financial performance by segment. In North American Records and Information Management, or RIM, internal storage rental revenue increased by 0.2% for the first quarter. North American RIM internal service revenue increased by 3.8% due to an increase in project revenue and new customer wins in the shred business, as noted earlier. 
North American RIM adjusted OIBDA margins declined year-over-year, primarily due to increased medical costs and severance charges related to our service margin initiative. 
North American Data Management, or DM, delivered storage rental internal growth of 1.8% for the first quarter. Internal service revenue in DM declined by 6.9%, as we continue to see reductions in the frequency of tape rotation and related transportation activity in the business. 
The high single-digit decline in transportation and handling services was partially offset by mid-single-digit growth in the new data management service offerings and other DM project-related revenue. 
DM adjusted OIBDA margins improved year-over-year due to an increase -- due to decrease in overhead costs, primarily associated with lower G&A expense. 
The Western European segment generated solid results, with 2.1% internal storage rental growth. Internal service revenue growth declined in this segment, primarily as a result of activity declines in retrieved refile in transportation and a relatively weak quarter for projects. 
Adjusted OIBDA margins improved in Western Europe as a result of a decrease in overhead expense, specifically compensation expense. In addition, Western Europe benefited from a one-off real estate tax benefit of roughly $3 million. 
The other International segments, which is made up primarily of emerging markets in Australia, showed strong growth in both storage and service revenues. Storage rental internal growth was 9.6% and service internal growth 11.3% for the quarter. Other International adjusted OIBDA margins were 21% for the quarter, in line with expectations. 
We continue to expect adjusted OIBDA in this segment to deliver profitability on a portfolio basis in the low 20s range in the short-term as we expand our exposure in these fast-growing markets. 
Let me now talk about the Recall acquisition and provide details on the cost that we have incurred so far in 2016. We're working diligently on integration planning as well as preparing to convert portions of Recall's business to our REIT structure. 
As a result of all this hard work, we are well positioned to achieve our synergies quicker in 2016 than we had originally anticipated when we announced the deal back in June of 2015. Our expectations of cost to achieve the deal are still consistent with prior projections. 
In the first quarter, we incurred $7 million of deal-closed cost and $11 million of integration-related cost, bringing the total of Recall costs in Q1 to roughly $18 million in operating expenses. Please note, these expenses are excluded from our adjusted OIBDA calculations, as they are onetime in nature. 
Let's turn to our outlook for 2016 on Page 12 of the supplemental. Business trends and fundamentals remain consistent. We remain on track to achieve our long-term financial objectives given the durability and strong fundamentals of our business. As we noted, our 2016 guidance reflects a partial year benefit from Recall as well as the net synergies we are expecting in 2016. Please note, this is a preliminary view of the combined group and assumes that all divestitures are effective on May 1. We'll continue to refine our estimates and provide updates as necessary, once the transaction is closed. 
Another point about the guidance, as you might expect, given that we're combining our higher-margin business with Recall's slightly lower-margin business, in the near term, adjusted OIBDA margins will be slightly lower and our standalone margins until we realize synergies. 
Lastly, I'd like to note that we are starting to see improvement in foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar, which may potentially add some favorability to our 2016 guidance. The top currencies that have improved since the beginning of the year are the Canadian dollar, euro, Brazilian real and Australian dollar, partially offset by the declines in the British pound. We're continuing to watch these trends closely, and we'll update our guidance once warranted. 
Moving to our expected cash available for distribution investment for 2016, we continue to estimate that it'll be roughly $600 million for 2016. This continues to provide ample dividend coverage and funds our core growth racking investments. Our capital deployment plans remain unchanged. We continue to expect capital expenditures, which include real estate and non-real estate maintenance and non-real estate investment to be in line with the figures we provided on April 1. We expect to send -- spend $70 million in core growth racking and approximately $35 million in the data center business. 
For M&A, our plan continues to be roughly $100 million spend in emerging markets and $50 million in developed markets. We also plan on investing where valued creation is compelling in real estate development consolidation and lease conversions. 
Dividend expectations remain consistent with the guidance we laid out on our Investor Day. Dividend per share is expected to grow in the double digits on average in 2017 and 2018, as we realize the benefits of transformation savings and Recall synergies. Beyond 2018, we expect to grow dividend per share roughly 4% per year. Importantly, the dividend payout ratio, as a percentage of AFFO, is expected to be approximately 78% in 2016 and 70% by 2020, which underscores the strength of our dividend coverage. 
Shifting briefly to the balance sheet, at the year-end, we had liquidity of approximately $650 million, and our lease adjusted debt ratio was 5.7x, as expected. 
We announced last week that we entered into a commitment letter with lenders to provide an unsecured bridge facility of up to $850 million to provide a portion of the financing for the Recall transaction. We expect to enter into definitive loan documentation for the bridge and borrow the full amount on April 29. 
As previously said, we anticipate refinancing the bridge and replenishing capacity on the revolver with long-term debt as soon as practical. 
Overall, we are pleased with the strong performance we saw in the first quarter. Our results are driven by the durability of our business and execution of our 2020 vision. We are excited to begin the integration of Recall in the second quarter and begin to realize meaningful synergies associated with the deal. 
Looking ahead, we believe we are well positioned to deliver on our short-term and long-term goals. We remain focused on extending the durability of our storage rental business, which drives growth and our cash available to fund dividends in core growth investments. 
And with that, I'll hand the call back to Bill."

And before I turn the call back to the operator for questions, let me quickly sum up what you've heard today so far. 
First, this was a very good quarter, and we are headed into the Recall integration from a strong position. Our core storage business performed well and remains extremely durable, a characteristic that has been demonstrated both in good economic conditions as well as through downturns. And if you recall, last year, we finished the year with a 1.5% internal revenue growth rate; i.e., before acquisitions, and our Q1 results showed a 2% internal revenue growth rate, which also compares favorably to the Q1 of last year of 1.4%. So it was a good quarter also in terms of revenue growth. 
Second, we're feeling good about the Recall transaction. Our progress on integration and our ability to derive benefits from scale, which supports additional growth in cash flow. 
And finally, our high-margin business, coupled with our focus on continuous cost control, continues to give us high confidence in our ability to deploy that incremental cash flow into growth investment, deleveraging and near-term double-digit growth in our dividend per share. 
With that, operator, we'd -- we're now ready for questions."

But I think I'll just touch a bit upon your last -- the last part of your question in terms of what we found through the integration planning with Recall. And I think what we've -- the main difference, I think we've talked about that on the April 1 call, is we found that we've -- what I would call more capital efficiencies. So 2 areas specifically is we found in terms of maintenance CapEx. We feel very comfortable that Recall's maintenance CapEx will be in line with what we spend on Iron Mountain's facilities; i.e., around 2.6% of revenue, whereas before, we thought we were going to have to spend more, because they had done a number of acquisitions. So we feel very comfortable based on the integration planning that -- it's kind of a like-for-like integration in terms of level of maintenance CapEx. The other area which we feel very comfortable now, which was an unknown for us, is we had a significant uptick or original budgeting for IT systems, because again, we didn't know if our platforms would be big enough to scale efficiently to absorb all of the Recall operations. And again, we feel very comfortable. So you'll see that we still have significant investment to absorb the Recall operations onto our IT platforms, but much more in line that we're taking on, on a company that's 1/4 of our size, rather than one that we would have to rebuild or relaunch major IT systems. So those have been the 2 areas, which I would say are positive surprises that we had on the integration side. But Rod, you may want to comment a little bit more in terms of the guidance."

And the second is, we took some severance costs in a number of our services businesses as part of an sort of ongoing program to drive longer-term improvements in margin. And that has an impact of 0.6%. There's a small other component, which has to do with some vacation accruals.

I think the -- I wouldn't read too much into that. I think generally, our guidance is the same that we're achieving inflation or a little bit more than inflation in terms of pricing in each of our markets. So it does look a little bit odd in this quarter that you see in a couple of segments, where we actually achieved higher volume growth and total revenue growth on a storage basis. I think that's more by -- driven by a couple of things. One is that in one of our business lines, we had a major REIT, a very large customer, major renewal. And I think, as we've talked about before, is when we have large customer renewals is you get these sawtooth where at the renewal point is you take a discount and then it climbs up through that period. So there was a little bit of that going on. And then, specifically in Europe, we had a market where we successfully took on a very large public sector customer, which has actually similar pricing in, say, a lot of our other developed markets, but because of the historical volume of some customers just reaching their natural life, for some of the boxes of natural -- customers reaching their natural life going out at the same time. You have a what effectively looks like a dilution effect. But overall, our pricing is -- still continues to track. If we look at it over a 12 or kind of a trailing basis, we expect it to continue to track to be slightly ahead of inflation. So you will see that kind of go back into the normal zone."

The other thing which we said is that we expect a ramp through the year. And we feel like we are well on track, and that's why we said we expect still at the end of the year to end up north of 2.5% in terms of internal storage revenue growth. The other thing you should go back, it is important to look at, if we look at year-on-year comparison, if we look at just total internal revenue growth, total internal revenue growth for the company quarter 1 2015 was 1.4%, and we have delivered 2% this quarter. And overall last year, we had 1.5%, and we delivered 2% this quarter. So we feel comfortable with the ramp, even on a total revenue basis that we are achieving. And specifically, if we look at the storage rental revenues, as I said, you need to look at it -- quarter-on-quarter is we're looking at a very strong quarter in '15, and then we have a natural ramp during the year."

We're off to a very good start after our 2nd May closing of the Recall acquisition. The base Iron Mountain results continue to show financial and operating performance, which is consistent with quarter 1. Synergies from Recall are coming in faster than anticipated in 2016, and based on all this, we reconfirmed of the full year guidance we gave back in April. 
We're also pleased about them Stuart Brown as our new CFO. Stuart officially joined us last week, and I know he's looking forward to getting more engaged in the business and meeting with our investors and analysts. Stuart has a unique blend of both global operating company and REIT experience, and I know he'll be a great fit with our executive team. And whilst we are sai that Rod will be leaving us, he'll be around for a few months yet to ensure a smooth transition to Stuart. 
Turning now to our progress on Recall's benefits and integration. First, just to summarize. Overall, the acquisition makes us the only global platform in our industry as we continue to expand our ability to meet customers' information management and storage needs as a face increasing regulation, ongoing cybersecurity threats and seek to turn information into business value. As we've noted in the past, this transaction has 3 core benefits. First, it enhances our global footprint, particularly in emerging markets. Second, it strengthens our ability to reach mid-market businesses where Recall was very present and Iron Mountain was significantly underrepresented in this very large and high-margin segment. And third, the level of synergy enables significant growth in AFFO and cash available for distribution. This rapid and large expansion of cash flow allows us to simultaneously invest in new product and innovation for the benefit of our customers, significantly grow our dividend whilst simultaneously delevering and markedly bringing down our payout ratio. Finally, this acquisition further supports the trust our customers have in Iron Mountain to serve both the current and future needs. Trust in Iron Mountain to protect what matters most, trust at Iron Mountain will be available to continue to support them in 50 years time and trust in Iron Mountain to continue to use at scale for innovation and to provide expertise, products and services designed to get the most out of their overall storage and information assets.
In the customer interactions we have had since closing the acquisition, their commentary has been very positive as they can see how we both have the intention and the resources to be even more innovative. An example of our product innovation was reported in a recent Bloomberg profile highlighting the work we are doing on behalf of MTV as they celebrate their 35th anniversary. 
On a more operational note, I'm pleased with the team's work to welcome new customers and begin integrating operations. During the second quarter, we accomplished a number of critical integration-related initiatives whilst continuing to pursue our transformation agenda. And we delivered internal storage rental revenue in volume growth in the base Iron Mountain business, consistent with the growth we saw in the first quarter of this year. In short, we kept our eye on the ball despite all the activities surrounding the Recall close. 
More specifically, since the closing on May 2, our integration progress includes several key initiatives. We completed our review of Recall's leadership and immediately brought the management teams together, enhancing our organization through the retention of key former executives to lead areas such as customer experience, mid-market and SMB sales as well as key finance roles in a number of country and territory management positions. We converted Recall's operations in 4 countries into our REIT structure. We completed the disposition of Recall's business in 23 U.S. markets as required by the United States Department of Justice. We received final clearance from the United Kingdom Competition and Markets Authority. We solicited and are currently evaluating bids on required dispositions in additional jurisdictions. We began a portfolio review of both companies service offerings to determine optimal platforms for ensuring continued superior customer service. And we undertook real estate reviews in select markets and identified initial consolidation opportunities in France, Spain, the United Kingdom and Australia as well as in the United States. As a result of these and other quick actions and outstanding facilitation from the transitioning Recall teams, we're getting the synergies faster than expected. This means more impact this year. In fact, we will exit 2016 having achieved more than 80% of the total synergies we expected to have achieved by year-end 2017. 
We appreciate that given the closing of Recall a month into the quarter, our second quarter results don't fully reflect Recall's contribution. And as we noted on last quarter's call, Q2 margins would reflect that Recall's core EBITDA margins are lower than ours.  In fact, Recall's EBITDA margins have consistently been more than 700 basis points lower than ours, but we saw a bit more impact from that initially given that the assets to be divested and those already sold are among the higher-margin markets in their portfolio. You will recall the execution of our integration program increases the Recall base margin business by pulling 2 levers. First, in the near term, we're achieving synergies and SG&A and labor costs; and second, in the medium term, we'll improve our operating leverage as we consolidate facilities. Rod will have more detail shortly and walk you through the buildup to our full year expectations. In brief, when we prorate year-to-date results, add in accelerated synergies, second half transformation benefit and typical ramp we see in the business throughout the year, we are comfortable slightly raising the bottom end of our guidance range relative to what we provided back in April. 
Now turning to some of the quarter's results at a high level before Rod walks you through the inns and outs that can also be found on the bridging graphs in our supplemental report. Total revenue growth in constant dollars was 19% with similar growth rates in constant dollars storage, rental and storage revenue. On an internal basis, storage growth was 2.1% and in line with levels achieved in Q4 and Q1. We continue to expect average storage rental internal growth to be around 2.5% for the full year. Internal volume work prior to acquisitions was positive in all segments and consistent with recent quarters' performance at 1.7% worldwide growth. Service revenue was flat over last year, reflecting the variability and timing of projects. However, based on our service project pipeline, we continue to expect positive internal service revenue as well as service gross profit growth for the full year. As mentioned previously, given our expected service mix, we will maintain our focus on increasing service gross profit rather than purely gross margins. Our new service offerings are sometimes lower margins but generate attractive returns due to the minimal capital investment required. Consistent with this focus, you will note service gross profit was up more than 18% in the second quarter, exceeding the growth in constant dollars service revenue. 
Turning to progress on our strategic plans. During the quarter, we continue to advance each of the 3 pillars of the plan as well as the foundational elements that support it. I will quickly highlight progress in each of the 3 pillars namely: getting the most out of our developed markets, increasing our presence in the fast-growing emerging markets and expansion in faster-growing adjacent business. In developed markets, which includes both North America and our Western European segment, we had 3 million cubic feet of internal volume growth during the quarter. In emerging markets, our goal is to expand our presence and leverage our scale, driving these markets to 20% of our total revenue by 2020. Recall's footprint in emerging markets supports that objective and has helped drive our emerging market business to 16.4% of total revenue on a constant dollar basis as of the end of Q2. Additionally, as our visibility on closing of Recall transaction became clearer, we resumed acquisition activity and moved into new emerging markets during the year. Earlier this week, we announced plans to acquire the information management operations of Santa Fe Group in 10 countries, mainly in Southeast Asia, for approximately EUR 27 million. The deal also marks our entry into 4 new emerging markets: Macau, the Philippines, Indonesia and South Korea as well as further bolstering our already strong positions in Hong Kong, Singapore, India, Taiwan and Malaysia, providing a great foundation for further expansion in this dynamic and higher-growth region. 
We continue to nurture a deep, diverse pipeline of accretive M&A opportunities in emerging markets where we can leverage our global footprint and deep customer relationships to capture the initial wave of records management outsourcing that is in the early days within these faster-growing markets. Before turning away from our International operations, I should comment on Brexit. Importantly, we don't expect to see a significant impact. We have built scenarios related to the potential implications of the decision with particular focus on our customers, the supply base, our staff and the regulatory and fiscal framework in which we operate. We will continue to monitor developments closely and watch for any shifting legal obligations governing the management of information. But as other multinationals have acknowledged, it will be some time before any meaningful movement toward an exit from the EU gets underway. In terms of our core business, it is unlikely to have much impact from a constant currency perspective. We're generally naturally hedged. As for adjacent businesses, we are on track to achieve our stated goal to generate 5% of our total worldwide revenue from adjacent businesses by the end of 2020, up from just 2% at the end of 2015. In our data center business, we had several recent big wins, bringing us to 80% committed in our first phase building in our aboveground facility in Boston. Combining our Boston facility with the undergrounds in Boyers, Pennsylvania and Kansas City, Missouri, our data center space is greater than 90% committed, and we are on track to achieve internal growth approaching 20% in this business area. In our art storage business, we're making good progress in acquired and other small business, a good example of what we believe will be a long-term consolidation play. Overall, between the progress we're making in emerging markets as well as adjacent businesses, we are well on track to achieve our combined goal of having the except expansion of our emerging market presence and adjacent businesses yield 25% of our total revenue mix by 2020, which is up from about 17.5% of our total business mix today. In terms of supporting foundations for the plan, we continued to make progress on our transformation initiative to remove $125 million in SG&A. Also, as previously disclosed, the remaining $25 million of overhead savings will be actioned in 2017 and the full amount for the Transformation Program will be reflected in our 2018 adjusted OIBDA. Given the timing of Recall synergies, our Transformation Program and expected ramp in the business, we remain confident that cash flow will be in line with the growth expectations we highlighted during Investor Day and again on our April 1 call, which provides the foundation for our expected dividend growth. As a reminder, we expect to grow dividend per share by about 13% in 2017 as the synergies and transformation benefits flow through our results and by an additional 7% in 2018 and 4% annual growth thereafter whilst also funding core growth racking, M&A and overall investments in support of our previously presented 2020 plan. As we progress this plan, we'll have more cash available to support discretionary investment, which means we'll borrow less to fund our growth plan and continue to delever. And at the same time, we'll reduce our payout ratio as a percentage of AFFO. 
Our operations are underpinned by our very durable, growing business that performs consistently throughout business cycles. In addition, we're extending that durability through solid execution of our plan in developed markets, identifying and capturing opportunities in both emerging markets and adjacent businesses, and continuing to enhance our cost structure in both service and overheads. Our durable storage business generates roughly $1.9 billion of annual storage net operating income, which exceeds that generated by leaders in both the industrial and self-storage sectors. What distinguishes our business is its inherent durability, and it is this durability that delivers consistent levels of operating performance in both good and bad times. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Rod."

I'll begin today with a high-level overview of our second quarter and year-to-date performance, which included a 2-month benefit from the Recall acquisition compared with the prior year. In addition, I will review our results by segment, provide an update on our transformation initiative and summarize our successful bridge loan refinancing. Lastly, I will touch on the strong progress we're making integrating Recall into our business as well as our outlook for 2016, which remains essentially unchanged since April.
Let's turn to our worldwide financial results. Consistent with prior quarters, we have provided bridging schedules for total revenue, adjusted OIBDA, adjusted earnings per share and FFO per share to explain key variances in our year-on-year performance. These schedules can be found on Pages 21 through 24 of the supplemental. 
Let me briefly walk you through the highlights. For the second quarter, total reported revenues were $884 million compared with $760 million in 2015. Excluding the year-over-year negative FX impact of approximately 2% or roughly $17 million, on a constant dollar basis, revenues grew by 18.6%. For the first half of the year, reported revenues were $1.63 billion compared with $1.51 billion in 2015. Excluding Recall and other smaller acquisitions, total internal storage rental revenue was up 2.1% to Q2, consistent with the growth we saw in Q1. In contrast, internal service revenue was down 2.1% compared with growth of 1.6% we saw in Q1. As we noted in our last call, service revenues are more project-based, which have more volatile growth rates on a quarter-on-quarter basis. Based on a review of our service deal pipeline, we continue to expect internal service revenue growth to be positive for the full year. 
Total adjusted OIBDA for the quarter was $261 million compared with $223 million in 2015. We grew adjusted OIBDA by 17.1% on a reported dollar basis and by 18.8% on a constant dollar basis. Year-to-date, adjusted OIBDA grew by 9.3% reported dollar and by 11.6% on a constant dollar basis. As we noted in our Q1 call, Recall is a lower-margin business in Iron Mountain. Therefore, as expected, our adjusted OIBDA margins were lower relative to the first quarter of the year. This impact flows through to our adjusted EPS, FFO per share and AFFO results. As synergies build in future quarters, this picture will be reversed. 
Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.24 compared with $0.28 in 2015. Year-to-date, adjusted EPS was $0.55 compared with $0.60 in 2015. In the second quarter, adjusted EPS was impacted by the amortization of Recall's customer relationship values and the increased depreciation expense of Recall's legacy racking structures. The amortization expense of customer relationships flows through to FFO per share. However, the increased depreciation does not because real estate depreciation is excluded from FFO per share. FFO per share was $0.47 for the quarter compared to $0.49 in the year-ago period. Year-to-date, FFO per share was $0.98 compared with $0.99 in the year-ago period. AFFO was $159 million compared with $131 million in the year-ago period. Importantly, AFFO was not impacted by the increased depreciation and amortization expense in the second quarter as these are noncash items and do not impact our AFFO or cash available for distribution. Year-to-date, AFFO was $301 million compared with $259 million in 2015. AFFO for the year-to-date is at the high end of our expectations. However, we expect to remain within our ranges for the full year. 
Similar to prior quarters, on Page 20 of the supplemental, we're providing a reconciliation between AFFO and cash flow from operations as presented in our GAAP cash flow statement, so you can more readily see the cash items that are not typically of a recurring nature. Our structural tax rate for this quarter came out to 17.2% compared with 13.9% in the prior year. Expected year-over-year increase in our structural tax rates was mostly driven by the legacy Recall business, which has higher exposure to international markets with their respective foreign tax rates and which do not have the same tax efficiency as we do in the U.S. with the REIT structure. Also, the tax rate this quarter is below the previously communicated run rate expectation of 20% as our pretax income was impacted by Recall integration and deal costs. For the remainder of 2016, we expect our tax rate to be approximately 18% as a result of these Recall costs. However, beyond 2016, we expect the tax rate to be closer to 19% to 20%. 
Let's turn to our financial performance by segments. In North American Records and Information Management, or RIM, internal storage revenue increased by 0.7% for the second quarter. North American RIM internal service revenue declined by 1.2%. Growth in threading and scanning was offset by declines in core transportation. North American Data Management, or DM, delivered storage rental internal growth of 1.3% for the second quarter. Internal service revenue in DM declined as we continue to see reductions in the frequency of tape rotation and related transportation activity, partially offset by strong growth in new Data Management offerings. In addition, we had a large project which benefited the prior year period. After normalizing for this, DM service revenues performed in line with prior quarters. DM adjusted OIBDA margins improved year-over-year due to a decrease in overhead cost as we continue to realize transformation benefits. The Western Europe segment generated 0.1% internal storage rental growth, and internal service revenue declined by 4.6%, primarily as a result of lower activity in transportation-related revenue and lower project revenue. The low internal storage growth in Western Europe was due to a large customer win in the year-ago period and certain contract renegotiations that occurred quarter. Adjusted OIBDA margins improved year-over-year in Western Europe due to lower G&A expenses. 
The Other International segments, which is made up primarily of emerging markets and Australia, showed strong growth in both storage and service revenues. Internal storage rental growth was 8.6%, and internal service growth was 5.3% for the quarter. Other International adjusted OIBDA margins were 25% for the quarter, in line with our expectations. We're pleased with the progress we've made with our transformation initiative. During the second quarter, we did not incur significant costs related to Transformation as the focus was not headcount-related, rather it was on streamlining business processes. Year-to-date, we've actioned $28 million of the $50 million exit rate savings and have line of site on incremental $22 million to be implemented by the end of this year. Our overall savings outlook for Transformation remains consistent with what we laid out at our Investor Day at October, with $125 million of cumulative savings by 2018. 
Let me now talk about Recall integration progress and provide details on the cost we've incurred so far in 2016 to achieve synergies and integrate Recall within our business. As Bill explained, the synergy program is ahead of schedule. As you can see on the supplemental on Page 25, we expect to exit this year having already achieved more than 80% of the total synergies originally anticipated to 2017. Our expectations of total cost to achieve the target synergies are still consistent with prior projections. Because we're accelerating synergies that set us up for a strong run rate for 2017, we expect to incur roughly $10 million more in costs in 2016 than originally contemplated. Year-to-date, we've incurred $37 million of integration costs to $32 million deal close costs. Additional details can be found in our 10-Q, which will be filed later today. Please note these expenses are excluded from our adjusted OIBDA calculation as they are onetime in nature. 
Let's turn to our outlook for 2016 on Page 12 of the supplemental. Business trends and fundamentals remain consistent given the durability of our business. We remain on track to achieve our short- and long-term financial objectives. Please note that although our guidance assumes divestitures would occur on day one, the benefit from businesses yet to be divested that are running through our operating results is not significant. Some legacy Recall assets was sold to Access nearly at the same time as they closed, so they're not reflected in our results. The remaining legacy Recall assets to be sold are included in discontinued operations, therefore, not flowing through our operating income. Lastly, the remaining Iron Mountain nice assets to be disposed of are flowing our financials, however, with an immaterial benefit for the quarter and full year. Overall, our core Iron Mountain business is performing to plan. Recall contribution is tracking in line with our previous expectations, and we have accelerated the realization of net synergies for the year, which is why we brought up the lower end of our adjusted OIBDA guidance by $5 million.
Let me now refer you to the table at the bottom of our guidance page on Page 12 of the supplemental to follow our expectations for full year adjusted OIBDA. We thought it would be helpful to cover how results track begins original expectations, but please note, we'll be not reporting actual results separately given our financial statements are now fully integrated. Our stand-alone expectation for Iron Mountain's core business remains $950 million to $970 million, consistent with what we previously communicated. And our performance in the first half of the year are tracking right in line with our expectation. For the second quarter, excluding Recall's base and synergies less divestitures, Iron Mountain stand-alone adjusted OIBDA was in line with Q1 results at $235 million. So year-to-date, Iron Mountain stand-alone adjusted OIBDA was roughly $470 million. In the second half of the year, we expect to realize $7 million the $10 million of transportation benefits to offset costs associated with that program in the first half. We also expect a ramp in the business as our storage base continues to expand. This ramp is consistent with 2015, during which second half year results were $10 million higher than the first half on a reported dollar basis. If you annualize the first have actual run rate, our transformation benefits and a similar ramp to last year, stand-alone expectations are in line. 
Now let me address the second line related to Recall's contribution for the year. Prior to divestitures, we expect the Recall business to contribute $115 million of adjusted OIBDA at the midpoint. This reflects 8 months of Recall contribution, and our range implies $13 million to $15 million per month of contribution prior to synergies and divestitures. Lastly, we're expecting $18 million of adjusted OIBDA synergies net of the impact of divestitures for the year. As Bill noted, this is up from our initial expectation of $15 million. As a result, our adjusted OIBDA guidance range for 2016 is now $1,075,000,000 to $1,110,000,000. For adjusted EPS, our guidance remains unchanged. Although our expectations for the structural tax rate are lower than previously anticipated, this benefit will likely be offset by the accelerated depreciation of Recall racking structures. Although our total normalized dollar AFFO guidance remains the same, we changed our FFO per share guidance to reflect where we expect the final weighted average share count will settle for the year. We did not update adjusted EPS for this impact because the benefit is offset by the incremental real estate depreciation expense mentioned earlier. Please also note that on a constant dollar guidance remains close to reported dollars. Assuming current rates hold, we do not see a downside from FX in our guidance.
Moving to our expected cash available for distributions and investment for 2016. We continue to estimate they will be roughly $600 million. This provides ample funding for dividends and core growth racking investment. Our capital deployment plans for 2016 are unchanged. We continue to expect capital expenditures, which include real estate and nonreal estate maintenance and non-real investment, to be in line with the figures we provided in our last earnings call and to total $170 million for the year. Our expectation for total real estate investment spend remains $320 million. This includes $70 million in core growth racking investment, and the remainder of our real estate spend is expected to be in real estate consolidation, development, data center and some lease conversions. As we've said in the past, we're focused on consolidating facilities, particularly given the Recall transaction. We expect real estate consolidation will provide upsides to synergies in the long term, but it's too early for us to quantify the exact benefit at this time. For M&A, we continue to expect to spend roughly $150 million, with approximately $110 million in emerging markets, $50 million in developed markets. Dividend expectations remain consistent with our previous guidance for 2016. Our dividend per share is expected to grow from $1.94 this year to a minimum of $2.20 in 2017 and $2.35 in 2018 as we realize the majority of benefits of Transformation savings and Recall synergies. Beyond 2018, we expect to grow dividend per share roughly 4% per year. Importantly, our dividend payout ratio as a percent of AFFO is in line with prior expectations and should reduce to 70% by 2020, which underscores the strength of our dividend coverage. In addition, we're targeting a leverage ratio of 5.0x by 2020. 
Shifting briefly to the balance sheet. At the quarter-end, we had liquidity of approximately $580 million, and our lease adjusted debt ratio was slightly up at 5.8x as expected. Our leverage ratio increased primarily as a result of the timing of Recall integration and deal costs discussed earlier. We expect to end the year with a leverage ratio of 5.7x as we start realizing synergies and Transformation savings. As many of you may already know, we refinanced of the $850 million bridge facility associated with the Recall transaction, primarily with long-term debt. We raised $750 million in aggregate principal amount on senior unsecured notes, which included $500 million of 4 3/8% due in 2021 and $250 million at 5 3/8% due in 2026. Our unsecured debt was priced at spreads similar to business services issuers 2 notches higher than Iron Mountain and at the top of the spread range for investment-grade issuance, which reflect debt investors' favorable view of our predictable cash flow. In addition, we also amended our credit agreement and extended its maturity to 2019. So overall, we're pleased with the performance we saw in the second quarter and year-to-date. Our results are driven by the durability of our business and execution of our long-term plan. We're excited with the progress we've made so far in integrating Recall and pleased that we'll be realizing synergies early than expected. Looking ahead, we're confident that we well positioned to deliver on our long-term goal. We remain highly focused on extending the durability of our storage rental business, which drives growth and cash available to fund dividends and core growth investments. 
I'll now hand the call back to Bill."

Before I turn it over to questions, I should say that I think our Transformation Program probably has produced the caffeine in my coffee in the morning, so I did, I think, misstate that Access, we sold 23 U.S. markets access. I meant to say 13. So 13 is much better than 23. I will talk to the Transformation and put the caffeine back in my coffee. But anyway, with that, operator I'd like to turn it over to Q&A.

So if you look at Q2 '16 this quarter, you'll see that out terms and distractions, if you subtract that from new sales and organic growth, you have a net before acquisition of 3.8% growth versus a Q1 of 3% growth, so the net growth has actually increased. But coming to specifically your question about what's going on with out firms is the 2.3% in Q1 of '16 is not out of norm. So if you kind of go back and you look at the supplemental on Page 11, you'll see that over the last 12 months or less, say, even more that 1.5 years or so, you'll see going back into Q3 of '14, it goes somewhere between 2.1 and 2.3. Where really see the spike is in the Q2 '16 number where you see that go up to 2.6, so it's really a Q2 issue. But to say the net of volume is positive. And for those that followed Recall, there was a program that Doug would initially call close the gap, and 2 things he referred to as the 700-or-so basis points lower gross margin that their business yielded in terms of their overall business. And the other thing is he highlighted that the level of out firms that they have relative to ours. So where we see the roughly the 30 bps increase in out firms from Q1 to Q2, that's driven by Recall's emerging business into hours, which we knew was had a less -- had a higher volatility or a higher turn in that. But you'll see that come down over time because obviously, we're wrapping the same customer loyalty program, which I think we've spoken on previous calls where we have a -- we built a -- with outside help, we built an algorithm that helps predict 6 to 12 months ahead of time certain customer issues that prevent the out firms."

And one of the things that Recall had is they couldn't afford to take the investment that we did. I mean, we brought in some upside outside help and advisers that know how to build these tools, and it looks like a number of different things. It looks at volume for the call center. It looks at number of boxes coming in. It looks at the types of complaints that we're getting from a customer. There's a number of different things that you pick up, the last time we gave them a price increase. And you look at those different pieces of data, and it's pretty accurate in terms of predicting when you're heading for a crisis with that customer and that you can intervene. And I forget exactly what their number was, but it was significantly -- it was at least a full point higher than ours in terms of the out firms. And you're seeing that averaging in the when we go from the 2.2 to 2.6. So it is something -- it is isn't structural in the Recall business.

But they were much more present within that middle market and SMB space, so they were winning and losing against much more the smaller players. And we're actually quite excited about it, to be honest with you. So their head of sales for North America now runs our whole mid-market SMB segment. And that business is, I think, approaching almost $800 million, I think $750 million of sales if we combined the 2 companies. So it's of the same size of what Recall was globally just in North America. And we think we could to a better job.

But I think when you buy a competitor, you always kind of think that they're different than you. When you're talking to customers, you typically demonize the competitor. And guess what, they have blood flow through just like us, and we've got some really good people as a result of it. And they had almost identical values and code of conduct as we had [indiscernible] next 2 slides up next each other. We did it at townhall, and they're virtually almost the same, so I don't know who copied from who. So we've actually, probably, if anything, have integrated the people much quicker. And when I say integrated not just get them into slots, but people feel like they've been around a lot longer than they have, if you know what I mean. They didn't spend a lot of time trying to figure stuff out or adapt to a new culture. So that part has been better than we thought.

So I think we also pretty kind of foreshadowed the last quarter that we thought be would see a drop in service revenue that the next Q2 wouldn't be as strong as Q1. And so obviously, we could see the pipeline, and we knew how that worked. The one thing that I think again we commented on last time is that as we shift more to project-based rather than transportation-based service revenue, we do expect it to be pipeline-dependent and, therefore, more project-dependent and, therefore, more lumpy. So it's much easier to predict that if you look over 12-month period than if you look at it on a 1-month or even a 3-month period. So as that as a backdrop, if we look forward to the rest of the year, we like the pipelines, the booking pipeline -- the bookings in the pipeline that we see for the rest of the year. So we're very confident that for the total year, we will see positive service revenue growth, which is obviously means that the new services are offsetting the declines that we talked about in the transportation, which has driven into the structural shift and the way that the information is being used. So we feel very good that for the full year, you'll see a trend that's consistent with Q1 as the pipeline turns into bookings in terms of the projects that we see in front of us."

30292,374809183,1025174,"Iron Mountain Incorporated, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 04, 2016",2016-08-04,"Earnings Calls","Iron Mountain Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Melissa, and good morning, everyone. We're off to a very good start after our 2nd May closing of the Recall acquisition.

We're off to a very good start after our 2nd May closing of the Recall acquisition. The Base Iron Mountain results continue to show financial and operating performance, which is consistent with quarter 1. Synergies from Recall are coming in faster than anticipated in 2016, and based on all this, we reconfirm the full year guidance we gave back in April. 
We're also pleased to welcome Stuart Brown, as our new CFO. Stuart officially joined us last week, and I know he's looking forward to getting more engaged in the business and meeting with our investors and analysts. Stuart has a unique blend of both global operating company and REIT experience, and I know he'll be a great fit with our executive team. And whilst we are sad that Rod will be leaving us, he'll be around for a few months yet to ensure a smooth transition to Stuart. 
Turning now to our progress on Recall's benefits and integration. First, just to summarize. Overall, the acquisition makes us the only global platform in our industry as we continue to expand our ability to meet customers' information management and storage needs as they face increasing regulation, ongoing cybersecurity threats and seek to turn information into business value. As we've noted in the past, this transaction has 3 core benefits: first, it enhances our global footprint, particularly, in emerging markets; second, it strengthens our ability to reach mid-market businesses where Recall was very present and Iron Mountain was significantly underrepresented in this very large and high-margin segment; and third, the level of synergy enables significant growth in AFFO and cash available for distribution. This rapid and large expansion of cash flow allows us to simultaneously invest in new product and innovation for the benefit of our customers, significantly grow our dividend whilst simultaneously delevering and markedly bringing down our payout ratio. 
Finally, these -- this acquisition further supports the trust our customers have in Iron Mountain to serve both their current and future needs. Trust in Iron Mountain to protect what matters most; trust that Iron Mountain will be available to continue to support them in 50 years time; and trust in Iron Mountain to continue to use its scale for innovation and to provide expertise, products and services designed to get the most out of their overall storage and information assets.
In the customer interactions we have had since closing the acquisition, their commentary has been very positive as they can see how we both have the intention and the resources to be even more innovative. An example of our product innovation was reported in a recent Bloomberg profile, highlighting the work we are doing on behalf of MTV as they celebrate their 35th anniversary. 
On a more operational note, I'm pleased with the team's work to welcome new customers and begin integrating operations. During the second quarter, we accomplished a number of critical integration-related initiatives whilst continuing to pursue our transformation agenda. And we delivered internal storage rental revenue in volume growth in the base Iron Mountain business consistent with the growth we saw in the first quarter of this year. In short, we kept our eye on the ball despite all the activities surrounding the Recall close. 
More specifically, since the closing on May 2, our integration progress includes several key initiatives. We completed our review of Recall's leadership and immediately brought the management teams together, enhancing our organization through the retention of key former executives to lead areas such as customer experience, mid-market and SMB sales as well as key finance roles in a number of country and territory management positions. We converted Recall's operations in 4 countries into our REIT structure. 
We completed the disposition of Recall's business in 23 U.S. markets as required by the United States Department of Justice. We received final clearance from the United Kingdom Competition and Markets Authority. We solicited and are currently evaluating bids on required dispositions in additional jurisdictions. We began a portfolio review of both companies service offerings to determine optimal platforms for ensuring continued superior customer service. And we undertook real estate reviews in select markets and identified initial consolidation opportunities in France, Spain, the United Kingdom and Australia as well as in the United States. As 
a result of these and other quick actions and outstanding facilitation from the transitioning Recall teams, we're getting the synergies faster than expected. This means more impact this year. In fact, we will exit 2016 having achieved more than 80% of the total synergies we expected to have achieved by year-end 2017. 
We appreciate that given the closing of Recall a month into the quarter, our second quarter results don't fully reflect Recall's contribution. And as we noted on last quarter's call, Q2 margins would reflect at [ph] Recall's core EBITDA margins are lower than ours.  In fact, Recall's EBITDA margins have consistently been more than 700 basis points lower than ours, but we saw a bit more impact from that initially given that the assets to be divested and those already sold are among the higher-margin markets in their portfolio. 
You will recall the execution of our integration program increases the Recall base margin business by pulling 2 levers: first, in the near term, we're achieving synergies in SG&A and labor cost; and second, in the medium term, we'll improve our operating leverage as we consolidate facilities. Rod will have more detail shortly and walk you through the buildup to our full year expectations. In brief, when we prorate year-to-date results, add in accelerated synergies, second half transformation benefit and typical ramp we see in the business throughout the year, we are comfortable slightly raising the bottom end of our guidance range relative to what we provided back in April. 
Now turning to some of the quarter's results at a high level before Rod walks you through the ins and outs that can also be found on the bridging graphs in our supplemental report. Total revenue growth in constant dollars was 19% with similar growth rates in constant dollar storage, rental and service revenue. On an internal basis, storage growth was 2.1% and in line with levels achieved in Q4 and Q1. We continue to expect average storage rental internal growth to be around 2.5% for the full year. Internal volume work or prior to acquisitions was positive in all segments and consistent with recent quarter's performance at 1.7% worldwide growth. Service revenue was flat over last year, reflecting the variability and timing of projects. However, based on our service project pipeline, we continue to expect positive internal service revenue as well as service gross profit growth for the full year. As mentioned previously, given our expected service mix, we will maintain our focus on increasing service gross profit rather than purely gross margins. Our new service offerings at [ph] sometimes lower margins, but generate attractive returns due to the minimal capital investment required. Consistent with this focus, you will note service gross profit was up more than 18% in the second quarter, exceeding the growth in constant dollar service revenue. 
Turning to progress on our strategic plans. During the quarter, we continue to advance each of the 3 pillars of the plan as well as the foundational elements that support it. I will quickly highlight progress in each of the 3 pillars namely: getting the most out of our developed markets; increasing our presence in the fast-growing emerging markets; and expansion in faster-growing adjacent business. In developed markets, which includes both North America RIM and our Western European segment, we had 3 million cubic feet of internal volume growth during the quarter. In emerging markets, our goal is to expand our presence and leverage our scale, driving these markets to 20% of our total revenue by 2020. Recall's footprint in emerging markets supports that objective and has helped drive our emerging market business to 16.4% of total revenue on a constant dollar basis as of the end of Q2. 
Additionally, as our visibility on closing of Recall transaction became clear, we resumed acquisition activity and moved into new emerging markets during the year. Earlier this week, we announced plans to acquire the information management operations of Santa Fe Group in 10 countries, mainly in Southeast Asia, for approximately EUR 27 million. The deal also marks our entry into 4 new emerging markets. Macau, the Philippines, Indonesia and South Korea as well as further bolstering our already strong positions in Hong Kong, Singapore, India, Taiwan and Malaysia, providing a great foundation for further expansion in this dynamic and higher-growth region. 
We continue to nurture a deep, diverse pipeline of accretive M&A opportunities in emerging markets where we can leverage our global footprint and deep customer relationships to capture the initial wave of records management outsourcing that is in the early days and -- within these faster-growing markets. 
Before turning away from our International operations, I should comment on Brexit. Importantly, we don't expect to see a significant impact. We have built scenarios related to the potential implications of the decision with particular focus on our customers, the supply base, our staff and the regulatory and fiscal frameworks in which we operate. We will continue to monitor developments closely and watch for any shifting legal obligations governing the management of information. But as other multinationals have acknowledged, it'll be some time before any meaningful movement toward an exit from the EU gets underway. In terms of our core business, it is unlikely to have much impact from a constant currency perspective, we're generally naturally hedged. 
As for adjacent businesses, we are on track to achieve our stated goal to generate 5% of our total worldwide revenue from adjacent businesses by the end of 2020, up from just 2% at the end of 2015. In our data center business, we had several recent big wins, bringing us to 80% committed in our first phase building in our above-ground facility in Boston. Combining our Boston facility with the undergrounds in Boyers, Pennsylvania and Kansas City, Missouri, our data center space is greater than 90% committed, and we are on track to achieve internal growth approaching 20% in this business area. In our Art Storage business, we're making good progress and acquired another smaller business, a good example of what we believe will be a long-term consolidation play. 
Overall, between the progress we're making in emerging markets as well as adjacent businesses, we are well on track to achieve our combined goal of having the except expansion of our emerging market presence and adjacent businesses yield 25% of our total revenue mix by 2020, which is up from about 17.5% of our total business mix today. 
In terms of supporting foundations for the plan, we continue to make progress on our transformation initiative to remove $125 million in SG&A. Also, as previously disclosed, the remaining $25 million of overhead savings will be actioned in 2017 and the full amount for the Transformation Program will be reflected in our 2018 adjusted OIBDA. Given the timing of Recall synergies, our Transformation Program and expected ramp in the business, we remain confident that cash flow will be in line with the growth expectations we highlighted during an Investor Day and again on our April 1 call, which provides the foundation for our expected dividend growth. 
As a reminder, we expect to grow dividend per share by about 13% in 2017 as the synergies and transformation benefits flow through our results and by an additional 7% in 2018 and 4% annual growth thereafter, whilst also funding core growth racking, M&A and overall investments in support of our previously presented 2020 plan. As we progress this plan, we'll have more cash available to support discretionary investment, which means we'll borrow less to fund our growth plan and continue to delever. And at the same time, we'll reduce our payout ratio as a percentage of AFFO. 
Our operations are underpinned by our very durable, growing business that performs consistently throughout business cycles. In addition, we're extending that durability through solid execution of our plan in developed markets, identifying and capturing opportunities in both emerging markets and adjacent businesses, and continuing to enhance our cost structure in both service and overhead. Our durable storage business generates roughly $1.9 billion of annual storage net operating income, which exceeds that generated by leaders in both the industrial and self-storage sectors. 
What distinguishes our business is its inherent durability, and it is this durability that delivers consistent levels of operating performance in both good and bad times. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Rod."

Lastly, I will touch on the strong progress we're making integrating Recall into our business as well as our outlook for 2016, which remains essentially unchanged since April.
Let's turn to our worldwide financial results. Consistent with prior quarters, we have provided bridging schedules for total revenue, adjusted OIBDA, adjusted earnings per share and FFO per share to explain key variances in our year-on-year performance. These schedules can be found on Pages 21 through 24 of the supplemental. 
Let me briefly walk you through the highlights. For the second quarter, total reported revenues were $884 million compared with $760 million in 2015. Excluding the year-over-year negative FX impact of approximately 2% or roughly $17 million, on a constant dollar basis, revenues grew by 18.6%. For the first half of the year, reported revenues were $1.63 billion compared with $1.51 billion in 2015. Excluding Recall and other smaller acquisitions, total internal storage rental revenue was up 2.1% for Q2, consistent with the growth we saw in Q1. In contrast, internal service revenue was down 2.1% compared with growth of 1.6%, we saw in Q1. 
As we noted in our last call, service revenues are more project-based, which have more volatile growth rates on a quarter-on-quarter basis. Based on a review of our service deal pipeline, we continue to expect internal service revenue growth to be positive for the full year. 
Total adjusted OIBDA for the quarter was $261 million compared with $223 million in 2015. We grew adjusted OIBDA by 17.1% on a reported dollar basis and by 18.8% on a constant dollar basis. Year-to-date, adjusted OIBDA grew by 9.3% reported dollar and by 11.6% on a constant dollar basis. As we noted in our Q1 call, Recall is a lower-margin business in Iron Mountain. Therefore, as expected, our adjusted OIBDA margins were lower relative to the first quarter of the year. This impacts flow through to our adjusted EPS, FFO per share and AFFO results. As synergies build in future quarters, this picture will be reversed. 
Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.24 compared with $0.28 in 2015. Year-to-date, adjusted EPS was $0.55 compared with $0.60 in 2015. In the second quarter, adjusted EPS was impacted by the amortization of Recall's customer relationship values and the increased depreciation expense of Recall's legacy racking structures. The amortization expense of customer relationships flows through to FFO per share. However, the increased depreciation does not because real estate depreciation is excluded from FFO per share. 
FFO per share was $0.47 for the quarter compared to $0.49 in the year-ago period. Year-to-date, FFO per share was $0.98 compared with $0.99 in the year-ago period. 
AFFO was $159 million compared with $131 million in the year-ago period. Importantly, AFFO was not impacted by the increased depreciation and amortization expense in the second quarter, as these are noncash items and do not impact our AFFO or cash available for distribution. Year-to-date, AFFO was $301 million compared with $259 million in 2015. AFFO for the year-to-date is at the high end of our expectations. However, we expect to remain within our ranges for the full year. 
Similar to prior quarters, on Page 20 of the supplemental, we're providing a reconciliation between AFFO and cash flow from operations as presented in our GAAP cash flow statement, so you can more readily see the cash items that are not typically of a recurring nature. 
Our structural tax rate for this quarter came out to 17.2% compared with 13.9% in the prior year. Expected year-over-year increase in our structural tax rates was mostly driven by the legacy Recall business, which has higher exposure to international markets with their respective foreign tax rates and which do not have the same tax efficiency as we do in the U.S. with the REIT structure. Also, the tax rate this quarter is below the previously communicated run rate expectation of 20% as our pretax income was impacted by Recall integration and deal costs. For the remainder of 2016, we expect our tax rate to be approximately 18%, as a result of these Recall costs. However, beyond 2016, we expect the tax rate to be closer to 19% to 20%. 
Let's turn to our financial performance by segments. In North American Records and Information Management, or RIM, internal storage revenue increased by 0.7% for the second quarter. North American RIM internal service revenue declined by 1.2%. Growth in shredding and scanning was offset by declines in core transportation. 
North American Data Management, or DM, delivered storage rental internal growth of 1.3% for the second quarter. Internal service revenue in DM declined, as we continue to see reductions in the frequency of tape rotation and related transportation activity, partially offset by strong growth in new Data Management offerings. In addition, we had a large project which benefited the prior year periods. After normalizing for this, DM service revenues performed in line with prior quarters. DM adjusted OIBDA margins improved year-over-year due to a decrease in overhead cost as we continue to realize transformation benefits. The Western Europe segment generated 0.1% internal storage rental growth, and internal service revenue declined by 4.6%, primarily as a result of lower activity in transportation-related revenue and lower project revenue. The low internal storage growth in Western Europe was due to a large customer win in the year-ago period and certain contract renegotiations that occurred this quarter. Adjusted OIBDA margins improved year-over-year in Western Europe due to lower G&A expenses. 
The other International segments, which is made up primarily of emerging markets in Australia, showed strong growth in both storage and service revenues. Internal storage rental growth was 8.6% and internal service growth was 5.3% for the quarter. Other International adjusted OIBDA margins were 25% for the quarter, in line with our expectations. 
We're pleased with the progress we've made with our transformation initiative. During the second quarter, we did not incur significant costs related to transformation, as the focus was not headcount-related, rather it was on streamlining business processes. Year-to-date, we've actioned $28 million of the $50 million exit rate savings and have line of site on the incremental $22 million to be implemented by the end of this year. Our overall savings outlook for transformation remains consistent with what we laid out at our Investor Day at October, with $125 million of cumulative savings by 2018. 
Let me now talk about Recall integration progress and provide details on the cost we've incurred so far in 2016 to achieve synergies and integrate Recall within our business. As Bill explained, the synergy program is ahead of schedule. As you can see on the supplemental on Page 25, we expect to exit this year having already achieved more than 80% of the total synergies originally anticipated for 2017. Our expectations of total cost to achieve the target synergies are still consistent with prior projections. Because we're accelerating synergies, this set us up for a strong run rate for 2017, we expect to incur roughly $10 million more in costs in 2016 than originally contemplated. Year-to-date, we've incurred $37 million of integration costs and $32 million of deal close costs. Additional details can be found in our 10-Q, which will be filed later today. Please note these expenses are excluded from our adjusted OIBDA calculation as they are onetime in nature. 
Let's turn to our outlook for 2016 on Page 12 of the supplemental. Business trends and fundamentals remain consistent given the durability of our business. We remain on track to achieve our short- and long-term financial objectives. Please note that although our guidance assumes divestitures would occur on day one, the benefit from business is yet to be divested but running through our operating results is not significant some legacy Recall assets was sold to Access nearly at the same time as the closed, so they are not reflected in our results. The remaining legacy Recall assets to be sold are included in discontinued operations, therefore, not flowing through our operating income. Lastly, the remaining Iron Mountain assets to be disposed of, are flowing our financials, however, with an immaterial benefit for the quarter and full year. Overall, our core Iron Mountain business is performing to plan. Recall contribution is tracking in line with our previous expectations, and we have accelerated the realization of net synergies for the year, which is why we brought up the lower end of our adjusted OIBDA guidance by $5 million.
Let me now refer you to the table at the bottom of our guidance page, on Page 12 of the supplemental, to follow our expectations for full year adjusted OIBDA. We thought it'd be helpful to cover how results track against our original expectations, but please note, we'll be not reporting actual results separately given our financial statements are now fully integrated. Our standalone expectation for Iron Mountain's core business remains $950 million to $970 million, consistent with what we previously communicated. And our performance in the first half of the year is tracking right in line with our expectation. For the second quarter, excluding Recall's base and synergies less divestitures, Iron Mountain's standalone adjusted OIBDA was in line with Q1 results at -- of $235 million. So year-to-date, Iron Mountain stand-alone adjusted OIBDA was roughly $470 million. 
In the second half of the year, we expect to realize $7 million to $10 million of transformation benefits to offset costs associated with that program in the first half. We also expect a ramp in the business as our storage base continues to expand. This ramp is consistent with 2015, during which second half year results were $10 million higher than the first half on a reported dollar basis. If you annualize the first have actual run rate, our transformation benefits and a similar ramp to last year, standalone expectations are in line. 
Now let me address the second line related to Recall's contribution for the year. Prior to divestitures, we expect the Recall business to contribute $115 million of adjusted OIBDA at the midpoint. This reflects 8 months of Recall contribution, and our range implies $13 million to $15 million per month of contribution prior to synergies and divestitures. Lastly, we're expecting $18 million of adjusted OIBDA synergies net of the impact of the divestitures for the year. As Bill noted, this is up from our initial expectation of $15 million. As a result, our adjusted OIBDA guidance range for 2016 is now $1,075,000,000 to $1,110,000,000. 
For adjusted EPS, our guidance remains unchanged. Although our expectations for the structural tax rate are lower than previously anticipated, this benefit will likely be offset by the accelerated depreciation of Recall racking structures.
Although our total normalized dollar AFFO guidance remains the same, we changed our FFO per share guidance to reflect where we expect the final weighted average share count will settle for the year. We did not update adjusted EPS for this impact because the benefit is offset by the incremental real estate depreciation expense mentioned earlier. Please also note that on a constant dollar guidance remains close to reported dollars. Assuming current rates hold, we do not see a downside from FX in our guidance.
Moving to our expected cash available for distributions and investment for 2016. We continue to estimate that it will be roughly $600 million. This provides ample funding for dividends and core growth racking investment. Our capital deployment plans for 2016 are unchanged. We continue to expect capital expenditures, which include real estate and nonreal estate maintenance and nonreal investment, to be in line with the figures we provided in our last earnings call and to total $170 million for the year. Our expectation for total real estate investment spend remains $320 million. This includes $70 million in core growth racking investment, and the remainder of our real estate spend is expected to be in real estate consolidation, development, data center and some lease conversions. As we've said in the past, we're focused on consolidating facilities, particularly given the Recall transaction. We expect real estate consolidation will provide upsides to synergies in the long term, but it's too early for us to quantify the exact benefit at this time. 
For M&A, we continue to expect to spend roughly $150 million, with approximately $110 million in emerging markets, $50 million in developed markets. 
Dividend expectations remain consistent with our previous guidance for 2016. Our dividend per share is then expected to grow from $1.94 this year to a minimum of $2.20 in 2017 and $2.35 in 2018 as we realize the majority benefits from [ph] transformation savings and Recall synergies. Beyond 2018, we expect to grow dividend per share roughly 4% per year. Importantly, our dividend payout ratio as a percent of AFFO is in line with prior expectations and should reduce to 70% by 2020, which underscores the strength of our dividend coverage. In addition, we're targeting a leverage ratio of 5.0x by 2020. 
Shifting briefly to the balance sheet. At the quarter-end, we had liquidity of approximately $580 million, and our lease adjusted debt ratio was slightly up at 5.8x as expected. Our leverage ratio increased primarily as a result of the timing of Recall integration and deal cost discussed earlier. We expect to end the year with a leverage ratio of 5.7x as we start realizing synergies and transformation savings. As many of you may already know, we refinanced the $850 million bridge facility associated with the Recall transaction, primarily with long-term debt. We raised $750 million in aggregate principal amounts on senior unsecured notes, which included $500 million of 4 3/8% due in 2021 and $250 million of 5 3/8% due in 2026. Our unsecured debt was priced at spreads similar to business services issuers [indiscernible] 2 notches higher than Iron Mountain and at the top of the spread range for investment-grade issuers, which reflect debt investors' favorable view of our predictable cash flow. In addition, we also amended our credit agreement and extended its maturity to 2019. 
So overall, we're pleased with the performance we saw in the second quarter and year-to-date. Our results are driven by the durability of our business and execution of our long-term plan. We're excited with the progress we've made so far in integrating Recall and pleased that we'll be realizing synergies early than expected. Looking ahead, we're confident that we well positioned to deliver on our long-term goals. We remain highly focused on extending the durability of our storage rental business, which drives growth and cash available to fund dividends and core growth investments. 
I'll now hand the call back to Bill."

Before I turn it over to questions, I should say that I think our Transformation Program probably has produced the caffeine in my coffee in the morning, so I did, I think, misstate that Access. We sold 23 U.S. markets to Access. I meant to say 13. So 13 is much better than 23. And I will talk to the transformation folks to kind of put the caffeine back in my coffee.

So first of all, let's look at the absolute net volume, right? So if you look at Q2 '16 this quarter, you'll see that outperms and destructions, if you subtract that from new sales and organic growth, you have a net before acquisitions of 3.8% growth versus a Q1 of 3% growth, so the net growth has actually increased. But coming to specifically your question about what's going on with outperms  is, the 2.3% in Q1 of '16 is not out of norm [ph] . So if you kind of go back and you look at the supplemental on Page 11, you'll see that over the last 12 month -- or less, say, even more than 1.5 years or so, you'll see going back into Q3 of '14, it goes somewhere between 2.1% and 2.3%. Where you really see the spike is in the Q2 '16 number, where you see that go up to 2.6%, so it's really a Q2 issue. But as I said, the net of volume is positive. And for those that followed Recall, there was a program that Doug would euphoniously call, ""Close the Gap."" and 2 things he referred to was the 700-or-so basis points lower gross margin that their business yielded in terms of their overall business. And the other thing is, he highlighted that the level of outperms that they have relative to ours. So where we see the roughly the 30 bp increase in outperms from Q1 to Q2, that's driven by Recall's -- emerging Recall's business into ours, which we knew was a -- had a less -- had a higher volatility or a higher turn in that. But you'll see that come down over time because obviously, we're wrapping the same customer loyalty program, which I think we've spoken on previous calls where we have a -- we built a -- with outside help, we built an algorithm that helps predict 6 to 12 months ahead of time certain customer issues that prevent the outperms."

I mean, we brought in some outside help and advisers that know how to build these tools, and it looks at a number of different things. It looks at volume through the call center. It looks at number of boxes coming in. It looks at the types of complaints that we're getting from a customer, and there's a number of different things that you pick up. The last time we gave them a price increase. And you look at those different pieces of data, and it's pretty accurate in terms of predicting when you're heading for a crisis with that customer and then you can intervene. And I forget exactly what their number was, but it was significantly -- it was at least a full point higher than ours in terms of the outperms. And you're seeing that when -- that averaging in the when we go from the 2.3% to 2.6%. So it is something -- it is isn't structural in the Recall business.

Okay, so in terms of their historical trend, so pretty much as we expected, other than -- we expected, as I answered to Shlomo, we expected that the outperms would be higher and that pretty much translated straight across because we could see that in the results. The growth and opportunity we see in the middle market is pretty much what we expected. I think that the -- so that  the -- the trends of merging their business into ours were pretty much on track. We -- the margin that both I commented on and Rod commented on, we commented on last quarter before we closed, we knew that, that was the case. I think the one thing that has been the -- so it's been more of an upside and I think the upside has been more around the people, not that we expected to get bad people. But I think when you buy a competitor, you always kind of think that they're different than you and when you're talking to customers, you typically demonize the competitor. And guess what? They have blood flowing their veins just like us, and we've got some really good people as a result of it. And they had almost identical values and code of conduct as we had. In fact, we laid the 2 slides up next to each other, we did it at a Townhall, and they're virtually almost the same. So I don't know who copied from who. So we've actually, probably, if anything, have integrated the people much quicker, and when I say integrated, not just get them into slots, but people feel like they've been around a lot longer than they have and if you know what I mean. In other words, they didn't spend a lot of time trying to figure stuff out or adapt to a new culture. So that part has been better than we thought. But in terms of the way the numbers have flowed in, we haven't found any surprises."

So I think we also pretty -- are kind of foreshadowed at the last quarter that we've thought be would see a drop in service revenue that the next -- Q2 wouldn't be as strong as Q1. And so obviously, we could see the pipeline, and we knew how that worked. The one thing that I think again we commented last time and -- is that we -- as we shift more to project-based rather than transportation-based service revenue, we do expect it to be pipeline-dependent and, therefore, more project-dependent and, therefore, more lumpy. So it's much easier to predict that if you look over a 12-month period than if you look at it on a 1-month or even a 3-month period. So if we -- as that as a backdrop, if we look forward to the rest of the year, we like the pipeline, the booking pipeline -- the bookings and the pipeline that we see for the rest of the year. So we're very confident that for the total year, we will see positive service revenue growth, which is obviously means that the new services are offsetting the declines that we talked about in the transportation, which has driven into the structural shift and the way that the information is being used. So we feel very good that for the full year, you'll see a trend that's consistent with Q1 as the pipeline turns into bookings and turns into projects that we see in front of us."

30292,374809183,1025344,"Iron Mountain Incorporated, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 04, 2016",2016-08-04,"Earnings Calls","Iron Mountain Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Melissa, and good morning, everyone. We're off to a very good start after our May 2 closing of the Recall acquisition. The base Iron Mountain results continue to show financial and operating performance, which is consistent with quarter 1. Syne",2110,"Thank you, Melissa, and good morning, everyone. We're off to a very good start after our May 2 closing of the Recall acquisition. The base Iron Mountain results continue to show financial and operating performance, which is consistent with quarter 1. Synergies from Recall are coming in faster than anticipated in 2016, and based on all this, we reconfirm the full year guidance we gave back in April. 
We're also pleased to welcome Stuart Brown, as our new CFO. Stuart officially joined us last week, and I know he's looking forward to getting more engaged in the business and meeting with our investors and analysts. Stuart has a unique blend of both global operating company and REIT experience, and I know he'll be a great fit with our executive team. And whilst we are sad that Rod will be leaving us, he'll be around for a few months yet to ensure a smooth transition to Stuart. 
Turning now to our progress on Recall's benefits and integration. First, just to summarize. Overall, the acquisition makes us the only global platform in our industry as we continue to expand our ability to meet customers' information management and storage needs as they face increasing regulation, ongoing cybersecurity threats and seek to turn information into business value. As we've noted in the past, this transaction has 3 core benefits: first, it enhances our global footprint, particularly in emerging markets; second, it strengthens our ability to reach mid-market businesses, where Recall was very present and Iron Mountain was significantly underrepresented in this very large and high-margin segment; and third, the level of synergy enables significant growth in AFFO and cash available for distribution. This rapid and large expansion of cash flow allows us to simultaneously invest in new product and innovation for the benefit of our customers, significantly grow our dividend whilst simultaneously delevering and markedly bringing down our payout ratio. 
Finally, these -- this acquisition further supports the trust our customers have in Iron Mountain to serve both their current and future needs: Trust in Iron Mountain to protect what matters most, trust that Iron Mountain will be available to continue to support them in 50 years' time, and trust in Iron Mountain to continue to use its scale for innovation and to provide expertise, products and services designed to get the most out of their overall storage and information assets.
In the customer interactions we have had since closing the acquisition, the commentary has been very positive as they can see how we both have the intention and the resources to be even more innovative. An example of our product innovation was reported in a recent Bloomberg profile, highlighting the work we are doing on behalf of MTV as they celebrate their 35th anniversary. 
On a more operational note, I'm pleased with the team's work to welcome new customers and begin integrating operations. During the second quarter, we accomplished a number of critical integration-related initiatives whilst continuing to pursue our transformation agenda. And we delivered internal storage rental revenue and volume growth in the base Iron Mountain business consistent with the growth we saw in the first quarter of this year. In short, we kept our eye on the ball despite all the activities surrounding the Recall close. 
More specifically, since the closing on May 2, our integration progress includes several key initiatives. We completed our review of Recall's leadership and immediately brought the management teams together, enhancing our organization through the retention of key former executives to lead areas such as customer experience, mid-market and SMB sales as well as key finance roles in a number of country and territory management positions. We converted Recall's operations in 4 countries into our REIT structure. 
We completed the disposition of Recall's business in 23 (sic) [ 13 ] U.S. markets as required by the United States Department of Justice. We received final clearance from the United Kingdom Competition and Markets Authority. We solicited and are currently evaluating bids on required dispositions in additional jurisdictions. We began a portfolio review of both companies' service offerings to determine optimal platforms for ensuring continued superior customer service. And we undertook real estate reviews in select markets and identified initial consolidation opportunities in France, Spain, the United Kingdom and Australia as well as in the United States. As a result of these and other quick actions and outstanding facilitation from the transitioning Recall teams, we're getting the synergies faster than expected. This means more impact this year. In fact, we will exit 2016 having achieved more than 80% of the total synergies we expected to have achieved by year-end 2017. 
We appreciate that given the closing of Recall a month into the quarter, our second quarter results don't fully reflect Recall's contribution. And as we noted on last quarter's call, Q2 margins would reflect that Recall's core EBITDA margins are lower than ours.  In fact, Recall's EBITDA margins have consistently been more than 700 basis points lower than ours, but we saw a bit more impact from that initially given that the assets to be divested and those already sold are among the higher-margin markets in their portfolio. 
You will recall the execution of our integration program increases the Recall base margin business by pulling 2 levers: first, in the near term, we're achieving synergies in SG&A and labor cost; and second, in the medium term, we'll improve our operating leverage as we consolidate facilities. Rod will have more detail shortly and walk you through the buildup to our full year expectations. In brief, when we prorate year-to-date results, add in accelerated synergies, second half transformation benefit and typical ramp we see in the business throughout the year, we are comfortable slightly raising the bottom end of our guidance range relative to what we provided back in April. 
Now turning to some of the quarter's results at a high level before Rod walks you through the ins and outs that can also be found on the bridging graphs in our supplemental report. Total revenue growth in constant dollars was 19% with similar growth rates in constant dollar storage, rental and service revenue. On an internal basis, storage growth was 2.1% and in line with levels achieved in Q4 and Q1. We continue to expect average storage rental internal growth to be around 2.5% for the full year. Internal volume, or prior to acquisitions, was positive in all segments and consistent with recent quarter's performance at 1.7% worldwide growth. Service revenue was flat over last year, reflecting the variability in timing of projects. However, based on our service project pipeline, we continue to expect positive internal service revenue as well as service gross profit growth for the full year. As mentioned previously, given our expected service mix, we will maintain our focus on increasing service gross profit rather than purely gross margins. Our new service offerings are sometimes lower margin, but generate attractive returns due to the minimal capital investment required. Consistent with this focus, you will note service gross profit was up more than 18% in the second quarter, exceeding the growth in constant dollar service revenue. 
Turning to progress on our strategic plans. During the quarter, we continued to advance each of the 3 pillars of the plan as well as the foundational elements that support it. I will quickly highlight progress in each of the 3 pillars, namely, getting the most out of our developed markets, increasing our presence in the fast-growing emerging markets, and expansion in faster-growing adjacent businesses. In developed markets, which includes both North America RIM and our Western European segment, we had 3 million cubic feet of internal volume growth during the quarter. In emerging markets, our goal is to expand our presence and leverage our scale, driving these markets to 20% of our total revenue by 2020. Recall's footprint in emerging markets supports that objective and has helped drive our emerging market business to 16.4% of total revenue on a constant dollar basis as of the end of Q2. 
Additionally, as our visibility on closing of Recall's transaction became clearer, we resumed acquisition activity and moved into new emerging markets during the year. Earlier this week, we announced plans to acquire the information management operations of Santa Fe Group in 10 countries, mainly in Southeast Asia, for approximately EUR 27 million. The deal also marks our entry into 4 new emerging markets: Macau, the Philippines, Indonesia and South Korea, as well as further bolstering our already strong positions in Hong Kong, Singapore, India, Taiwan and Malaysia, providing a great foundation for further expansion in this dynamic and higher-growth region. 
We continue to nurture a deep, diverse pipeline of accretive M&A opportunities in emerging markets where we can leverage our global footprint and deep customer relationships to capture the initial wave of records management outsourcing that is in the early days and -- within these faster-growing markets. 
Before turning away from our International operations, I should comment on Brexit. Importantly, we don't expect to see a significant impact. We have built scenarios related to the potential implications of the decision with particular focus on our customers, the supply base, our staff and the regulatory and fiscal frameworks in which we operate. We will continue to monitor developments closely and watch for any shifting legal obligations governing the management of information. But as other multinationals have acknowledged, it'll be some time before any meaningful movement toward an exit from the EU gets underway. In terms of our core business, it is unlikely to have much impact from a constant currency perspective; we're generally naturally hedged. 
As for adjacent businesses, we are on track to achieve our stated goal to generate 5% of our total worldwide revenue from adjacent businesses by the end of 2020, up from just 2% at the end of 2015. In our data center business, we had several recent big wins, bringing us to 80% committed in our first-phase building in our above-ground facility in Boston. Combining our Boston facility with the undergrounds in Boyers, Pennsylvania, and Kansas City, Missouri, our data center space is greater than 90% committed, and we are on track to achieve internal growth approaching 20% in this business area. In our art storage business, we're making good progress and acquired another small business, a good example of what we believe will be a long-term consolidation play. 
Overall, between the progress we're making in emerging markets as well as adjacent businesses, we are well on track to achieve our combined goal of having the expansion of our emerging market presence and adjacent businesses yield 25% of our total revenue mix by 2020, which is up from about 17.5% of our total business mix today. 
In terms of supporting foundations for the plan, we continue to make progress on our transformation initiative to remove $125 million in SG&A. Also, as previously disclosed, the remaining $25 million of overhead savings will be actioned in 2017 and the full amount for the Transformation Program will be reflected in our 2018 adjusted OIBDA. Given the timing of Recall synergies, our Transformation Program and expected ramp in the business, we remain confident that cash flow will be in line with the growth expectations we highlighted during an Investor Day and again on our April 1 call, which provides the foundation for our expected dividend growth. 
As a reminder, we expect to grow dividend per share by about 13% in 2017 as the synergies and transformation benefits flow through our results, and by an additional 7% in 2018 and 4% annual growth thereafter, whilst also funding core growth racking, M&A and overall investments in support of our previously presented 2020 plan. As we progress this plan, we'll have more cash available to support discretionary investment, which means we'll borrow less to fund our growth plan and continue to delever. And at the same time, we'll reduce our payout ratio as a percentage of AFFO. 
Our operations are underpinned by our very durable, growing business that performs consistently throughout business cycles. In addition, we're extending that durability through solid execution of our plan in developed markets, identifying and capturing opportunities in both emerging markets and adjacent businesses, and continuing to enhance our cost structure in both service and overhead. Our durable storage business generates roughly $1.9 billion of annual storage net operating income, which exceeds that generated by leaders in both the industrial and self-storage sectors. 
What distinguishes our business is its inherent durability, and it is this durability that delivers consistent levels of operating performance in both good and bad times. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Rod."

I'll begin today with a high-level overview of our second quarter and year-to-date performance, which included a 2-month benefit from the Recall acquisition compared with the prior year. In addition, I will review our results by segment, pro",2482,"Thanks, Bill. I'll begin today with a high-level overview of our second quarter and year-to-date performance, which included a 2-month benefit from the Recall acquisition compared with the prior year. In addition, I will review our results by segment, provide an update on our transformation initiative and summarize our successful bridge loan refinancing. Lastly, I will touch on the strong progress we're making integrating Recall into our business as well as our outlook for 2016, which remains essentially unchanged since April.
Let's turn to our worldwide financial results. Consistent with prior quarters, we have provided bridging schedules for total revenue, adjusted OIBDA, adjusted earnings per share and FFO per share to explain key variances in our year-on-year performance. These schedules can be found on Pages 21 through 24 of the supplemental. 
Let me briefly walk you through the highlights. For the second quarter, total reported revenues were $884 million compared with $760 million in 2015. Excluding the year-over-year negative FX impact of approximately 2% or roughly $17 million, on a constant dollar basis, revenues grew by 18.6%. For the first half of the year, reported revenues were $1.63 billion compared with $1.51 billion in 2015. Excluding Recall and other smaller acquisitions, total internal storage rental revenue was up 2.1% for Q2, consistent with the growth we saw in Q1. In contrast, internal service revenue was down 2.1% compared with growth of 1.6% we saw in Q1. 
As we noted in our last call, service revenues are more project-based, which have more volatile growth rates on a quarter-on-quarter basis. Based on a review of our service deal pipeline, we continue to expect internal service revenue growth to be positive for the full year. 
Total adjusted OIBDA for the quarter was $261 million compared with $223 million in 2015. We grew adjusted OIBDA by 17.1% on a reported dollar basis and by 18.8% on a constant dollar basis. Year-to-date, adjusted OIBDA grew by 9.3% reported dollar and by 11.6% on a constant dollar basis. As we noted in our Q1 call, Recall is a lower-margin business than Iron Mountain. Therefore, as expected, our adjusted OIBDA margins were lower relative to the first quarter of the year. This impacts flow-through to our adjusted EPS, FFO per share and AFFO results. As synergies build in future quarters, this picture will be reversed. 
Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.24 compared with $0.28 in 2015. Year-to-date adjusted EPS was $0.55 compared with $0.60 in 2015. In the second quarter, adjusted EPS was impacted by the amortization of Recall's customer relationship values and the increased depreciation expense of Recall's legacy racking structures. The amortization expense of customer relationships flows through to FFO per share. However, the increased depreciation does not because real estate depreciation is excluded from FFO per share. 
FFO per share was $0.47 for the quarter compared to $0.49 in the year-ago period. Year-to-date, FFO per share was $0.98 compared with $0.99 in the year-ago period. 
AFFO was $159 million compared with $131 million in the year-ago period. Importantly, AFFO was not impacted by the increased depreciation and amortization expense in the second quarter, as these are noncash items and do not impact our AFFO or cash available for distribution. Year-to-date, AFFO was $301 million compared with $259 million in 2015. AFFO for the year-to-date is at the high end of our expectations. However, we expect to remain within our ranges for the full year. 
Similar to prior quarters, on Page 20 of the supplemental, we're providing a reconciliation between AFFO and cash flow from operations as presented in our GAAP cash flow statement so you can more readily see the cash items that are not typically of a recurring nature. 
Our structural tax rate for this quarter came out to 17.2% compared with 13.9% in the prior year. Expected year-over-year increase in our structural tax rates was mostly driven by the legacy Recall business, which has higher exposure to international markets with their respective foreign tax rates and which do not have the same tax efficiency as we do in the U.S. with the REIT structure. Also, the tax rate this quarter is below the previously communicated run rate expectation of 20% as our pretax income was impacted by Recall integration and deal costs. For the remainder of 2016, we expect our tax rate to be approximately 18% as a result of these Recall costs. However, beyond 2016, we expect the tax rate to be closer to 19% to 20%. 
Let's turn to our financial performance by segment. In North American Records and Information Management, or RIM, internal storage revenue increased by 0.7% for the second quarter. North American RIM internal service revenue declined by 1.2%. Growth in shredding and scanning was offset by declines in core transportation. 
North American Data Management, or DM, delivered storage rental internal growth of 1.3% for the second quarter. Internal service revenue in DM declined, as we continue to see reductions in the frequency of tape rotation and related transportation activity, partially offset by strong growth in new Data Management offerings. In addition, we had a large project which benefited the prior year period. After normalizing for this, DM service revenues performed in line with prior quarters. DM adjusted OIBDA margins improved year-over-year due to a decrease in overhead cost as we continue to realize transformation benefits. The Western Europe segment generated 0.1% internal storage rental growth, and internal service revenue declined by 4.6%, primarily as a result of lower activity in transportation-related revenue and lower project revenue. The low internal storage growth in Western Europe was due to a large customer win in the year-ago period and certain contract renegotiations that occurred this quarter. Adjusted OIBDA margins improved year-over-year in Western Europe due to lower G&A expenses. 
The Other International segment, which is made up primarily of emerging markets and Australia, showed strong growth in both storage and service revenues. Internal storage rental growth was 8.6% and internal service growth was 5.3% for the quarter. Other International adjusted OIBDA margins were 25% for the quarter, in line with our expectations. 
We're pleased with the progress we've made with our transformation initiative. During the second quarter, we did not incur significant costs related to transformation, as the focus was not headcount-related, rather it was on streamlining business processes. Year-to-date, we've actioned $28 million of the $50 million exit rate savings and have line of sight on the incremental $22 million to be implemented by the end of this year. Our overall savings outlook for transformation remains consistent with what we laid out at our Investor Day in October, with $125 million of cumulative savings by 2018. 
Let me now talk about the Recall integration progress and provide details on the cost we've incurred so far in 2016 to achieve synergies and integrate Recall within our business. As Bill explained, the synergy program is ahead of schedule. As you can see on the supplemental on Page 25, we expect to exit this year having already achieved more than 80% of the total synergies originally anticipated for 2017. Our expectations of total cost to achieve the target synergies are still consistent with prior projections. Because we're accelerating synergies to set us up for a strong run rate for 2017, we expect to incur roughly $10 million more in costs in 2016 than originally contemplated. Year-to-date, we've incurred $37 million of integration costs and $32 million of deal close costs. Additional details can be found in our 10-Q, which will be filed later today. Please note these expenses are excluded from our adjusted OIBDA calculation as they are onetime in nature. 
Let's turn to our outlook for 2016 on Page 12 of the supplemental. Business trends and fundamentals remain consistent given the durability of our business. We remain on track to achieve our short- and long-term financial objectives. Please note that although our guidance assumes divestitures would occur on day one, the benefit from businesses yet to be divested but running through our operating results is not significant. Some legacy Recall assets were sold to Access nearly at the same time as the close, so they are not reflected in our results. The remaining legacy Recall assets to be sold are included in discontinued operations, therefore, not flowing through our operating income. Lastly, the remaining Iron Mountain assets to be disposed of are flowing through our financials, however, with an immaterial benefit for the quarter and full year. Overall, our core Iron Mountain business is performing to plan, Recall contribution is tracking in line with our previous expectations, and we have accelerated the realization of net synergies for the year, which is why we brought up the lower end of our adjusted OIBDA guidance by $5 million.
Let me now refer you to the table at the bottom of our guidance page, on Page 12 of the supplemental, to follow our expectations for full year adjusted OIBDA. We thought it would be helpful to cover how results track against our original expectations, but please note, we'll be not reporting actual results separately given our financial statements are now fully integrated. Our standalone expectation for Iron Mountain's core business remains $950 million to $970 million, consistent with what we previously communicated. And our performance in the first half of the year is tracking right in line with our expectation. For the second quarter, excluding Recall's base and synergies less divestitures, Iron Mountain's standalone adjusted OIBDA was in line with Q1 results at -- of $235 million. So year-to-date, Iron Mountain standalone adjusted OIBDA was roughly $470 million. 
In the second half of the year, we expect to realize $7 million to $10 million of transformation benefits to offset costs associated with that program in the first half. We also expect a ramp in the business as our storage base continues to expand. This ramp is consistent with 2015, during which second half year results were $10 million higher than the first half on a reported dollar basis. If you annualize the first half actual run rate, our transformation benefits and a similar ramp to last year, standalone expectations are in line. 
Now let me address the second line related to Recall's contribution for the year. Prior to divestitures, we expect the Recall business to contribute $115 million of adjusted OIBDA at the midpoint. This reflects 8 months of Recall contribution, and our range implies $13 million to $15 million per month of contribution prior to synergies and divestitures. Lastly, we're expecting $18 million of adjusted OIBDA synergies net of the impact of the divestitures for the year. As Bill noted, this is up from our initial expectation of $15 million. As a result, our adjusted OIBDA guidance range for 2016 is now $1,075,000,000 to $1,110,000,000. 
For adjusted EPS, our guidance remains unchanged. Although our expectations for the structural tax rate are lower than previously anticipated, this benefit will likely be offset by the accelerated depreciation of Recall racking structures.
Although our total normalized dollar AFFO guidance remains the same, we changed our FFO-per-share guidance to reflect where we expect the final weighted average share count will settle for the year. We did not update adjusted EPS for this impact because the benefit is offset by the incremental real estate depreciation expense mentioned earlier. Please also note that our constant dollar guidance remains close to reported dollars. Assuming current rates hold, we do not see a downside from FX in our guidance.
Moving to our expected cash available for distributions and investment for 2016. We continue to estimate that it will be roughly $600 million. This provides ample funding for dividends and core growth racking investment. Our capital deployment plans for 2016 are unchanged. We continue to expect capital expenditures, which include real estate and non-real-estate maintenance and non-real-estate investment, to be in line with the figures we provided in our last earnings call and to total $170 million for the year. Our expectation for total real estate investment spend remains $320 million. This includes $70 million in core growth racking investment, and the remainder of our real estate spend is expected to be in real estate consolidation, development, data center and some lease conversions. As we've said in the past, we're focused on consolidating facilities, particularly given the Recall transaction. We expect real estate consolidation will provide upsides to synergies in the long term, but it's too early for us to quantify the exact benefit at this time. 
For M&A, we continue to expect to spend roughly $150 million, with approximately $100 million in emerging markets, $50 million in developed markets. 
Dividend expectations remain consistent with our previous guidance for 2016. Our dividend per share is then expected to grow from $1.94 this year to a minimum of $2.20 in 2017 and $2.35 in 2018 as we realize the majority of benefits from the transformation savings and Recall synergies. Beyond 2018, we expect to grow dividend per share at roughly 4% per year. Importantly, our dividend payout ratio as a percent of AFFO is in line with prior expectations and should reduce to 70% by 2020, which underscores the strength of our dividend coverage. In addition, we're targeting a leverage ratio of 5.0x by 2020. 
Shifting briefly to the balance sheet. At the quarter-end, we had liquidity of approximately $580 million, and our lease adjusted debt ratio was slightly up at 5.8x, as expected. Our leverage ratio increased primarily as a result of the timing of Recall integration and deal costs discussed earlier. We expect to end the year with a leverage ratio of 5.7x as we start realizing synergies and transformation savings. As many of you may already know, we refinanced the $850 million bridge facility associated with the Recall transaction, primarily with long-term debt. We raised $750 million in aggregate principal amounts from senior unsecured notes, which included $500 million at 4 3/8% due in 2021 and $250 million at 5 3/8% due in 2026. Our unsecured debt was priced at spreads similar to business services issuers rated 2 notches higher than Iron Mountain and at the top of the spread range for investment-grade issuers, which reflect debt investors' favorable view of our predictable cash flow. In addition, we also amended our credit agreement and extended its maturity to 2019. 
So overall, we're pleased with the performance we saw in the second quarter and year-to-date. Our results are driven by the durability of our business and execution of our long-term plan. We're excited with the progress we've made so far in integrating Recall and pleased that we'll be realizing synergies earlier than expected. Looking ahead, we're confident that we're well positioned to deliver on our long-term goals. We remain highly focused on extending the durability of our storage rental business, which drives growth and cash available to fund dividends and core growth investments. 
I'll now hand the call back to Bill."

Before I turn it over to questions, I should say that I think our Transformation Program probably has reduced the caffeine in my coffee in the morning, so I did, I think, misstate that Access -- we sold 23 U.S. markets to Access. I meant to say 13. So 13 is much better than 23. And I will talk to the transformation folks to kind of put the caffeine back in my coffee.

So first of all, let's look at the absolute net volume, right? So if you look at Q2 '16, this quarter, you'll see that outperms and destructions, if you subtract that from new sales and organic growth, you have a net before acquisitions of 3.8% growth versus a Q1 of 3% growth, so the net growth has actually increased. But coming to specifically your question about what's going on with outperms, is the 2.3% in Q1 of '16 is not out of norm. So if you kind of go back and you look at the supplemental on Page 11, you'll see that over the last 12 month -- or let's say even more than that, 1.5 years or so, you'll see going back into Q3 of '14, it goes somewhere between 2.1% and 2.3%. Where you really see the spike is in the Q2 '16 number, where you see that go up to 2.6%, so it's really a Q2 issue. But as I said, the net of volume is positive. And for those that followed Recall, there was a program that Doug would euphemistically call, ""Close the Gap."" And the 2 things he referred to was the 700-or-so basis points lower gross margin that their business yielded in terms of their overall business, and the other thing is, he highlighted that -- the level of outperms that they had relative to ours. So where we see the roughly the 30 bp increase in outperms from Q1 to Q2, that's driven by Recall's -- emerging Recall's business into ours, which we knew was a -- had a less -- had a higher volatility or a higher turn in that. But you'll see that come down over time because obviously, we're wrapping the same customer loyalty program, which I think we've spoken on previous calls, where we have a -- we built a -- with outside help, we built an algorithm that helps predict 6 to 12 months ahead of time certain customer issues that prevent the outperms."

And one of the things that Recall had is they couldn't afford to take the investment that we did. I mean, we brought in some outside help and advisers that know how to build these tools, and it looks at a number of different things. It looks at volume through the call center. It looks at number of boxes coming in. It looks at the types of complaints that we're getting from a customer, and there's a number of different things that you pick up the last time we gave them a price increase. And you look at those different pieces of data, and it's pretty accurate in terms of predicting when you're heading for a crisis with that customer and that you can intervene. And I forget exactly what their number was, but it was significantly -- it was at least a full point higher than ours in terms of the outperms. And you're seeing that when -- that averaging in the when we go from the 2.3% to 2.6%. So it is something -- it isn't structural in the Recall business.

We -- the margin that both I commented on and Rod commented on, we commented on last quarter before we closed, we knew that, that was the case. I think the one thing that has been the -- so it's been more of an upside and I think the upside has been more around the people, not that we expected to get bad people. But I think when you buy a competitor, you always kind of think that they're different than you and when you're talking to customers, you typically demonize the competitor. And guess what? They have blood flowing their veins just like us, and we've got some really good people as a result of it. And they had almost identical values and code of conduct as we had. In fact, we laid the 2 slides up next to each other, we did it at a town hall, and they're virtually almost the same. So I don't know who copied from who. So we've actually, probably, if anything, have integrated the people much quicker, and when I say integrated, not just get them into slots, but people feel like they've been around a lot longer than they have, if you know what I mean. In other words, they didn't spend a lot of time trying to figure stuff out or adapt to a new culture. So that part has been better than we thought.

And so obviously, we could see the pipeline, and we knew how that worked. The one thing that I think again we commented last time and -- is that we -- as we shift more to project-based rather than transportation-based service revenue, we do expect it to be pipeline-dependent and, therefore, more project-dependent and, therefore, more lumpy. So it's much easier to predict that if you look over a 12-month period than if you look at it on a 1-month or even a 3-month period. So if we -- as that as a backdrop, if we look forward to the rest of the year, we like the pipeline, the booking pipeline -- the bookings in the pipeline that we see for the rest of the year. So we're very confident that for the total year, we will see positive service revenue growth, which is -- obviously means that the new services are offsetting the declines that we talked about in the transportation, which has driven to the structural shift and the way that the information is being used. So we feel very good that for the full year, you'll see a trend that's consistent with Q1 as the pipeline turns into bookings and turns into projects that we see in front of us."

And the new services have been offsetting that -- between 40% and 50% of that decline. So the net decline, and you'll see that going forward as well, is that the net decline as the new services replace some of the transportation, as the tapes are becoming more for disaster recovery rather than for rotation, then you'll see that the typical 9% to 10% decline in transportation and being offset by 40% or 50% by the growth in new products.

We're off to a very good start after our May 2 closing of the Recall acquisition. The base Iron Mountain results continue to show financial and operating performance, which is consistent with quarter 1. Syne",2110,"Thank you, Melissa, and good morning, everyone. We're off to a very good start after our May 2 closing of the Recall acquisition. The base Iron Mountain results continue to show financial and operating performance, which is consistent with quarter 1. Synergies from Recall are coming in faster than anticipated in 2016, and based on all this, we reconfirm the full year guidance we gave back in April. 
We're also pleased to welcome Stuart Brown, as our new CFO. Stuart officially joined us last week, and I know he's looking forward to getting more engaged in the business and meeting with our investors and analysts. Stuart has a unique blend of both global operating company and REIT experience, and I know he'll be a great fit with our executive team. And whilst we are sad that Rod will be leaving us, he'll be around for a few months yet to ensure a smooth transition to Stuart. 
Turning now to our progress on Recall's benefits and integration. First, just to summarize. Overall, the acquisition makes us the only global platform in our industry as we continue to expand our ability to meet customers' information management and storage needs as they face increasing regulation, ongoing cybersecurity threats and seek to turn information into business value. As we've noted in the past, this transaction has 3 core benefits: first, it enhances our global footprint, particularly in emerging markets; second, it strengthens our ability to reach mid-market businesses, where Recall was very present and Iron Mountain was significantly underrepresented in this very large and high-margin segment; and third, the level of synergy enables significant growth in AFFO and cash available for distribution. This rapid and large expansion of cash flow allows us to simultaneously invest in new product and innovation for the benefit of our customers, significantly grow our dividend whilst simultaneously delevering and markedly bringing down our payout ratio. 
Finally, these -- this acquisition further supports the trust our customers have in Iron Mountain to serve both their current and future needs: Trust in Iron Mountain to protect what matters most, trust that Iron Mountain will be available to continue to support them in 50 years' time, and trust in Iron Mountain to continue to use its scale for innovation and to provide expertise, products and services designed to get the most out of their overall storage and information assets.
In the customer interactions we have had since closing the acquisition, the commentary has been very positive as they can see how we both have the intention and the resources to be even more innovative. An example of our product innovation was reported in a recent Bloomberg profile, highlighting the work we are doing on behalf of MTV as they celebrate their 35th anniversary. 
On a more operational note, I'm pleased with the team's work to welcome new customers and begin integrating operations. During the second quarter, we accomplished a number of critical integration-related initiatives whilst continuing to pursue our transformation agenda. And we delivered internal storage rental revenue and volume growth in the base Iron Mountain business consistent with the growth we saw in the first quarter of this year. In short, we kept our eye on the ball despite all the activities surrounding the Recall close. 
More specifically, since the closing on May 2, our integration progress includes several key initiatives. We completed our review of Recall's leadership and immediately brought the management teams together, enhancing our organization through the retention of key former executives to lead areas such as customer experience, mid-market and SMB sales as well as key finance roles in a number of country and territory management positions. We converted Recall's operations in 4 countries into our REIT structure. 
We completed the disposition of Recall's business in 23 (sic) [ 13 ] U.S. markets as required by the United States Department of Justice. We received final clearance from the United Kingdom Competition and Markets Authority. We solicited and are currently evaluating bids on required dispositions in additional jurisdictions. We began a portfolio review of both companies' service offerings to determine optimal platforms for ensuring continued superior customer service. And we undertook real estate reviews in select markets and identified initial consolidation opportunities in France, Spain, the United Kingdom and Australia as well as in the United States. As a result of these and other quick actions and outstanding facilitation from the transitioning Recall teams, we're getting the synergies faster than expected. This means more impact this year. In fact, we will exit 2016 having achieved more than 80% of the total synergies we expected to have achieved by year-end 2017. 
We appreciate that given the closing of Recall a month into the quarter, our second quarter results don't fully reflect Recall's contribution. And as we noted on last quarter's call, Q2 margins would reflect that Recall's core EBITDA margins are lower than ours.  In fact, Recall's EBITDA margins have consistently been more than 700 basis points lower than ours, but we saw a bit more impact from that initially given that the assets to be divested and those already sold are among the higher-margin markets in their portfolio. 
You will recall the execution of our integration program increases the Recall base margin business by pulling 2 levers: first, in the near term, we're achieving synergies in SG&A and labor cost; and second, in the medium term, we'll improve our operating leverage as we consolidate facilities. Rod will have more detail shortly and walk you through the buildup to our full year expectations. In brief, when we prorate year-to-date results, add in accelerated synergies, second half transformation benefit and typical ramp we see in the business throughout the year, we are comfortable slightly raising the bottom end of our guidance range relative to what we provided back in April. 
Now turning to some of the quarter's results at a high level before Rod walks you through the ins and outs that can also be found on the bridging graphs in our supplemental report. Total revenue growth in constant dollars was 19% with similar growth rates in constant dollar storage, rental and service revenue. On an internal basis, storage growth was 2.1% and in line with levels achieved in Q4 and Q1. We continue to expect average storage rental internal growth to be around 2.5% for the full year. Internal volume, or prior to acquisitions, was positive in all segments and consistent with recent quarter's performance at 1.7% worldwide growth. Service revenue was flat over last year, reflecting the variability in timing of projects. However, based on our service project pipeline, we continue to expect positive internal service revenue as well as service gross profit growth for the full year. As mentioned previously, given our expected service mix, we will maintain our focus on increasing service gross profit rather than purely gross margins. Our new service offerings are sometimes lower margin, but generate attractive returns due to the minimal capital investment required. Consistent with this focus, you will note service gross profit was up more than 18% in the second quarter, exceeding the growth in constant dollar service revenue. 
Turning to progress on our strategic plans. During the quarter, we continued to advance each of the 3 pillars of the plan as well as the foundational elements that support it. I will quickly highlight progress in each of the 3 pillars, namely, getting the most out of our developed markets, increasing our presence in the fast-growing emerging markets, and expansion in faster-growing adjacent businesses. In developed markets, which includes both North America RIM and our Western European segment, we had 3 million cubic feet of internal volume growth during the quarter. In emerging markets, our goal is to expand our presence and leverage our scale, driving these markets to 20% of our total revenue by 2020. Recall's footprint in emerging markets supports that objective and has helped drive our emerging market business to 16.4% of total revenue on a constant dollar basis as of the end of Q2. 
Additionally, as our visibility on closing of Recall's transaction became clearer, we resumed acquisition activity and moved into new emerging markets during the year. Earlier this week, we announced plans to acquire the information management operations of Santa Fe Group in 10 countries, mainly in Southeast Asia, for approximately EUR 27 million. The deal also marks our entry into 4 new emerging markets: Macau, the Philippines, Indonesia and South Korea, as well as further bolstering our already strong positions in Hong Kong, Singapore, India, Taiwan and Malaysia, providing a great foundation for further expansion in this dynamic and higher-growth region. 
We continue to nurture a deep, diverse pipeline of accretive M&A opportunities in emerging markets where we can leverage our global footprint and deep customer relationships to capture the initial wave of records management outsourcing that is in the early days and -- within these faster-growing markets. 
Before turning away from our International operations, I should comment on Brexit. Importantly, we don't expect to see a significant impact. We have built scenarios related to the potential implications of the decision with particular focus on our customers, the supply base, our staff and the regulatory and fiscal frameworks in which we operate. We will continue to monitor developments closely and watch for any shifting legal obligations governing the management of information. But as other multinationals have acknowledged, it'll be some time before any meaningful movement toward an exit from the EU gets underway. In terms of our core business, it is unlikely to have much impact from a constant currency perspective; we're generally naturally hedged. 
As for adjacent businesses, we are on track to achieve our stated goal to generate 5% of our total worldwide revenue from adjacent businesses by the end of 2020, up from just 2% at the end of 2015. In our data center business, we had several recent big wins, bringing us to 80% committed in our first-phase building in our above-ground facility in Boston. Combining our Boston facility with the undergrounds in Boyers, Pennsylvania, and Kansas City, Missouri, our data center space is greater than 90% committed, and we are on track to achieve internal growth approaching 20% in this business area. In our art storage business, we're making good progress and acquired another small business, a good example of what we believe will be a long-term consolidation play. 
Overall, between the progress we're making in emerging markets as well as adjacent businesses, we are well on track to achieve our combined goal of having the expansion of our emerging market presence and adjacent businesses yield 25% of our total revenue mix by 2020, which is up from about 17.5% of our total business mix today. 
In terms of supporting foundations for the plan, we continue to make progress on our transformation initiative to remove $125 million in SG&A. Also, as previously disclosed, the remaining $25 million of overhead savings will be actioned in 2017 and the full amount for the Transformation Program will be reflected in our 2018 adjusted OIBDA. Given the timing of Recall synergies, our Transformation Program and expected ramp in the business, we remain confident that cash flow will be in line with the growth expectations we highlighted during an Investor Day and again on our April 1 call, which provides the foundation for our expected dividend growth. 
As a reminder, we expect to grow dividend per share by about 13% in 2017 as the synergies and transformation benefits flow through our results, and by an additional 7% in 2018 and 4% annual growth thereafter, whilst also funding core growth racking, M&A and overall investments in support of our previously presented 2020 plan. As we progress this plan, we'll have more cash available to support discretionary investment, which means we'll borrow less to fund our growth plan and continue to delever. And at the same time, we'll reduce our payout ratio as a percentage of AFFO. 
Our operations are underpinned by our very durable, growing business that performs consistently throughout business cycles. In addition, we're extending that durability through solid execution of our plan in developed markets, identifying and capturing opportunities in both emerging markets and adjacent businesses, and continuing to enhance our cost structure in both service and overhead. Our durable storage business generates roughly $1.9 billion of annual storage net operating income, which exceeds that generated by leaders in both the industrial and self-storage sectors. 
What distinguishes our business is its inherent durability, and it is this durability that delivers consistent levels of operating performance in both good and bad times. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Rod."

I'll begin today with a high-level overview of our second quarter and year-to-date performance, which included a 2-month benefit from the Recall acquisition compared with the prior year. In addition, I will review our results by segment, provide an update on our transformation initiative and summarize our successful bridge loan refinancing. Lastly, I will touch on the strong progress we're making integrating Recall into our business as well as our outlook for 2016, which remains essentially unchanged since April.
Let's turn to our worldwide financial results. Consistent with prior quarters, we have provided bridging schedules for total revenue, adjusted OIBDA, adjusted earnings per share and FFO per share to explain key variances in our year-on-year performance. These schedules can be found on Pages 21 through 24 of the supplemental. 
Let me briefly walk you through the highlights. For the second quarter, total reported revenues were $884 million compared with $760 million in 2015. Excluding the year-over-year negative FX impact of approximately 2% or roughly $17 million, on a constant dollar basis, revenues grew by 18.6%. For the first half of the year, reported revenues were $1.63 billion compared with $1.51 billion in 2015. Excluding Recall and other smaller acquisitions, total internal storage rental revenue was up 2.1% for Q2, consistent with the growth we saw in Q1. In contrast, internal service revenue was down 2.1% compared with growth of 1.6% we saw in Q1. 
As we noted in our last call, service revenues are more project-based, which have more volatile growth rates on a quarter-on-quarter basis. Based on a review of our service deal pipeline, we continue to expect internal service revenue growth to be positive for the full year. 
Total adjusted OIBDA for the quarter was $261 million compared with $223 million in 2015. We grew adjusted OIBDA by 17.1% on a reported dollar basis and by 18.8% on a constant dollar basis. Year-to-date, adjusted OIBDA grew by 9.3% reported dollar and by 11.6% on a constant dollar basis. As we noted in our Q1 call, Recall is a lower-margin business than Iron Mountain. Therefore, as expected, our adjusted OIBDA margins were lower relative to the first quarter of the year. This impacts flow-through to our adjusted EPS, FFO per share and AFFO results. As synergies build in future quarters, this picture will be reversed. 
Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.24 compared with $0.28 in 2015. Year-to-date adjusted EPS was $0.55 compared with $0.60 in 2015. In the second quarter, adjusted EPS was impacted by the amortization of Recall's customer relationship values and the increased depreciation expense of Recall's legacy racking structures. The amortization expense of customer relationships flows through to FFO per share. However, the increased depreciation does not because real estate depreciation is excluded from FFO per share. 
FFO per share was $0.47 for the quarter compared to $0.49 in the year-ago period. Year-to-date, FFO per share was $0.98 compared with $0.99 in the year-ago period. 
AFFO was $159 million compared with $131 million in the year-ago period. Importantly, AFFO was not impacted by the increased depreciation and amortization expense in the second quarter, as these are noncash items and do not impact our AFFO or cash available for distribution. Year-to-date, AFFO was $301 million compared with $259 million in 2015. AFFO for the year-to-date is at the high end of our expectations. However, we expect to remain within our ranges for the full year. 
Similar to prior quarters, on Page 20 of the supplemental, we're providing a reconciliation between AFFO and cash flow from operations as presented in our GAAP cash flow statement so you can more readily see the cash items that are not typically of a recurring nature. 
Our structural tax rate for this quarter came out to 17.2% compared with 13.9% in the prior year. Expected year-over-year increase in our structural tax rates was mostly driven by the legacy Recall business, which has higher exposure to international markets with their respective foreign tax rates and which do not have the same tax efficiency as we do in the U.S. with the REIT structure. Also, the tax rate this quarter is below the previously communicated run rate expectation of 20% as our pretax income was impacted by Recall integration and deal costs. For the remainder of 2016, we expect our tax rate to be approximately 18% as a result of these Recall costs. However, beyond 2016, we expect the tax rate to be closer to 19% to 20%. 
Let's turn to our financial performance by segment. In North American Records and Information Management, or RIM, internal storage revenue increased by 0.7% for the second quarter. North American RIM internal service revenue declined by 1.2%. Growth in shredding and scanning was offset by declines in core transportation. 
North American Data Management, or DM, delivered storage rental internal growth of 1.3% for the second quarter. Internal service revenue in DM declined, as we continue to see reductions in the frequency of tape rotation and related transportation activity, partially offset by strong growth in new Data Management offerings. In addition, we had a large project which benefited the prior year period. After normalizing for this, DM service revenues performed in line with prior quarters. DM adjusted OIBDA margins improved year-over-year due to a decrease in overhead cost as we continue to realize transformation benefits. The Western Europe segment generated 0.1% internal storage rental growth, and internal service revenue declined by 4.6%, primarily as a result of lower activity in transportation-related revenue and lower project revenue. The low internal storage growth in Western Europe was due to a large customer win in the year-ago period and certain contract renegotiations that occurred this quarter. Adjusted OIBDA margins improved year-over-year in Western Europe due to lower G&A expenses. 
The Other International segment, which is made up primarily of emerging markets and Australia, showed strong growth in both storage and service revenues. Internal storage rental growth was 8.6% and internal service growth was 5.3% for the quarter. Other International adjusted OIBDA margins were 25% for the quarter, in line with our expectations. 
We're pleased with the progress we've made with our transformation initiative. During the second quarter, we did not incur significant costs related to transformation, as the focus was not headcount-related, rather it was on streamlining business processes. Year-to-date, we've actioned $28 million of the $50 million exit rate savings and have line of sight on the incremental $22 million to be implemented by the end of this year. Our overall savings outlook for transformation remains consistent with what we laid out at our Investor Day in October, with $125 million of cumulative savings by 2018. 
Let me now talk about the Recall integration progress and provide details on the cost we've incurred so far in 2016 to achieve synergies and integrate Recall within our business. As Bill explained, the synergy program is ahead of schedule. As you can see on the supplemental on Page 25, we expect to exit this year having already achieved more than 80% of the total synergies originally anticipated for 2017. Our expectations of total cost to achieve the target synergies are still consistent with prior projections. Because we're accelerating synergies to set us up for a strong run rate for 2017, we expect to incur roughly $10 million more in costs in 2016 than originally contemplated. Year-to-date, we've incurred $37 million of integration costs and $32 million of deal close costs. Additional details can be found in our 10-Q, which will be filed later today. Please note these expenses are excluded from our adjusted OIBDA calculation as they are onetime in nature. 
Let's turn to our outlook for 2016 on Page 12 of the supplemental. Business trends and fundamentals remain consistent given the durability of our business. We remain on track to achieve our short- and long-term financial objectives. Please note that although our guidance assumes divestitures would occur on day one, the benefit from businesses yet to be divested but running through our operating results is not significant. Some legacy Recall assets were sold to Access nearly at the same time as the close, so they are not reflected in our results. The remaining legacy Recall assets to be sold are included in discontinued operations, therefore, not flowing through our operating income. Lastly, the remaining Iron Mountain assets to be disposed of are flowing through our financials, however, with an immaterial benefit for the quarter and full year. Overall, our core Iron Mountain business is performing to plan, Recall contribution is tracking in line with our previous expectations, and we have accelerated the realization of net synergies for the year, which is why we brought up the lower end of our adjusted OIBDA guidance by $5 million.
Let me now refer you to the table at the bottom of our guidance page, on Page 12 of the supplemental, to follow our expectations for full year adjusted OIBDA. We thought it would be helpful to cover how results track against our original expectations, but please note, we'll be not reporting actual results separately given our financial statements are now fully integrated. Our standalone expectation for Iron Mountain's core business remains $950 million to $970 million, consistent with what we previously communicated. And our performance in the first half of the year is tracking right in line with our expectation. For the second quarter, excluding Recall's base and synergies less divestitures, Iron Mountain's standalone adjusted OIBDA was in line with Q1 results at -- of $235 million. So year-to-date, Iron Mountain standalone adjusted OIBDA was roughly $470 million. 
In the second half of the year, we expect to realize $7 million to $10 million of transformation benefits to offset costs associated with that program in the first half. We also expect a ramp in the business as our storage base continues to expand. This ramp is consistent with 2015, during which second half year results were $10 million higher than the first half on a reported dollar basis. If you annualize the first half actual run rate, our transformation benefits and a similar ramp to last year, standalone expectations are in line. 
Now let me address the second line related to Recall's contribution for the year. Prior to divestitures, we expect the Recall business to contribute $115 million of adjusted OIBDA at the midpoint. This reflects 8 months of Recall contribution, and our range implies $13 million to $15 million per month of contribution prior to synergies and divestitures. Lastly, we're expecting $18 million of adjusted OIBDA synergies net of the impact of the divestitures for the year. As Bill noted, this is up from our initial expectation of $15 million. As a result, our adjusted OIBDA guidance range for 2016 is now $1,075,000,000 to $1,110,000,000. 
For adjusted EPS, our guidance remains unchanged. Although our expectations for the structural tax rate are lower than previously anticipated, this benefit will likely be offset by the accelerated depreciation of Recall racking structures.
Although our total normalized dollar AFFO guidance remains the same, we changed our FFO-per-share guidance to reflect where we expect the final weighted average share count will settle for the year. We did not update adjusted EPS for this impact because the benefit is offset by the incremental real estate depreciation expense mentioned earlier. Please also note that our constant dollar guidance remains close to reported dollars. Assuming current rates hold, we do not see a downside from FX in our guidance.
Moving to our expected cash available for distributions and investment for 2016. We continue to estimate that it will be roughly $600 million. This provides ample funding for dividends and core growth racking investment. Our capital deployment plans for 2016 are unchanged. We continue to expect capital expenditures, which include real estate and non-real-estate maintenance and non-real-estate investment, to be in line with the figures we provided in our last earnings call and to total $170 million for the year. Our expectation for total real estate investment spend remains $320 million. This includes $70 million in core growth racking investment, and the remainder of our real estate spend is expected to be in real estate consolidation, development, data center and some lease conversions. As we've said in the past, we're focused on consolidating facilities, particularly given the Recall transaction. We expect real estate consolidation will provide upsides to synergies in the long term, but it's too early for us to quantify the exact benefit at this time. 
For M&A, we continue to expect to spend roughly $150 million, with approximately $100 million in emerging markets, $50 million in developed markets. 
Dividend expectations remain consistent with our previous guidance for 2016. Our dividend per share is then expected to grow from $1.94 this year to a minimum of $2.20 in 2017 and $2.35 in 2018 as we realize the majority of benefits from the transformation savings and Recall synergies. Beyond 2018, we expect to grow dividend per share at roughly 4% per year. Importantly, our dividend payout ratio as a percent of AFFO is in line with prior expectations and should reduce to 70% by 2020, which underscores the strength of our dividend coverage. In addition, we're targeting a leverage ratio of 5.0x by 2020. 
Shifting briefly to the balance sheet. At the quarter-end, we had liquidity of approximately $580 million, and our lease adjusted debt ratio was slightly up at 5.8x, as expected. Our leverage ratio increased primarily as a result of the timing of Recall integration and deal costs discussed earlier. We expect to end the year with a leverage ratio of 5.7x as we start realizing synergies and transformation savings. As many of you may already know, we refinanced the $850 million bridge facility associated with the Recall transaction, primarily with long-term debt. We raised $750 million in aggregate principal amounts from senior unsecured notes, which included $500 million at 4 3/8% due in 2021 and $250 million at 5 3/8% due in 2026. Our unsecured debt was priced at spreads similar to business services issuers rated 2 notches higher than Iron Mountain and at the top of the spread range for investment-grade issuers, which reflect debt investors' favorable view of our predictable cash flow. In addition, we also amended our credit agreement and extended its maturity to 2019. 
So overall, we're pleased with the performance we saw in the second quarter and year-to-date. Our results are driven by the durability of our business and execution of our long-term plan. We're excited with the progress we've made so far in integrating Recall and pleased that we'll be realizing synergies earlier than expected. Looking ahead, we're confident that we're well positioned to deliver on our long-term goals. We remain highly focused on extending the durability of our storage rental business, which drives growth and cash available to fund dividends and core growth investments. 
I'll now hand the call back to Bill."

Before I turn it over to questions, I should say that I think our Transformation Program probably has reduced the caffeine in my coffee in the morning, so I did, I think, misstate that Access -- we sold 23 U.S. markets to Access. I meant to say 13. So 13 is much better than 23. And I will talk to the transformation folks to kind of put the caffeine back in my coffee.

So first of all, let's look at the absolute net volume, right? So if you look at Q2 '16, this quarter, you'll see that outperms and destructions, if you subtract that from new sales and organic growth, you have a net before acquisitions of 3.8% growth versus a Q1 of 3% growth, so the net growth has actually increased. But coming to specifically your question about what's going on with outperms, is the 2.3% in Q1 of '16 is not out of norm. So if you kind of go back and you look at the supplemental on Page 11, you'll see that over the last 12 month -- or let's say even more than that, 1.5 years or so, you'll see going back into Q3 of '14, it goes somewhere between 2.1% and 2.3%. Where you really see the spike is in the Q2 '16 number, where you see that go up to 2.6%, so it's really a Q2 issue. But as I said, the net of volume is positive. And for those that followed Recall, there was a program that Doug would euphemistically call, ""Close the Gap."" And the 2 things he referred to was the 700-or-so basis points lower gross margin that their business yielded in terms of their overall business, and the other thing is, he highlighted that -- the level of outperms that they had relative to ours. So where we see the roughly the 30 bp increase in outperms from Q1 to Q2, that's driven by Recall's -- emerging Recall's business into ours, which we knew was a -- had a less -- had a higher volatility or a higher turn in that.

I mean, we brought in some outside help and advisers that know how to build these tools, and it looks at a number of different things. It looks at volume through the call center. It looks at number of boxes coming in. It looks at the types of complaints that we're getting from a customer, and there's a number of different things that you pick up the last time we gave them a price increase. And you look at those different pieces of data, and it's pretty accurate in terms of predicting when you're heading for a crisis with that customer and that you can intervene.

I wish I could have gotten them to be data-driven. Actually, the loss ratio between -- the win and loss ratio between us and them was actually much smaller than you would think, right? I mean, we'd like to say we competed against each other and we did. But actually, generally, they lost to somebody else, and we lost to somebody else. And that -- I think we've talked about it previously where they -- they did -- they have taken business from us, there was no question about that. But where they were much more present was in that middle market and SMB space, so they were winning and losing against much more of the smaller players. And we're actually quite excited about it to be honest with you. So their head of sales for North America now runs our whole mid-market SMB segment. And that business is, I think, approaching almost $800 million, I think $750 million of sales, if we combine the 2 companies. So it's of the same size of what Recall was globally just in North America, and we think we could to a better job. So they were losing typically to other people, and we were losing to other people, for the most part."

Okay, so in terms of their historical trend, so pretty much as we expected, other than -- we expected, as I answered to Shlomo, we expected that the outperms would be higher, and that pretty much translated straight across because we could see that in the results.

We -- the margin that both I commented on and Rod commented on, we commented on last quarter before we closed, we knew that, that was the case. I think the one thing that has been the -- so it's been more of an upside and I think the upside has been more around the people, not that we expected to get bad people. But I think when you buy a competitor, you always kind of think that they're different than you and when you're talking to customers, you typically demonize the competitor. And guess what? They have blood flowing their veins just like us, and we've got some really good people as a result of it. And they had almost identical values and code of conduct as we had. In fact, we laid the 2 slides up next to each other, we did it at a town hall, and they're virtually almost the same. So I don't know who copied from who. So we've actually, probably, if anything, have integrated the people much quicker, and when I say integrated, not just get them into slots, but people feel like they've been around a lot longer than they have, if you know what I mean. In other words, they didn't spend a lot of time trying to figure stuff out or adapt to a new culture. So that part has been better than we thought.

So I think we also -- or kind of foreshadowed it the last quarter that we'd thought we would see a drop in service revenue, that the next -- Q2 wouldn't be as strong as Q1. And so obviously, we could see the pipeline, and we knew how that worked. The one thing that I think again we commented last time and -- is that we -- as we shift more to project-based rather than transportation-based service revenue, we do expect it to be pipeline-dependent and, therefore, more project-dependent and, therefore, more lumpy. So it's much easier to predict that if you look over a 12-month period than if you look at it on a 1-month or even a 3-month period. So if we -- as that as a backdrop, if we look forward to the rest of the year, we like the pipeline, the booking pipeline -- the bookings in the pipeline that we see for the rest of the year. So we're very confident that for the total year, we will see positive service revenue growth, which is -- obviously means that the new services are offsetting the declines that we talked about in the transportation, which has driven to the structural shift and the way that the information is being used. So we feel very good that for the full year, you'll see a trend that's consistent with Q1 as the pipeline turns into bookings and turns into projects that we see in front of us."

And the new services have been offsetting that -- between 40% and 50% of that decline. So the net decline, and you'll see that going forward as well, is that the net decline as the new services replace some of the transportation, as the tapes are becoming more for disaster recovery rather than for rotation, then you'll see that the typical 9% to 10% decline in transportation and being offset by 40% or 50% by the growth in new products.

Today's earnings call and presentation will contain a number of forward-looking statements, most notably our outlook for 2016 and 2017 preliminary financial and operating performance. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to today's slides, our earnings commentary, the Safe Harbor language on this slide and our most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the major risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those in our forward-looking statements. In addition, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results, and the reconciliations to those measures, as required by Reg G, are included in the supplemental reporting package. 
With that, Bill, would you please begin?"

We are pleased to be reporting a solid quarter, and I'm also happy to be partnering with Stuart Brown for first Iron Mountain quarterly conference call. Stuart's been on board since the time we reported Q2 and has been spending a lot of time in the field familiarizing himself with the business and working closely with rod during the transition. Stuart will deliver financial highlights in just a bit. 
For the third quarter, we delivered revenue and adjusted OIBDA results right in line with our expectations and notably drove our adjusted OIBDA margins back to 31.2%, more in line with historical norms prior to integrating the historically lower-margin Recall business. In addition, we continue to see consistent trends in our core business with positive internal storage rental revenue and volume growth in developed markets; a greater portion of our revenue coming from faster-growing emerging markets; and good momentum in our adjacent business segment, particularly data center.
As noted last quarter, due to our quick actions, we are getting Recall integration synergies faster than expected. In fact, we now expect to exit 2016 having achieved more than 85% of the total synergies we expected to have achieved by year-end 2017. This is up from 80% in our Q2 call, and we continue to expect in-year synergies to be $18 million. It is this achievement of getting synergies faster and the added benefit from our transformation initiative, which is the fuel that allowed us to increase the dividend per share starting in Q4 by 13% from $0.485 to $0.55 per share. As you will recall, this is in line with what we laid out at our Investor Day a year ago, but we are achieving it a full quarter earlier despite closing the Recall transaction later than originally expected.
Before going into Q3 performance, let me first provide a little more color on the Recall integration. As we've noted in the past, the Recall transaction benefits us in 3 primary ways: first, the level of synergy enables meaningful growth in AFFO and cash available for distribution, which funds increasing dividends and provides cash for continued investment in the business, all whilst over time delevering; second, it strengthens our ability to reach the high-margin midmarket business where Recall had a strong presence compared with Iron Mountain's enterprise focus; and third, it enhances our global footprint, particularly in emerging markets, giving us more exposure to these faster-growing and attractive markets.
As noted in the past, integration efforts will increase the Recall base margin business, which has historically operated at 600 to 700 basis points lower than ours in 3 areas: SG&A; labor; and in the longer term, real estate consolidation benefits. We also continue our detailed review of our real estate platform as we consider further consolidation opportunities, which we believe can provide additional benefit over time. Further, the growth in cash flow allows us to invest in new products and innovation for the benefit of our customers, innovation around areas from how we bundle services and simplify pricing, utilizing excess building capacity for other types of storage, deleveraging our sector-leading knowledge to offer technology solutions our customers.
An example of this is our analytics dashboard that we recently introduced to help records and information managers demonstrate the effectiveness of their information governance programs and uncover the value of their data. The dashboard help them manage retention schedules, improve inventory tracking, identify potential risk and compliance concerns and conduct internal and peer benchmarking of best practices. In addition to improving tools such as the dashboard, we're also testing better and easy ways for customers to interact with us through mobile devices that enable voice recognition. When we refer to innovation, we're talking about tapping the ideas our customers and employees have for new products and solutions, vetting them and then incorporating them in our customer solutions and processes in order to further strengthen our differentiation and profitability. We have discussed some of these items previously such as our emerging partnership with the likes of EMC/virtue stream and now Dell in building Air Gap, which provides customers with the added cybersecurity all of us seek. It is these innovations and others, which not only provide additional value to our customers, that will also add to future earnings growth both as stand-alone products as well as further differentiating our existing offerings. We're planning to host our next Investor Day in late April 2017, at which time we intend to share a few of these innovation ideas with you. We'll also have about a full year of Recall under our belt by that time.
In addition, we continue to make progress on the dispositions required by the regulators. You may have seen that just last week, we received approval from the ACCC, or the Australian regulator, for the disposition of our legacy business in Australia to whose Atomic Partners a private equity firm. The AUD 70 million transaction closed yesterday. In addition, we continue to make progress on the sale of the acquired assets in the U.S., Canada and the United Kingdom. We're pleased with our progress on these dispositions, and we'll bring you updates as those transactions are approved by the regulators and closed. We now expect the total dispositions will generate approximately $185 million in gross proceeds compared with our initial estimate of $220 million. Whilst its total is a bit lighter than we originally expected, we are pleased with where we've landed and believe the transactions are consistent with our commercial goals in those markets. 
Let me now turn to some highlights before Stuart walks you through the details that can also be found on the bridging graph in our supplemental report. Total revenue growth in constant dollars was up more than 27% with similar growth rates in constant dollars storage, rental and service revenue. Adjusted OIBDA, as I mentioned at the beginning, is back to nearly our high levels before the acquisition with adjusted OIBDA margins up 150 basis points from Q2. On an internal basis, storage rental growth was 2.6%, and we continue to expect average storage rental internal growth to be around 2.5% for the full year. Internal volume growth, which excludes the initial Recall volume we added when we closed the transaction, was positive in all storage segments and at 1.8% for the quarter. In short, we maintained our focus even in the midst of the Recall integration-related activity. 
Year-to-date, service revenue was basically flat over last year, reflecting the variability and timing of the project. Based on our service project pipeline, we expect internal service revenue growth to be roughly flat for the full year. As we've talked about on previous calls, given our expected change and service mix, we continue to focus on improving service gross profit and protecting returns on invested capital rather than on service gross margin. We continue to focus on driving productivity improvement on service business, but it's important to keep in mind that 83% of our gross profit is from storage. Whilst we continue to devote a fair amount of attention to how we can grow and enhance our service business, our service lines, first and foremost, provide a strong differentiation to our core storage business. 
Turning to progress on our strategic plan, which entails getting the most of our developed markets, increasing our presence in the fast-growing emerging markets and expanding in faster-growing adjacent businesses, we continue to make progress on each of these pillars and the foundation that support them. In developed markets, which includes both North America, RIM and our Western European segment, we added 3.6 million cubic feet of internal volume growth. North America RIM storage growth was 1.1%, reflecting positive volume growth. This is all before the impact of the Recall and any other acquisitions during the period. In emerging markets, it is important to note that these markets are differentiated through higher levels of internal storage growth of roughly 10%. Our goal is to expand our presence and leverage our scale to drive these markets to 20% of our total revenue by 2020. You may remember, we announced the beginning of this journey about 3 years ago, where we started at 10% of our sales coming from this fast-growing segment. By the beginning of this year, we had approached 16% of our sales coming from emerging markets. And now, with the Recall's footprint, we're at 17.1% of total revenue on a 2014 constant dollar basis. Whilst we did not close any international acquisitions during the quarter, we continue to expect total M&A investment in the range of $140 million to $180 million this year, having closed on roughly $56 million year-to-date, excluding Recall. More specifically, we expect 4 significant transactions in the emerging markets to close in Q4, which will utilize about $75 million of the remaining M&A budget. In addition to this final stage pipeline in the emerging markets, there are a number of smaller tuck-ins mainly in developed markets, which are expected to close. An example of this focus and continued execution can be readily seen in our Southeast Asia markets plus China. At the start of the year, this region represented just $14 million in annual sales. With the acquisition of Recall and upon closing the Sanofi transaction we discussed last quarter, we'll have grown our business in this region to annualized revenue of more than $100 million with leading positions in virtually all countries where we operate within the region. 
In our adjacent business segment, we are on track to achieve our stated goal to generate 5% of our total worldwide revenue from adjacent businesses by the end of 2020, up from just 2% at the end of 2015.
In our data center business, we announced a major lease in the quarter in our purpose-built Boston data center with Simplicity, a leader in infrastructure enterprise IT. Simplicity needed data center resources to support its engineering lab and our colocation was the right fit from a cost, capacity, efficiency and security perspective. They noted that our 65-year track record of protecting proprietary assets gave them confidence to trust a third-party with such an expansion. In addition, a couple of weeks ago, we broke ground on construction of the first building of our 83-acre data center campus in Virginia using a development partner for this first 150,000 square foot data center. This building will deliver superior physical security, lower power cost and reduced tax structure compared to other national locations. In total, our Northern Virginia data center campus will support 42 megawatts of critical load spread across a planned 4 individual colocation facilities. This represents a 4x expansion of our current capacity. The first building expected to open in summer 2017 will offer 10.5 megawatts of critical power and a flexible design that can meet the more exacting requirements of cloud service providers, Federal Government, system integrators, financial service firms and healthcare companies. It will also comply with Federal technology and environmental regulations, enabling Federal agencies and integrators to comply by stated deadlines for efficient, sustainable data centers. We're pleased with the momentum we're seeing in the business and are continuing to manage capacity utilization to stay ahead of demand whilst benefiting from preleasing activity in existing markets. Combining our Boston facility with the undergrounds of Boyers, Pennsylvania and Kansas City, our data center space is greater than 90% committed, and we are on track to achieve internal growth of 20% to 25% in this business area. Whilst we don't break out our data center business separately in our financials, we continue to achieve top line organic growth in this business, and we expect to end 2016 with an exit run rate of $25 million in sales, which compares favorably with our 2015 exit rate of $20 million.
In terms of supporting foundations to the strategic plan, we continue to make progress on our transformation initiative to remove $125 million in SG&A. We expect action an additional $18 million of savings by the end of this year, bringing us to $100 million in run rate savings to be recognized in 2017. Whilst we didn't incur much of the way of additional cost in Q3, we laid the groundwork for improvements to be implemented next year focused on achieving the final $25 million of this $125 million program. 
Given the timing of Recall synergies, our Transformation Program and positive business trends, we remain confident that we will generate cash flow in line with the growth expectations we highlighted during Investor Day and updated in recent presentations. This provides the foundation for our dividend growth. Our newly declared quarterly dividend of $0.55 per share equates to an increase of about 13%, reflecting the benefit of synergies and transformation. Our expectations continue to be to grow the underlying business and cash flow, which will support an increase in our dividend per share by an additional 7% in 2018 and 4% annual growth thereafter, in line with our strategic plan whilst also funding 4 [ph] growth racking, M&A and overall investments.
As we progress our plan, we'll generate more cash available to support discretionary investments so we'll borrow less to fund our growth plan and continue to deliver. Our operations are underpinned by a very durable growing business that performs consistently throughout business cycles. We have a durable storage business that generates roughly $1.9 billion of annual storage net operating income, which exceeds that generated by leaders in both the industrial and self-storage real estate sectors. Our lack of volatility through economic cycles and business durability clearly distinguishes our business. It is this durability that delivers consistent operating performance with higher rates of utilization, stable pricing in both good and bad economies. Another thing that distinguishes our business is our relative insensitivity to higher interest rates compared with most REITs. First, our customer storage needs are largely unaffected by interest rates movements. Second, our core storage NOI doesn't change with the value of the underlying real estate. Third, we incur virtually no TIs, or tenant improvements, if a customer leaves and we bring in a new one. Importantly, we have an operating business, and we effectively control real estate through long-term leases with multiple lease extension options and direct ownership with strategic locations of about 1/3 of our properties. In an increasing rate environment, this structure reduces our exposure to real estate value fluctuations compared with REITs that own their entire portfolios. Additionally, it should be noted that we generally enjoy higher levels of real price increases during periods with more inflation. 
In summary, it was a solid quarter with good execution on all 3 pillars of our strategic plan even in the midst of the Recall integration. We achieved solid internal and constant dollar growth, continued volume increases and meaningful expanded OIBDA margins, all of which support increased cash flow and the 13% increase in our dividend per share. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Stuart."

Let me start by saying how excited I am to be a part of Iron Mountain and working with mountaineers around the globe. The durability of Iron Mountain's records management and related businesses adds substantial opportunity to continue to optimize performance, following the Recall acquisition and through our strategic plan, this is part of what drew me to Iron Mountain. I'm really pleased that our strong results this quarter demonstrate our ability to execute. There are many opportunities ahead, and I believe it's a very exciting time to be part of the team. Before diving into the details of our financials, let me take a moment and walk you through the key highlights of the quarter.
First, we achieved strong internal storage rental revenue growth of 2.6%, excluding Recall and other small acquisitions. This compares with 2.1% last quarter, reflecting solid underlying business fundamentals and continued volume growth across all major markets. Making up over 80% of our gross profit growth in the storage, rental business remains our key execution focus. 
Second, we enhanced our profitability. Adjusted OIBDA margins improved by 150 basis points from the second quarter as benefits from the Transformation Program and synergies from the Recall transaction flow into our results. Third, we're making great progress in the integration of Recall, and over 85% of the $115 million of 2017 gross synergies will be in process by the end of this year. Fourth, since June 30, we completed approximately $380 million of debt refinancing at attractive rates, including the recent $50 million mortgage, resulting in about 74% of our debt now being fixed after paying down the revolver in early October, and that compares to 68% in the second quarter. Our average maturity was 5.1 years, and our weighted average interest rate was 5.1%. Our Canadian debt offering tied to the lowest coupon ever in a high-yield Canadian market, demonstrating our debt investors' appreciation of our solid cash flow and recognition that our leverage is in line with many investment-grade REITs. We remain steadily on track to deliver our short-term financial objectives and long-term goals. And as Bill mentioned, it is based upon this continued demonstration of growth, the durability of our cash flows and capital efficiency that our Board of Directors increased our dividend by 13% to $0.55 per share.
Now that I covered the highlights, I will go our worldwide financial results followed by a review of our performance by segment and conclude with a discussion on our outlook 2016 and a preliminary view on 2017. Consistent with prior quarters in providing schedules for total revenue, adjusted OIBDA, adjusted earnings per share and FFO per share, we'll explain key variances in our year-on-year performance. These schedules can be found on Pages 23 through 26 of the supplemental. Let me walk you through the highlights. For the third quarter, our total recorded revenues increased 26.3% or 27.4% on a constant dollar basis. Excluding the Recall and other smaller acquisitions, total internal revenue increased 1.4% in the third quarter compared with a 0.4% increase in Q2, again with improvement in all regions and segments. We expect total internal revenue growth in 2016 to be between 1.5% and 2%, reflecting continued solid performance in our higher-margin storage activities and growth in adjacent businesses, offset by modest declines in service revenues. 
Let's look at storage and service revenue performance in the quarter. Storage rental revenue is the core economic driver of our business, representing 61% of revenue and 83% of our total gross profit. As I mentioned earlier, our third quarter storage internal growth accelerated to 2.6% from 2.2% growth in the first half of the year, and we continue to expect full year storage internal growth of approximately 2.5%.
Service revenues, which make up 39% of total revenues and 17% of our gross profit, declined 0.5% from a year ago compared to a year-over-year decline of 2.1% in Q2. As we've highlighted in previous calls, the mix shift in our service business profits can be a bit volatile on a quarter-on-quarter basis. However, we expect the internal service revenue growth to be about flat for the full year. Total third quarter gross profit margin declined slightly from Q2 due mainly to the additional month of Recall results. As we previously highlighted, Recall preacquisition [indiscernible] lower margin than Iron Mountain due in part to adding higher rent expense as a percentage of revenue as Recall lease almost all of their facilities. However, we were able to capture overhead efficiencies and other synergies to more than offset this margin decline resulting in expansion of adjusted OIBDA margin.
In the quarter, we grew total adjusted OIBDA by 29.1% on a reported dollar basis and by approximately 30% on a constant dollar basis. Importantly, adjusted OIBDA margins expanded year-on-year and sequentially to 31.2% as we continue to see benefits from transformational actions and from Recall synergies. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.27. Adjusted EPS was impacted by the amortization of Recall's customer relationship values and the depreciation expense of legacy Recall racking structures. As a reminder, the amortization expense of customer relationships flows through the funds from operations. However, the increased depreciation does not because real estate depreciation is excluded from FFO. Normalized FFO per share was $0.44 for the quarter. The decline in FFO per share was driven by 2 factors. First, the increased noncash amortization of Recall's customer relationship intangibles as discussed back in April and is not added back to capital weighted FFO. Second is the tax impact of Recall-related expenses. As most of the cost of this integration phase occurred in our qualified subsidiary, it did not provide a tax yield. This last item also impacted our effective tax rate, which appears high as the Recall costs and the $14 million impairment reduced pretax income. However, they did not reduce taxes according to our taxable securities. This is the short-term effect from the integration effort. 
Third quarter AFFO was $169 million compared with $134 million in the year-ago period, fueling our dividend increase. Remember, AFFO adds back noncash item such as amortization and noncash or discrete cash items, so AFFO was not as impacted by the same items that impacted FFO. 
Let's turn quickly to our financial performance by segment. Pages 15 and 16 of the supplemental outline our performance by segment in detail for the quarter and on a year-to-date basis. Let me touch on a few highlights from these pages. In North America, Records and Information Management, or RIM, internal storage rental revenue increased by 1.1%, reflecting strong internal volume growth. In North America Data Management, or DM, we saw strong internal storage rental growth of 2.2%, reflecting an improvement from the second quarter. However, service internal growth declined due to the timing of projects and the ongoing reduction in take rotation as we have discussed previously.
The Western European segment had 0.3% of internal storage rental growth, having it impacted by the carryforwards certain contract negotiations that we mentioned in our last earnings call. In the Other International segment, we continue to see strong storage and service internal revenue growth of 11.6% and 6.9%, respectively. 
Let me now talk about the Recall integration progress and the cost that we've incurred so far to achieve synergies and integrate Recall with our business. Bill explained, we remain on track to achieve the synergies in total, albeit we are getting there a bit faster. Our expectations of total cost to achieve synergies are still consistent with prior projections, $380 million in deal cost of $80 million. In the fourth quarter, we expect to incur roughly $50 million in operating expenses and $17 million in capital expenditures as we accelerate the cost-savings programs. Year-to-date, Q3, we have incurred $103 million of integration and deal close cost and $7 million in capital expenditure. Additional details can be found in our 10-Q, which can we filed later this week. Please note that these onetime items are excluded from our adjusted OIBDA calculation. 
Let's turn to our outlook for 2016 and preliminary outlook for 2017 summarized on Pages 10 and 11 of the supplemental. Our outlook for business trends and fundamentals remains unchanged, with consistent storage rental growth and accelerating growth in our International adjacent businesses. In addition, our expectations from Recall's contribution and our stand-alone business contribution remain unchanged as seen on the table at the bottom of our guidance page. Our guidance is now on a reported dollar basis given foreign exchange differences during the year have been small and is now serves as a baseline for our 2017 outlook. Further, we have updated our 2016 FFO guidance to adjust for the increases in income tax expense, amortization and interest. Our AFFO guidance remains unchanged at $610 million to $650 million, reflecting savings we have identified in maintenance capital since the Recall acquisition as well as non-real estate capital expenditures, which were partially offset by increases in interest expense and cash taxes. However, we anticipate AFFO for the full year to come in above the midpoint of our guidance.
Our interest expense for the year is higher than we originally assumed due to the timing and amount of divestiture proceeds as well as additional Recall integration-related spend. AFFO continues to provide ample funding for dividends and core growth racking investments. Given the higher interest in taxes than our original guidance, we expect adjusted EPS to being near the low end of our guidance range for the year. Upon further review of Recall's real estate assets and overall systems requirements, we reduced our capital expenditure outlook, real estate and non-real estate maintenance as well as real non-estate investments by $25 million for 2016. The capital efficiency that is created by bringing the 2 businesses together is better than we originally anticipated. Therefore, this is an elimination not a deferral of spend. In addition, we've reduced our real estate investments by $95 million, driven mostly by delayed spending on lease conversion and certain real estate development to make sure we take the time to optimize each market's needs and negotiate with landlords to consolidate facilities in light of the Recall acquisition. Note that the reduction in real estate spend this year is not impacting our synergy or margin outlook for 2020 Vision. As we noted, these types of investments take a period of time to stabilize. 
Distributions for the year will total around $500 million, resulting in a dividend payout ratio as percentage of AFFO consistent with our prior guidance under 80% and becoming more in line with the REIT peers over time. Let's touch on our preliminary guidance for 2017, which is based on September 30 exchange rates. At a high level, this guidance is consistent with long-term expectations with slightly lower growth from acquisitions given our focus on Recall this year. At the midpoint of our guidance, we expect adjusted OIBDA to grow by 17% and AFFO to grow by 12% in 2017 compared with 2016. We'll provide more detail on capital allocation and other guidance for 2017 in February after we file -- finalize prioritizing investments. We expect maintenance capital expenditures in non-real estate investments to be approximately $170 million next year, together representing roughly 4.5% of revenue, consistent with 2016. 
Shifting briefly to the balance sheet. We currently have liquidity of approximately $1.1 billion and a lease-adjusted debt ratio of 5.7x, as expected. In the short term, given the timing of proceeds from divestments, we expect to end the year at a leverage ratio around 5.8x and to trend down from there in line with our 2020 Vision. Lastly, we continue to focus on strengthening our debt structure to increasing exposure to long-term notes and shifting greater percentage of our debt to foreign jurisdictions, which creates a natural currency hedge to mitigate translation exposure while also being tax efficient. In September, we raised CAD 250 million in senior notes at 5.375% due in 2023 and closed on a AUD 250 million syndicated term Loan B facility, which matures on September 2022 and currently bears interest at 6.05%. Overall, we are pleased with our performance this quarter and with the progress we have made integrating Recall and executing on our Transformation Program.
Looking ahead, we are confident that we are well positioned to deliver on our short-term and long-term financial projections. Our expectations are underscored by the durability of our business, and we are extending that durability through solid execution of our strategic plan and optimizing our cost. 
Before closing, I want to mention that I continue to be impressed with the caliber of the team here at Iron Mountain and appreciate the passion that our teams in the field have to care for our customers. They're focused on moving the business forward during a major acquisition integration was evident in the performance this quarter. I continue to expand my knowledge of the Iron Mountain business and look forward to meeting many of you in person over the coming months. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill for closing remarks."

And the result of that was we're able to bring the teams together much faster because especially these early synergies are mainly headcount-related. So I'd say, we weren't -- we were not going deeper than expected in terms of the headcount reductions, but the speed at which we're able to align processes and then release people was much faster than we planned. So I would say it's probably the key driver has been cultural. But it I'd say in terms of further upside is, we still remain focused that we think there's going to be further upside than we start consolidating the facilities, but that's more on the midterm rather than the near term."

So actually, it's pretty much consistent with what we said. I think I've always said on the calls for the last, I would say, few quarters that it's really the transportation and that's generally down between high single digits, low double digits in terms of revenues. So it's continuing -- we continue to see the trend. As I said before, I think, a couple of calls ago, we see kind of a flattening out of that archival drop in transportation when look at the paper storage business or the record storage side of the business. But in Data Management, it's still a little bit lagging, that transition into becoming more about backup and recovery rather than rotating the tape. So -- and we still are declaring a bottom. So if you say going forward, I still expect that we're going to see transportation declines in the tape business still in the high single-digit, low double-digit level. So it's really -- it's not the projects that are driving that, it's the transportation decline. So I mean, the good news, if you look at the storage, as we said, the storage both on a revenue and a volume basis, if you look at revenue quarter-on-quarter, we're up a little over 2%. If you look in a trailing 12 months in terms of volume, we're up 2%. And keep in mind, as we look at the margins of the business and the profitability of the business, whilst I think services is important, it's first the most important in terms of differentiating our storage product because that's where we build the reliability in it, through the robustness of our transportation. But the part that's driving the cash in the business, we continue to be pleased with. But if you ask me just specific on transportation, I have to say that I expected to continue to decline in the high single, low double digits for a few more quarters because we still seem to be behind the transition that wv pretty much have worked most of the way through on the records management side."

What I do feel and I talked a little bit about on my call on my script or when I was going through my remarks saying that innovation is an important part. And one of the things bring the 2 organizations together, it gives us not only larger customer base, but it gives us more capacity to innovate, and that innovation resonates with our customers. What we're finding, especially for the regulated customers that have to worry about compliance in so many different jurisdictions, that the fact that we can get them better solutions around information governance is a differentiating factor. And you can say that the pace of the product, did they pay more for the storage. And sometimes, it's built up in the storage cost or pricing and sometimes it's built up on the product, but what we do find is that the world is getting more complex especially for the heavy and regulated industries, and bringing the 2 companies together does give us more economies of scale to do that kind of R&D. That is resonating with customers. So I wouldn't -- I think that's the way I think about the power of bringing of the 2 companies together. It just gives us a deeper pool, if you will, to innovate around. And so far, it's early days, but I'd spent a fair amount of time with different customers. They had a top financial service customer forum in Louisiana at June. I just came back from Milan in Europe a couple of weeks ago. And there's even more excitement that I'm hearing from our large customers about bringing the 2 companies together rather than last because they're expecting even more in the way of innovation. The other thing I would highlight is it's early days, but I also expect we reorganized the North American sales force again a little bit in light of bringing Recall in. They were, as I said, much better at training running after the middle market, which is a higher-margin segment, and a lot of it is embedded and we haven't been as present there as Iron Mountain and Recall was more present. And now, the Head of North American sales is the person from Recall who's driving the charge not just in terms of our traditional segment in the enterprise, but he also has 2 new leaders that are helping drive more penetration into the middle market, which we expect of over time to start coming through. It's early days. You don't see that in the numbers today, but I would like to see improvement in those areas."

So we had pretty clear view and you can see that in terms of our improvement on AFFO of where we were actually getting the restructuring savings. The issue is in specifically in the U.S., right, because that's where we have the tax detectability and nontax-deductibility depending on the QRS our TRS or the qualified subsidiary or the non-qualified subsidiary is when we got into the U.S., a lot of the cost savings were in the part of Recall that would be in terms of the qualified REIT subsidiary and that was where we didn't get the deductibility. It doesn't affect International because although we do have split between qualified and non-qualified subsidiaries, remember that internationally, we gets fully taxed in those local entities because of the U.S. REIT rules don't apply. It's important in terms of the way we repatriate money back into the United States for dividends, but it's not important in the local tax scheme. So it's specifically a U.S. situation. And as we finish the restructuring, I say there's a little bit more of that next year and that's built into our guidance because we now have clear view of what the restructuring is left that's in the qualified REIT subsidiary versus not, so we know what the tax-deductibility is. But I think you can probably appreciate when you you're buying a public company, trying to have that level of detail until you actually get into the restructuring, that's where you get to the tax detectability. But if you think about it in terms of the ability -- whilst tax does affect AFFO as well, but we're starting to actually get through those onetime restructuring charges, then we're still in line with what we can do total cost of the integration project is. But Stuart, you may want to talk about the intangibles."

We're still looking for a lot of valuations, so not fully flowed debt through our forecast for the rest of the year. So could we have forecast better? Maybe, but it's getting updated now. The other thing I'd point out though, too, as we've gone through and clean up these things, I'm going to try to AFFO for a second is if we go back to second quarter AFFO, we actually had understated that by around $10 million. That's because we had a -- for a Mexico REIT subsidiary, we had some onetime tax integration cost or tax that we had to pay to restructure that entity. Those costs have actually been accrued as part of purchase accounting, never went through the P&L. Because it was cash tax payment, it actually gotten picked up as a reduction of AFFO last quarter, but it was onetime in nature. Those are the types of things we exclude. So if you go back and look at the second quarter, AFFO was actually better in our trends when we talk about AFFO guidance being above the midpoint for the year that gives us comfort.

We are pleased to be reporting a solid quarter, and I'm also happy to be partnering with Stuart Brown for his first Iron Mountain quarterly conference call. Stuart's been on board since the time we reported Q2 and has been spending a lot of time in the field familiarizing himself with the business and working closely with Rod during the transition. Stuart will deliver financial highlights in just a bit.
For the third quarter, we delivered revenue and adjusted OIBDA results right in line with our expectations and notably drove our adjusted OIBDA margins back to 31.2%, more in line with historical norms prior to integrating the historically lower-margin Recall business. In addition, we continued to see consistent trends in our core business with positive internal storage rental revenue and volume growth in developed markets; a greater portion of our revenue coming from faster-growing emerging markets; and good momentum in our adjacent business segment, particularly data center.
As noted last quarter, due to our quick actions, we are getting Recall integration synergies faster than expected. In fact, we now expect to exit 2016 having achieved more than 85% of the total synergies we expected to have achieved by year-end 2017. This is up from 80% in our Q2 call, and we continue to expect in-year synergies to be $18 million. It is this achievement of getting synergies faster and the added benefit from our transformation initiative, which is the fuel that allowed us to increase the dividend per share starting in Q4 by 13% from $0.485 to $0.55 per share. As you will recall, this is in line with what we laid out at our Investor Day a year ago, but we are achieving it a full quarter earlier despite closing the Recall transaction later than originally expected.
Before going into Q3 performance, let me first provide a little more color on the Recall integration. As we've noted in the past, the Recall transaction benefits us in 3 primary ways: first, the level of synergy enables meaningful growth in AFFO and cash available for distribution, which funds increasing dividends and provides cash for continued investment in the business, all whilst over time delevering; second, it strengthens our ability to reach the high-margin midmarket business where Recall had a strong presence compared with Iron Mountain's enterprise focus; and third, it enhances our global footprint, particularly in emerging markets, giving us more exposure to these faster-growing and attractive markets.
As noted in the past, integration efforts will increase the Recall base margin business, which has historically operated at 600 to 700 basis points lower than ours in 3 areas: SG&A; labor; and in the longer term, real estate consolidation benefits. We also continue our detailed review of our real estate platform as we consider further consolidation opportunities, which we believe can provide additional benefit over time. Further, the growth in cash flow allows us to invest in new products and innovation for the benefit of our customers; innovation around areas from how we bundle services and simplify pricing, utilizing excess building capacity for other types of storage, deleveraging our sector-leading knowledge to offer technology solutions to our customers.
An example of this is our Analytics Dashboard that we recently introduced to help records and information managers demonstrate the effectiveness of their information governance programs and uncover the value of their data. The dashboard helps to manage retention schedules, improve inventory tracking, identify potential risk and compliance concerns and conduct internal and peer benchmarking of best practices. In addition to improving tools such as the dashboard, we're also testing better and easy ways for customers to interact with us through mobile devices that enable voice recognition. When we refer to innovation, we're talking about tapping the ideas our customers and employees have for new products and solutions, vetting them and then incorporating them into our customer solutions and processes in order to further strengthen our differentiation and profitability. We have discussed some of these items previously, such as our emerging partnership with the likes of EMC/virtue stream and now Dell in building air gap, which provides customers with the added cybersecurity all of us seek. It is these innovations and others, which not only provide additional value to our customers, but will also add to future earnings growth, both as stand-alone products as well as further differentiating our existing offerings. We're planning to host our next Investor Day in late April 2017, at which time we intend to share a few of these innovation ideas with you. We'll also have about a full year of Recall under our belt by that time.
In addition, we continue to make progress on the dispositions required by the regulators. You may have seen that just last week, we received approval from the ACCC, or the Australian regulator, for the disposition of our legacy business in Australia to Housatonic Partners, a private equity firm. The AUD 70 million transaction closed yesterday. In addition, we continue to make progress on the sale of the required assets in the U.S., Canada and the United Kingdom. We're pleased with our progress on these dispositions, and we'll bring you updates as those transactions are approved by the regulators and closed. We now expect the total dispositions will generate approximately $185 million in gross proceeds compared with our initial estimate of $220 million. Whilst this total is a bit lighter than we originally expected, we are pleased with where we've landed and believe the transactions are consistent with our commercial goals in those markets.
Let me now turn to some highlights before Stuart walks you through the details that can also be found in the bridging graph in our supplemental report. Total revenue growth in constant dollars was up more than 27% with similar growth rates in constant dollar storage, rental and service revenue. Adjusted OIBDA, as I mentioned at the beginning, is back to nearly our high levels before the acquisition with adjusted OIBDA margins up 150 basis points from Q2. On an internal basis, storage rental growth was 2.6%, and we continue to expect average storage rental internal growth to be around 2.5% for the full year. Internal volume growth, which excludes the initial Recall volume we added when we closed the transaction, was positive in all storage segments and at 1.8% for the quarter. In short, we maintained our focus even in the midst of the Recall integration-related activity.
Year-to-date, service revenue was basically flat over last year, reflecting the variability and timing of the project. Based on our service project pipeline, we expect internal service revenue growth to be roughly flat for the full year. As we've talked about on previous calls, given our expected change and service mix, we continue to focus on improving service gross profit and protecting returns on invested capital rather than on service gross margin. We continue to focus on driving productivity improvement in our service business, but it's important to keep in mind that 83% of our gross profit is from storage. Whilst we continue to devote a fair amount of attention to how we can grow and enhance our service business, our service lines, first and foremost, provide a strong differentiation to our core storage business.
Turning to progress on our strategic plan, which entails getting the most out of our developed markets, increasing our presence in the fast-growing emerging markets and expanding in faster-growing adjacent businesses, we continue to make progress on each of these pillars and the foundational elements [ph] to support them. In developed markets, which includes both North America RIM and our Western European segment, we added 3.6 million cubic feet of internal volume growth. North America RIM storage growth was 1.1%, reflecting positive volume growth. This is all before the impact of Recall and any other acquisitions during the period. In emerging markets, it is important to note that these markets are differentiated through higher levels of internal storage growth of roughly 10%. Our goal is to expand our presence and leverage our scale to drive these markets to 20% of our total revenue by 2020. You may remember, we announced the beginning of this journey about 3 years ago, when we started at 10% of our sales coming from this fast-growing segment. By the beginning of this year, we had approached 16% of our sales coming from emerging markets, and now, with Recall's footprint, we're at 17.1% of total revenue on a 2014 constant dollar basis. Whilst we did not close any international acquisitions during the quarter, we continue to expect total M&A investment in the range of $140 million to $180 million this year, having closed on roughly $56 million year-to-date, excluding Recall. More specifically, we expect 4 significant transactions in the emerging markets to close in Q4, which will utilize about $75 million of the remaining M&A budget. In addition to this final-stage pipeline in the emerging markets, there are a number of smaller tuck-ins, mainly in developed markets, which are expected to close. An example of this focus and continued execution can be readily seen in our Southeast Asia markets plus China. At the start of the year, this region represented just $14 million of annual sales. With the acquisition of Recall and upon closing the Santa Fe transaction we discussed last quarter, we'll have grown our business in this region to annualized revenue of more than $100 million with leading positions in virtually all countries where we operate within the region.
In our adjacent business segment, we are on track to achieve our stated goal to generate 5% of our total worldwide revenue from adjacent businesses by the end of 2020, up from just 2% at the end of 2015.
In our data center business, we announced a major lease in the quarter in our purpose-built Boston Data Center with SimpliVity, a leader in infrastructure enterprise IT. SimpliVity needed data center resources to support its engineering lab and our colocation solution was the right fit from a cost, capacity, efficiency and security perspective. They noted that our 65-year track record of protecting proprietary assets gave them the confidence to trust a third-party with such an expansion. In addition, a couple of weeks ago, we broke ground on construction of the first building of our 83-acre data center campus in Manassas, Virginia using a development partner for this first 150,000 square foot data center. This building will deliver superior physical security, lower power cost and a reduced tax structure compared to other national locations. In total, our Northern Virginia Data Center Campus will support 42 megawatts of critical load, spread across a planned 4 individual colocation facilities. This represents a 4x expansion of our current capacity. The first building expected to open in summer 2017 will offer 10.5 megawatts of critical power and a flexible design that can meet the more exacting requirements of cloud service providers, Federal Government, system integrators, financial service firms and health care companies. It will also comply with Federal technology and environmental regulations, enabling Federal agencies and integrators to comply by stated deadlines for efficient, sustainable data centers. We're pleased with the momentum we're seeing in the business and are continuing to manage capacity utilization to stay ahead of demand, whilst benefiting from preleasing activity in existing markets. Combining our Boston facility with the undergrounds of Boyers, Pennsylvania and Kansas City, our data center space is greater than 90% committed, and we are on track to achieve internal growth of 20% to 25% in this business area. Whilst we don't break out our data center business separately in our financials, we continue to achieve top line organic growth in this business, and we expect to end 2016 with an exit run rate of $25 million in sales, which compares favorably with our 2015 exit rate of $20 million.
In terms of supporting foundations to the strategic plan, we continue to make progress on our transformation initiative to remove $125 million in SG&A. We expect to action an additional $18 million of savings by the end of this year, bringing us to $100 million in run rate savings to be recognized in 2017. Whilst we didn't incur much in the way of additional cost in Q3, we laid the groundwork for improvements to be implemented next year, focused on achieving the final $25 million of this $125 million program.
Given the timing of Recall synergies, our Transformation Program and positive business trends, we remain confident that we will generate cash flow in line with the growth expectations we highlighted during Investor Day and updated in recent presentations. This provides the foundation for our dividend growth. Our newly declared quarterly dividend of $0.55 per share equates to an increase of about 13%, reflecting the benefit of synergies and transformation. Our expectations continue to be to grow the underlying business and cash flow, which will support an increase in our dividend per share by an additional 7% in 2018 and 4% annual growth thereafter, in line with our strategic plan whilst also funding core growth racking, M&A and overall investments.
As we progress our plan, we'll generate more cash available to support discretionary investments, so we'll borrow less to fund our growth plan and continue to deliver. Our operations are underpinned by our very durable growing business that performs consistently throughout business cycles. We have a durable storage business that generates roughly $1.9 billion of annual storage net operating income, which exceeds that generated by leaders in both the industrial and self-storage real estate sectors. Our lack of volatility through economic cycles and business durability clearly distinguishes our business. It is this durability that delivers consistent operating performance with high rates of utilization and stable pricing in both good and bad economies.
Another thing that distinguishes our business is our relative insensitivity to higher interest rates compared with most REITs. First, our customer storage needs are largely unaffected by interest rate movements. Second, our core storage NOI doesn't change with the value of the underlying real estate. Third, we incur virtually no TIs, or tenant improvements, if a customer leaves and we bring in a new one. Importantly, we have an operating business, and we effectively control real estate through long-term leases with multiple lease extension options and direct ownership of strategic locations of about 1/3 of our properties. In an increasing rate environment, this structure reduces our exposure to real estate value fluctuations compared with REITs that own their entire portfolios. Additionally, it should be noted that we generally enjoy higher levels of real price increases during periods with more inflation.
In summary, it was a solid quarter with good execution on all 3 pillars of our strategic plan even in the midst of the Recall integration. We achieved solid internal and constant dollar growth, continued volume increases and meaningful expanded OIBDA margins, all of which support increased cash flow and the 13% increase in our dividend per share.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Stuart."

Let me start by saying how excited I am to be a part of Iron Mountain and working with mountaineers around the globe. The durability of Iron Mountain's records management and related businesses and its substantial opportunity to continue to optimize performance, following the Recall acquisition and through our strategic plan, is just part of what drew me to Iron Mountain. I'm really pleased that our strong results this quarter demonstrate our ability to execute. There are many opportunities ahead, and I believe it's a very exciting time to be a part of the team. Before diving into the details of our financials, let me take a moment and walk you through the key highlights of the quarter.
First, we achieved strong internal storage rental revenue growth of 2.6%, excluding Recall and other small acquisitions. This compares with 2.1% last quarter, reflecting solid underlying business fundamentals and continued volume growth across all major markets. Making up over 80% of our gross profits growth in the storage, rental business remains our key execution focus.
Second, we enhanced our profitability. Adjusted OIBDA margins improved by 150 basis points from the second quarter as benefits from the Transformation Program and synergies from the Recall transaction flow into our results. Third, we're making great progress in the integration of Recall, and over 85% of the $115 million of 2017 gross synergies will be in process by the end of this year. Fourth, since June 30, we completed approximately $380 million of debt refinancing at attractive rates, including the recent $50 million mortgage, resulting in about 74% of our debt now being fixed after paying down the revolver in early October, and that compares to 68% in the second quarter. Our average maturity was 5.1 years, and our weighted average interest rate was 5.1%. Our Canadian debt offering tied the lowest coupon ever in the high-yield Canadian market, demonstrating our debt investors' appreciation of our solid cash flow and recognition that our leverage is in line with many investment-grade REITs. We remain steadily on track to deliver our short-term financial objectives and long-term goals. And as Bill mentioned, it is based upon this continued demonstration of growth, the durability of our cash flows and capital efficiency that our Board of Directors increased our dividend by 13% to $0.55 per share.
Now that I've covered the highlights, I will go our worldwide financial results followed by a review of our performance by segment and conclude with a discussion on our outlook for 2016 and a preliminary view on 2017. Consistent with prior quarters, we provided bridging schedules for total revenue, adjusted OIBDA, adjusted earnings per share and FFO per share to explain key variances in our year-on-year performance. These schedules can be found on Pages 23 through 26 of the supplemental. Let me walk you through the highlights. For the third quarter, our total reported revenues increased 26.3% or 27.4% on a constant dollar basis. Excluding the Recall and other smaller acquisitions, total internal revenue increased 1.4% in the third quarter compared with a 0.4% increase in Q2, again with improvement in all regions and segments. We expect total internal revenue growth in 2016 to be between 1.5% and 2%, reflecting continued solid performance in our higher-margin storage activities and growth in adjacent businesses, offset by modest declines in service revenues.
Let's look at storage and service revenue performance in the quarter. Storage rental revenue is the core economic driver of our business, representing 61% of revenue and 83% of our total gross profit. As I mentioned earlier, our third quarter storage internal growth accelerated to 2.6% from 2.2% growth in the first half of the year, and we continue to expect full year storage internal growth of approximately 2.5%.
Service revenues, which make up 39% of total revenues and 17% of our gross profit, declined 0.5% from a year ago, compared to a year-over-year decline of 2.1% in Q2. As we've highlighted in previous calls, the mix shift in our service business growth rates can be a bit volatile on a quarter-on-quarter basis. However, we expect the internal service revenue growth to be about flat for the full year. Total third quarter gross profit margin declined slightly from Q2 due mainly to the additional month of Recall results. As we have previously highlighted, Recall, preacquisition, offered lower margin than Iron Mountain due in part to having higher rent expenses as a percentage of revenue as Recall leased almost all of their facilities. However, we were able to capture overhead efficiencies and other synergies to more than offset this margin decline resulting in expansion of adjusted OIBDA margin.
In the quarter, we grew total adjusted OIBDA by 29.1% on a reported dollar basis and by approximately 30% on a constant dollar basis. Importantly, adjusted OIBDA margins expanded year-on-year and sequentially to 31.2% as we continue to see benefits from transformation actions and from Recall synergies. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.27. Adjusted EPS was impacted by the amortization of Recall's customer relationship values and the depreciation expense of legacy Recall racking structures. As a reminder, the amortization expense of customer relationships flows through to funds from operations. However, the increased depreciation does not because real estate depreciation is excluded from FFO. Normalized FFO per share was $0.44 for the quarter. The decline in FFO per share was driven by 2 factors. First, the increased noncash amortization of Recall's customer relationship intangibles, as discussed back in April, that is not added back to calculate FFO. Second is the tax impact of Recall-related expenses. As most of the cost of this integration phase were incurred in our qualified REIT subsidiary, they did not provide a tax yield. This last item also impacted our effective tax rate, which appears high as the Recall costs and the $14 million impairment reduced pretax income. However, they did not reduce taxes reported in our taxable subsidiaries. This is a short-term effect of the integration effort.
Third quarter AFFO was $169 million compared with $134 million in the year-ago period, fueling our dividend increase. Remember, AFFO adds back noncash item, such as amortization, and noncash or discrete tax items, so AFFO was not as impacted by the same items that impacted FFO.
Let's turn quickly to our financial performance by segment. Pages 15 and 16 of the supplemental outline our performance by segment in detail for the quarter and on a year-to-date basis. Let me touch on a few highlights from these pages. In North America, Records and Information Management, or RIM, internal storage rental revenue increased by 1.1%, reflecting strong internal volume growth. In North America Data Management, or DM, we saw a strong internal storage rental growth of 2.2%, reflecting an improvement from the second quarter. However, service internal growth declined due to the timing of projects and the ongoing reduction in tape rotation as we have discussed previously.
The Western European segment had 0.3% of internal storage rental growth, having been impacted by the carryforward of certain contract negotiations that we mentioned on our last earnings call. In the Other International segment, we continue to see strong storage and service internal revenue growth of 11.6% and 6.9%, respectively.
Let me now talk about the Recall integration progress and the costs that we've incurred so far to achieve synergies and to integrate Recall with our business. Bill explained, we remain on track to achieve the synergies in total, albeit we are getting there a bit faster. Our expectations of total cost to achieve synergies are still consistent with prior projections, $380 million and deal cost of $80 million. In the fourth quarter, we expect to incur roughly $50 million in operating expenses and $17 million in capital expenditures as we accelerate the cost-savings programs. Year-to-date, Q3, we have incurred $103 million of integration and deal close cost and $7 million in capital expenditure. Additional details can be found in our 10-Q, which will be filed later this week. Please note that these onetime items are excluded from our adjusted OIBDA calculation.
Let's turn to our outlook for 2016 and preliminary outlook for 2017, summarized on Pages 10 and 11 of the supplemental. Our outlook for business trends and fundamentals remains unchanged, with consistent storage rental growth and accelerating growth in our International and adjacent businesses. In addition, our expectations from Recall's contribution and our stand-alone business contribution remain unchanged as seen on the table at the bottom of our guidance page. Our guidance is now on a reported dollar basis, given foreign exchange differences during the year, have been small and this now serves as the baseline for our 2017 outlook. Further, we have updated our 2016 FFO guidance to adjust for the increases in income tax expense, amortization and interest. Our AFFO guidance remains unchanged at $610 million to $650 million, reflecting savings we have identified in maintenance capital since the Recall acquisition as well as nonreal estate capital expenditures, which were partially offset by increases in interest expense and cash taxes. However, we anticipate AFFO for the full year to come in above the midpoint of our guidance.
Our interest expense for the year is higher than we originally assumed due to the timing and amount of divestiture proceeds as well as additional Recall integration-related spend. AFFO continues to provide ample funding for dividends and core growth racking investments. Given the higher interest in taxes than our original guidance, we expect adjusted EPS to be near the low end of our guidance range for the year. Upon further review of Recall's real estate assets and overall systems requirements, we reduced our capital expenditure outlook, real estate and nonreal estate maintenance as well as real nonreal estate investment by $25 million for 2016. The capital efficiency that is created by bringing the 2 businesses together is better than we had originally anticipated. Therefore, this is an elimination, not a deferral of spend. In addition, we've reduced our real estate investments by $95 million, driven mostly by delayed spending on lease conversions and certain real estate development to make sure we take the time to optimize each market's needs and negotiate with landlords to consolidate facilities in light of the Recall transaction. Note that the reduction in real estate spend this year is not impacting our synergy or margin outlook or 2020 Vision, as we know that these types of investments take a period of time to stabilize.
Distributions for the year will total around $500 million, resulting in our dividend payout ratio as a percentage of AFFO consistent with our prior guidance under 80% and becoming more in line with the REIT peers over time.
Let's touch on our preliminary guidance for 2017, which is based on September 30 exchange rates. At a high level, this guidance is consistent with long-term expectations with slightly lower growth from acquisitions given our focus on Recall this year. At the midpoint of our guidance, we expect adjusted OIBDA to grow by 17% and AFFO to grow by 12% in 2017 compared with 2016. We'll provide more detail on capital allocation and other guidance for 2017 in February after we file -- finalize prioritizing investments. We expect maintenance capital expenditures and nonreal estate investments to be approximately $170 million next year, together representing roughly 4.5% of revenue, consistent with 2016.
Shifting briefly to the balance sheet, we currently have liquidity of approximately $1.1 billion and a lease-adjusted debt ratio of 5.7x, as expected. In the short term, given the timing of proceeds from divestments, we expect to end the year at a leverage ratio around 5.8x and to trend down from there in line with our 2020 Vision. Lastly, we continue to focus on strengthening our debt structure to increasing exposure to long-term notes and shifting a greater percentage of our debt to foreign jurisdictions, which creates a natural currency hedge to mitigate translation exposure while also being tax efficient. In September, we raised CAD 250 million in senior notes at 5.375% due in 2023 and closed on a AUD 250 million syndicated Term Loan B facility, which matures in September 2022 and currently bears interest at 6.05%. Overall, we are pleased with our performance this quarter and with the progress we've made integrating Recall and executing on our Transformation Program.
Looking ahead, we are confident that we are well positioned to deliver on our short-term and long-term financial projections. Our expectations are underscored by the durability of our business, and we are extending that durability through solid execution of our strategic plan and optimizing our costs. 
Before closing, I want to mention that I continue to be impressed with the caliber of the team here at Iron Mountain and appreciate the passion that our teams in the field have to care for our customers. Their focus on moving the business forward during a major acquisition and integration was evident in the performance this quarter. I continue to expand my knowledge of the Iron Mountain business and look forward to meeting with many of you in person over the coming months. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill for closing remarks."

I think where we still remain optimistic that there'll be upside is when we get into the real estate consolidation. But obviously, that's for longer term. I think the biggest fuel to being able to get it faster beyond, Stu, was cultural, that when -- you always -- when you have a competitor across you, you always tend to think they're more different than yourselves. But actually, when we brought the 2 organization, there was a lot of common understanding and common way of doing things. And the result of that was we're able to bring the teams together much faster because especially these early synergies are mainly headcount related. So I'd say, we weren't -- we're not going deeper than expected in terms of the headcount reductions, but the speed at which we're able to align processes and then release people was much faster than we planned. So I would say it's probably the key driver has been cultural. But I'd say in terms of further upside is, we still remain focused that we think there's going to be further upside when we start consolidating the facilities.

I think if I -- I've always said on the calls for the last, I would say, few quarters that it's really the transportation. I'd say that's generally down between high single digits, low double digits in terms of revenues. So it's continuing -- we've continued to see the trend. As I said before, I think, on a couple of calls ago, we see kind of a flattening out of that archival drop in transportation when look at the paper storage business or the record storage side of the business. But in the Data Management, it's still a little bit lagging, that transition into becoming more about backup and recovery rather than rotating the tape. So -- and I -- and we still aren't declaring a bottom. So if you say going forward, I still expect that we're going to see transportation declines in the tape business still in the high single-digit, low double-digit level. So it's really -- it's not the projects that are driving that. It's the transportation decline. So the -- I mean, the good news, if you look at the storage, as we said, that the storage both on a revenue and a volume basis, if you look at revenue quarter-on-quarter, we're up a little over 2%. If you look on a trailing 12 months in terms of volume, we're up 2%. And keep in mind, is if we look at the margins of the business and the profitability of the business, whilst I think services is important, it's first the most important in terms of differentiating our storage product because that's where we build the reliability in, it's through the robustness of our transportation. But the part that's driving the cash in the business, we continue to be pleased with. But if you're asking me just specific on transportation, I have to say that I expect it to continue to decline in the high single, low double digits for a few more quarters because we still seem to be behind the transition that we've pretty much have worked most of the way through on the records management side."

And whilst it does drive the top line in terms of the revenue, again, if you come down to in terms of -- if you go back up say -- you see, even though that we've lost that project, which -- so you're now seeing kind of raw, more of the transportation decline than you see in some quarters, is it hasn't affected our ability in terms of driving overall profit growth. But you're right. We do see -- and those typically -- I'm not saying all, but most of those lumpy projects come in our film and sound unit."

And the reason for that is that is, is that the integration costs out of Recall are really hitting in the REIT subsidiaries. So you're not getting any tax benefit from those, and that is different than we had originally assumed. You've got -- about 1/3 of it is coming from the amortization of customer tangibles, right? That's really what came out of purchase accounting. And as we finalized purchase accounting, I'll point out that, that's noncash so that you could add that -- add it back in AFFO. So that's about 1/3 of it. And the last piece of it is really interest expense, and that's the rest of it, and that's really the timing as we talked about of the divestment proceeds and a little bit lower proceeds from that on a cash basis."

I think a lot of it goes back to what we did, and I wouldn't say last quarter's performance was because of noise of Recall. It's just that on a quarter-by-quarter basis, it does move around. But we're starting to see that whilst this isn't a high-growth business, there is still growth to be achieved, which I know is counterintuitive. But I think this business will be running longer than the iPhone franchise, right? I mean, it -- I know a lot of people in their stomach don't believe that.

What I do feel -- and I talked about it a little bit about on my call, in my script or when I was going through my remarks saying that innovation is an important part. And one of the things bringing the 2 organizations together, it gives us not only a larger customer base, but it gives us more capacity to innovate, and that innovation resonates with our customers. What we're finding, especially for the regulated customers that have to worry about compliance in so many different jurisdictions, the fact that we can give them better solutions around information governance is a differentiating factor. And you can say do they pay for the product or do they pay more for the storage? And sometimes, it's built up in the storage cost or pricing. And sometimes, it's built up in the product. But what we do find is that the world is getting more complex especially for the heavily regulated industries, and bringing the 2 companies together does give us more economies of scale to do that kind of R&D, and that is resonating with customers, so I wouldn't -- I think that's the way I think about the power of bringing of the 2 companies together. It just gives us a deeper pool, if you will, to innovate around. And that -- and so far, it's early days, but I've spent a fair amount of time in -- with different customers. We had a top financial service customer forum in Louisiana in June. I just came back from one in Europe a couple of weeks ago. And there's even more excitement that I'm hearing from our large customers about bringing the 2 companies together, rather than less, because they're expecting even more in the way of innovation. The other thing I would highlight is it's early days, but I also expect -- we've reorganized the North American sales force again a little bit in light of bringing Recall in. They were, as I said, much better at running after the middle market, which is a higher-margin segment. And a lot of it is embedded, and we haven't been as present there as Iron Mountain, whereas Recall was more present. And so now the Head of North American Sales is the person from Recall who's driving the charge, not just in terms of our traditional segment in the enterprise, but he also has 2 new leaders that are helping drive more penetration into the middle market, which we expect of over time to start coming through. It's early days. You don't see that in the numbers today, but I would like to see an improvement in those areas."

But our total liquidity right about now is about $1.1 billion. You've got to remember, we did one of the debt offerings right at the very end of the quarter, so we have the cash sitting on the balance sheet, and it has paid off the credit facility. And then in addition, in October, we did the $50 million mortgage notes, so that brought down the balance as well. Sitting -- it's sort of fixed to floating at, call it, 74% today. We're continuing to sort of evaluate where we are in the cycle. I think those -- over time, you'll see us stay in the 70% to 80% range. My personal view would be to try to continue to push that up a little bit given where the world is today, but we're sort of right in the middle of where our target range is."

And as we finish the restructuring, I'd say there'll a little bit more of that next year, and that's built into our guidance because we now have clear view of what the restructuring is left that's in the qualified REIT subsidiary versus not. So we know what the tax deductibility is. But I think you can probably appreciate when you you're buying a public company, trying to have that level of detail until you actually get into the restructuring, that's where you get into the tax detectability. But if you think about it in terms of the ability, whilst cash taxes does affect AFFO as well, but when we're starting to actually get through those onetime restructuring charges, then we're still in line with what we think the total cost of the integration project is.

The other thing I'd point out though too, as we've gone through -- in cleaning up and  reconciling things, I want to turn to AFFO for a second, is if you go back and look at second quarter AFFO, we actually had understated that by around $10 million. That's because we had a -- for a Mexico REIT subsidiary, we had some onetime tax integration cost or tax that we had to pay to restructure that entity. Those costs had actually been accrued as part of purchase accounting, never went through the P&L. Because it was cash tax payment, it had actually gotten picked up as a reduction of AFFO last quarter, but it was onetime in nature. Those are the types of things we exclude. So if you go back and look at second quarter, AFFO was actually better in our trends, and that's one of the things we talked about, AFFO guidance being above the midpoint for the year. That gives us comfort."

We are pleased to be reporting a solid quarter, and I'm also happy to be partnering with Stuart Brown for his first Iron Mountain quarterly conference call. Stuart's been on board since the time we reported Q2 and has been spending a lot of time in the field familiarizing himself with the business and working closely with Rod during the transition. Stuart will deliver financial highlights in just a bit.
For the third quarter, we delivered revenue and adjusted OIBDA results right in line with our expectations and notably drove our adjusted OIBDA margins back to 31.2%, more in line with historical norms prior to integrating the historically lower-margin Recall business. In addition, we continued to see consistent trends in our core business with positive internal storage rental revenue and volume growth in developed markets; a greater portion of our revenue coming from faster-growing emerging markets; and good momentum in our adjacent business segment, particularly data center.
As noted last quarter, due to our quick actions, we are getting Recall integration synergies faster than expected. In fact, we now expect to exit 2016 having achieved more than 85% of the total synergies we expected to have achieved by year-end 2017. This is up from 80% in our Q2 call, and we continue to expect in-year synergies to be $18 million. It is this achievement of getting synergies faster and the added benefit from our transformation initiative, which is the fuel that allowed us to increase the dividend per share starting in Q4 by 13% from $0.485 to $0.55 per share. As you will recall, this is in line with what we laid out at our Investor Day a year ago, but we are achieving it a full quarter earlier despite closing the Recall transaction later than originally expected.
Before going into Q3 performance, let me first provide a little more color on the Recall integration. As we've noted in the past, the Recall transaction benefits us in 3 primary ways: first, the level of synergy enables meaningful growth in AFFO and cash available for distribution, which funds increasing dividends and provides cash for continued investment in the business, all whilst over time delevering; second, it strengthens our ability to reach the high-margin midmarket business where Recall had a strong presence compared with Iron Mountain's enterprise focus; and third, it enhances our global footprint, particularly in emerging markets, giving us more exposure to these faster-growing and attractive markets.
As noted in the past, integration efforts will increase the Recall base margin business, which has historically operated at 600 to 700 basis points lower than ours in 3 areas: SG&A, labor and in the longer term, real estate consolidation benefits. We also continue our detailed review of our real estate platform as we consider further consolidation opportunities, which we believe can provide additional benefit over time. Further, the growth in cash flow allows us to invest in new products and innovation for the benefit of our customers: innovation around areas from how we bundle services and simplify pricing, to utilizing excess building capacity for other types of storage, to deleveraging our sector-leading knowledge to offer technology solutions to our customers.
An example of this is our Analytics Dashboard that we recently introduced to help records and information managers demonstrate the effectiveness of their information governance programs and uncover the value of their data. The dashboard helped them manage retention schedules, improve inventory tracking, identify potential risk and compliance concerns and conduct internal and peer benchmarking of best practices. In addition to improving tools such as the dashboard, we're also testing better and easier ways for customers to interact with us through mobile devices that enable voice recognition. When we refer to innovation, we're talking about tapping the ideas our customers and employees have for new products and solutions, vetting them and then incorporating them into our customer solutions and processes in order to further strengthen our differentiation and profitability. We have discussed some of these items previously, such as our emerging partnership with the likes of EMC/virtue stream and now Dell in building air gap, which provides customers with the added cybersecurity all of us seek. It is these innovations and others, which not only provide additional value to our customers, but will also add to future earnings growth, both as stand-alone products as well as further differentiating our existing offerings. We're planning to host our next Investor Day in late April 2017, at which time we intend to share a few of these innovation ideas with you. We'll also have about a full year of Recall under our belts by that time.
In addition, we continue to make progress on the dispositions required by the regulators. You may have seen that just last week, we received approval from the ACCC, or the Australian regulator, for the disposition of our legacy business in Australia to Housatonic Partners, a private equity firm. The AUD 70 million transaction closed yesterday. In addition, we continue to make progress on the sale of the required assets in the U.S., Canada and the United Kingdom. We're pleased with our progress on these dispositions, and we'll bring you updates as those transactions are approved by the regulators and closed. We now expect that total dispositions will generate approximately $185 million in gross proceeds compared with our initial estimate of $220 million. Whilst this total is a bit lighter than we originally expected, we are pleased with where we've landed and believe the transactions are consistent with our commercial goals in those markets.
Let me now turn to some highlights before Stuart walks you through the details that can also be found in the bridging graphs in our supplemental report. Total revenue growth in constant dollars was up more than 27% with similar growth rates in constant dollar storage, rental and service revenue. Adjusted OIBDA, as I mentioned at the beginning, is back to nearly our high levels before the acquisition with adjusted OIBDA margins up 150 basis points from Q2. On an internal basis, storage rental growth was 2.6%, and we continue to expect average storage rental internal growth to be around 2.5% for the full year. Internal volume growth, which excludes the initial Recall volume we added when we closed the transaction, was positive in all storage segments and at 1.8% for the quarter. In short, we maintained our focus even in the midst of the Recall integration-related activity.
Year-to-date, service revenue was basically flat over last year, reflecting the variability and timing of the projects. Based on our service project pipeline, we expect internal service revenue growth to be roughly flat for the full year. As we've talked about on previous calls, given our expected change in service mix, we continue to focus on improving service gross profit and protecting returns on invested capital rather than on service gross margins. We continue to focus on driving productivity improvement in our service business, but it's important to keep in mind that 83% of our gross profit is from storage. Whilst we continue to devote a fair amount of attention to how we can grow and enhance our service business, our service lines, first and foremost, provide a strong differentiation to our core storage business.
Turning to progress on our strategic plan, which entails getting the most out of our developed markets, increasing our presence in the fast-growing emerging markets and expanding in faster-growing adjacent businesses, we continue to make progress on each of these pillars and the foundational elements that support them. In developed markets, which includes both North America RIM and our Western European segment, we added 3.6 million cubic feet of internal volume growth. North America RIM storage growth was 1.1%, reflecting positive volume growth. This is all before the impact of Recall and any other acquisitions during the period. In emerging markets, it is important to note that these markets are differentiated through higher levels of internal storage growth of roughly 10%. Our goal is to expand our presence and leverage our scale to drive these markets to 20% of our total revenue by 2020. You may remember, we announced the beginning of this journey about 3 years ago, where we started at 10% of our sales coming from this fast-growing segment. By the beginning of this year, we had approached 16% of our sales coming from emerging markets and now, with Recall's footprint, we are at 17.1% of total revenue on a 2014 constant dollar basis. Whilst we did not close any international acquisitions during the quarter, we continue to expect total M&A investment in the range of $140 million to $180 million this year, having closed on roughly $56 million year-to-date, excluding Recall. More specifically, we expect 4 significant transactions in the emerging markets to close in Q4, which will utilize about $75 million of the remaining M&A budget. In addition to this final-stage pipeline in the emerging markets, there are a number of smaller tuck-ins, mainly in developed markets, which are expected to close. An example of this focus and continued execution can be readily seen in our Southeast Asian markets plus China. At the start of the year, this region represented just $14 million of annual sales. With the acquisition of Recall and upon closing the Santa Fe transaction we discussed last quarter, we'll have grown our business in this region to annualized revenue of more than $100 million, with leading positions in virtually all countries where we operate within the region.
In our adjacent business segment, we are on track to achieve our stated goal to generate 5% of our total worldwide revenue from adjacent businesses by the end of 2020, up from just 2% at the end of 2015.
In our data center business, we announced a major lease in the quarter in our purpose-built Boston Data Center with SimpliVity, a leader in infrastructure enterprise IT. SimpliVity needed data center resources to support its engineering lab, and our colocation solution was the right fit from a cost, capacity, efficiency and security perspective. They noted that our 65-year track record of protecting proprietary assets gave them the confidence to trust a third-party with such an expansion. In addition, a couple of weeks ago, we broke ground on construction of the first building of our 83-acre data center campus in Manassas, Virginia using a development partner for this first 150,000 square foot data center. This building will deliver superior physical security, lower power cost and a reduced tax structure compared to other national locations. In total, our Northern Virginia Data Center Campus will support 42 megawatts of critical load, spread across a planned 4 individual colocation facilities. This represents a 4x expansion of our current capacity. The first building, expected to open in summer 2017, will offer 10.5 megawatts of critical power and a flexible design that can meet the more exacting requirements of cloud service providers, Federal Government, system integrators, financial service firms and health care companies. It will also comply with Federal technology and environmental regulations, enabling Federal agencies and integrators to comply by stated deadlines for efficient, sustainable data centers. We're pleased with the momentum we're seeing in the business and are continuing to manage capacity utilization to stay ahead of demand, whilst benefiting from preleasing activity in existing markets. Combining our Boston facility with the undergrounds of Boyers, Pennsylvania and Kansas City, our data center space is greater than 90% committed, and we are on track to achieve internal growth of 20% to 25% in this business area. Whilst we don't break out our data center business separately in our financials, we continue to achieve top line organic growth in this business, and we expect to end 2016 with an exit run rate of $25 million in sales, which compares favorably with our 2015 exit rate of $20 million.
In terms of supporting foundations for the strategic plan, we continue to make progress on our transformation initiative to remove $125 million in SG&A. We expect to action an additional $18 million of savings by the end of this year, bringing us to $100 million in run rate savings to be recognized in 2017. Whilst we didn't incur much in the way of additional cost in Q3, we laid the groundwork for improvements to be implemented next year, focused on achieving the final $25 million of this $125 million program.
Given the timing of Recall synergies, our Transformation Program and positive business trends, we remain confident that we will generate cash flow in line with the growth expectations we highlighted during Investor Day and updated in recent presentations. This provides the foundation for our dividend growth. Our newly declared quarterly dividend of $0.55 per share equates to an increase of about 13%, reflecting the benefit of synergies and transformation. Our expectations continue to be to grow the underlying business and cash flow, which will support an increase in our dividend per share by an additional 7% in 2018 and 4% annual growth thereafter, in line with our strategic plan whilst also funding core growth racking, M&A and overall investments.
As we progress our plan, we'll generate more cash available to support discretionary investments, so we'll borrow less to fund our growth plan and continue to deliver. Our operations are underpinned by our very durable growing business that performs consistently throughout business cycles. We have a durable storage business that generates roughly $1.9 billion of annual storage net operating income, which exceeds that generated by leaders in both the industrial and self-storage real estate sectors. Our lack of volatility through economic cycles and business durability clearly distinguishes our business. It is this durability that delivers consistent operating performance with high rates of utilization and stable pricing in both good and bad economies.
Another thing that distinguishes our business is our relative insensitivity to higher interest rates compared with most REITs. First, our customer storage needs are largely unaffected by interest rate movements. Second, our core storage NOI doesn't change with the value of the underlying real estate. Third, we incur virtually no TIs, or tenant improvements, if a customer leaves and we bring in a new one. Importantly, we have an operating business, and we effectively control real estate through long-term leases with multiple lease extension options and direct ownership at strategic locations of about 1/3 of our properties. In an increasing rate environment, this structure reduces our exposure to real estate value fluctuations compared with REITs that own their entire portfolios. Additionally, it should be noted that we generally enjoy higher levels of real price increases during periods with more inflation.
In summary, it was a solid quarter with good execution on all 3 pillars of our strategic plan even in the midst of the Recall integration. We achieved solid internal and constant dollar growth, continued volume increases and meaningful expanded OIBDA margins, all of which support increased cash flow and the 13% increase in our dividend per share.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Stuart."

Let me start by saying how excited I am to be a part of Iron Mountain and working with mountaineers around the globe. The durability of Iron Mountain's records management and related businesses and its substantial opportunity to continue to optimize performance, following the Recall acquisition and through our strategic plan, is just part of what drew me to Iron Mountain. I'm really pleased that our strong results this quarter demonstrate our ability to execute. There are many opportunities ahead, and I believe it's a very exciting time to be a part of the team. Before diving into the details of our financials, let me take a moment and walk you through the key highlights of the quarter.
First, we achieved strong internal storage rental revenue growth of 2.6%, excluding Recall and other small acquisitions. This compares with 2.1% last quarter, reflecting solid underlying business fundamentals and continued volume growth across all major markets. Making up over 80% of our gross profits growth in the storage rental business remains our key execution focus.
Second, we enhanced our profitability. Adjusted OIBDA margins improved by 150 basis points from the second quarter as benefits from the Transformation Program and synergies from the Recall transaction flow into our results. Third, we're making great progress in the integration of Recall, and over 85% of the $115 million of 2017 gross synergies will be in process by the end of this year. Fourth, since June 30, we completed approximately $380 million of debt refinancing at attractive rates, including a recent $50 million mortgage, resulting in about 74% of our debt now being fixed after paying down the revolver in early October, and that compares to 68% in the second quarter. Our average maturity was 5.1 years, and our weighted average interest rate was 5.1%. Our Canadian debt offering, tied to the lowest coupon ever in the high-yield Canadian market, demonstrating our debt investors' appreciation of our solid cash flow and recognition that our leverage is in line with many investment-grade REITs. We remain steadily on track to deliver on short-term financial objectives and long-term goals. And as Bill mentioned, it is based upon this continued demonstration of growth, the durability of our cash flows and capital efficiency that our Board of Directors increased our dividend by 13% to $0.55 per share.
Now that I've covered the highlights, I will go over our worldwide financial results followed by a review of our performance by segment and conclude with a discussion on our outlook for 2016 and a preliminary view on 2017. Consistent with prior quarters, we provided bridging schedules for total revenue, adjusted OIBDA, adjusted earnings per share and FFO per share to explain key variances in our year-on-year performance. These schedules can be found on Pages 23 through 26 of the supplemental. Let me walk you through the highlights. For the third quarter, our total reported revenues increased 26.3% or 27.4% on a constant dollar basis. Excluding the Recall and other smaller acquisitions, total internal revenue increased 1.4% in the third quarter compared with a 0.4% increase in Q2, again with improvement in all regions and segments. We expect total internal revenue growth in 2016 to be between 1.5% and 2%, reflecting continued solid performance in our higher-margin storage activities and growth in adjacent businesses, offset by modest declines in service revenues.
Let's look at storage and service revenue performance in the quarter. Storage rental revenue is the core economic driver of our business, representing 61% of revenue and 83% of our total gross profit. As I mentioned earlier, our third quarter storage internal growth accelerated to 2.6% from 2.2% growth in the first half of the year, and we continue to expect full year storage internal growth of approximately 2.5%.
Service revenues, which make up 39% of total revenues and 17% of our gross profit, declined 0.5% from a year ago, compared to a year-over-year decline of 2.1% in Q2. As we've highlighted in previous calls, the mix shift in our service business growth rates can be a bit volatile on a quarter-on-quarter basis. However, we expect internal service revenue growth to be about flat for the full year. Total third quarter gross profit margin declined slightly from Q2 due mainly to the additional month of Recall results. As we have previously highlighted, Recall, preacquisition, operated at a lower margin than Iron Mountain, due in part to having higher rent expense as a percentage of revenue as Recall leased almost all of their facilities. However, we were able to capture overhead efficiencies and other synergies to more than offset this margin decline, resulting in expansion of adjusted OIBDA margin.
In the quarter, we grew total adjusted OIBDA by 29.1% on a reported dollar basis and by approximately 30% on a constant dollar basis. Importantly, adjusted OIBDA margins expanded year-on-year and sequentially to 31.2% as we continued to see benefits from transformation actions and from Recall synergies. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.27. Adjusted EPS was impacted by the amortization of Recall's customer relationship values and the depreciation expense of legacy Recall racking structures. As a reminder, the amortization expense of customer relationships flows through to funds from operations. However, the increased depreciation does not because real estate depreciation is excluded from FFO. Normalized FFO per share was $0.44 for the quarter. The decline in FFO per share was driven by 2 factors. First, the increased noncash amortization of Recall's customer relationship intangibles, as discussed back in April, that is not added back to calculate FFO. Second is the tax impact of Recall-related expenses. As most of the costs of this integration phase were incurred in our qualified REIT subsidiary, they did not provide a tax shield. This last item also impacted our effective tax rate, which appears high as the Recall costs and the $14 million impairment reduced pretax income. However, they did not reduce taxes recorded in our taxable subsidiaries. This is a short-term effect of the integration effort.
Third quarter AFFO was $169 million compared with $134 million in the year-ago period, fueling our dividend increase. Remember, AFFO adds back noncash items such as amortization and noncash or discrete tax items, so AFFO was not as impacted by the same items that impacted FFO.
Let's turn quickly to our financial performance by segment. Pages 15 and 16 of the supplemental outline our performance by segment in detail for the quarter and on a year-to-date basis. Let me touch on a few highlights from these pages. In North America, Records and Information Management, or RIM, internal storage rental revenue increased by 1.1%, reflecting strong internal volume growth. In North America Data Management, or DM, we saw strong internal storage rental growth of 2.2%, reflecting an improvement from the second quarter. However, service internal growth declined due to the timing of projects and the ongoing reduction in tape rotation as we have discussed previously.
The Western European segment had 0.3% of internal storage rental growth, having been impacted by the carryforward of certain contract negotiations that we mentioned on our last earnings call. In the Other International segment, we continue to see strong storage and service internal revenue growth of 11.6% and 6.9%, respectively.
Let me now talk about the Recall integration progress and the costs that we have incurred so far to achieve synergies and integrate Recall with our business. Bill explained we remain on track to achieve the synergies in total, albeit we are getting there a bit faster. Our expectations of total cost to achieve synergies are still consistent with prior projections: $380 million and deal cost of $80 million. In the fourth quarter, we expect to incur roughly $50 million in operating expenses and $17 million in capital expenditures as we accelerate the cost-savings programs. Year-to-date, Q3, we have incurred $103 million of integration and deal close costs and $7 million in capital expenditure. Additional details can be found in our 10-Q, which will be filed later this week. Please note that these onetime items are excluded from our adjusted OIBDA calculation.
Let's turn to our outlook for 2016 and preliminary outlook for 2017, summarized on Pages 10 and 11 of the supplemental. Our outlook for business trends and fundamentals remains unchanged, with consistent storage rental growth and accelerating growth in our International and adjacent businesses. In addition, our expectations for Recall's contribution and our stand-alone business contribution remain unchanged as seen on the table at the bottom of our guidance page. Our guidance is now on a reported dollar basis, given foreign exchange differences during the year have been small, and this now serves as the baseline for our 2017 outlook. Further, we have updated our 2016 FFO guidance to adjust for the increases in income tax expense, amortization and interest. Our AFFO guidance remains unchanged at $610 million to $650 million, reflecting savings we have identified in maintenance capital since the Recall acquisition as well as non-real estate capital expenditures, which were partially offset by increases in interest expense and cash taxes. However, we anticipate AFFO for the full year to come in above the midpoint of our guidance.
Our interest expense for the year is higher than we originally assumed due to the timing and amount of divestiture proceeds as well as additional Recall integration-related spend. AFFO continues to provide ample funding for dividends and core growth racking investments. Given the higher interest in taxes than our original guidance, we expect adjusted EPS to be near the low end of our guidance range for the year. Upon further review of Recall's real estate assets and overall systems requirements, we reduced our capital expenditure outlook, real estate and non-real estate maintenance as well as real non-real estate investment by $25 million for 2016. The capital efficiency that is created by bringing the 2 businesses together is better than we had originally anticipated. Therefore, this is an elimination, not a deferral of spend. In addition, we've reduced our real estate investments by $95 million, driven mostly by delayed spending on lease conversions and certain real estate development as we make sure we take the time to optimize each market's needs and negotiate with landlords to consolidate facilities in light of the Recall transaction. Note that the reduction in real estate spend this year is not impacting our synergy or margin outlook or 2020 Vision, as we know that these types of investments take a period of time to stabilize.
Distributions for the year will total around $500 million, resulting in our dividend payout ratio as a percentage of AFFO consistent with our prior guidance under 80% and becoming more aligned with REIT peers over time.
Let's touch on our preliminary guidance for 2017, which is based on September 30 exchange rates. At a high level, this guidance is consistent with long-term expectations, with slightly lower growth from acquisitions given our focus on Recall this year. At the midpoint of our guidance, we expect adjusted OIBDA to grow by 17% and AFFO to grow by 12% in 2017 compared with 2016. We'll provide more detail on capital allocation and other guidance for 2017 in February after we file -- finalize prioritizing investments. We expect maintenance capital expenditures and non-real estate investments to be approximately $170 million next year, together representing roughly 4.5% of revenue, consistent with 2016.
Shifting briefly to the balance sheet, we currently have liquidity of approximately $1.1 billion and a lease-adjusted debt ratio of 5.7x, as expected. In the short term, given the timing of proceeds from divestments, we expect to end the year at a leverage ratio around 5.8x and to trend down from there in line with our 2020 Vision. Lastly, we continued to focus on strengthening our debt structure through increasing exposure to long-term notes and shifting a greater percentage of our debt to foreign jurisdictions, which creates a natural currency hedge to mitigate translation exposure while also being tax efficient. In September, we raised CAD 250 million in senior notes at 5.375% due in 2023 and closed on a AUD 250 million syndicated Term Loan B facility, which matures in September 2022 and currently bears interest at 6.05%. Overall, we are pleased with our performance this quarter and with the progress we have made integrating Recall and executing on our Transformation Program.
Looking ahead, we are confident that we are well positioned to deliver on our short-term and long-term financial projections. Our expectations are underscored by the durability of our business, and we are extending that durability through solid execution of our strategic plan and optimizing our costs. 
Before closing, I want to mention that I continue to be impressed with the caliber of the team here at Iron Mountain and appreciate the passion that our teams in the field have to care for our customers. Their focus on moving the business forward during a major acquisition and integration was evident in the performance this quarter. I continue to expand my knowledge of the Iron Mountain business and look forward to meeting with many of you in person over the coming months. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill for closing remarks."

I think where we still remain optimistic that there'll be upside is when we get into the real estate consolidation. But obviously, that's the longer term. I think the biggest fuel to being able to get it faster, to be honest with you, was cultural, that when -- you always, when you have a competitor across you, you always tend to think they're more different than yourselves. But actually, when we brought the 2 organization, there was a lot of common understanding and common way of doing things. And the result of that was we were able to bring the teams together much faster because especially these early synergies are mainly headcount related. So as I say, we weren't -- we're not going deeper than expected in terms of the headcount reductions, but the speed at which we were able to align processes and then release people was much faster than we planned. So I would say it's probably the key driver has been cultural. But as I say, in terms of further upside, is we still remain focused that we think there's going to be further upside when we start consolidating the facilities. But that's still -- that's more in the midterm rather than the near term."

I think if I -- I've always said on the calls for the last, I would say, few quarters that it's really the transportation. I'd say that's generally down between high single digits, low double digits in terms of revenues. So it's continuing -- we've continued to see the trend. As I said before, I think, on a couple of calls ago, we see a kind of a flattening out of that archival drop in transportation when we look at the paper storage business or the record storage side of the business. But in the Data Management, it's still a little bit lagging, that transition into becoming more about backup and recovery rather than rotating the tape. So -- and I -- and we still aren't declaring a bottom. So if you say going forward, I'd still expect that we're going to see transportation declines in the tape business still in the high single-digit, low double-digit level. So it's really -- it's not the projects that are driving that. It's the transportation decline. So the -- I mean, the good news, if you look at the storage, as we said, that the storage both on a revenue and a volume basis, if you look at revenue quarter-on-quarter, we're up a little over 2%. If you look on a trailing 12 months in terms of volume, we're up 2%. And to keep in mind, is if we look at the margins of the business and the profitability of the business, whilst I think services is important, it's first and most important in terms of differentiating our storage product because that's where we build the reliability in, is through the robustness of our transportation. But the part that's driving the cash in the business, we continue to be pleased with. But if you're asking me just specific on transportation, I have to say that I expect it to continue to decline in the high single, low double digits for a few more quarters because we still seem to be behind the transition that we've pretty much have worked most of the way through on the records management side."

And the reason for that is, is that the integration costs out of Recall are really hitting in the REIT subsidiaries. So you're not getting any tax benefit from those, and that is different than we had originally assumed. You've got about 1/3 of it that's coming from the amortization of customer intangibles, right?

I think we've got the sales force much more organized and aligned. Yes, we did the big organization 3 years ago. That's starting to bear fruit. And as you know, as being a long observer of this business, nothing happens fast. But you have to put certain foundations and building blocks. So my -- I wouldn't say it's any one thing. I think a lot of it goes back to what we did, and I wouldn't say last quarter's performance was because of noise of Recall. It's just that on a quarter-by-quarter basis, it does move around. But we're starting to see that whilst this isn't a high-growth business, there is still growth to be achieved, which I know is counterintuitive. But I think this business will be running longer than the iPhone franchise, right? I mean, it -- I know a lot of people in their stomach don't believe that. But if you look at the results, we continue to drive positive organic growth out of the business. And I think the new organization gets better and better every quarter of doing that.

What I do feel -- and I talked about it a little bit about on my call, in my script or when I was going through my remarks saying that innovation is an important part. And one of the things bringing the 2 organizations together, it gives us not only a larger customer base, but it gives us more capacity to innovate. And that innovation resonates with our customers. What we're finding, especially for the regulated customers that have to worry about compliance in so many different jurisdictions, the fact that we can give them better solutions around information governance is a differentiating factor. And you can say, do they pay for the product or do they pay more for the storage? And sometimes, it's built up in the storage cost or pricing. And sometimes, it's built up in the product. But what we do find is that the world is getting more complex especially for the heavily regulated industries, and bringing the 2 companies together does give us more economies of scale to do that kind of R&D. And that is resonating with customers. So I wouldn't -- I think that's the way I think about the power of bringing of the 2 companies together. It just gives us a deeper pool, if you will, to innovate around. And that -- and so far, it's early days, but I've spent a fair amount of time in -- with different customers. We had a top financial service customer forum in Louisiana in June. I just came back from one in Europe a couple of weeks ago. And there's even more excitement that I'm hearing from our large customers about bringing the 2 companies together, rather than less, because they're expecting even more in the way of innovation. The other thing I would highlight is, it's early days, but I also expect -- we've reorganized the North American sales force again a little bit in light of bringing Recall in. They were, as I said, much better at running after the middle market, which is a higher-margin segment. And a lot of it is unvended, and we haven't been as present there as Iron Mountain, whereas Recall was more present. And so now the Head of North American Sales is the person from Recall who's driving the charge, not just in terms of our traditional segment in the enterprise, but he also has 2 new leaders that are helping drive more penetration into the middle market, which we expect over time to start coming through. It's early days. You don't see that in the numbers today, but I would expect to see an improvement in those areas."

But when you actually start negotiating with sellers, each seller -- each buyer, rather, I should say, has different parameters that they're interested in. And lining that up that, that makes sense for the regulator and makes sense for us commercially is something that we work through. So I think the -- hence, my comment is that we're lighter on cash that we're getting from these dispositions, but we're quite pleased in terms of where we're coming out commercially. So I think it's -- I think everybody wins on those things.

The issue is -- and it's specifically in the U.S., right? Because that's where we have the tax deductibility or nontax deductibility depending if it's in the QRS or the TRS, or the qualified REIT subsidiary or the nonqualified subsidiary, is when we got into the U.S., a lot of the cost savings were in the part of Recall that would be in terms of the qualified REIT subsidiary, and that was where..."

It doesn't affect International because although we do have -- split between qualified and nonqualified subsidiaries, you remember that internationally, we get fully taxed in those local entities because the U.S. REIT rules don't apply. It's important in terms of the way we repatriate money back into the United States for dividends, but it's not important in the local tax scheme. So it's specifically a U.S. situation. And as we finish the restructuring, I'd say there'll a little bit more of that next year. And that's built into our guidance because we now have clear view of what the restructuring is left that's in the qualified REIT subsidiary versus not. So we know where the tax deductibility is. But I think you can probably appreciate when you're buying a public company, trying to have that level of detail until you actually get into the restructuring, that's where you get into the tax detectability. But if you think about it in terms of the ability, whilst cash taxes does affect AFFO as well, but when we're starting to actually get through those onetime restructuring charges, then we're still in line with what we think the total cost of the integration project is. But I know -- Stuart, you may want to talk about the intangibles."

So we've not fully flowed that through our forecast for the rest of the year. So could we have forecast better? Maybe, but it's getting updated now. The other thing I'd point out though too, as we've gone through in cleaning up and  reconciling things, I want to turn to AFFO for a second, is if you go back and look at second quarter AFFO, we actually had understated that by around $10 million. That's because we had a -- for a Mexico REIT subsidiary, we had some onetime tax integration cost or tax that we had to pay to restructure that entity. Those costs had actually been accrued as part of purchase accounting, never went through the P&L. Because it was a cash tax payment, it had actually gotten picked up as a reduction of AFFO last quarter, but it was onetime in nature. Those are the types of things we exclude. So if you go back and look at second quarter, AFFO was actually better in our trends. And that's one of the things, when we talked about AFFO guidance being above the midpoint for the year, that gives us comfort."

For the third quarter, we delivered revenue and adjusted OIBDA results right in line with our expectations and notably drove our adjusted OIBDA margins back to 31.2%, more in line with historical norms prior to integrating the historically lower-margin Recall business. In addition, we continued to see consistent trends in our core business with positive internal storage rental revenue and volume growth in developed markets; a greater portion of our revenue coming from faster-growing emerging markets; and good momentum in our adjacent business segment, particularly data center.
As noted last quarter, due to our quick actions, we are getting Recall integration synergies faster than expected. In fact, we now expect to exit 2016 having achieved more than 85% of the total synergies we expected to have achieved by year-end 2017. This is up from 80% in our Q2 call, and we continue to expect in-year synergies to be $18 million. It is this achievement of getting synergies faster and the added benefit from our transformation initiative, which is the fuel that allowed us to increase the dividend per share starting in Q4 by 13% from $0.485 to $0.55 per share. As you will recall, this is in line with what we laid out at our Investor Day a year ago, but we are achieving it a full quarter earlier despite closing the Recall transaction later than originally expected.
Before going into Q3 performance, let me first provide a little more color on the Recall integration. As we've noted in the past, the Recall transaction benefits us in 3 primary ways: first, the level of synergy enables meaningful growth in AFFO and cash available for distribution, which funds increasing dividends and provides cash for continued investment in the business, all whilst over time delevering; second, it strengthens our ability to reach the high-margin midmarket business where Recall had a strong presence compared with Iron Mountain's enterprise focus; and third, it enhances our global footprint, particularly in emerging markets, giving us more exposure to these faster-growing and attractive markets.
As noted in the past, integration efforts will increase the Recall base margin business, which has historically operated at 600 to 700 basis points lower than ours in 3 areas: SG&A, labor and in the longer term, real estate consolidation benefits. We also continue our detailed review of our real estate platform as we consider further consolidation opportunities, which we believe can provide additional benefit over time. Further, the growth in cash flow allows us to invest in new products and innovation for the benefit of our customers: innovation around areas from how we bundle services and simplify pricing, to utilizing excess building capacity for other types of storage, to deleveraging our sector-leading knowledge to offer technology solutions to our customers.
An example of this is our Analytics Dashboard that we recently introduced to help records and information managers demonstrate the effectiveness of their information governance programs and uncover the value of their data. The dashboard helped them manage retention schedules, improve inventory tracking, identify potential risk and compliance concerns and conduct internal and peer benchmarking of best practices. In addition to improving tools such as the dashboard, we're also testing better and easier ways for customers to interact with us through mobile devices that enable voice recognition. When we refer to innovation, we're talking about tapping the ideas our customers and employees have for new products and solutions, vetting them and then incorporating them into our customer solutions and processes in order to further strengthen our differentiation and profitability. We have discussed some of these items previously, such as our emerging partnership with the likes of EMC/virtue stream and now Dell in building air gap, which provides customers with the added cybersecurity all of us seek. It is these innovations and others, which not only provide additional value to our customers, but will also add to future earnings growth, both as stand-alone products as well as further differentiating our existing offerings. We're planning to host our next Investor Day in late April 2017, at which time we intend to share a few of these innovation ideas with you. We'll also have about a full year of Recall under our belts by that time.
In addition, we continue to make progress on the dispositions required by the regulators. You may have seen that just last week, we received approval from the ACCC, or the Australian regulator, for the disposition of our legacy business in Australia to Housatonic Partners, a private equity firm. The AUD 70 million transaction closed yesterday. In addition, we continue to make progress on the sale of the required assets in the U.S., Canada and the United Kingdom. We're pleased with our progress on these dispositions, and we'll bring you updates as those transactions are approved by the regulators and closed. We now expect that total dispositions will generate approximately $185 million in gross proceeds compared with our initial estimate of $220 million. Whilst this total is a bit lighter than we originally expected, we are pleased with where we've landed and believe the transactions are consistent with our commercial goals in those markets.
Let me now turn to some highlights before Stuart walks you through the details that can also be found in the bridging graphs in our supplemental report. Total revenue growth in constant dollars was up more than 27% with similar growth rates in constant dollar storage, rental and service revenue. Adjusted OIBDA, as I mentioned at the beginning, is back to nearly our high levels before the acquisition with adjusted OIBDA margins up 150 basis points from Q2. On an internal basis, storage rental growth was 2.6%, and we continue to expect average storage rental internal growth to be around 2.5% for the full year. Internal volume growth, which excludes the initial Recall volume we added when we closed the transaction, was positive in all storage segments and at 1.8% for the quarter. In short, we maintained our focus even in the midst of the Recall integration-related activity.
Year-to-date, service revenue was basically flat over last year, reflecting the variability and timing of the projects. Based on our service project pipeline, we expect internal service revenue growth to be roughly flat for the full year. As we've talked about on previous calls, given our expected change in service mix, we continue to focus on improving service gross profit and protecting returns on invested capital rather than on service gross margins. We continue to focus on driving productivity improvement in our service business, but it's important to keep in mind that 83% of our gross profit is from storage. Whilst we continue to devote a fair amount of attention to how we can grow and enhance our service business, our service lines, first and foremost, provide a strong differentiation to our core storage business.
Turning to progress on our strategic plan, which entails getting the most out of our developed markets, increasing our presence in the fast-growing emerging markets and expanding in faster-growing adjacent businesses, we continue to make progress on each of these pillars and the foundational elements that support them. In developed markets, which includes both North America RIM and our Western European segment, we added 3.6 million cubic feet of internal volume growth. North America RIM storage growth was 1.1%, reflecting positive volume growth. This is all before the impact of Recall and any other acquisitions during the period. In emerging markets, it is important to note that these markets are differentiated through higher levels of internal storage growth of roughly 10%. Our goal is to expand our presence and leverage our scale to drive these markets to 20% of our total revenue by 2020. You may remember, we announced the beginning of this journey about 3 years ago, where we started at 10% of our sales coming from this fast-growing segment. By the beginning of this year, we had approached 16% of our sales coming from emerging markets and now, with Recall's footprint, we are at 17.1% of total revenue on a 2014 constant dollar basis. Whilst we did not close any international acquisitions during the quarter, we continue to expect total M&A investment in the range of $140 million to $180 million this year, having closed on roughly $56 million year-to-date, excluding Recall. More specifically, we expect 4 significant transactions in the emerging markets to close in Q4, which will utilize about $75 million of the remaining M&A budget. In addition to this final-stage pipeline in the emerging markets, there are a number of smaller tuck-ins, mainly in developed markets, which are expected to close. An example of this focus and continued execution can be readily seen in our Southeast Asian markets plus China. At the start of the year, this region represented just $14 million of annual sales. With the acquisition of Recall and upon closing the Santa Fe transaction we discussed last quarter, we'll have grown our business in this region to annualized revenue of more than $100 million, with leading positions in virtually all countries where we operate within the region.
In our adjacent business segment, we are on track to achieve our stated goal to generate 5% of our total worldwide revenue from adjacent businesses by the end of 2020, up from just 2% at the end of 2015.
In our data center business, we announced a major lease in the quarter in our purpose-built Boston Data Center with SimpliVity, a leader in infrastructure enterprise IT. SimpliVity needed data center resources to support its engineering lab, and our colocation solution was the right fit from a cost, capacity, efficiency and security perspective. They noted that our 65-year track record of protecting proprietary assets gave them the confidence to trust a third-party with such an expansion. In addition, a couple of weeks ago, we broke ground on construction of the first building of our 83-acre data center campus in Manassas, Virginia using a development partner for this first 150,000 square foot data center. This building will deliver superior physical security, lower power cost and a reduced tax structure compared to other national locations. In total, our Northern Virginia Data Center Campus will support 42 megawatts of critical load, spread across a planned 4 individual colocation facilities. This represents a 4x expansion of our current capacity. The first building, expected to open in summer 2017, will offer 10.5 megawatts of critical power and a flexible design that can meet the more exacting requirements of cloud service providers, Federal Government, system integrators, financial service firms and health care companies. It will also comply with Federal technology and environmental regulations, enabling Federal agencies and integrators to comply by stated deadlines for efficient, sustainable data centers. We're pleased with the momentum we're seeing in the business and are continuing to manage capacity utilization to stay ahead of demand, whilst benefiting from preleasing activity in existing markets. Combining our Boston facility with the undergrounds of Boyers, Pennsylvania and Kansas City, our data center space is greater than 90% committed, and we are on track to achieve internal growth of 20% to 25% in this business area. Whilst we don't break out our data center business separately in our financials, we continue to achieve top line organic growth in this business, and we expect to end 2016 with an exit run rate of $25 million in sales, which compares favorably with our 2015 exit rate of $20 million.
In terms of supporting foundations for the strategic plan, we continue to make progress on our transformation initiative to remove $125 million in SG&A. We expect to action an additional $18 million of savings by the end of this year, bringing us to $100 million in run rate savings to be recognized in 2017. Whilst we didn't incur much in the way of additional cost in Q3, we laid the groundwork for improvements to be implemented next year, focused on achieving the final $25 million of this $125 million program.
Given the timing of Recall synergies, our Transformation Program and positive business trends, we remain confident that we will generate cash flow in line with the growth expectations we highlighted during Investor Day and updated in recent presentations. This provides the foundation for our dividend growth. Our newly declared quarterly dividend of $0.55 per share equates to an increase of about 13%, reflecting the benefit of synergies and transformation. Our expectations continue to be to grow the underlying business and cash flow, which will support an increase in our dividend per share by an additional 7% in 2018 and 4% annual growth thereafter, in line with our strategic plan whilst also funding core growth racking, M&A and overall investments.
As we progress our plan, we'll generate more cash available to support discretionary investments, so we'll borrow less to fund our growth plan and continue to deliver. Our operations are underpinned by our very durable growing business that performs consistently throughout business cycles. We have a durable storage business that generates roughly $1.9 billion of annual storage net operating income, which exceeds that generated by leaders in both the industrial and self-storage real estate sectors. Our lack of volatility through economic cycles and business durability clearly distinguishes our business. It is this durability that delivers consistent operating performance with high rates of utilization and stable pricing in both good and bad economies.
Another thing that distinguishes our business is our relative insensitivity to higher interest rates compared with most REITs. First, our customer storage needs are largely unaffected by interest rate movements. Second, our core storage NOI doesn't change with the value of the underlying real estate. Third, we incur virtually no TIs, or tenant improvements, if a customer leaves and we bring in a new one. Importantly, we have an operating business, and we effectively control real estate through long-term leases with multiple lease extension options and direct ownership at strategic locations of about 1/3 of our properties. In an increasing rate environment, this structure reduces our exposure to real estate value fluctuations compared with REITs that own their entire portfolios. Additionally, it should be noted that we generally enjoy higher levels of real price increases during periods with more inflation.
In summary, it was a solid quarter with good execution on all 3 pillars of our strategic plan even in the midst of the Recall integration. We achieved solid internal and constant dollar growth, continued volume increases and meaningful expanded OIBDA margins, all of which support increased cash flow and the 13% increase in our dividend per share.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Stuart."

Let me start by saying how excited I am to be a part of Iron Mountain and working with mountaineers around the globe. The durability of Iron Mountain's records management and related businesses and its substantial opportunity to continue to optimize performance, following the Recall acquisition and through our strategic plan, is just part of what drew me to Iron Mountain. I'm really pleased that our strong results this quarter demonstrate our ability to execute. There are many opportunities ahead, and I believe it's a very exciting time to be a part of the team. Before diving into the details of our financials, let me take a moment and walk you through the key highlights of the quarter.
First, we achieved strong internal storage rental revenue growth of 2.6%, excluding Recall and other small acquisitions. This compares with 2.1% last quarter, reflecting solid underlying business fundamentals and continued volume growth across all major markets. Making up over 80% of our gross profits growth in the storage rental business remains our key execution focus.
Second, we enhanced our profitability. Adjusted OIBDA margins improved by 150 basis points from the second quarter as benefits from the Transformation Program and synergies from the Recall transaction flow into our results. Third, we're making great progress in the integration of Recall, and over 85% of the $115 million of 2017 gross synergies will be in process by the end of this year. Fourth, since June 30, we completed approximately $380 million of debt refinancing at attractive rates, including a recent $50 million mortgage, resulting in about 74% of our debt now being fixed after paying down the revolver in early October, and that compares to 68% in the second quarter. Our average maturity was 5.1 years, and our weighted average interest rate was 5.1%. Our Canadian debt offering, tied to the lowest coupon ever in the high-yield Canadian market, demonstrating our debt investors' appreciation of our solid cash flow and recognition that our leverage is in line with many investment-grade REITs. We remain steadily on track to deliver on short-term financial objectives and long-term goals. And as Bill mentioned, it is based upon this continued demonstration of growth, the durability of our cash flows and capital efficiency that our Board of Directors increased our dividend by 13% to $0.55 per share.
Now that I've covered the highlights, I will go over our worldwide financial results followed by a review of our performance by segment and conclude with a discussion on our outlook for 2016 and a preliminary view on 2017. Consistent with prior quarters, we provided bridging schedules for total revenue, adjusted OIBDA, adjusted earnings per share and FFO per share to explain key variances in our year-on-year performance. These schedules can be found on Pages 23 through 26 of the supplemental. Let me walk you through the highlights. For the third quarter, our total reported revenues increased 26.3% or 27.4% on a constant dollar basis. Excluding the Recall and other smaller acquisitions, total internal revenue increased 1.4% in the third quarter compared with a 0.4% increase in Q2, again with improvement in all regions and segments. We expect total internal revenue growth in 2016 to be between 1.5% and 2%, reflecting continued solid performance in our higher-margin storage activities and growth in adjacent businesses, offset by modest declines in service revenues.
Let's look at storage and service revenue performance in the quarter. Storage rental revenue is the core economic driver of our business, representing 61% of revenue and 83% of our total gross profit. As I mentioned earlier, our third quarter storage internal growth accelerated to 2.6% from 2.2% growth in the first half of the year, and we continue to expect full year storage internal growth of approximately 2.5%.
Service revenues, which make up 39% of total revenues and 17% of our gross profit, declined 0.5% from a year ago, compared to a year-over-year decline of 2.1% in Q2. As we've highlighted in previous calls, the mix shift in our service business growth rates can be a bit volatile on a quarter-on-quarter basis. However, we expect internal service revenue growth to be about flat for the full year. Total third quarter gross profit margin declined slightly from Q2 due mainly to the additional month of Recall results. As we have previously highlighted, Recall, preacquisition, operated at a lower margin than Iron Mountain, due in part to having higher rent expense as a percentage of revenue as Recall leased almost all of their facilities. However, we were able to capture overhead efficiencies and other synergies to more than offset this margin decline, resulting in expansion of adjusted OIBDA margin.
In the quarter, we grew total adjusted OIBDA by 29.1% on a reported dollar basis and by approximately 30% on a constant dollar basis. Importantly, adjusted OIBDA margins expanded year-on-year and sequentially to 31.2% as we continued to see benefits from transformation actions and from Recall synergies. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.27. Adjusted EPS was impacted by the amortization of Recall's customer relationship values and the depreciation expense of legacy Recall racking structures. As a reminder, the amortization expense of customer relationships flows through to funds from operations. However, the increased depreciation does not because real estate depreciation is excluded from FFO. Normalized FFO per share was $0.44 for the quarter. The decline in FFO per share was driven by 2 factors. First, the increased noncash amortization of Recall's customer relationship intangibles, as discussed back in April, that is not added back to calculate FFO. Second is the tax impact of Recall-related expenses. As most of the costs of this integration phase were incurred in our qualified REIT subsidiary, they did not provide a tax shield. This last item also impacted our effective tax rate, which appears high as the Recall costs and the $14 million impairment reduced pretax income. However, they did not reduce taxes recorded in our taxable subsidiaries. This is a short-term effect of the integration effort.
Third quarter AFFO was $169 million compared with $134 million in the year-ago period, fueling our dividend increase. Remember, AFFO adds back noncash items such as amortization and noncash or discrete tax items, so AFFO was not as impacted by the same items that impacted FFO.
Let's turn quickly to our financial performance by segment. Pages 15 and 16 of the supplemental outline our performance by segment in detail for the quarter and on a year-to-date basis. Let me touch on a few highlights from these pages. In North America, Records and Information Management, or RIM, internal storage rental revenue increased by 1.1%, reflecting strong internal volume growth. In North America Data Management, or DM, we saw strong internal storage rental growth of 2.2%, reflecting an improvement from the second quarter. However, service internal growth declined due to the timing of projects and the ongoing reduction in tape rotation as we have discussed previously.
The Western European segment had 0.3% of internal storage rental growth, having been impacted by the carryforward of certain contract negotiations that we mentioned on our last earnings call. In the Other International segment, we continue to see strong storage and service internal revenue growth of 11.6% and 6.9%, respectively.
Let me now talk about the Recall integration progress and the costs that we have incurred so far to achieve synergies and integrate Recall with our business. Bill explained we remain on track to achieve the synergies in total, albeit we are getting there a bit faster. Our expectations of total cost to achieve synergies are still consistent with prior projections: $380 million and deal cost of $80 million. In the fourth quarter, we expect to incur roughly $50 million in operating expenses and $17 million in capital expenditures as we accelerate the cost-savings programs. Year-to-date, Q3, we have incurred $103 million of integration and deal close costs and $7 million in capital expenditure. Additional details can be found in our 10-Q, which will be filed later this week. Please note that these onetime items are excluded from our adjusted OIBDA calculation.
Let's turn to our outlook for 2016 and preliminary outlook for 2017, summarized on Pages 10 and 11 of the supplemental. Our outlook for business trends and fundamentals remains unchanged, with consistent storage rental growth and accelerating growth in our International and adjacent businesses. In addition, our expectations for Recall's contribution and our stand-alone business contribution remain unchanged as seen on the table at the bottom of our guidance page. Our guidance is now on a reported dollar basis, given foreign exchange differences during the year have been small, and this now serves as the baseline for our 2017 outlook. Further, we have updated our 2016 FFO guidance to adjust for the increases in income tax expense, amortization and interest. Our AFFO guidance remains unchanged at $610 million to $650 million, reflecting savings we have identified in maintenance capital since the Recall acquisition as well as non-real estate capital expenditures, which were partially offset by increases in interest expense and cash taxes. However, we anticipate AFFO for the full year to come in above the midpoint of our guidance.
Our interest expense for the year is higher than we originally assumed due to the timing and amount of divestiture proceeds as well as additional Recall integration-related spend. AFFO continues to provide ample funding for dividends and core growth racking investments. Given the higher interest in taxes than our original guidance, we expect adjusted EPS to be near the low end of our guidance range for the year. Upon further review of Recall's real estate assets and overall systems requirements, we reduced our capital expenditure outlook, real estate and non-real estate maintenance as well as real non-real estate investment by $25 million for 2016. The capital efficiency that is created by bringing the 2 businesses together is better than we had originally anticipated. Therefore, this is an elimination, not a deferral of spend. In addition, we've reduced our real estate investments by $95 million, driven mostly by delayed spending on lease conversions and certain real estate development as we make sure we take the time to optimize each market's needs and negotiate with landlords to consolidate facilities in light of the Recall transaction. Note that the reduction in real estate spend this year is not impacting our synergy or margin outlook or 2020 Vision, as we know that these types of investments take a period of time to stabilize.
Distributions for the year will total around $500 million, resulting in our dividend payout ratio as a percentage of AFFO consistent with our prior guidance under 80% and becoming more aligned with REIT peers over time.
Let's touch on our preliminary guidance for 2017, which is based on September 30 exchange rates. At a high level, this guidance is consistent with long-term expectations, with slightly lower growth from acquisitions given our focus on Recall this year. At the midpoint of our guidance, we expect adjusted OIBDA to grow by 17% and AFFO to grow by 12% in 2017 compared with 2016. We'll provide more detail on capital allocation and other guidance for 2017 in February after we file -- finalize prioritizing investments. We expect maintenance capital expenditures and non-real estate investments to be approximately $170 million next year, together representing roughly 4.5% of revenue, consistent with 2016.
Shifting briefly to the balance sheet, we currently have liquidity of approximately $1.1 billion and a lease-adjusted debt ratio of 5.7x, as expected. In the short term, given the timing of proceeds from divestments, we expect to end the year at a leverage ratio around 5.8x and to trend down from there in line with our 2020 Vision. Lastly, we continued to focus on strengthening our debt structure through increasing exposure to long-term notes and shifting a greater percentage of our debt to foreign jurisdictions, which creates a natural currency hedge to mitigate translation exposure while also being tax efficient. In September, we raised CAD 250 million in senior notes at 5.375% due in 2023 and closed on a AUD 250 million syndicated Term Loan B facility, which matures in September 2022 and currently bears interest at 6.05%. Overall, we are pleased with our performance this quarter and with the progress we have made integrating Recall and executing on our Transformation Program.
Looking ahead, we are confident that we are well positioned to deliver on our short-term and long-term financial projections. Our expectations are underscored by the durability of our business, and we are extending that durability through solid execution of our strategic plan and optimizing our costs. 
Before closing, I want to mention that I continue to be impressed with the caliber of the team here at Iron Mountain and appreciate the passion that our teams in the field have to care for our customers. Their focus on moving the business forward during a major acquisition and integration was evident in the performance this quarter. I continue to expand my knowledge of the Iron Mountain business and look forward to meeting with many of you in person over the coming months. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill for closing remarks."

I think where we still remain optimistic that there'll be upside is when we get into the real estate consolidation. But obviously, that's the longer term. I think the biggest fuel to being able to get it faster, to be honest with you, was cultural, that when -- you always, when you have a competitor across you, you always tend to think they're more different than yourselves. But actually, when we brought the 2 organization, there was a lot of common understanding and common way of doing things. And the result of that was we were able to bring the teams together much faster because especially these early synergies are mainly headcount related. So as I say, we weren't -- we're not going deeper than expected in terms of the headcount reductions, but the speed at which we were able to align processes and then release people was much faster than we planned. So I would say it's probably the key driver has been cultural. But as I say, in terms of further upside, is we still remain focused that we think there's going to be further upside when we start consolidating the facilities.

I think if I -- I've always said on the calls for the last, I would say, few quarters that it's really the transportation. I'd say that's generally down between high single digits, low double digits in terms of revenues. So it's continuing -- we've continued to see the trend. As I said before, I think, on a couple of calls ago, we see a kind of a flattening out of that archival drop in transportation when we look at the paper storage business or the record storage side of the business. But in the Data Management, it's still a little bit lagging, that transition into becoming more about backup and recovery rather than rotating the tape. So -- and I -- and we still aren't declaring a bottom. So if you say going forward, I'd still expect that we're going to see transportation declines in the tape business still in the high single-digit, low double-digit level. So it's really -- it's not the projects that are driving that. It's the transportation decline. So the -- I mean, the good news, if you look at the storage, as we said, that the storage both on a revenue and a volume basis, if you look at revenue quarter-on-quarter, we're up a little over 2%. If you look on a trailing 12 months in terms of volume, we're up 2%. And to keep in mind, is if we look at the margins of the business and the profitability of the business, whilst I think services is important, it's first and most important in terms of differentiating our storage product because that's where we build the reliability in, is through the robustness of our transportation. But the part that's driving the cash in the business, we continue to be pleased with. But if you're asking me just specific on transportation, I have to say that I expect it to continue to decline in the high single, low double digits for a few more quarters because we still seem to be behind the transition that we've pretty much have worked most of the way through on the records management side."

And the reason for that is, is that the integration costs out of Recall are really hitting in the REIT subsidiaries. So you're not getting any tax benefit from those, and that is different than we had originally assumed. You've got about 1/3 of it that's coming from the amortization of customer intangibles, right? That's really what came out of purchase accounting. And as we finalized purchase accounting, again, I'll point out that that's noncash so that you could add that -- added back in AFFO. So that's about 1/3 of it. And the last piece of it is really interest expense, and that's the rest of it.

And as you know, as being a long observer of this business, nothing happens fast. But you have to put certain foundations and building blocks. So my -- I wouldn't say it's any one thing. I think a lot of it goes back to what we did, and I wouldn't say last quarter's performance was because of noise of Recall. It's just that on a quarter-by-quarter basis, it does move around. But we're starting to see that whilst this isn't a high-growth business, there is still growth to be achieved, which I know is counterintuitive. But I think this business will be running longer than the iPhone franchise, right? I mean, it -- I know a lot of people in their stomach don't believe that.

What I do feel -- and I talked about it a little bit about on my call, in my script or when I was going through my remarks saying that innovation is an important part. And one of the things bringing the 2 organizations together, it gives us not only a larger customer base, but it gives us more capacity to innovate. And that innovation resonates with our customers. What we're finding, especially for the regulated customers that have to worry about compliance in so many different jurisdictions, the fact that we can give them better solutions around information governance is a differentiating factor. And you can say, do they pay for the product or do they pay more for the storage? And sometimes, it's built up in the storage cost or pricing. And sometimes, it's built up in the product. But what we do find is that the world is getting more complex especially for the heavily regulated industries, and bringing the 2 companies together does give us more economies of scale to do that kind of R&D. And that is resonating with customers. So I wouldn't -- I think that's the way I think about the power of bringing of the 2 companies together. It just gives us a deeper pool, if you will, to innovate around. And that -- and so far, it's early days, but I've spent a fair amount of time in -- with different customers. We had a top financial service customer forum in Louisiana in June. I just came back from one in Europe a couple of weeks ago. And there's even more excitement that I'm hearing from our large customers about bringing the 2 companies together, rather than less, because they're expecting even more in the way of innovation. The other thing I would highlight is, it's early days, but I also expect -- we've reorganized the North American sales force again a little bit in light of bringing Recall in. They were, as I said, much better at running after the middle market, which is a higher-margin segment. And a lot of it is unvended, and we haven't been as present there as Iron Mountain, whereas Recall was more present. And so now the Head of North American Sales is the person from Recall who's driving the charge, not just in terms of our traditional segment in the enterprise, but he also has 2 new leaders that are helping drive more penetration into the middle market, which we expect over time to start coming through. It's early days. You don't see that in the numbers today, but I would expect to see an improvement in those areas."

And as we finish the restructuring, I'd say there'll a little bit more of that next year. And that's built into our guidance because we now have clear view of what the restructuring is left that's in the qualified REIT subsidiary versus not. So we know where the tax deductibility is. But I think you can probably appreciate when you're buying a public company, trying to have that level of detail until you actually get into the restructuring, that's where you get into the tax detectability. But if you think about it in terms of the ability, whilst cash taxes does affect AFFO as well, but when we're starting to actually get through those onetime restructuring charges, then we're still in line with what we think the total cost of the integration project is.

The other thing I'd point out though too, as we've gone through in cleaning up and  reconciling things, I want to turn to AFFO for a second, is if you go back and look at second quarter AFFO, we actually had understated that by around $10 million. That's because we had a -- for a Mexico REIT subsidiary, we had some onetime tax integration cost or tax that we had to pay to restructure that entity. Those costs had actually been accrued as part of purchase accounting, never went through the P&L. Because it was a cash tax payment, it had actually gotten picked up as a reduction of AFFO last quarter, but it was onetime in nature. Those are the types of things we exclude. So if you go back and look at second quarter, AFFO was actually better in our trends.
