As I'm sure you've seen by now, Honeywell delivered another excellent quarter capping off a terrific year in a difficult environment. We delivered results at or above our guidance on segment margin, earnings and cash flow. Earnings",1073,"Good morning, everyone. As I'm sure you've seen by now, Honeywell delivered another excellent quarter capping off a terrific year in a difficult environment. We delivered results at or above our guidance on segment margin, earnings and cash flow. Earnings of $1.58 in the fourth quarter increased 10%, representing another quarter of double-digit earnings growth.
We continue to drive margin expansion up 140 basis points, excluding the impact of the fourth quarter '14 Aerospace OEM incentives. And our free cash flow finished at $1.6 billion in the quarter, up 17% at 127% conversion.
For the full year, we increased sales 1% on a core organic basis while continuing our seed planting with investments in new products and technologies, high ROI CapEx and expansion of our global footprint. We're benefiting from our balanced global portfolio, diversity of opportunity and our ability to effectively manage in what continues to be a slow growth macro environment. We also proactively funded $160 million of new restructuring in 2015, and that includes $60 million in the fourth quarter, building on a healthy pipeline of new projects, which will support strong margin expansion this year and beyond.
Earnings for the full year of $6.10 increased 10%, representing the sixth consecutive year of double-digit growth. Or 15% dividend rate increase marked the 11th time in the last 10 years that we've increased our dividend. And we committed over $8 billion in capital during the year to M&A and share repurchases, which sets us up nicely to deliver for our shareowners in 2016 and beyond.
W are reaffirming our 2016 earnings guidance of $6.45 to $6.70, up 6% to 10% year-over-year. We're facing challenging end markets, but we have a credible and attainable plan to achieve this guidance and our planning framework has not changed. We'll support growth wherever we have it to drive our performance. However, we'll also be cautious in our sales planning, and we'll continue to plan our costs and spending conservatively, ensuring we remain flexible as a company. We'll also maintain our seed planting investments for the future, supported by a robust pipeline of funded restructuring projects and continued investment in R&D.
There continues to be a lot of exciting things happening across the portfolio driving our terrific results, and I can't help but highlight a few. At the 2016 International Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Honeywell's latest connected offerings were on display, including the second-generation Leerik round WiFi thermostat. The new Leerik WiFi waterleak and freeze detector was honored by USA Today with the CES 2016 Editor's Choice award. This great product provides users with early alerts of water leaks and frozen pipes to avoid costly repairs. The detector easily connects to your home WiFi network and provides a simple do-it-yourself installation.
In 2015, our connectable product portfolio sales grew nearly 30%. A good example of the benefits from our continued investment in development of new technologies to support growth.
Our win rate in turbos on new platforms was once again over 40%. Honeywell turbochargers are the no-compromise solution for vehicle performance, better fuel economy and compliance with emission regulations. Sales from both diesel and gas turbos continue to grow in 2015. And we estimate that by 2020, roughly half of all cars on the road will have turbocharged engines, up from 1/3 of all passenger vehicles today. We expect to continue growing faster than the industry due to our differentiated technology, global footprint and the benefits of the Honeywell Operating System.
In November, Honeywell was selected to supply its HDS series jet engines auxiliary power unit advanced cockpit technologies, environmental control system and cabin pressure control system to set its new citation longitude business jet. Further evidence of we continue to perform well in super midsized cabin platforms. Including the Cessna, our HDF 7000 engine is now on 4 of the 5 super midsized platforms. The other is being Gulfstream, the G2 80; the Embraer Legacy 450, 500; and Bombardier Challenger 300 350. Our platform engine has surpassed 2.4 million flight hours to date.
On the M&A front, we're pleased to have closed the Elster acquisition at the end of December, and the integration is underway. Elster brings outstanding technologies, including software, strong well-recognized brands, energy efficiency know-how and a global presence to Honeywell and ACS. We look forward to updating you on our integration process in our Investor day in March.
Earlier this month, we acquired the remaining 30% stake in UOP Russell, a global leader in gas processing technology and equipment. One of our objectives when we acquired the first 70% was to leverage the Honeywell global footprint to take this principally domestic-focused marginal technology to markets outside the U.S. This premise is now materializing. As an example, in the fourth quarter, PV Gas Vietnam's primary gas provider selected UOP Russell's modular gas processing plant to separate liquefied petroleum gas or LPG from natural gas in its facility near the southern tip of Vietnam. In addition, HPS will service as the integrated main automation contractor, or IMAC, as applied integrated control and safety systems for the facility and erminal. And we repurchased close to $2 billion in Honeywell shares during the year at attractive prices, which is nearly double the rate in 2014. We have and will continue to be opportunistic when it comes to share repurchases, which allows us to preserve our balance sheet firepower for repurchases or M&A as opportunities present themselves. And you can expect another terrific year for capital deployment in 2016.
You can expect to see lots of exciting innovations at our Investor Day on March 2, where each of the businesses will highlight a number of new products and roadmaps for future growth and margin expansion. 
We also plan to share how software is evolving throughout organization, which we believe is a key differentiator, particularly across the industrial space. We held our annual senior leadership meeting earlier this month, and I could tell you that each of the businesses are hard at work, identifying new and innovative breakthroughs to drive further growth. Our seed planting for the future, Great Positions in Good Industries, diversity of opportunity and strength of execution will allow us to deliver on our long-term targets and continue to outperform a little long term. Needless to say, as we continue to talk about amongst ourselves, this is an exciting time to be at Honeywell. 
So with that, I'll turn it over to Tom."
1340740,321465853,923577,"Honeywell International Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 29, 2016",2016-01-29,"Earnings Calls","Honeywell International Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Dave mentioned our deployment of $8 billion in share [ph] or capital for 2015. That actually excludes $2 billion in dividends. And just to remind you, we raised our dividend rate in the fourth quarter to -- by 15%",4392,"Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Dave mentioned our deployment of $8 billion in share [ph] or capital for 2015. That actually excludes $2 billion in dividends. And just to remind you, we raised our dividend rate in the fourth quarter to -- by 15%. The biggest component of the $8 billion is M&A. Slide 4 summarizes each of the deals, all of which have closed with the exception of, which is expected to close imminently.
We've previously articulated the rational for each deal, and we're pleased with the diversity of the investments. So 3 of the deals are for aero, 2 for ACS and 3 for PMT. Spreading the wealth, so to speak. We also noticed the technology focus. For example, the Elster metering and analytics, the com dev space and communication technologies and the SatCom1 Aerospace connectivity software. We also view each of these acquisitions as a great opportunity to deploy HOS Gold to drive new growth and greater profitability while building on our Great Positions in Good Industries across the portfolio. We expect the acquisitions will generate strong future returns for our shareowners, consistent with Honeywell's track record. And we're excited about the M&A momentum as we head into 2016, as Dave mentioned.
Slide 5 shows the fourth quarter results. Overall, our results met or exceeded the guidance we provided in December. Sales of $10 billion were flat on a core organic basis, slightly better than what we estimated during outlook call. largely because of our conservative planning. Suite improvements in commercial Aero OEM, both ATR and BGA; UOP Cala shipments; Process Solutions services; and the America's Fire and Security Distribution drove the stronger finish. The growth in these areas helped to mitigate the challenges we have in the oil and gas-related businesses.
On a reported basis, the sales decline in the fourth quarter was driven by the stronger U.S. dollar and the lower pass-through pricing in resins and chemicals, offset by the absence of the Aerospace OEM incentive in the fourth quarter of 2014, which as you'll recall, impacted both sales and segment profit in the fourth quarter '14. 
Segment profit, up 15%, with segment margins expanding 290 basis points to 18.8% or 140 basis points when you exclude those OEM incentives. We drove profit growth and margin expansion in each of our 3 SBGs. So again, a balanced contribution across the portfolio. I'll talk more about segment margin in a minute.
Items below segment profit were as expected. We did see higher pension income as a result of our fourth quarter adoption of the spot rate approach to setting our discount rates. The impact, however, was more than offset by -- or, yes, more than offset by about $60 million of new restructuring projects, which position us well for continued margin expansion. 
Earnings per share, excluding pension mark-to-market adjustment, were $1.58 and increased 10% from 2014, again in line with our guidance. The 2015 pension mark-to-market adjustment was a approximately $67 million unfavorable or $0.05 a share, principally driven by our U.S. nonqualified plans versus $249 million, also unfavorable in 2014 or $0.23 a share. So as a result, the fourth quarter reported earnings per share of $1.53 were up 28% from $1.20 last year.
Free cash flow in the quarter, $1.6 billion, was up 17% versus 2014, with conversion at 127%. We had a bigger improvement in working capital and lower cash taxes than what we anticipated in our outlook costs. So overall, another strong quarter of margin expansion, double-digit earnings growth and strong cash flow.
Let me move to Slide 6 to provide more detail on segment margin expansion with the slide that you're familiar with. As we've spoken about throughout 2015, our operating initiatives continue to drive segment margin growth, led by the continued deployment of HOS Gold. We generated 100 basis -- 100 point basis operational improvement in the quarter, and that follows a 140 basis points in the first quarter, 110 basis points in the second quarter and 140 basis points in the third quarter. We've got attractive products with differentiated technologies and a software focus. Our factories and supply chains are maturing, our back office continues to get more efficient and we continue to manage our indirect spend. Previously funded restructuring as well as new restructuring actions have also enabled us to continue improving our overall cost position, yet we believe there's more room to improved.
The remaining 190 basis points of improvement from our foreign currency hedging approach, lower raw materials pass-through pricing in resins and chemicals and the absence of the fourth quarter OEM incentives. 
For 2015, we outpaced our Five-Year Plan targets of 45 to 75 basis points segment margin expansion, and we expect that the permanent improvements to our supply-chain, footprint and back-office through the deployment of HOS Gold will continue to drive margin expansion in 2016, '17 and beyond.
Let's move to Slide 7 and discuss the Aerospace results. Sales for the quarter were up 2% on a core organic basis, in line with our expectations. Commercial OE sales increased by 9% on a core organic basis, driven by the third consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in Business and General Aviation engine shipments and higher shipments to large OEMs in air transport. As Dave mentioned earlier, we continue to win on super midsized business jet platforms. We also experienced good growth on key air transport platforms, including the Boeing 737 and 787 and Airbus A320 and A350, as we had anticipated. On a reported basis, Commercial OE sales increased 45%, again reflecting the absence of the OEM incentives that we recorded in the fourth quarter '14.
Commercial aftermarket sales, up 3% on a core organic basis, driven by robust repair and overhaul activities. R&O sales were up high single digit in the quarter and have improved sequentially throughout 2015. On spare side, we saw an increase in airline spares growth for both mechanical and avionic products. BGA RMUs, or retrofit modifications and upgrades, grew double digit in the fourth quarter, as we expected. Spares were soft in other parts of BGA due to timing of channel provisioning.
Defense & Space sales declined 1% core organic basis, driven by a number of program completions and project timing in our U.S. businesses. We saw strong growth in our international business on a sequential basis, but year-over-year growth was only 1% due to a difficult prior year comparison. Just to remind you, the international business grew 17% in the fourth quarter of '14. Defense and space finished 2015 approximately flat, and we expect growth across all Defense & Space segments in 2016.
Finally, Transportation Systems sales increased 1% on a core organic basis due to new platform launches and continued volume growth in both diesel and light -- and gas-light vehicle applications. Our light vehicle diesel business grew in both Europe and North America while we saw double-digit growth in light vehicle gas in Europe and China. This was partially offset by lower commercial vehicle volumes, reflecting the soft conditions faced by our on-highway and off-highway commercial vehicle global OEM customers. On a reported basis, TS sales declined 10%, reflecting the stronger U.S. dollar. 
Aerospace segment margins expanded 420 basis points or 50 basis points, if you again exclude the OEM incentives. This was driven by productivity net of inflation, commercial excellence and the favorable impact from our foreign currency hedges, partially offset by the margin impact of higher OE shipments and continued investments for growth.
Let turn to the ACS results on Slide 8. In ACS, Alex and his team continued to positioned portfolio for better and more profitable growth. With the closing of Elster, the newly acquired thermal solutions, combustion and gas, electricity and water metering businesses will be integrated into our environmental and energy solutions business unit, which includes the legacy ECC business. The broader scope of this new business unit will position us for accelerated growth in both existing markets and attractive new adjacencies. We've seen similar commercial benefits from a combination of our security and fire businesses into Honeywell security and fire.
In the fourth quarter, ACS sales were flat on a core organic basis. Sales by Energy, Safety and Security, so the products business has declined 1% on a core organic basis. We saw continued strength in security and fire globally, another quarter of double-digit growth in China. The investments we've made in China continue to drive results, and we expect similar growth in 2016. And as Dave mentioned, sales of our connected products grew nearly 30% in 2015, as we -- as the continued growth following the launch of our new product offering. These improvements were offset by lower volume incenting and productivity solutions, as we lapped the benefits of the U.S. Postal Service in our mobility business as well as by declines in industrial safety due principally to oil and gas related discretionary spending cuts.
Building Solutions and Distribution sales were up 3% on a core organic basis in the fourth quarter. We continue to see strength in the Americas Distribution business, where sales growth improved sequentially every quarter in 2015, exiting the year up double-digit in the fourth quarter. This growth was partially offset by a decline in building solutions, we continue to experience softness in the energy retrofit business and slower backlog conversion.
ACS margins expanded 70 basis points to 16.6% in the quarter, capping off another terrific year. The business continues to benefit from significant productivity improvements net of inflation as well as from execution of restructuring actions. At the same time, we've maintained our investments for growth. We've added resources in sales, marketing and engineering locally to drive further acceleration in our high-growth regions as well as in our connected product offerings.
I'm now on Slide 9 to discuss PMT results. PMT sales declined 4% on a core organic basis while segment margin expansion was again robust. And orders growth for the quarter was positive, led by very strong orders in UOP. 
Let's take it business-by-business, starting with UOP. Sales were down 10% on a core organic basis, driven by lower gas processing, equipment and licensing sales, partially offset by strong catalysts demands. Catalyst shipments were up significantly in the fourth quarter, driven by new petrochemical units and refining reloads. Furthermore, we recorded nearly $1 billion in orders in the fourth quarter, with growth across the entire UOP portfolio, including another international gas processing win. This brings UOP's book-to-bill ratio for the year to approximately 0.95, not bad in this environment. And we expect a portion of UOP orders to convert in 2016, which will partially mitigate the market softness.
In Process Solutions, core organic sales were flat. We finished the December better than anticipated, driven by growth in services and projects to an uptick in consumer spend at year-end, offset by high single-digit decline in the field instrumentation sales. The HPS projects and services backlogs remain solid, and we continue to see increased demand for our [indiscernible] 360 service partnership offering, which is a multiyear agreement to maintain support and optimize performance of Honeywell control systems. So while our short-cycle field instrumentation business faces the continued headwinds of the industry, we are seeing improvements in our higher-margin software and service businesses.
Advanced Materials sales, down 3% on a core organic basis due to volume declines in resins and chemicals and specialty products, partially offset by foreign product sales, which again increased to to continue demand for solstice low global warming refrigerant and insulation products. Volumes in resins and chemicals in particular were adversely impacted by unplanned plant outages in the quarter. On a reported basis, Advanced Materials sales declined 15%, primarily due to the impact of the lower pass-through pricing in resins and chemicals as we've highlighted previously.
PMT segment margins, up 380 basis points to 20.3%, driven by significant productivity actions net of inflation, commercial excellence, the favorable impact of from a deals pass-through pricing in resins and chemicals and a heavier weighting of UOP catalyst sales. PMT continues to aggressively pursue further cost-reduction opportunities, which help support further margin expansion in this slow-growth environment.
I'm now on slide into recap the full year 2015 results. Sales increased 1% on a core organic basis with good growth in our short-cycle ESS and Transportation Systems businesses, strong engine shipments in BGA OE and continued growth from a ramp-up of our solstice offerings and Fluorine Products. The reported sales segment reflects the unfavorable impact of foreign currency to friction materials' divestiture and lower pass-through pricing in resin and chemicals, offset by the favorable year-over-year impact of the OEM incentives, which did not repeat in 2015. 
Segment profit increased 8%, with margins expanding 220 basis points. 110 of the expansion was driven by the operational improvements in each of the businesses as we've discussed throughout 2015. All of this resulted in earnings of $6.10, up 10%, clearly in the top quartile of our industrial peer group. And as Dave mentioned, this represents our sixth consecutive year of double-digit earnings growth. 
Reported EPS for the year increased 13%, reflecting decline in the unfavorable pension mark-to-market adjustment that I mentioned earlier. 
Finally, free cash flow of $4.4 billion increased 11%, exceeding the high end of our guidance range, largely driven by improved working capital performance. Our 91% free cash flow conversion was diluted by our investment of over $1 billion in attractive high ROI CapEx in 2015 to support future growth. Adjusting to our long-term reinvestment ratio of 1x depreciation would yield approximately 100% free cash flow conversion, which we expect to reach on a run rate basis by the end of 2017.
Slide 11 provides a recap for the full year by business. The results are very consistent with our guidance in each of our 3 segments generated triple-digit margin expansion and a challenging market environment. At the same time, we've maintained our investments in new products, high-growth regions and restructuring across the portfolio to ensure growth and productivity. With 2015 behind us, let's take a quick look at our end markets as we head into 2016.
On Page 12, there's no change in our assessment of the conditions in the end markets we serve and no change to our 2016 guidance that we provided in December. We continue to expect the slower global growth environment to persists in 2016. However, our portfolio with its mix of short and long-cycle businesses, balanced participation in numerous global markets and diversified offerings for consumers, commercial buildings, industrial complexes and government will help us to grow even in slower environment. Our end markets in total are generally stable. We continue to actively monitor the dynamics in our oil and gas businesses, particularly on the exploration and production sides. The challenging conditions we see associated with lower oil and gas prices was contemplated in our 2016 outlook. For Honeywell, this is somewhat tempered by the healthy demand for the output for refining and petrochemical plant operators, which bodes well in the long term for the mid and balanced stream offerings of HPS and UOP. And that includes catalysts, advanced solutions and other aftermarket offerings. In the event conditions do continue to deteriorate, we have the flexibility to further adjust operating costs fairly quickly as well as other contingencies to help us mitigate market headwinds.
As we look across the other end markets, which make up over 85% of our total portfolio, we expect the demand environment to remain stable. In non-resi construction, we expect a similar environment as 2015. The Commercial aftermarket industry will continue to grow, albeit at a slightly slower pace as flight hours remain positive overall but increased in line efficiency and retirement of older aircraft will tamper aftermarket demand.
International defense spending and increasing U.S. DoD budgets will make the Defense & Space environment attractive. On autos, we have attractive and competitive turbocharger offerings, which continued to manifest themselves in our strong win rates. As Dave noted, TS 1 over 40% of all new launches in 2015 grew the business in both gas and diesel and continued to differentiate through breakthrough innovation and technologies.
Further, Turbo penetration continues to improve, and we're growing faster than the market. Our planning approach for 2016 remains intact. We'll support growth where we see opportunities to outperform, emphasizing those areas where clear passengers exists like high-growth regions, UOP catalysts and Fluorine Products. We'll be cautious in our sales planning in the end markets where we see uncertainty in 2016. And we'll make shorter-term adjustments to cost levels should softer end markets dictate. 
We also continue to plan our costs and spending conservative -- conservatively, with a strong emphasis to drive productivity in all of our cost categories while remain flexible as a company. Of course, we will continue our seed planting investments to create mid- to longer-term opportunity. This includes R&D and marketing investments, but also further deployment of shareholder capital opportunistically.
Let's move to Slide 13 to more specifically discuss each of our businesses for 2016. The green and red abbreviations on this page represent our full year 2016 core organic sales growth expectations for each business.
Let me start with Commercial OE. Excluding the OEM incentives, the business is expected to grow low single digit for 2016. The demand in ATR and BGA continues to be strong, and we'll see the new wins we've communicated drive volume growth, particularly in the second half of the year. However, as previously communicated, the OEM incentives will dilute these ongoing growth rates in our ATR business. As a reminder, we expense these incentives as incurred, unlike many of our competitors who capitalize and amortization them over the life of the program.
On the Commercial aftermarket side, we expect the strong R&O momentum to continue. Additionally, while it's been up against a difficult year on RMU sales comparisons for most of 2015 in BGA, we're expecting the business to return to growth in 2016 as it did in the fourth quarter. All the businesses in Defense and Space of the U.S. DOD, the services in the U.S. and international are expected to grow in 2016 as a market demand dynamics improve. In TS, the growth will also continue, supported by a strong backlog of new wins. And while the commercial vehicles market for our technologies have been slow, particularly in China, we anticipate a moderation in the declines for 2016.
We expect low single-digit growth in ACS across both the products and the BSD portfolio, driven by continued momentum in security and fire products and distribution and above-market growth in China, offset medicaments related to the completion of large projects in SNPS.
In PMT, our previously communicated growth expectations remain. As we've highlighted on numerous occasions, UOP short-cycle catalyst business tends to be very lumpy quarter-to-quarter, and it's growth in the fourth quarter of 2015 was massive, capping off a double-digit growth year for that business. This sets up a challenging first quarter and full year 2016, which along with the tough year-over-year comparisons in gas processing, drive our expectations that UOP will be down mid-single digit in 2016.
So on balance, no change to our end-market outlook, but we continue to monitor the landscape as we move into the first quarter. And speaking of the first quarter, I'm on Slide 14 with a preview. 
Relative to foreign exchange, our Q1 sales estimates contemplates our full year planning exchanges. So for example, $1 per euro. However, for operating profit, as we've communicated, we do -- we are hedged. So for the year as an example, our estimates reflect our $1 per 10 -- or $1.10 per euro hedge rate. For total, Honeywell expecting first quarter sales of $9.2 billion to $9.4 billion. That's flat to up 2% reported or down 2% to flat on a core organic basis. Segment margins are expected to be up 70 to 90 basis points, excluding M&A, or down 20 to 40 basis points reported. EPS is expected to be $1.48 to $1.53, and that's up 5% to 9% versus 2015 with a tax rate of 26.5%.
Starting with Aerospace. Sales are expected to be up 1% to 2% on a core organic basis. In Commercial OE, we're expecting sales to be down mid-single digit, driven by the impact of the OEM incentives, which we previewed in our December outlook call. Excluding the incentives, Commercial OE is expected to be up low single digit, with a ramp-up on key platforms in air transport, partially offset by regional declines and slowing growth in BGA following a terrific 2015.
Commercial aftermarket sales are expected to grow low single digit, with higher volume in airline repair and overhaul activity and improvement in BGA RMU sales. Defense and space sales are expected to be up low single digit, with higher sales to the U.S. government partially offset by tough prior year comparisons in the international business as larger projects blow off. 
In Transportation Systems, sales are expected to be up mid-single digit, with strong growth across both diesel and gas-light vehicle applications. Commercial vehicles, which represent roughly 15% of the TS portfolio, continue to face headwinds from a down market, but we expect the declines to moderate in the second half of '15. 
As for Aerospace margins, we expect an increase of 100 to 120 basis points excluding M&A. ACS sales are expected to be up 2% to 3% on a core organic basis or up 11% to 12% reported, driven by the addition of Elster. Both ESS and BSD are expected to grow low single digits on a core organic basis. We expect the momentum on our security and fire businesses and in our high-growth regions to continue heading into 2016. SNPS growth will be slower with the completion of the U.S. our Postal Service deployment. And we expect continued oil and gas-related headwinds in industrial safety. In BSD, we're expecting a similar trends to what we've seen in recent quarters, with strength in Americas distribution offset by weakness in U.S. energy retrofit businesses within Building Solutions.
As I mentioned back in October, we've been selected on a number of competitive RFPs, but the pace of conversion from wins into orders is now eventually on to revenue is slow. Excluding M&A, margins are expected to improve 130 to 160 basis points in ACS, driven by continued productivity and commercial excellence. Due to acquisition, dilution in the ACS margin rate in the first quarter is expected to be down 50 to 80 basis points.
In PMT, sales are expected to be down 11% to 13% on both reported and core organic basis. We contemplated the slow first quarter and the guidance we provided during our December outlook call. UOP is expected to be down significantly, driven primarily by continued the kind of gas processing and lower catalysts sales, as I mentioned.
Sales in our catalyst business were very strong at 15, but it's not unusual to see variations as we've experienced in prior years. We'll see these trends again in the first quarter in particular, but expect that for the full year 2016, the catalyst demand will again be strong.
HPS sales are expected to be down slightly. In 2014 and 2015 won [ph] a number of significant global megaprojects, where we service the main contractor to providing control and safety solutions for large installations. These will begin to convert in 2016, but the resulting sales growth to be more than offset by continued declines in sales of field instrumentation products.
Advanced Materials sales are expected to be up high single digit driven by Fluorine Products solstice sales as well as higher production volumes in resins and chemicals. 
PMT segment margins are expected to be down 90 to 110 basis points or down 40 to 60 basis points, excluding M&A, with the dilution coming from sales declines in our petrochemical catalyst business. 
Let me move to Slide 15 for the 2016 financial guidance for the full year. So consistent with our December call, we expect total Honeywell sales in the range of $39.9 billion to $40.9 billion, up 1% to 2% on a core organic basis. Modestly better than our Q1 expectations, which, as you've seen, are weighed down by the normal ongoing lumpiness in UOP. Reported sales growth will be higher in the range of 3% to 6%, primarily due to the favorable impact of M&A, most notably, Elster. Segment margin expansion is expected to be 10 to 50 basis points or 80 to 110 basis, excluding M&A.
We're confident in our earnings range of $6.45 to $6.70, representing 6% to 10% growth versus 2015. The full year growth [indiscernible] remains in line with prior years and is based on an expected full year tax rate of 26.5%, with share count held flat to the 2015 full year weighted average. Of course, we'll continue to be opportunistic about share repurchase opportunities, particularly in these volatile markets.
Free cash flow is expected to be up in a range of $4.6 billion to $4.8 million. That's 5% to 10% increase from 2015, with CapEx investments roughly flat at approximately $1.1 billion. This will drive free cash flow conversion of approximately 90%.
Let me move to Slide 16 for a quick summary before turning it back to Mark for Q&A. In 2015, we again demonstrated that Honeywell can deliver on its commitment even on a slow growth environment. We've met or exceeded our margin expansion, earnings growth and free cash flow target while investing for future growth through enhanced research and development, continued investment in CapEx and funding of business restructuring. And we put to work some sizable amount of shareholder capital, which will pave the way for future earnings and cash growth.
As we turn our attention to 2016, we're planning for more of the same. A modest top line growth with strong margin expansion and earnings and cash growth. We have incredible and attainable 2016 plan based on the tenets that Dave mentioned of supporting growth, being conscious on sales, planning costs and spending conservatively and continued seed planting.
In summary, we're excited and prepared for 2016. Our management team is focused on execution as we head into year 3 of our Five-Year Plan, and we look forward to sharing more at our March 2 Investor Conference.
With that, Mark, let's move to Q&A."

It tends to go through cycles, and we'll be coming up on any cycle for as we get towards the end of this year and into next year. When it comes to new projects, yes, you're right. There wasn't as much as many new projects put on the board as there were in prior years. But we largely took a lot of those hits last year. So as we start looking at kind of a comparables as you go from 1 year to another, we should start seeing that coming out, I'd say again toward the end of this year and more into next year. So while it's been a difficult transition, it helps for us that this diversity of opportunity you hear me talked about where oil and gas is only about 13% in total, so it's been manageable, not easy, but manageable. And I think you're going to see UOP getting on to a growth that again as we get into next year. Tom, I don't know if there's anything you want to add."

As I'm sure you've seen by now, Honeywell delivered another excellent quarter, capping off a terrific year in a difficult environment. We delivered results at or above our guidance on segment margin, earnings and cash flow. Earning",1077,"Good morning, everyone. As I'm sure you've seen by now, Honeywell delivered another excellent quarter, capping off a terrific year in a difficult environment. We delivered results at or above our guidance on segment margin, earnings and cash flow. Earnings of $1.58 in the fourth quarter increased 10%, representing another quarter of double-digit earnings growth.
We continue to drive margin expansion up 140 basis points, excluding the impact of the fourth quarter '14 Aerospace OEM incentives. And our free cash flow finished at $1.6 billion in the quarter, up 17% at 127% conversion.
For the full year, we increased sales 1% on a core organic basis while continuing our seed planting with investments in new products and technologies, high ROI CapEx and expansion of our global footprint. We're benefiting from our balanced global portfolio, diversity of opportunity and our ability to effectively manage in what continues to be a slow growth macro environment. We also proactively funded $160 million of new restructuring in 2015, and that includes $60 million in the fourth quarter, building on a healthy pipeline of new projects, which will support strong margin expansion this year and beyond.
Earnings for the full year of $6.10 increased 10%, representing the sixth consecutive year of double-digit growth. Our 15% dividend rate increase marked the 11th time in the last 10 years that we've increased our dividend. And we committed over $8 billion in capital during the year to M&A and share repurchases, which sets us up nicely to deliver for our share owners in 2016 and beyond.
W are reaffirming our 2016 earnings guidance of $6.45 to $6.70, up 6% to 10% year-over-year. We're facing challenging end markets, but we have a credible and attainable plan to achieve this guidance, and our planning framework has not changed. We'll support growth wherever we have it to drive our performance. However, we'll also be cautious in our sales planning, and we'll continue to plan our costs and spending conservatively, ensuring we remain flexible as a company. We'll also maintain our seed planting investments for the future, supported by a robust pipeline of funded restructuring projects and continued investment in R&D.
There continues to be a lot of exciting things happening across the portfolio driving our terrific results, and I can't help but highlight a few. At the 2016 International Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Honeywell's latest connected offerings were on display, including the second-generation Lyric Round Wi-Fi Thermostat. The new Lyric Wi-Fi Water Leak and Freeze Detector was honored by USA TODAY with the CES 2016 Editor's Choice award. This great new product provides users with early alerts of water leaks and frozen pipes to avoid costly repairs. The detector easily connects to your home Wi-Fi network and provides a simple do-it-yourself installation.
In 2015, our connectable product portfolio sales grew nearly 30%, a good example of the benefits from our continued investment in development of new technologies to support growth.
Our win rate in turbos on new platforms was once again over 40%. Honeywell turbochargers are the no-compromise solution for vehicle performance, better fuel economy and compliance with emission regulations. Sales from both diesel and gas turbos continued to grow in 2015. And we estimate that by 2020, roughly half of all cars on the road will have turbocharged engines, up from 1/3 of all passenger vehicles today. We expect to continue growing faster than the industry due to our differentiated technology, global footprint and the benefits of the Honeywell Operating System.
In November, Honeywell was selected to supply its HTF series jet engines, auxiliary power unit, advanced cockpit technologies, environmental control system and cabin pressure control system to set this new citation longitude business jet. Further evidence that we continue to perform well in super mid-sized cabin platforms. Including the Cessna, our HTF7000 engine is now on 4 of the 5 super mid-sized platforms. The other is being Gulfstream, the G280; the Embraer Legacy 450, 500; and Bombardier Challenger 300, 350. Our platform engine has surpassed 2.4 million flight hours to date.
On the M&A front, we're pleased to have closed the Elster acquisition at the end of December, and the integration is underway. Elster brings outstanding technologies, including software, strong well-recognized brands, energy efficiency know-how and a global presence to Honeywell and ACS. We look forward to updating you on the integration progress at our Investor Day in March.
Earlier this month, we acquired the remaining 30% stake in UOP Russell, a global leader in modular gas processing technology and equipment. One of our objectives when we acquired the first 70% was to leverage the Honeywell global footprint to take this principally domestic-focused modular technology to markets outside the U.S. This premise is now materializing. As an example, in the fourth quarter, PV Gas, Vietnam's primary gas provider, selected UOP Russell's modular gas processing plant to separate liquefied petroleum gas or LPG from natural gas in its facility near the southern tip of Vietnam. In addition, HPS will service as the integrated main automation contractor, or IMAC, and supply the integrated control and safety systems for the facility and terminal. And we repurchased close to $2 billion in Honeywell shares during the year at attractive prices, which is nearly double the rate in 2014. We have and will continue to be opportunistic when it comes to share repurchases, which allows us to preserve our balance sheet firepower for repurchases or M&A as opportunities present themselves. And you can expect another terrific year for capital deployment in 2016.
You can expect to see lots of exciting innovations at our Investor Day on March 2, where each of the businesses will highlight a number of new products and roadmaps for future growth and margin expansion. 
We also plan to share how software is evolving throughout the organization, which we believe is a key differentiator, particularly across the industrial space. 
We held our annual senior leadership meeting earlier this month, and I could tell you that each of the businesses are hard at work, identifying new and innovative breakthroughs to drive further growth. Our seed planting for the future, Great Positions in Good Industries, diversity of opportunity and strength of execution will allow us to deliver on our long-term targets and continue to outperform a little long term. Needless to say, as we continue to talk about amongst ourselves, this is an exciting time to be at Honeywell. So with that, I'll turn it over to Tom."
1340740,321465853,923780,"Honeywell International Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 29, 2016",2016-01-29,"Earnings Calls","Honeywell International Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Dave mentioned our deployment of $8 billion in shareowner capital for 2015. That actually excludes $2 billion in dividends. And just to remind you, we raised our dividend rate in the fourth quarter to -- by 15%. T",4404,"Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Dave mentioned our deployment of $8 billion in shareowner capital for 2015. That actually excludes $2 billion in dividends. And just to remind you, we raised our dividend rate in the fourth quarter to -- by 15%. The biggest component of the $8 billion is M&A. Slide 4 summarizes each of the deals, all of which have closed with the exception of COM DEV, which is expected to close imminently.
We've previously articulated the rationale for each deal, and we're pleased with the diversity of the investments. So 3 of the deals are for aero, 2 for ACS and 3 for PMT. Spreading the wealth so to speak. We also noticed the technology focus. For example, the Elster metering and analytics, the COM DEV space, communication technologies and the SatCom1 aerospace connectivity software. We also view each of these acquisitions as a great opportunity to deploy HOS Gold to drive new growth and greater profitability while building on our Great Positions in Good Industries across the portfolio. We expect the acquisitions will generate strong future returns for our shareowners, consistent with Honeywell's track record. And we're excited about the M&A momentum as we head into 2016, as Dave mentioned.
Slide 5 shows the fourth quarter results. Overall, our results met or exceeded the guidance we provided in December. Sales of $10 billion were flat on a core organic basis, slightly better than what we estimated during the outlook call largely because of our conservative planning. We had improvements in Commercial aero OEM, in both ATR and BGA; UOP catalyst shipments; Process Solutions services; and the America's Fire and Security Distribution drove the stronger finish. The growth in these areas helped to mitigate the challenges we have in the oil and gas-related businesses.
On a reported basis, the sales decline in the fourth quarter was driven by the stronger U.S. dollar and the lower passthrough pricing in resins and chemicals, offset by the absence of the Aerospace OEM incentive in the fourth quarter of 2014, which as you will recall, impacted both sales and segment profit in the fourth quarter '14. 
Segment profit, up 15%, with segment margins expanding 290 basis points to 18.8% or 140 basis points when you exclude those OEM incentives. We drove profit growth and margin expansion in each of our 3 SBGs. So again, a balanced contribution across the portfolio. I'll talk more about segment margin in a minute.
Items below segment profit were as expected. We did see higher pension income as a result of our fourth quarter adoption of the spot rate approach; to setting our discount rates. The impact, however, was more than offset by -- or, yes, more than offset by about $60 million of new restructuring projects, which position us well for continued margin expansion.
Earnings per share, excluding pension mark-to-market adjustment, were $1.58 and increased 10% from 2014, again in line with our guidance. The 2015 pension mark-to-market adjustment was approximately $67 million unfavorable or $0.05 a share, principally driven by our U.S. nonqualified plans versus $249 million, also unfavorable in 2014, or $0.23 a share. So as a result, the fourth quarter reported earnings per share of $1.53 were up 28% from $1.20 last year.
Free cash flow in the quarter, $1.6 billion, was up 17% versus 2014 with conversion at 127%. We had a bigger improvement in working capital and lower cash taxes than what we anticipated in our outlook costs. So overall, another strong quarter of margin expansion, double-digit earnings growth and strong cash flow.
Let me move to Slide 6 to provide more detail on segment margin expansion with the slide that you're familiar with. As we've spoken about throughout 2015, our operating initiatives continue to drive segment margin growth, led by the continued deployment of HOS Gold. We generated 100 basis -- 100 point basis operational improvement in the quarter, and that follows 140 basis points in the first quarter, 110 basis points in the second quarter and 140 basis points in the third quarter. We've got attractive products with differentiated technologies and a software focus. Our factories and supply chains are maturing, our back office continues to get more efficient, and we continue to manage our indirect spend stringently. Previously funded restructuring as well as new restructuring actions have also enabled us to continue improving our overall cost position, yet we believe there's more room to improve.
The remaining 190 basis points of improvement came from our foreign currency hedging approach, lower raw materials, pass-through pricing in resins and chemicals, and the absence of the fourth quarter OEM incentives. 
For 2015, we outpaced our Five-Year Plan targets of 45 to 75 basis point segment margin expansion, and we expect that the permanent improvements to our supply chain, footprint and back office through the deployment of HOS Gold will continue to drive margin expansion in 2016, '17 and beyond.
Let's move to Slide 7 and discuss the Aerospace results. Sales for the quarter were up 2% on a core organic basis, in line with our expectations. Commercial OE sales increased by 9% on a core organic basis, driven by the third consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in Business and General Aviation engine shipments, and higher shipments to large OEMs in air transport. As Dave mentioned earlier, we continue to win on super mid-sized business jet platforms. We also experienced good growth on key air transport platforms, including the Boeing 737 and 787 and Airbus A320 and A350 as we had anticipated. On a reported basis, Commercial OE sales increased 45%, again reflecting the absence of the OEM incentives that we recorded in the fourth quarter of '14.
Commercial aftermarket sales, up 3% on a core organic basis, driven by robust repair and overhaul activities. R&O sales were up high single digit in the quarter and have improved sequentially throughout 2015. On the spare side, we saw an increase in airline spares growth for both mechanical and avionic products. BGA RMUs, or retrofit modifications and upgrades, grew double digit in the fourth quarter as we expected. Spares were soft in other parts of BGA due to timing of channel provisioning.
Defense & Space sales declined 1% core organic basis, driven by a number of program completions and project timing in our U.S. businesses. We saw strong growth in our international business on a sequential basis, but year-over-year growth was only 1% due to a difficult prior year comparison. Just to remind you, the international business grew 17% in the fourth quarter of '14. Defense & Space finished 2015 approximately flat, and we expect growth across all Defense & Space segments in 2016.
Finally, Transportation Systems sales increased 1% on a core organic basis due to new platform launches and continued volume growth in both diesel and light -- and gas-light vehicle applications. Our light vehicle diesel business grew in both Europe and North America while we saw double-digit growth in light vehicle gas in Europe and China. This was partially offset by lower commercial vehicle volumes, reflecting the soft conditions faced by our on-highway and off-highway commercial vehicle global OEM customers. On reported basis, TS sales declined 10%, reflecting the stronger U.S. dollar. 
Aerospace segment margins expanded 420 basis points or 50 basis points, if you again exclude the OEM incentives. This was driven by productivity net of inflation, commercial excellence and the favorable impact from our foreign currency hedges, partially offset by the margin impact of higher OE shipments and continued investments for growth.
Let's turn to the ACS results on Slide 8. In ACS, Alex and his team continued to position the portfolio for better and more profitable growth. With the closing of Elster, the newly acquired thermal solutions, combustion and gas, electricity and water metering businesses will be integrated into our environmental and energy solutions business unit, which includes the legacy ECC business. The broader scope of this new business unit will position us for accelerated growth in both existing markets and attractive new adjacencies. We've seen similar commercial benefits from a combination of our security and fire businesses into Honeywell Security and Fire.
In the fourth quarter, ACS sales were flat on a core organic basis. Sales by Energy, Safety and Security, so the products business has declined 1% on a core organic basis. We saw a continued strength in security and fire globally, another quarter of double-digit growth in China. The investments we've made in China continue to drive results, and we expect similar growth in 2016. And as Dave mentioned, sales of our connected products grew nearly 30% in 2015, as we -- as the continued growth following the launch of our new Lyric product offering. These improvements were offset by lower volume incenting and productivity solutions, as we lapped the benefits of the U.S. Postal Service win in our mobility business as well as by declines in industrial safety due principally to oil and gas-related discretionary spending cuts.
Building Solutions and Distribution sales were up 3% on a core organic basis in the fourth quarter. We continue to see strength in the Americas Distribution business, where sales growth improved sequentially every quarter in 2015, exiting the year up double digit in the fourth quarter. This growth was partially offset by a decline in building solutions, where we continue to experience softness in the energy retrofit business and slower backlog conversion.
ACS margins expanded 70 basis points to 16.6% in the quarter, capping off another terrific year. The business continues to benefit from significant productivity improvements, net of inflation as well as from execution of restructuring actions. At the same time, we've maintained our investments for growth. We've added resources in sales, marketing and engineering locally to drive further acceleration in our high-growth regions as well as in our connected product offerings.
I'm now on Slide 9 to discuss PMT results. PMT sales declined 4% on a core organic basis while segment margin expansion was again robust. And orders growth for the quarter was positive, led by very strong orders in UOP. 
Let's take it business by business, starting with UOP. Sales were down 10% on a core organic basis, driven by lower gas processing, equipment and licensing sales, partially offset by strong catalyst demands. Catalyst shipments were up significantly in the fourth quarter, driven by new petrochemical units and refining reloads. Furthermore, we recorded nearly $1 billion in orders in the fourth quarter, with growth across the entire UOP portfolio, including another international gas processing win. This brings UOP's book-to-bill ratio for the year to approximately 0.95, not bad in this environment. And we expect a portion of the UOP orders to convert in 2016, which will partially mitigate the market softness.
In Process Solutions, core organic sales were flat. We finished the December better than anticipated, driven by growth in services and projects to an uptick in consumer spend at year-end, offset by high single-digit declines in the field instrumentation sales. The HPS projects and services backlogs remain solid, and we continue to see increased demand for our Assurance 360 service partnership offering, which is a multi-year agreement to maintain support and optimize performance of Honeywell control systems. So while our short-cycle field instrumentation business faces the continued headwinds of the industry, we are seeing improvements in our higher-margin software and service businesses.
Advanced Materials sales, down 3% on a core organic basis due to volume declines in resins and chemicals and specialty products, partially offset by foreign product sales, which again increased due to continued demand for solstice, low global warming refrigerant and insulation products. The volumes in resins and chemicals, in particular, were adversely impacted by unplanned plant outages in the quarter. On a reported basis, Advanced Materials sales declined 15%, primarily due to the impact of the lower pass-through pricing in resins and chemicals as we've highlighted previously.
PMT segment margins, up 380 basis points to 20.3%, driven by significant productivity actions net of inflation, commercial excellence, the favorable impact of raw material's pass-through pricing in resins and chemicals and a heavier weighting of UOP catalyst sales. PMT continues to aggressively pursue further cost-reduction opportunities, which help support further margin expansion in this slow-growth environment.
I'm now on Slide 10 to recap the full year 2015 results. Sales increased 1% on a core organic basis with good growth in our short-cycle ESS and Transportation Systems businesses, strong engine shipments in BGA OE and continued growth from a ramp-up of our solstice offering and fluorine products. The reported sales decline reflects the unfavorable impact of foreign currency to friction materials' divestiture and lower pass-through pricing in resin and chemicals, offset by the favorable year-over-year impact of the OEM incentives, which did not repeat in 2015. 
Segment profit increased 8%, with margins expanding 220 basis points. 110 of the expansion was driven by the operational improvements in each of the businesses as we've discussed throughout 2015. All of this resulted in earnings of $6.10, up 10%, clearly in the top quartile of our industrial peer group. And as Dave mentioned, this represents our sixth consecutive year of double-digit earnings growth. 
Reported EPS for the year increased 13%, reflecting decline in the unfavorable pension mark-to-market adjustment that I mentioned earlier. 
Finally, free cash flow of $4.4 billion increased 11%, exceeding the high end of our guidance range, largely driven by improved working capital performance. Our 91% free cash flow conversion was diluted by our investment of over $1 billion in attractive high ROI CapEx in 2015 to support future growth. Adjusting to our long-term reinvestment ratio of 1x depreciation would yield approximately 100% free cash flow conversion, which we expect to reach on a run rate basis by the end of 2017.
Slide 11 provides a recap for the full year by business. The results are very consistent with our guidance. Each of our 3 segments generated triple-digit margin expansion in a challenging market environment. At the same time, we've maintained our investments in new products, high-growth regions and restructuring across the portfolio to ensure growth and productivity. 
With 2015 behind us, let's take a quick look at our end markets as we head into 2016. On Page 12, there's no change in our assessment of the conditions in the end markets we serve and no change to our 2016 guidance that we provided in December. We continue to expect the slower global growth environment to persist in 2016. However, our portfolio with its mix of short and long-cycle businesses, balanced participation in numerous global markets and diversified offerings for consumers, commercial buildings, industrial complexes and governments will help us to grow even in slower environments. Our end markets in total are generally stable. We continue to actively monitor the dynamics in our oil and gas businesses, particularly on the exploration and production side. The challenging conditions we see associated with lower oil and gas prices was contemplated in our 2016 outlook. For Honeywell, this is somewhat tempered by the healthy demand for the output for refining and petrochemical plant operators, which bodes well in the long term for the mid and balanced-stream offerings of HPS and UOP. And that includes catalysts, Advanced Solutions and other aftermarket offerings. In the event conditions do continue to deteriorate, we have the flexibility to further adjust operating costs fairly quickly as well as other contingencies to help us mitigate market headwinds.
As we look across the other end markets, which make up over 85% of our total portfolio, we expect the demand environment to remain stable. In non-resi construction, we expect a similar environment as 2015. The commercial aftermarket industry will continue to grow, albeit at a slightly slower pace as flight hours remain positive overall but increased airline efficiency and the retirement of older aircraft will temper aftermarket demand.
International defense spending and increasing U.S. DoD budgets will make the Defense & Space environment attractive. On autos, we have attractive and competitive turbocharger offerings, which continued to manifest themselves in our strong win rates. As Dave noted, TS won over 40% of all new launches in 2015, grew the business in both gas and diesel, and continued to differentiate through breakthrough innovation and technologies.
Further, Turbo penetration continues to improve, and we're growing faster than the market. Our planning approach for 2016 remains intact. We'll support growth where we see opportunities to outperform, emphasizing those areas where our clear path to growth exists like high-growth regions, UOP catalysts and Fluorine Products. We'll be cautious in our sales planning in the end markets where we see uncertainty in 2016. And we'll make shorter-term adjustments on cost levels should softer end markets dictate.
We also continue to plan our costs and spending conservatively, with a strong emphasis to drive productivity in all of our cost categories while remaining flexible as a company. Of course, we will continue our seed planting investments to create mid- to longer-term opportunity. This includes R&D and marketing investments, but also further deployment of shareowner capital opportunistically.
Let's move to Slide 13 to more specifically discuss each of our businesses for 2016. The green and red abbreviations on this page represent our full year 2016 core organic sales growth expectations for each business.
Let me start with Commercial OE. Excluding the OEM incentives, the business is expected to grow low single digit for 2016. The demand in ATR and BGA continues to be strong, and we'll see the new wins we've communicated drive volume growth, particularly in the second half of the year. However, as previously communicated, the OEM incentives will dilute these ongoing growth rates in our ATR business. As a reminder, we expense these incentives as incurred, unlike many of our competitors who capitalize and amortize them over the life of the program.
On the Commercial Aftermarket side, we expect the strong R&O momentum to continue. Additionally, while we've been up against a difficult year on RMU sales comparisons for most of 2015 in BGA, we're expecting the business to return to growth in 2016 as it did in the fourth quarter. All the businesses in Defense & Space of the U.S. DoD, the services in the U.S. and international, are expected to grow in 2016 as a market demand dynamics improve. In TS, the growth will also continue, supported by a strong backlog of new wins. And while the commercial vehicles market for our technologies have been slow, particularly in China, we anticipate a moderation in the declines for 2016.
We expect low single-digit growth in ACS across both the products and the BSD portfolio, driven by continued momentum in security and fire products and distribution and above-market growth in China, offset by declines related to the completion of large projects in S&PS.
In PMT, our previously communicated growth expectations remain. As we've highlighted on numerous occasions, UOP short-cycle catalyst business tends to be very lumpy quarter-to-quarter, and its growth in the fourth quarter of 2015 was massive, capping off a double-digit growth year for that business. This sets up a challenging first quarter and full year 2016, which along with the tough year-over-year comparisons in gas processing, drive our expectation that UOP will be down mid-single digit in 2016.
So on balance, no change to our end-market outlook, but we continue to monitor the landscape as we move into the first quarter. And speaking of first quarter, I'm on Slide 14 with a preview. 
Relative to foreign exchange, our Q1 sales estimates contemplates our full year planning exchanges. So for example, $1 per euro. However, for operating profit, as we've communicated, we do -- we are hedged. So for the euro as an example, our estimates reflect our $1 per 10 -- or $1.10 per euro hedge rate. 
For total, Honeywell is expecting first quarter sales of $9.2 billion to $9.4 billion. So that's flat to up 2% reported or down 2% to flat on a core organic basis. Segment margins are expected to be up 70 to 90 basis points, excluding M&A, or down 20 to 40 basis points reported. EPS is expected to be $1.48 to $1.53, and that's up 5% to 9% versus 2015 with a tax rate of 26.5%.
So starting with Aerospace, sales are expected to be up 1% to 2% on a core organic basis. In Commercial OE, we're expecting sales to be down mid-single digit, driven by the impact of the OEM incentives, which we previewed in our December outlook call. Excluding the incentives, Commercial OE is expected to be up low single digit, with a ramp-up on key platforms in air transport, partially offset by regional declines and slowing growth in BGA following a terrific 2015.
Commercial aftermarket sales are expected to grow low single digit, with higher volume in airline repair and overhaul activity, and improvement in BGA RMU sales. Defense & Space sales are expected to be up low single digit, with higher sales to the U.S. government partially offset by tough prior year comparisons in international business as larger projects blow off. 
In Transportation Systems, sales are expected to be up mid-single digit, with strong growth across both diesel and gas-light vehicle applications. Commercial vehicles, which represent roughly 15% of the TS portfolio, continue to face headwinds from a down market, but we expect the declines to moderate in the second half of '15. 
As for Aerospace margins, we expect an increase of 100 to 120 basis points excluding M&A. ACS sales are expected to be up 2% to 3% on a core organic basis or up 11% to 12% reported, driven by the addition of Elster. Both ESS and BSD are expected to grow low single digit on a core organic basis. We expect the momentum in our security and fire businesses, and in our high-growth regions to continue heading into 2016. 
S&PS growth will be slower with the completion of the U.S. Postal Service deployment. And we expect continued oil and gas-related headwinds in industrial safety. In BSD, we're expecting similar trends to what we've seen in recent quarters, with strength in Americas Distribution offset by weakness in U.S. energy retrofit business within Building Solutions.
As I mentioned back in October, we've been selected on a number of competitive RFPs, but the pace of conversion from wins into orders and then eventually into revenue is slow. Excluding M&A, margins are expected to improve 130 to 160 basis points of ACS, driven by continued productivity and commercial excellence. Due to acquisition dilution, the ACS margin rate in the first quarter is expected to be down 50 to 80 basis points.
In PMT, sales are expected to be down 11% to 13% on both reported and core organic basis. We contemplated the slow first quarter and the guidance we provided during our December outlook call. UOP is expected to be down significantly, driven primarily by continued declines in gas processing and lower catalyst sales, as I mentioned.
Sales in our catalyst business were very strong at '15, but it's not unusual to see variations as we've experienced in prior years. We'll see these trends again in the first quarter in particular, but expect that for the full year 2016, the catalyst demand will again be strong.
HPS sales are expected to be down slightly. In 2014 and 2015, won a number of significant global megaprojects, where we service the main contractor to providing control and safety solutions for large installations. These will begin to convert in 2016, but the result in sales growth will be more than offset by continued declines in sales of field instrumentation products.
Advanced Materials sales are expected to be up high single digit driven by Fluorine Products solstice sales as well as higher production volumes in resins and chemicals.
PMT segment margins are expected to be down 90 to 110 basis points or down 40 to 60 basis points, excluding M&A, with the dilution coming from sales declines in our petrochemical catalyst business. 
Let me move to Slide 15 for the 2016 financial guidance for the full year. So consistent with our December call, we expect total Honeywell sales in the range of $39.9 billion to $40.9 billion, up 1% to 2% on a core organic basis. Modestly better than our Q1 expectations, which, as you've seen, are weighed down by the normal ongoing lumpiness in UOP. Reported sales growth will be higher in the range of 3% to 6%, primarily due to the favorable impact of M&A, most notably, Elster. Segment margin expansion is expected to be 10 to 50 basis points or 80 to 110 basis points, excluding M&A.
We're confident in our earnings range of $6.45 and $6.70, representing 6% to 10% growth versus 2015. The full year growth linearity remains in line with prior years and is based on an expected full year tax rate of 26.5%, with share count held flat to the 2015 full year weighted average. Of course, we'll continue to be opportunistic about share repurchase opportunities, particularly in these volatile markets.
Free cash flow is expected to be up in the range of $4.6 billion to $4.8 million. That's 5% to 10% increase from 2015, with CapEx investments roughly flat at approximately $1.1 billion. This will drive free cash flow conversion of approximately 90%.
Let me move to Slide 16 for a quick summary before turning it back to Mark for Q&A. In 2015, we again demonstrated that Honeywell can deliver on its commitments even on a slow growth environment. We met or exceeded our margin expansion, earnings growth and free cash flow targets while investing for future growth through enhanced research and development, continued investment in CapEx and funding of business restructuring. And we put to work some sizable amount of shareowner capital, which will pave the way for future earnings and cash growth.
As we turn our attention to 2016, we're planning for more of the same. A modest top line growth with strong margin expansion and earnings and cash growth. We have incredible and attainable 2016 plan based on the tenets that Dave mentioned of supporting growth, being conscious on sales, planning costs and spending conservatively and continued seed planting.
In summary, we're excited and prepared for 2016. Our management team is focused on execution as we head into year 3 of our Five-Year Plan, and we look forward to sharing more at our March 2 Investor Conference.
With that, Mark, let's move to Q&A."

What's your confidence that, that stuff comes back and catalysts don't normalize? Particularly, I mean, you're seeing the GDP numbers out of the U.S. today. I mean, it's -- may have another tough year in front of us. I mean, I can't imagine catalyst growth can stay incredibly strong forever. So just help us get a little bit more confidence around that because I think it's just impossible for us to know."

But you can expect that the catalysts are going to continue to do well, and Tom provided you some of the data to provide more color. But catalysts will continue to do well because there's still usage out there and there's still demand for refined product. That's not going away, and that's really where demand comes from -- for us on the catalyst side. You're also going to hear more about the Parex cycle and how that changes. It tends to go through cycles, and we'll be coming up on a new cycle for Parex as we get towards the end of this year and into next year. When it comes to new projects, yes, you're right. There wasn't as much as many new projects put on the boards as there were in prior years. But we largely took a lot of those hits last year. So as we start looking at kind of the comparables, as we go from 1 year to another, we should start seeing that coming out, I'd say again towards the end of this year and more into next year. So while it's been a difficult transition, it helps for us that this diversity of opportunity you hear me talked about, where oil and gas is only about 13% in total, so it's been manageable, not easy, but manageable. And I think you're going to see UOP getting on to a growth path again as we get into next year. But Tom, I don't know if there's anything you want to add."

When you talk to Rajeev and the team, they are very excited about what's going on in chemicals and petrochemical catalysts, in particular. We are the clear leader in that space. So when you think about aromatics and olefins and other things where we have a significant amount of presence, it's a big opportunity for us. So overall, I think it's -- it will continue to be lumpy, but prospects are good."

As I'm sure you've seen by now, Honeywell delivered another excellent quarter, capping off a terrific year in a difficult environment. We delivered results at or above our guidance on segment margin, earnings and cash flow. Earning",1075,"Good morning, everyone. As I'm sure you've seen by now, Honeywell delivered another excellent quarter, capping off a terrific year in a difficult environment. We delivered results at or above our guidance on segment margin, earnings and cash flow. Earnings of $1.58 in the fourth quarter increased 10%, representing another quarter of double-digit earnings growth.
We continue to drive margin expansion up 140 basis points, excluding the impact of the fourth quarter '14 Aerospace OEM incentives. And our free cash flow finished at $1.6 billion in the quarter, up 17% at 127% conversion.
For the full year, we increased sales 1% on a core organic basis while continuing our seed planting with investments in new products and technologies, high ROI CapEx and expansion of our global footprint. We're benefiting from our balanced global portfolio, diversity of opportunity and our ability to effectively manage in what continues to be a slow growth macro environment. We also proactively funded $160 million of new restructuring in 2015, and that includes $60 million in the fourth quarter, building on a healthy pipeline of new projects, which will support strong margin expansion this year and beyond.
Earnings for the full year of $6.10 increased 10%, representing the sixth consecutive year of double-digit growth. Our 15% dividend rate increase marked the 11th time in the last 10 years that we've increased our dividend. And we committed over $8 billion in capital during the year to M&A and share repurchases, which sets us up nicely to deliver for our share owners in 2016 and beyond.
We're reaffirming our 2016 earnings guidance of $6.45 to $6.70, up 6% to 10% year-over-year. We're facing challenging end markets, but we have a credible and attainable plan to achieve this guidance, and our planning framework has not changed. We'll support growth wherever we have it to drive our performance. However, we'll also be cautious in our sales planning, and we'll continue to plan our costs and spending conservatively, ensuring we remain flexible as a company. We'll also maintain our seed planting investments for the future, supported by a robust pipeline of funded restructuring projects and continued investment in R&D.
There continues to be a lot of exciting things happening across the portfolio driving our terrific results, and I can't help but highlight a few. At the 2016 International Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Honeywell's latest connected offerings were on display, including the second-generation Lyric Round Wi-Fi Thermostat. The new Lyric Wi-Fi Water Leak and Freeze Detector was honored by USA TODAY with the CES 2016 Editor's Choice award. This great new product provides users with early alerts of water leaks and frozen pipes to avoid costly repairs. The detector easily connects to your home Wi-Fi network and provides a simple do-it-yourself installation.
In 2015, our connectable product portfolio sales grew nearly 30%, a good example of the benefits from our continued investment in development of new technologies to support growth.
Our win rate in turbos on new platforms was once again over 40%. Honeywell turbochargers are the no-compromise solution for vehicle performance, better fuel economy and compliance with emission regulations. Sales from both diesel and gas turbos continued to grow in 2015. And we estimate that by 2020, roughly half of all cars on the road will have turbocharged engines, up from 1/3 of all passenger vehicles today. We expect to continue growing faster than the industry due to our differentiated technology, global footprint and the benefits of the Honeywell Operating System.
In November, Honeywell was selected to supply its HTF series jet engines, auxiliary power unit, advanced cockpit technologies, environmental control system and cabin pressure control system to set this new citation longitude business jet. Further evidence that we continue to perform well in super mid-sized cabin platforms. Including the Cessna, our HTF7000 engine is now on 4 of the 5 super mid-sized platforms. The others being: Gulfstream, the G280; the Embraer Legacy 450, 500; and Bombardier Challenger 300, 350. Our platform engine has surpassed 2.4 million flight hours to date.
On the M&A front, we're pleased to have closed the Elster acquisition at the end of December, and the integration is underway. Elster brings outstanding technologies, including software, strong well-recognized brands, energy efficiency know-how and a global presence to Honeywell and ACS. We look forward to updating you on the integration progress at our Investor Day in March.
Earlier this month, we acquired the remaining 30% stake in UOP Russell, a global leader in modular gas processing technology and equipment. One of our objectives when we acquired the first 70% was to leverage the Honeywell global footprint to take this principally domestic-focused modular technology to markets outside the U.S. This premise is now materializing. As an example, in the fourth quarter, PV Gas, Vietnam's primary gas provider, selected UOP Russell's modular gas processing plant to separate liquefied petroleum gas or LPG from natural gas in its facility near the southern tip of Vietnam. In addition, HPS will serve as the integrated main automation contractor, or IMAC, and supply the integrated controls and safety systems for the facility and terminal. And we repurchased close to $2 billion in Honeywell shares during the year at attractive prices, which is nearly double the rate of 2014. We have and will continue to be opportunistic when it comes to share repurchases, which allows us to preserve our balance sheet firepower for repurchases or M&A as opportunities present themselves. And you can expect another terrific year for capital deployment in 2016.
You can expect to see lots of exciting innovations at our Investor Day on March 2, where each of the businesses will highlight a number of new products and roadmaps for future growth and margin expansion. 
We also plan to share how software is evolving throughout the organization, which we believe is a key differentiator, particularly across the industrial space. 
We held our annual senior leadership meeting earlier this month, and I could tell you that each of the businesses are hard at work, identifying new and innovative breakthroughs to drive further growth. Our seed planting for the future, Great Positions in Good Industries, diversity of opportunity and strength of execution will allow us to deliver on our long-term targets and continue to outperform a little long term. Needless to say, as we continue to talk about amongst ourselves, this is an exciting time to be at Honeywell. So with that, I'll turn it over to Tom."

Dave mentioned our deployment of $8 billion in shareowner capital for 2015. That actually excludes $2 billion in dividends. And just to remind you, we raised our dividend rate in the fourth quarter to -- by 15%. T",4408,"Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Dave mentioned our deployment of $8 billion in shareowner capital for 2015. That actually excludes $2 billion in dividends. And just to remind you, we raised our dividend rate in the fourth quarter to -- by 15%. The biggest component of the $8 billion is M&A. Slide 4 summarizes each of the deals, all of which have closed with the exception of COM DEV, which is expected to close imminently.
We've previously articulated the rationale for each deal, and we're pleased with the diversity of the investments. So 3 of the deals are for aero, 2 for ACS and 3 for PMT. Spreading the wealth so to speak. We also noticed the technology focus. For example, the Elster metering and analytics, the COM DEV space, communications technologies and the SatCom1 aerospace connectivity software. We also view each of these acquisitions as a great opportunity to deploy HOS Gold to drive new growth and greater profitability while building on our Great Positions in Good Industries across the portfolio. We expect the acquisitions will generate strong future returns for our shareowners, consistent with Honeywell's track record. And we're excited about the M&A momentum as we head into 2016, as Dave mentioned.
Slide 5 shows the fourth quarter results. Overall, our results met or exceeded the guidance we provided in December. Sales of $10 billion were flat on a core organic basis, slightly better than what we estimated during the outlook call largely because of our conservative planning. We had improvements in Commercial aero OE, in both ATR and BGA; UOP catalyst shipments; Process Solutions services; and the America's Fire and Security Distribution drove the stronger finish. The growth in these areas helped to mitigate the challenges we have in the oil and gas-related businesses.
On a reported basis, the sales decline in the fourth quarter was driven by the stronger U.S. dollar and the lower passthrough pricing in resins and chemicals, offset by the absence of the Aerospace OEM incentive in the fourth quarter of 2014, which as you recall, impacted both sales and segment profit in the fourth quarter '14. 
Segment profit, up 15%, with segment margins expanding 290 basis points to 18.8% or 140 basis points when you exclude those OEM incentives. We drove profit growth and margin expansion in each of our 3 SBGs. So again, a balanced contribution across the portfolio. I'll talk more about segment margin in a minute.
Items below segment profit were as expected. We did see higher pension income as a result of our fourth quarter adoption of the spot rate approach to setting our discount rates. The impact, however, was more than offset by -- or, yes, more than offset by about $60 million of new restructuring projects, which position us well for continued margin expansion.
Earnings per share, excluding pension mark-to-market adjustment, were $1.58 and increased 10% from 2014, again in line with our guidance. The 2015 pension mark-to-market adjustment was approximately $67 million unfavorable or $0.05 a share, principally driven by our U.S. nonqualified plans versus $249 million, also unfavorable in 2014, or $0.23 a share. So as a result, the fourth quarter reported earnings per share of $1.53 were up 28% from $1.20 last year.
Free cash flow in the quarter, $1.6 billion, was up 17% versus 2014 with conversion at 127%. We had a bigger improvement in working capital and lower cash taxes than what we anticipated in our outlook costs. So overall, another strong quarter of margin expansion, double-digit earnings growth and strong cash flow.
Let me move to Slide 6 to provide more detail on segment margin expansion with the slide that you're familiar with. As we've spoken about throughout 2015, our operating initiatives continue to drive segment margin growth, led by the continued deployment of HOS Gold. We generated 100 basis -- 100 point basis operational improvement in the quarter, and that follows 140 basis points in the first quarter, 110 basis points in the second quarter and 140 basis points in the third quarter. We've got attractive products with differentiated technologies and a software focus. Our factories and supply chains are maturing, our back office continues to get more efficient, and we continue to manage our indirect spend stringently. Previously funded restructuring as well as new restructuring actions have also enabled us to continue improving our overall cost position, yet we believe there's more room to improve.
The remaining 190 basis points of improvement came from our foreign currency hedging approach, lower raw materials, pass-through pricing in resins and chemicals, and the absence of the fourth quarter OEM incentives. 
For 2015, we outpaced our Five-Year Plan targets of 45 to 75 basis point segment margin expansion, and we expect that the permanent improvements to our supply chain, footprint and back office through the deployment of HOS Gold will continue to drive margin expansion in 2016, '17 and beyond.
Let's move to Slide 7 and discuss the Aerospace results. Sales for the quarter were up 2% on a core organic basis, in line with our expectations. Commercial OE sales increased by 9% on a core organic basis, driven by the third consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in Business and General Aviation engine shipments, and higher shipments to large OEMs in air transport. As Dave mentioned earlier, we continue to win on super mid-sized business jet platforms. We also experienced good growth on key air transport platforms, including the Boeing 737 and 787 and Airbus A320 and A350 as we had anticipated. On a reported basis, Commercial OE sales increased 45%, again reflecting the absence of the OEM incentives that we recorded in the fourth quarter of '14.
Commercial aftermarket sales, up 3% on a core organic basis, driven by robust repair and overhaul activities. R&O sales were up high single digit in the quarter and have improved sequentially throughout 2015. On the spare side, we saw an increase in airline spares growth for both mechanical and avionic products. BGA RMUs, or retrofit modifications and upgrades, grew double digit in the fourth quarter as we expected. Spares were soft in other parts of BGA due to timing of channel provisioning.
Defense & Space sales declined 1% core organic basis, driven by a number of program completions and project timing in our U.S. businesses. We saw strong growth in our international business on a sequential basis, but year-over-year growth was only 1% due to a difficult prior year comparison. Just to remind you, the international business grew 17% in the fourth quarter of '14. Defense & Space finished 2015 approximately flat, and we expect growth across all Defense & Space segments in 2016.
Finally, Transportation Systems sales increased 1% on a core organic basis due to new platform launches and continued volume growth in both diesel and light -- and gas-light vehicle applications. Our light vehicle diesel business grew in both Europe and North America while we saw double-digit growth in light vehicle gas in Europe and China. This was partially offset by lower commercial vehicle volumes, reflecting the soft conditions faced by our on-highway and off-highway commercial vehicle global OEM customers. On a reported basis, TS sales declined 10%, reflecting the stronger U.S. dollar. 
Aerospace segment margins expanded 420 basis points or 50 basis points, if you again exclude the OEM incentives. This was driven by productivity net of inflation, commercial excellence and the favorable impact from our foreign currency hedges, partially offset by the margin impact of higher OE shipments and continued investments for growth.
Let's turn to the ACS results on Slide 8. In ACS, Alex and his team continued to position the portfolio for better and more profitable growth. With the closing of Elster, the newly acquired thermal solutions, combustion and gas, electricity and water metering businesses will be integrated into our environmental and energy solutions business unit, which includes the legacy ECC business. The broader scope of this new business unit will position us for accelerated growth in both existing markets and attractive new adjacencies. We've seen similar commercial benefits from a combination of our security and fire businesses into Honeywell Security and Fire.
In the fourth quarter, ACS sales were flat on a core organic basis. Sales by Energy, Safety and Security, so the products business has declined 1% on a core organic basis. We saw a continued strength in security and fire globally, another quarter of double-digit growth in China. The investments we've made in China continue to drive results, and we expect similar growth in 2016. And as Dave mentioned, sales of our connected products grew nearly 30% in 2015, as we -- as the continued growth following the launch of our new Lyric product offering. These improvements were offset by lower volume incenting and productivity solutions, as we lapped the benefits of the U.S. Postal Service win in our mobility business as well as by declines in industrial safety due principally to oil and gas-related discretionary spending cuts.
Building Solutions and Distribution sales were up 3% on a core organic basis in the fourth quarter. We continue to see strength in the Americas Distribution business, where sales growth improved sequentially every quarter in 2015, exiting the year up double digit in the fourth quarter. This growth was partially offset by a decline in building solutions, where we continue to experience softness in the energy retrofit business and slower backlog conversion.
ACS margins expanded 70 basis points to 16.6% in the quarter, capping off another terrific year. The business continues to benefit from significant productivity improvements, net of inflation as well as from execution of restructuring actions. At the same time, we've maintained our investments for growth. We've added resources in sales, marketing and engineering locally to drive further acceleration in our high-growth regions as well as in our connected product offerings.
I'm now on Slide 9 to discuss PMT results. PMT sales declined 4% on a core organic basis while segment margin expansion was again robust. And orders growth for the quarter was positive, led by very strong orders in UOP. 
Let's take it business by business, starting with UOP. Sales were down 10% on a core organic basis, driven by lower gas processing, equipment and licensing sales, partially offset by strong catalyst demands. Catalyst shipments were up significantly in the fourth quarter, driven by new petrochemical units and refining reloads. Furthermore, we recorded nearly $1 billion in orders in the fourth quarter, with growth across the entire UOP portfolio, including another international gas processing win. This brings UOP's book-to-bill ratio for the year to approximately 0.95, not bad in this environment. And we expect a portion of UOP orders to convert in 2016, which will partially mitigate the market softness.
In Process Solutions, core organic sales were flat. We finished the December better than anticipated, driven by growth in services and projects due to an uptick in consumer spend at year-end, offset by high single-digit declines in the field instrumentation sales. The HPS projects and services backlogs remain solid, and we continue to see increased demand for our Assurance 360 service partnership offering, which is a multi-year agreement to maintain support and optimize performance of Honeywell control systems. So while our short-cycle field instrumentation business faces the continued headwinds of the industry, we are seeing improvements in our higher-margin software and service businesses.
Advanced Materials sales, down 3% on a core organic basis due to volume declines in resins and chemicals and specialty products, partially offset by foreign product sales, which again increased due to continued demand for solstice, low global warming refrigerant and insulation products. The volumes in resins and chemicals, in particular, were adversely impacted by unplanned plant outages in the quarter. On a reported basis, Advanced Materials sales declined 15%, primarily due to the impact of the lower pass-through pricing in resins and chemicals as we've highlighted previously.
PMT segment margins, up 380 basis points to 20.3%, driven by significant productivity actions net of inflation, commercial excellence, the favorable impact of raw material's pass-through pricing in resins and chemicals and a heavier weighting of UOP catalyst sales. PMT continues to aggressively pursue further cost-reduction opportunities, which help support further margin expansion in this slow-growth environment.
I'm now on Slide 10 to recap the full year 2015 results. Sales increased 1% on a core organic basis with good growth in our short-cycle ESS and Transportation Systems businesses, strong engine shipments in BGA OE and continued growth from a ramp-up of our solstice offering and fluorine products. The reported sales decline reflects the unfavorable impact of foreign currency to friction materials' divestiture and lower pass-through pricing in resin and chemicals, offset by the favorable year-over-year impact of the OEM incentives, which did not repeat in 2015. 
Segment profit increased 8%, with margins expanding 220 basis points. 110 of the expansion was driven by the operational improvements in each of the businesses as we've discussed throughout 2015. All of this resulted in earnings of $6.10, up 10%, clearly in the top quartile of our industrial peer group. And as Dave mentioned, this represents our sixth consecutive year of double-digit earnings growth. 
Reported EPS for the year increased 13%, reflecting decline in the unfavorable pension mark-to-market adjustment that I mentioned earlier. 
Finally, free cash flow of $4.4 billion increased 11%, exceeding the high end of our guidance range, largely driven by improved working capital performance. Our 91% free cash flow conversion was diluted by our investment of over $1 billion in attractive high ROI CapEx in 2015 to support future growth. Adjusting to our long-term reinvestment ratio of 1x depreciation would yield approximately 100% free cash flow conversion, which we expect to reach on a run rate basis by the end of 2017.
Slide 11 provides a recap for the full year by business. The results are very consistent with our guidance. Each of our 3 segments generated triple-digit margin expansion in a challenging market environment. At the same time, we've maintained our investments in new products, high-growth regions and restructuring across the portfolio to ensure growth and productivity. 
With 2015 behind us, let's take a quick look at our end markets as we head into 2016. On Page 12, there's no change in our assessment of the conditions in the end markets we serve and no change to our 2016 guidance that we provided in December. We continue to expect the slower global growth environment to persist in 2016. However, our portfolio with its mix of short and long-cycle businesses, balanced participation in numerous global markets and diversified offerings for consumers, commercial buildings, industrial complexes and governments will help us to grow even in slower environments. Our end markets in total are generally stable. We continue to actively monitor the dynamics in our oil and gas businesses, particularly on the exploration and production side. The challenging conditions we see associated with lower oil and gas prices was contemplated in our 2016 outlook. For Honeywell, this is somewhat tempered by the healthy demand for the output for refining and petrochemical plant operators, which bodes well in the long term for the mid and down-stream offerings of HPS and UOP. And that includes catalysts, Advanced Solutions and other aftermarket offerings. In the event conditions do continue to deteriorate, we have the flexibility to further adjust operating costs fairly quickly as well as other contingencies to help us mitigate market headwinds.
As we look across the other end markets, which make up over 85% of our total portfolio, we expect the demand environment to remain stable. In non-resi construction, we expect a similar environment as 2015. The commercial aftermarket industry will continue to grow, albeit at a slightly slower pace as flight hours remain positive overall but increased airline efficiency and the retirement of older aircraft will temper aftermarket demand.
International defense spending and increasing U.S. DoD budgets will make the Defense & Space environment attractive. On autos, we have attractive and competitive turbocharger offerings, which continue to manifest themselves in our strong win rates. As Dave noted, TS won over 40% of all new launches in 2015, grew the business in both gas and diesel, and continued to differentiate through breakthrough innovation and technologies.
Further, Turbo penetration continues to improve, and we're growing faster than the market. Our planning approach for 2016 remains intact. We'll support growth where we see opportunities to outperform, emphasizing those areas where our clear path to growth exists like high-growth regions, UOP catalysts and Fluorine Products. We'll be cautious in our sales planning in the end markets where we see uncertainty in 2016. And we'll make shorter-term adjustments of cost levels should softer end markets dictate.
We also continue to plan our costs and spending conservatively, with a strong emphasis to drive productivity in all of our cost categories while remaining flexible as a company. Of course, we will continue our seed planting investments to create mid- to longer-term opportunity. This includes R&D and marketing investments, but also further deployment of shareowner capital opportunistically.
Let's move to Slide 13 to more specifically discuss each of our businesses for 2016. The green and red abbreviations on this page represent our full year 2016 core organic sales growth expectations for each business.
Let me start with Commercial OE. Excluding the OEM incentives, the business is expected to grow low single digit for 2016. The demand in ATR and BGA continues to be strong, and we'll see the new wins we've communicated drive volume growth, particularly in the second half of the year. However, as previously communicated, the OEM incentives will dilute these ongoing growth rates in our ATR business. As a reminder, we expense these incentives as incurred, unlike many of our competitors who capitalize and amortize them over the life of the program.
On the Commercial Aftermarket side, we expect the strong R&O momentum to continue. Additionally, while we've been up against a difficult year on RMU sales comparisons for most of 2015 in BGA, we're expecting the business to return to growth in 2016 as it did in the fourth quarter. All the businesses in Defense & Space, so the U.S. DoD, the services in the U.S. and international, are expected to grow in 2016 as the market demand dynamics improve. In TS, the growth will also continue, supported by a strong backlog of new wins. And while the commercial vehicles market for our technologies have been slow, particularly in China, we anticipate a moderation in the declines for 2016.
We expect low single-digit growth in ACS across both the products and the BSD portfolio, driven by continued momentum in security and fire products and distribution and above-market growth in China, offset by declines related to the completion of large projects in S&PS.
In PMT, our previously communicated growth expectations remain. As we've highlighted on numerous occasions, UOP short-cycle catalyst business tends to be very lumpy quarter-to-quarter, and its growth in the fourth quarter of 2015 was massive, capping off a double-digit growth year for that business. This sets up a challenging first quarter and full year 2016, which along with the tough year-over-year comparisons in gas processing, drive our expectation that UOP will be down mid-single digit in 2016.
So on balance, no change to our end-market outlook, but we continue to monitor the landscape as we move into the first quarter. And speaking of the first quarter, I'm on Slide 14 with a preview. 
Relative to foreign exchange, our Q1 sales estimates contemplates our full year planning exchanges. So for example, $1 per euro. However, for operating profit, as we've communicated, we do -- we are hedged. So for the euro as an example, our estimates reflect our $1 per 10 -- or $1.10 per euro hedge rate. 
For total, Honeywell is expecting first quarter sales of $9.2 billion to $9.4 billion. So that's flat to up 2% reported or down 2% to flat on a core organic basis. Segment margins are expected to be up 70 to 90 basis points, excluding M&A, or down 20 to 40 basis points reported. EPS is expected to be $1.48 to $1.53, and that's up 5% to 9% versus 2015 with a tax rate of 26.5%.
So starting with Aerospace, sales are expected to be up 1% to 2% on a core organic basis. In Commercial OE, we're expecting sales to be down mid-single digit, driven by the impact of the OEM incentives, which we previewed in our December outlook call. Excluding the incentives, Commercial OE is expected to be up low single digit, with a ramp-up on key platforms in air transport, partially offset by regional declines and slowing growth in BGA following a terrific 2015.
Commercial aftermarket sales are expected to grow low single digit, with higher volume in airline repair and overhaul activity, and improvement in BGA RMU sales. Defense & Space sales are expected to be up low single digit, with higher sales to the U.S. government partially offset by tough prior year comparisons in the international business as larger projects flow off. 
In Transportation Systems, sales are expected to be up mid-single digits, with strong growth across both diesel and gas-light vehicle applications. Commercial vehicles, which represent roughly 15% of the TS portfolio, continue to face headwinds from a down market, but we expect the declines to moderate in the second half of '15. 
As for Aerospace margins, we expect an increase of 100 to 120 basis points excluding M&A. ACS sales are expected to be up 2% to 3% on a core organic basis or up 11% to 12% reported, driven by the addition of Elster. Both ESS and BSD are expected to grow low single digit on a core organic basis. We expect the momentum in our security and fire businesses, and in our high-growth regions to continue heading into 2016. 
S&PS growth will be slower with the completion of the U.S. Postal Service deployment. And we expect continued oil and gas-related headwinds in industrial safety. In BSD, we're expecting similar trends to what we've seen in recent quarters, with strength in Americas Distribution offset by weakness in U.S. energy retrofit business within Building Solutions.
As I mentioned back in October, we've been selected on a number of competitive RFPs, but the pace of conversion from wins into orders and then eventually into revenue is slow. Excluding M&A, margins are expected to improve 130 to 160 basis points of ACS, driven by continued productivity and commercial excellence. Due to acquisition dilution, the ACS margin rate in the first quarter is expected to be down 50 to 80 basis points.
In PMT, sales are expected to be down 11% to 13% on both reported and core organic basis. We contemplated the slow first quarter and the guidance we provided during our December outlook call. UOP is expected to be down significantly, driven primarily by continued declines in gas processing and lower catalyst sales, as I mentioned.
Sales in our catalyst business were very strong at '15, but it's not unusual to see variations as we've experienced in prior years. We'll see these trends again in the first quarter in particular, but expect that for the full year 2016, the catalyst demand will again be strong.
HPS sales are expected to be down slightly. In 2014 and 2015, won a number of significant global megaprojects, where we serve as the main contractor to providing control and safety solutions for large installations. These will begin to convert in 2016, but the result in sales growth will be more than offset by continued declines in sales of field instrumentation products.
Advanced Materials sales are expected to be up high single digit driven by Fluorine Products solstice sales as well as higher production volumes in resins and chemicals.
PMT segment margins are expected to be down 90 to 110 basis points or down 40 to 60 basis points, excluding M&A, with the dilution coming from sales declines in our petrochemical catalyst business. 
Let me move to Slide 15 for the 2016 financial guidance for the full year. So consistent with our December call, we expect total Honeywell sales in the range of $39.9 billion to $40.9 billion, up 1% to 2% on a core organic basis. Modestly better than our Q1 expectations, which, as you've seen, are weighed down by the normal ongoing lumpiness in UOP. Reported sales growth will be higher in the range of 3% to 6%, primarily due to the favorable impact of M&A, most notably, Elster. Segment margin expansion is expected to be 10 to 50 basis points or 80 to 110 basis points, excluding M&A.
We're confident in our earnings range of $6.45 to $6.70, representing 6% to 10% growth versus 2015. The full year growth linearity remains in line with prior years and is based on an expected full year tax rate of 26.5%, with share count held flat to the 2015 full year weighted average. Of course, we'll continue to be opportunistic about share repurchase opportunities, particularly in these volatile markets.
Free cash flow is expected to be up in the range of $4.6 billion to $4.8 million. That's 5% to 10% increase from 2015, with CapEx investments roughly flat at approximately $1.1 billion. This will drive free cash flow conversion of approximately 90%.
Let me move to Slide 16 for a quick summary before turning it back to Mark for Q&A. In 2015, we again demonstrated that Honeywell can deliver on its commitments even in a slow growth environment. We met or exceeded our margin expansion, earnings growth and free cash flow targets while investing for future growth through enhanced research and development, continued investment in CapEx and funding of business restructuring. And we've put to work some sizable amounts of shareowner capital, which will pave the way for future earnings and cash growth.
As we turn our attention to 2016, we're planning for more of the same. A modest top line growth with strong margin expansion and earnings and cash growth. We have a credible and attainable 2016 plan based on the tenets that Dave mentioned of supporting growth, being cautious on sales, planning costs and spending conservatively and continued seed planting.
In summary, we're excited and prepared for 2016. Our management team is focused on execution as we head into year 3 of our Five-Year Plan, and we look forward to sharing more at our March 2 Investor Conference.
With that, Mark, let's move to Q&A."

What's your confidence that, that stuff comes back and catalysts don't normalize? Particularly, I mean, you're seeing the GDP numbers out of the U.S. today. I mean, it's -- may have another tough year in front of us. I mean, I can't imagine catalyst growth can stay incredibly strong forever. So just help us get a little bit more confidence around that because I think it's just impossible for us to know."

But you can expect that the catalysts are going to continue to do well, and Tom provided you some of the data to provide more color. But catalysts will continue to do well because there's still usage out there and there's still demand for refined product. That's not going away, and that's really where demand comes from -- for us on the catalyst side. You're also going to hear more about the Parex cycle and how that changes. It tends to go through cycles, and we'll be coming up on a new cycle for Parex as we get towards the end of this year and into next year. When it comes to new projects, yes, you're right. There wasn't as much -- as many new projects put on the boards as there were in prior years. But we largely took a lot of those hits last year. So as we start looking at kind of the comparables, as you go from 1 year to another, we should start seeing that coming out, I'd say again towards the end of this year and more into next year. So while it's been a difficult transition, it helps for us that this diversity of opportunity you hear me talk about, where oil and gas is only about 13% in total, so it's been manageable, not easy, but manageable. And I think you're going to see UOP getting on to a growth path again as we get into next year. But Tom, I don't know if there's anything you want to add."

So it's -- and the backlog itself has held up pretty well. I mentioned the 0.95 book-to-bill ratio. I mean, the backlog is down mid-single digits is the way I characterize it. When you talk to Rajeev and the team, they are very excited about what's going on in chemicals and petrochemical catalysts, in particular. We are the clear leader in that space. So when you think about aromatics and olefins and other things where we have a significant amount of presence, it's a big opportunity for us. So overall, I think it's -- while it will continue to be lumpy, the prospects are good."

And if you take a look at what's happening in the Aerospace industry, the biggest thing for us is that flight hours increase. And flight hours last year were up 4%, 5%. They're likely to be up 4% to 6% again this year. And the big thing is that planes fly. And as long as they fly and as long as there's a need for the kind of upgrades that we keep talking about, and as long as the technology keeps progressing towards this kind of connectivity and the need for airlines and passengers to just be connected better than they have in the past, those are all good phenomena for us. So no, it doesn't really have an effect on us. The big thing is flight hours continuing to grow and the technology, especially on the software and connectivity side, continuing to develop."

Doesn't make a lot of sense, and that's why we said we're going to run this for the long term. So the -- we always planned on getting back to 100% as soon as we were done with the CapEx expansions. And Tom saying it was -- we feel a message that we've been saying all along. But if it resonates better because we said it again, then great because that's been the message all along as far as I'm concerned."

As I'm sure you've seen by now, Honeywell delivered another strong quarter to kick off 2016. EPS of $1.53 increased 9% coming in at the high end of our guidance range; sales of $9.5 billion were up 1% on a core organic basis, above",962,"Good morning, everyone. As I'm sure you've seen by now, Honeywell delivered another strong quarter to kick off 2016. EPS of $1.53 increased 9% coming in at the high end of our guidance range; sales of $9.5 billion were up 1% on a core organic basis, above the high end of our sales guidance.
The outperform growth accelerated in Aerospace Commercial aftermarket and Transportation Systems, in our residential and commercial and China businesses within ACS and in Process Solutions in Fluorine Products in PMT. Excluding the dilutive impact of M&A, segment margin expanded 20 basis points in the quarter to 18.9%. We generated significant sustainable productivity in the quarter. The Honeywell user experience is driving new products at higher margins. Our factories and sourcing organizations continue to mature, and we continue to reengineer our products to make it easier and less expensive to maximum manufacturer.
HOS Gold and our key process initiatives that generated their productivity allowed us to overcome previously discussed significant headwinds in segment profit. These included over $40 million of additional Aerospace OEM incentives, additional depreciations stemming from our ramp-up in high ROI CapEx, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar and difficult comparisons at UOP and Sensing & Productivity Solutions, which Tom will take you through further.
Our segment margin rate was slightly lower than our guidance range, primarily due to a combination of higher-than-expected sales of lower-margin products like in BSD and commercial aviation OE and lower sales of higher-margin products like in ESS and UOP catalysts. We still expect to be within our segment margin guidance range for the full year as sales growth modestly improves in the second half of the year Basically just from the absence of declines in UOP that we encountered in the first half. We will, of course, continue with our disciplined cost controls, focus on commercial excellence and execution of previously funded restructuring actions. Our strong start and the momentum we see in parts of the portfolio allow us to raise the low end of our 2016 full year earnings guidance to a new range of $6.55 to $6.70 or up 7% to 10% year-over-year.
Our planning framework has not changed. We will support growth wherever we have it to drive outperformance. We'll be cautious in our sales planning. We will continue to plan our costs and spending conservatively, ensuring we remain flexible as a company. And we'll maintain our seed planting investments for the future, supported by a robust pipeline of funded restructuring projects and continued investments in R&D.
In the second quarter, we expect EPS growth of 7% to 10%, in line with the full year range. There's a number of exciting things that are happening across the company I'd like to spend a moment here. Earlier this month, we appointed Darius Adamczyk to the newly created role of President and Chief Operating Officer reporting to me. In this role, he will drive continued profitable growth of our operating businesses through HOS Gold breakthrough strategies and advanced software offerings that complement Honeywell's diverse technology portfolio. Honeywell remains very active on the capital allocation front in this quarter. We opportunistically repurchased over $1 billion of Honeywell shares at a weighted average price of approximately $104, and we deployed another $1 billion to acquisitions.
We announced and closed 3 deals in ACS, Xtralis and RSI video technologies in security and fire and mobilizing in Sensing & Productivity Solutions. And as we discussed in January, we acquired the remaining 30% stake in UOP Russell, a global leader in modular gas processing technology and equipment. Each acquisition brings differentiated technology and a software focus to drive new growth and greater profitability while building on our great positions in good industries.
Our acquisitions across the portfolio last year that bolster our connectivity and software offerings are already paying dividends with new wins announced by Elster, AVIASO and COM DEV. In excess, one of the largest multi-utility distribution system operators in the Netherlands, selected Honeywell to deliver more than 1 million smart electricity meters over the next 5 years as part of the country's efforts to meet European Union energy efficiency goals. Aerospace's IVR services was selected by Ehrhardt Airways to provide fuel efficiency software and analysis to uncover opportunities for fuel savings and measure the effectiveness of fuel efficiency initiatives already in place.
COM DEV, part of Defense & Space and aero, recently launched the launch of our world-leading technology on the European space agencies [indiscernible] 3-aid [ph] satellite. Our systems enable fast reliable connectivity to provide near realtime data from the satellite specialty systems. We continue to be excited about the growth opportunities these businesses bring to Honeywell and look forward to telling you more about our progress.
As some of you may have seen last month, the Honeywell green jet fuel is now being used by United Airlines to power 12,500 flights from LA to San Francisco as part of its efforts to reduce carbon emissions and support energy diversification. Honeywell green jet fuel can replace as much as 50% as petroleum derived jet fuels use in flight without any changes to the aircraft technology while meeting the current ASTM jet fuel specs for flight. Depending on the bio feed stocks, Honeywell green jet fuel can offer a 65% to 85% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions compared with petroleum-based fuels. We have lots of exciting new innovations and initiatives driving growth and margin expansion across the portfolio. Our big wins, capacity expansions and software and connectivity focus drive significant growth. We've got a lot of momentum across the portfolio. Innovation and execution, our seed planting for the future, Great Positions in Good Industries and the power of One Honeywell continue to be differentiators.
So with that, I'll turn it over to Tom."
1340740,328792692,961781,"Honeywell International Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 22, 2016",2016-04-22,"Earnings Calls","Honeywell International Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Dave, and good morning. I'm on Slide 3, which shows the first quarter results. So sales of $9.5 billion increased 1% on a core organic basis. Each of these statements exceeded the sales guidance we provided in January, led by Commercial Aviation,",4529,"Thanks, Dave, and good morning. I'm on Slide 3, which shows the first quarter results. So sales of $9.5 billion increased 1% on a core organic basis. Each of these statements exceeded the sales guidance we provided in January, led by Commercial Aviation, Building Solutions & Distribution and Process Solutions, which I'll talk more about on business slides.
By region, core organic sales mostly declined in the Americas and increased high single-digit in Europe. In our high-growth Europe regions, India grew double digit while in China Airline, air and ACS increased double-digit, partially offset by declines in PMT. On a reported basis, total sales increased 3% as acquisitions more than offset the unfavorable impact of the stronger U.S. dollar and lower pass-through pricing in Resins & Chemicals.
Segment margin was down 60 basis points versus the prior year but up 20 basis points, excluding a dilutive impact of acquisitions. The businesses are driving benefits from HOS Gold, our focus on commercial excellence, new product development and functional transformation while maintaining our investments for growth. I'll talk more about the segment margin in a minute.
Earnings per share of $1.53 was up 9% coming in at the high end of our guidance range. Items below segment profit were favorable on a year-over-year basis. Consistent with our long-term framework, we recorded approximately $40 million of new restructuring projects, partially offsetting the benefit from higher pension income. For the full year, we anticipate that additional restructuring charges will largely offset the incremental pension income, positioning us well for margin expansion.
Noncontrolling interest was also favorable year-over-year as anticipated given the purchase of the remaining 30% stake in UOP Russell. 
On share count, as David mentioned, we repurchased over $1 billion of shares at attractive prices, which brought our weighted average fully diluted share count to approximately 777 million for the quarter. We have been and will continue to be opportunistic when it comes to share repurchases and deploy capital to opportunity that will create the greatest value for our shareholders.
Free cash flow in the quarter of $63 million was down from the first quarter of 2015, driven primarily by the timing of tax payments and higher capital expenditures, offset by better working capital performance. Capital expenditures of almost $200 million in the quarter increased 18% year-over-year. First quarter has historically proven to be our lowest from a cash perspective, and we remain on track to our full year cash guidance of $4.6 billion to $4.8 billion. Overall, we continue to generate strong results in a relatively low-growth environment.
I'm now on Slide 4 to provide more detail on our segment margin expansion. Our operating initiatives continue to drive segment margin growth, led by the deployment of HOS Gold. We generated an 80 basis points operational impairment in the quarter, which compares well with 100-plus basis point improvement for the full year 2015. We have differentiated technologies and a software focus, our supply chains are becoming more lean, our back office continues to get more efficient and our strong collaboration across the organizations to drive down our material costs and indirect spend.
The previously funded restructuring as well as new restructuring actions had made us to continue improving our overall cost position. We were encouraged by the outperformance on the top line in building solutions and distribution and in our commercial aviation OE businesses this quarter. But better the driver as well as the lower UOP petrochemical catalyst sales and lower-than-expected products growth in ACS scanning and productivity solutions business constrained the operational margin improvement to the 80 basis points that you see.
Lower raw materials pass-through pricing in Resins & Chemicals  added 10 basis points. The impact from the pricing dynamics in Resins & Chemicals should be minimal for all of 2016.
The other 3 impacts you see on the slide combined for 150 basis points of margin contraction in the quarter. First, M&A accounted for 80 basis points, primarily due to acquisition accounting and pay-as-you-go costs. The incremental amortization from the deals will be a margin headwind for the rest of the year as anticipated. We're in the midst of integrating 8 acquisitions and are happy to report that each one is performing well and is ahead of our deal financial model. Second, as we previewed in our December outlook call, Aerospace OEM incentives increased by approximately $44 million from 2015, reflecting our continued investment in developing and growing our installed base on the right platforms in the commercial aviation industry. Depending on their nature, the incentives are treated as a reduction to revenue or as a cost. But either way, they reduce segment profit as they incurred.
Third. On foreign exchange as previewed, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar drove our margin -- drove down our margins, principally in Transportation Systems. You'll recall that we're able to hedge our euro earnings at approximately 1.24 in 2015 versus our 2016 euro hedge rate of 1.10.
So put it into perspective, these 3 items accounted for approximately $63 million of headwind in the quarter or roughly $0.06 of earnings per share. In that light, the $0.12 of earnings per share growth for the first quarter certainly stands out. 
I'm now on Slide 5. Summarizing our first quarter segment margin performance versus guidance. We were off [ph] 30 basis points at the midpoint. This chart provides some color on that.
Airline PMT were generally in line with what we guided. In aero, we continue to drive strong productivity improvements, but we did see some impact from the higher-than-planned Commercial OE content. In PMT, we hit the high end of the guidance range. In ACS, we experienced the sales shift. That is lower-than-anticipated ESS sales, including a double-digit decline in security -- or scanning and productivity solutions but higher-than-expected sales in Building Solutions & Distribution.
The adverse margin impact to these sales shifts offset the continued improvements we're seeing across the ACS portfolio from productivity initiatives, commercial excellence and restructuring.
As you'll see later, we continue to maintain our full year margin guidance, which includes an acceleration of restructuring benefits in the second half of the year. This, while absorbing the adverse margin impacts of the M&A accounting, the Aerospace OEM incentives and the strengthening of the U.S. dollar.
Let's turn to Slide 6 with a quick update on some of our recent acquisitions. In 2015, we announced 5 acquisitions aggregating over $5.5 billion in purchase price. These were across all of our SBGs following our consistent qualitative and quantitative methodologies.
We've continued this into 2016 having already announced and closed the 3 additional deals highlighted on this page. Each of these deals allows us to put non-U.S. cash to work and each advances the software content of the Honeywell portfolio.
Starting with Xtralis and RSI Video technologies. Each of these acquisitions has excellent technologies, including video analytics and software that complement and expand our current security entire offerings. Xtralis is a pioneer in very early warning smoke detection technology, which enables customers protect high-value assets such as museums and historical buildings or facilities where continuity is critical such as IP data centers and warehouses. Xtralis is the clear leader in that space.
RSI's advanced motion technology allows our commercial and residential customers to receive intrusion alerts through a live video stream over the ground providing visual verification that an intrusion event has indeed occurred. This verification is legislatively mandated throughout Europe as a means of reducing unnecessary police response to false alarms, and we expect this type of legislation will become more prevalent globally.
Mobile Isis allows us to expand our offerings toward the connected working in sensing and productivity solutions. Mobile Isis cloud platform plot seamlessly in to our customer's ERP system and enables them to develop, deploy and manage the workflow and field service operations through the Movilizer app. Each of these 2016 acquisitions are being integrated into Honeywell right now, and each is tracking ahead of our financial deal model.
Let's move to Slide 7 and discuss the Aerospace results. Sales were up 3% on a core organic basis and above our expectations, driven by better-than-expected growth in the commercial aviation business. Aerospace recently created 1 unified commercial strategic business unit named Commercial Aviation. This organization combines our business and general aviation and our Air Transport and Regional business units to provide a consistent and world-class support required to win and grow our OEM and aftermarket business.
Commercial aviation OE sales increased by 4% on a core organic basis, driven by continued strong engine shipments and increased JetWave satcom sales in Business and General Aviation and higher sales to OEMs in air transport and regional, partially offset by a 6-point headwind from the higher OEM incentives that I previously mentioned. As we mentioned in January, the growth in BGA OE is driven by our HTS 7000 series engine, which has won [ph] 4 of the 5 super midsized business jet platforms.
Commercial aviation aftermarket sales were up 6% on a core organic basis, driven by better-than-expected ATR flight hours and double-digit growth in repair and overhaul activities. On the spears side, we saw an increase in airline spares, partially offset by lower spare sales in other parts of BGA due to the timing of channel provisioning.
In China, both Spears and R&O sales increased double-digit on strong flight hours.
Defense & Space sales declined 2% on a core organic basis, driven by program delays and project timing in our U.S. service businesses. International business, in particular, faced a difficult prior comparison as larger projects were completed. As a reminder, the international defense business grew north of 20% in the first quarter of 2015. Additionally, we closed the COM DEV acquisition. That's the satellite communications business we bought in February, and that integration is progressing nicely.
Transportation Systems sales increased 6% on a core organic basis due to new platform launches and continued volume growth in both gas and diesel-light vehicle applications. On the gas side, we saw double-digit growth in both Europe and China. On a reported basis, TS sales increased 3%, reflecting the stronger U.S. dollar. Aerospace segment margin expanded 70 basis points or 90 basis points excluding the dilutive impact of acquisitions. This was driven by productivity net of inflation and commercial excellence, partially offset by continued investments for growth, including the higher OEM incentives.
Let's turn to the ACS results on Slide 8. ACS sales were up 4% on a core organic basis in the first quarter, above the high end of our guidance. ACS continues to outperform in high-growth regions. Sales in both China and India grew double-digit in the quarter, driven by our connected ACS strategy and the benefit from our ongoing investments for growth. Sales in energy, safety and security to the products businesses were flat on a core organic basis in the first quarter and include a 3 -- a negative 3% or 3-point impact from the 2015 completion of the U.S. Postal Services contract in Sensing & Productivity solutions.
That is excluding security and productivity solutions, the -- I'm sorry, excluding Sensing & Productivity Solutions, the other 3 business units within the S&S were up this quarter on an average of 3%. The momentum continued in security and fire globally with strong growth rates in both residential and commercial markets, coupled with benefit from new product introductions and further penetration in high-growth regions. We expect S&PS to return to growth in the fourth quarter.
Building Solutions and distribution sales were up 11% on a core organic basis, outpacing our expectations. We continue to see strength in the Americas distribution business where sales increased over 15% on both the residential and commercial sides and growth has improved sequentially every quarter since the beginning of 2015. 
In Building Solutions, sales grew mid-single-digit, reflecting strength in both project installation and service businesses. Orders growth was also healthy approaching 20%, with particular strength in the services and energy retrofit businesses. 
We're encouraged by the solid improvement we have seen in our energy portfolio in HBS this quarter. Our selections, though we have chosen in RFP but have not yet booked the order, those selections stand at nearly $500 million and have been growing steadily over the past 18 months. In the past, I described the slow pace of the conversion of this selection pool into orders while we're starting to see some of the acceleration of that conversion. 
Energy orders were up over 350% in the first quarter, and we expect orders growth north of 25% in the second quarter. And for the full year, energy orders should nearly double. This has been driven by sales excellence and a differentiated offering that is leading to multiple awards in an industry that is expected to grow a strong mid-single digits over the next 5 years.
We're also seeing traction in the service business in HPS driven by focused investments in STI. Overall, the HPS backlog increased mid-single digit on an organic basis, driven primarily by growth in Europe and Asia Pacific, and the conversion of backlog is improving. We converted on a number of larger projects in high-growth regions, particularly in India.
The ACS margin rate contracted 140 basis points in the quarter, but was up 10 basis points, excluding a dilutive impact of acquisitions. As I mentioned earlier, the margin expansion was below our expectations, primarily driven by higher project installation and distribution sales, which carry lower margins. ACS continues to benefit from commercial excellence, productivity initiatives and impacts from restructuring. We continue to invest for growth in our connected product offerings and in high-growth regions sales, marketing and engineering resources. As an example, we received great feedback thus far on our second-generation of Lyric products including our water leak and free detector products following our launch in April.
I'm now on Slide 9 with the PMT results. Sales in the quarter were better than expected, primarily driven by strength in Process Solutions of business that continues to outperform its peers in a challenging environment. Process Solutions' sales grew 9% on a core organic basis, driven by double-digit growth in our project businesses and by higher services sales. Conversion of the global megaproject wins and backlog where we serve as the main contractor providing control and safety solutions for large installations ticked up in the first quarter, and we expect this trend to continue throughout 2016.
Orders were down low single digits on a core organic basis but improved in our higher-margin software and service businesses. In particular, we see increased demand for our assurance to the 60 [ph] service partnership offering, which is a multiyear agreement to maintain, support and optimize the performance of Honeywell process control systems.
In UOP, sales were down as expected, driven by lower gas processing, catalysts and equipment sales. Gas processing faced tough prior year comparisons in the first quarter. And while the domestic gas processing environment remains muted, international activity continues to be encouraging. Catalyst demand overall remains strong, but it's not unusual to see variations from quarter-to-quarter as we've highlighted in the past. The first quarter declines were consistent with this trend following strong catalyst shipments in 2015. 
UOP backlog was up low single digits, driven by our catalyst business. Advanced Materials sales were up 11% on a core organic basis, driven by demand for our Solstice low global warming products as well as higher volume in resins and chemicals. The Solstice growth is accelerating even more than we expected, and we continue to build out our capacity to meet the increasing global customer demand. In Resins & Chemicals, the volume favorability was offset somewhat by challenging market conditions.
PMT segment margins were down 90 basis points to 20.6% or down 70 basis points excluding the dilutive impact of acquisitions. The decline was primarily due the lower UOP petrochemical catalyst sales, partially offset by strong improvement in margin rates in HPS and Advanced Materials. PMT benefited from commercial excellence, the favorable impact of raw materials pass-through in Resins & Chemicals and the impact from previous restructuring actions.
I'm now on Slide 10 with a preview of the second quarter. For Honeywell total, we're conservatively planning for sales of $10 billion to $10.2 billion, up 2% to 4% reported or down 2% to flat on a core organic basis. Segment margins are expected to be up 40 to 60 basis points, excluding M&A, or down 10 to up 10 basis points on a reported basis. We see credible drivers to improving sales and margin expansion for the rest of the year, including higher catalyst sales in UOP, higher product sales in ESS and improving segment profit from acquisitions. As onetime M&A related charges paid off. We expect the tax rate to be 26.5%. EPS is expected to be $1.61 to $1.66, up 7% to 10% versus 2015.
Starting with Aerospace. Sales are expected to be flat to up 1% on a reported and core organic basis. In commercial aviation OE, we're expecting sales to be down mid-single digits, driven by the impact of Aerospace OEM incentives. Excluding the OEM incentives, commercial aviation OE is expected to be up low single digit with a ramp-up on key platforms and Air Transport and Regional, partially offset by declines in BGA following significant double-digit growth in the second quarter of 2015 driven by strong engine shipments.
Commercial aviation aftermarket sales are expected to grow mid-single digit again, with an increase in airline spares sales improvement and BGA RMU sales and higher repair and overhaul activity.
ATR flight hours continue to be strong are also delivering higher satcom and other software upgrades to enhance our growth. We're seeing good traction from customers on our JetWave onboard connectivity terminal, which is currently undergoing certification testing for 26 different aircraft models. 
Defense & Space sales are expected to be roughly flat with higher product sales in the U.S. government, offset by a tough prior year comparisons in the international business as larger projects are completed and by continued softness in the U.S. services business.
In Transportation Systems, sales are expected to be up low single digit, with continued strong growth in light vehicle gas applications, partially offset by slower growth in diesel based on the timing of new launches. As for the Aerospace margin rates, we expect a reported increase of 60 to 80 basis point, in line with the first quarter performance; and an increase of 80 to 100 basis points, excluding the dilutive impact of M&A.
ACS sales are expected to be down 1% to up 1% on a core organic basis or up 9% to 11% reported, driven by the addition of Elster and the 3 acquisitions we announced and closed in the first quarter. We expect ESS sales growth to be similar in the first quarter on a core organic basis, as continued momentum in our security and fire businesses and in our key high-growth regions is more than offset by the declines we highlighted in S&PS. S&PS is expected to return to growth in the fourth quarter where we lack the comparisons to periods containing the completed U.S. postal service contract. 
In Building Solutions and distribution, we're expecting low single-digit core organic growth driven primarily by continued strength in the America's distribution business and the recent agreements in the HVS orders and backlog.
Excluding a dilutive impact from M&A, the ACS margin rate is expected to improve 50 to 70 basis points, driven by commercial excellence, continued productivity and the benefits of restructuring. ACS's reported segment margin rate in the second quarter is expected to be down 20 basis points to flat.
In PMT, sales are expected to be down 3% to 4% on both the reported and core organic basis. UOP sales are expected to improve sequentially in the quarter but will still be down double digit on a year-over-year basis, driven primarily by continued declines in gas processing, particularly in the U.S., and the timing of catalyst shipments.
Based on our stable UOP backlog and strong anticipated second quarter orders, we expect the catalyst business growth rates to improve in the second half of the year. HPS sales are expected to be up low single digit on a core organic basis, driven by continued conversion of global megaprojects and higher software and services sales, partially offset by declines in sales of field instrumentation product.
Advanced Materials sales are expected to be up low single digit, driven by strength in Fluorine Products, Solstice sales and improving specialty products lines, partially offset by the aforementioned pricing conditions in Resins & Chemicals.
The PMT reported segment margin rate is expected to be down 10 to 30 basis points and down 20 basis points to flat excluding a dilutive impact of M&A. And this is driven by strong productivity net of inflation and the favorable margin rate impact of the raw materials pass-through pricing in Resins & Chemicals.
Let's move to Slide 11 to discuss what to expect for the rest of 2016. Our planning framework for 2016 contemplates a second half organic -- core organic sales guide of approximately 2%, and our full year guidance remains at up 1% to 2%. There are a few drivers, which we expect will contribute to this modest second half core organic sales growth acceleration. 
We expect aero and ACS growth rates in the second half to be similar to the first half. So in Aerospace, we're expecting similar strong growth in aftermarket sales and for modest pickups in our Defense & Space and TS businesses to offset modest declines in the Commercial OE business. We'll see tougher comps in the second half of this year across commercial aviation, which as you'll recall, grew 5 single digit on a core organic basis in the second half of 2015.
At ACS, we expect S&PS business to return to growth in the fourth quarter as we lap the tough comps stemming from the completion of the U.S. Postal Service contract. We also continue to see traction on our new product investments, including the award-winning water leak detector part of the Lyric 2.0 suite of products. This, together with ACS's continued strong performance in high-growth regions particularly China and India, will support continued modest second half growth.
The majority of the improvement in the second half growth is expected to be driven by PMT. Our UOP business was down significantly in the first quarter as we discussed. We expect a substantial improvement in catalyst sales as shipments accelerate on robust demand with the refining and petrochemical segments. 
We also expect improvement in the other UOP businesses. UOP's backlog is healthy, up 2% at the end of the first quarter, driven by the nearly $1 billion in fourth quarter orders of -- fourth quarter orders in 2015, and we're expecting a robust orders performance again in the second quarter.
So with that, let's move to our full year 2016 guidance summary on Slide 12. As Dave mentioned earlier, we're raising the low end of the full year EPS guide by $0.10 with a new range of $6.55 to $6.70, up 7% to 10% over the prior year. There's some minor puts and takes among the segments from the guidance we provided in March. But overall, another very strong year expected for Honeywell in 2016. 
As we look at Honeywell in total, we expect 1% to 2% core organic sales growth, and total sales are now expected to be between $40.3 billion and $40.9 billion, up 4% to 6% on a repeated basis. This increase in reported sales reflect the incremental sales from the 3 new acquisition and an update to our foreign currency assumptions. From a sales perspective, we're now planning the euro rate at approximately 1 10 for the remainder of 2016, roughly in line with the prior year and up from our previous assumption of the euro at parity with the U.S. dollar. This change in assumption, of course, does not impact the expected core organic growth rate.
Segment margin expansion is expected to be up 10 to 50 basis points or 80 to 110 basis points, excluding the dilutive impact at M&A, driven by commercial excellence, restructuring benefits and the continued proactive cost management. The low segment profit our restructuring and other expenses remain stable and in line with our previous guidance, and we still expect the full year tax rate to be 26.5%.
Our pension OPEB income is expected to be approximately $100 million higher than we anticipated in December due to lower service and interest costs as a result of our adoption to stock rate methodology for our pension plans in the U.S. and U.K. We continue to expect our share count for the full year to be approximately 774 million shares or approximately 2% lower than the 2015 weighted average share count of 789 million shares. We plan to offset any incremental dilution for new exercises over the course of the year to keep the share count at roughly 774 million.
We've already spent over $1 billion in share repurchases in the quarter, where our strategy to keep our share count flat over the long term remains. We will continue to be optimistic in our approach as the market allows. 
As I mentioned earlier, we expect free cash flow to be in the range of $4.6 billion to $4.8 billion, up 5% to 10% from 2015 with CapEx investments roughly flat to 2015 at approximately $1.1 billion. This will drive free cash flow conversion of approximately 90% for the full year.
And as I said, as a result of our strong first quarter performance and the benefit from lower share count, we're raising the low end of our 2016 earnings guidance by $0.10 at this time.
Let's move to Slide 16 for a quick summary before turning it back to Mark for Q&A. Once again, we've demonstrated we can deliver on our earnings commitments, hitting the high end of our guidance range even in a slow-growth environment. A big reminder of the value of our diversified and balanced portfolio and the strength of the Honeywell Operating System. Sales growth was better than anticipated in the quarter, and we continue to invest for future growth in new products and technology, high ROI CapEx and our presence in high-growth regions. We're also continuing to invest in and execute on process improvements and restructuring. And we again put to work a sizable amounts of shareowner capital, which will pave the way for future earnings and cash growth.
We have confidence in our full year guidance based on the tenets of supporting growth, being cautious on sales, planning costs and spending conservatively and continued seed planting. So while 2016 isn't the easiest economic environment, we are confident we will continue outperforming our peers and performing well for our shareholders.
As always, we're also thinking about what's beyond 2016. Each of our HOS Gold enterprise is hard at work focusing on breakthrough goals and profitable growth that we expect to drive earnings outperformance through our Five-Year Plan and beyond. We look forward to sharing more over the course of year.
With that, Mark, let's move to Q&A."

So you're right, those will not be utilized for the rest of the year, but that was already contemplated in our organic guidance that we have given you. So if you look at on that basis for the first quarter, we certainly did have the productivity impacts that we felt we were going to have. We had good material cost productivity, good performance on indirects, and we actually had good performance in the commercial side. The issue was what Dave highlighted. I mean, you had more sales in distribution, more sales of Building Solutions product. I mean, 17% up in our Distribution business. 7% up in Building Solutions. And we also had in S&PS a little bit of unfavorability beyond the Postal Service contract we talked about. A little bit of channels softness and inventory shifts. We're keeping our eye on that as well. But those are the puts and takes. As we've said, second quarter, we expect to snap back to 50 to 70 basis points of expansion. We'll get the productivity.

And hopefully, the first quarter performance continues on organic growth, but we hate like hell to count on it, not have it happen and rather have it be the other way around."

As I'm sure you've seen by now, Honeywell delivered another strong quarter to kick off 2016. EPS of $1.53, increased 9% coming in at the high end of our guidance range; sales of $9.5 billion were up 1% on a core organic basis, abov",963,"Good morning, everyone. As I'm sure you've seen by now, Honeywell delivered another strong quarter to kick off 2016. EPS of $1.53, increased 9% coming in at the high end of our guidance range; sales of $9.5 billion were up 1% on a core organic basis, above the high end of our sales guidance.
We outperformed in sale growth accelerate in Aerospace Commercial Aftermarket and Transportation Systems, in our residential and commercial and China businesses within ACS. And in Process Solutions and Fluorine Products in PMT. Excluding the dilutive impact of M&A, segment margin expanded 20 basis points in the quarter to 18.9%. We generated significant sustainable productivity in the quarter. The Honeywell user experience is driving new products at higher margins. Our factories and sourcing organizations continue to mature, and we continue to re-engineer our products to make them easier and less expensive to manufacture.
HOS Gold and our key process initiatives that generated their productivity allowed us to overcome previously discussed significant headwinds in segment profit. These included over $40 million of additional Aerospace OEM incentives, additional depreciation stemming from our ramp-up in high ROI CapEx, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar and difficult comparisons at UOP and Sensing & Productivity Solutions, which Tom will take you through further.
Our segment margin rate was slightly lower than our guidance range, primarily due to a combination of higher-than-expected sales of lower-margin products, like in BSD and Commercial Aviation OE, and lower sales of higher-margin products, like in ESS and UOP catalysts. We still expect to be within our segment margin guidance range for the full year as sales growth modestly improves in the second half of the year, basically just from the absence of declines in UOP that we encounter in the first half. We will, of course, continue with our disciplined cost controls, focus on commercial excellence and execution of previously funded restructuring actions. Our strong stack and the momentum we see in parts of the portfolio allow us to raise the low end of our 2016 full year earnings guidance to a new range of $6.55 to $6.70 or up 7% to 10% year-over-year.
Our planning framework has not changed. We will support growth wherever we have it to drive outperformance. We'll be cautious in our sales planning. We will continue to plan our costs and spending conservatively, ensuring we remain flexible as a company. And we'll maintain our seed planting investments for the future, supported by a robust pipeline of funded restructuring projects and continued investments in R&D.
In the second quarter, we expect EPS growth of 7% to 10%, in line with the full year range. There's a number of exciting things that are happening across the company, I'd like to spend a moment on here. Earlier this month, we appointed Darius Adamczyk to the newly created role of President and Chief Operating Officer reporting to me. In this role, he will drive continued profitable growth of our operating businesses through HOS Gold breakthrough strategies, and advanced software offerings that complement Honeywell's diverse technology portfolio. Honeywell remain very active on the capital allocation front in this quarter. We opportunistically repurchased over $1 billion of Honeywell shares at a weighted average price of approximately $104, and we deployed another $1 billion to acquisitions.
We announced and closed 3 deals in ACS, Xtralis and RSI video technologies in security and fire and Movilizer in Sensing & Productivity Solutions. And as we discussed in January, we acquired the remaining 30% stake in UOP Russell, a global leader in modular gas processing technology and equipment. Each acquisition brings differentiated technology and a software focus to drive new growth and greater profitability, while building on our great positions in good industries.
Our acquisitions across the portfolio last year that bolster our connectivity in software offerings are already paying dividends with new wins announced by Elster, Aviaso and COM DEV. In excess, one of the largest multi-utility distribution system operators in the Netherlands, selected Honeywell outfit to deliver more than 1 million smart electricity meters over the next 5 years as part of the country's efforts to meet European Union energy efficiency goals. Aerospace's Aviaso business was selected by Etihad Airways to provide fuel efficiency software and analysis to uncover opportunities for fuel savings, and measure the effectiveness of fuel efficiency initiatives already in place.
COM DEV, part of Defense & Space in aero, recently announced the launch of our world-leading ferrite technology on the European Space Agency's Sentinel-3A satellite. Our systems enable fast, reliable connectivity to provide near real-time data from the satellite specimen systems. We continue to be excited about the growth opportunities these businesses bring to Honeywell, and look forward to telling you more about our progress.
As some of you may have seen last month that the Honeywell Green Jet Fuel is now being used by United Airlines to power 12,500 flights from LA to San Francisco as part of its efforts to reduce carbon emissions and support energy diversification. Honeywell Green Jet Fuel can replace as much as 50% as petroleum-derived jet fuel used in flight without any changes to the aircraft technology, while meeting the current ASTM jet fuel specs for flight. Depending on the bio feedstock, Honeywell Green Jet Fuel can offer a 65% to 85% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions compared with petroleum-based fuels. We have lots of exciting new innovations and initiatives driving growth and margin expansion across the portfolio. Our big wins, capacity expansions and software and connectivity focus drive significant growth. We've got a lot of momentum across the portfolio. Innovation and execution, our seed planting for the future, Great Positions in Good Industries and the power of One Honeywell continue to be differentiators.
So with that, I'll turn it over to Tom."
1340740,328792692,961982,"Honeywell International Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 22, 2016",2016-04-22,"Earnings Calls","Honeywell International Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Dave, and good morning. I'm on Slide 3, which shows the first quarter results. So sales of $9.5 billion, increased 1% on a core organic basis. Each of the segments exceeded the sales guidance we provided in January, led by Commercial Aviation, Bui",4526,"Thanks, Dave, and good morning. I'm on Slide 3, which shows the first quarter results. So sales of $9.5 billion, increased 1% on a core organic basis. Each of the segments exceeded the sales guidance we provided in January, led by Commercial Aviation, Building Solutions & Distribution and Process Solutions, which I'll talk more about on business slides.
By region, core organic sales mostly declined in the Americas and increased high single digit in Europe. In our high-growth regions; India grew double digit, while in China, aero and ACS increased double-digit, partially offset by declines in PMT. On a reported basis, total sales increased 3% as acquisitions more than offset the unfavorable impact of the stronger U.S. dollar and lower pass-through pricing in Resins & Chemicals.
Segment margin was down 60 basis points versus the prior year, but up 20 basis points, excluding a dilutive impact of acquisitions. The businesses are driving benefits from HOS Gold, our focus on commercial excellence, new product development and functional transformation, while maintaining our investments for growth. I'll talk more about the segment margin in a minute.
Earnings per share of $1.53 was up 9% coming in at the high end of our guidance range. Items below segment profit were favorable on a year-over-year basis. Consistent with our long-term framework, we recorded approximately $40 million of new restructuring projects, partially offsetting the benefit from higher pension income. For the full year, we anticipate that additional restructuring charges will largely offset the incremental pension income, positioning us well for margin expansion.
Noncontrolling interest was also favorable year-over-year, as anticipated, given the purchase of the remaining 30% stake in UOP Russell. 
On share count, as Dave mentioned, we repurchased over $1 billion of shares at attractive prices, which brought our weighted average fully diluted share count to approximately 777 million for the quarter. We have been, and we'll continue to be opportunistic when it comes to share repurchases and deploy capital to opportunity that will create the greatest value for our shareholders.
Free cash flow in the quarter of $63 million was down from the first quarter of 2015, driven primarily by the timing of tax payments and higher capital expenditures, offset by better working capital performance. Capital expenditures of almost $200 million in the quarter increased 18% year-over-year. First quarter has historically proven to be our lowest from a cash perspective, and we'll remain on track to our full year cash guidance of $4.6 billion to $4.8 billion. Overall, we continue to generate strong results in a relatively low-growth environment.
I'm now on Slide 4 to provide more detail on our segment margin expansion. Our operating initiatives continue to drive segment margin growth, led by the deployment of HOS Gold. We generated an 80 basis point operational improvement in quarter, which compares well with 100-plus basis point improvement for the full year 2015. We have differentiated technologies and a software focus. Our supply chains are becoming more lean. Our back office continues to get more efficient, and their strong collaboration across the organization to drive down our material costs and indirect spend.
The previously funded restructuring as well as new restructuring actions that have made us to continue improving our overall cost position. We were encouraged by the outperformance on the top line in Building Solutions & Distribution and in our Commercial Aviation OE businesses this quarter, but better overdrive as well as the lower UOP petrochemical catalyst sales and lower-than-expected products growth in ACS Scanning & Productivity Solutions business constrained the operational margin improvement to the 80 basis points that you see.
Lower raw materials pass-through pricing in Resins & Chemicals added 10 basis points. The impact from the pricing dynamics in Resins & Chemicals should be minimal for all of 2016.
The other 3 impacts you see on the slide combine for 150 basis points of margin contraction in the quarter. First, M&A accounted for 80 basis points, primarily due to acquisition accounting and pay-as-you-go costs. The incremental amortization from the deals will be a margin headwind for the rest of the year as anticipated. We're in the midst of integrating 8 acquisitions and are happy to report that each one is performing well, and is ahead of our deal financial model. Second, as we previewed on our December outlook call, Aerospace OEM incentives increased by approximately $44 million from 2015, reflecting our continued investment in developing and growing our installed base on the right platforms in the Commercial Aviation industry. Depending on their nature, the incentives are treated as a reduction to revenue or as a cost. But either way, they reduce segment profit as they are incurred.
Third, on foreign exchange, as previewed, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar drove our margin -- drove down our margins, principally in Transportation Systems. You'll recall that we're able to hedge our euro earnings at approximately 1.24 in 2015 versus our 2016 euro hedge rate of 1.10.
So putting into perspective, these 3 items accounted for approximately $63 million of headwind in the quarter or roughly $0.06 of earnings per share. In that light, the $0.12 of earnings per share growth for the first quarter certainly stands out. 
I'm now on Slide 5, summarizing our first quarter segment margin performance versus guidance. We were off 30 basis points at the midpoint. This chart provides some color on that.
Aero and PMT were generally in line with what we guided. In aero, we continue to drive strong productivity improvements, but we did see some impact from the higher-than-planned Commercial OE content. In PMT, we hit the high end of the guidance range. In ACS, we experienced the sales shift. That is lower-than-anticipated ESS sales, including a double-digit decline in security -- Scanning & Productivity Solutions, but higher-than-expected sales in Building Solutions & Distribution.
The adverse margin impact to these sales shifts offset the continued improvements we're seeing across the ACS portfolio from productivity initiatives, commercial excellence and restructuring.
As you'll see later, we continue to maintain our full year margin guidance, which includes an acceleration of restructuring benefits in the second half of the year. This, while absorbing the adverse margin impacts of the M&A accounting, the Aerospace OEM incentives and the strengthening of U.S. dollar.
Let's turn to Slide 6 with a quick update on some of our recent acquisitions. In 2015, we announced 5 acquisitions aggregating over $5.5 billion in purchase price. These were across all of our SBGs, following our consistent qualitative and quantitative methodologies.
We've continued this into 2016 having already announced and closed the 3 additional deals highlighted on this page. Each of these deals allows us to put non-U.S. cash to work and each advances the software content in the Honeywell portfolio.
Starting with Xtralis and RSI Video technologies. Each of these acquisitions has excellent technologies, including video analytics and software that complement and expand our current security n-tier offerings. Xtralis is a pioneer in very early warning smoke detection technology, which enables customers to protect high-value assets, such as museums and historical buildings, or facilities where continuity is critical, such as IP data centers and warehouses. Xtralis is the clear leader in that space.
RSI's advanced motion technology allows our commercial and residential customers to receive intrusion alerts through a live video stream over the cloud providing visual verification that an intrusion event has indeed occurred. This verification is legislatively mandated throughout Europe as a means of reducing unnecessary police response to false alarms, and we expect this type of legislation will become more prevalent globally.
Movilizer allows us to expand our offerings through the Connected Woker in Sensing and Productivity Solutions. Movilizer's cloud platform plug seamlessly into our customer's ERP systems and enable them to develop, deploy and manage their workflow and field service operations through the Movilizer app. Each of these 2016 acquisitions are being integrated into Honeywell right now and each is tracking ahead of our financial deal model.
Let's move to Slide 7 and discuss the Aerospace results. Sales were up 3% on a core organic basis and above our expectations, driven by better-than-expected growth in the Commercial Aviation business. Aerospace recently created one unified commercial strategic business unit named, Commercial Aviation. This organization combines our business and general aviation and our Air Transport and Regional business units to provide the consistent and world-class support required to win and grow our OEM and Aftermarket business.
Commercial Aviation OE sales increased by 4% on a core organic basis, driven by continued strong engine shipments and increased JetWave satcom sales in Business and General Aviation and higher sales to OEMs in air transport and regional, partially offset by a 6-point headwind from the higher OEM incentives that I previously mentioned. As we mentioned in January, the growth in BGA OE is driven by our HTF7000 series engine, which has won 4 of the 5 super midsized business jet platforms.
Commercial Aviation Aftermarket sales were up 6% on a core organic basis, driven by better-than-expected ATR flight hours and double-digit growth in Repair & Overhaul activities. On the spares side, we saw an increase in airline spares, partially offset by lower spare sales in other parts of BGA due to the timing of channel provisioning.
In China, both spares and R&O sales increased double digit on strong flight hours.
Defense & Space sales declined 2% on a core organic basis, driven by program delays and project timing in our U.S. service businesses. International business, in particular, faced a difficult prior comparison as larger projects were completed. As a reminder, the international defense business grew north of 20% in the first quarter of 2015. Additionally, we closed the COM DEV acquisition. That's the satellite communications business we bought in February, and that integration is progressing nicely.
Transportation System sales increased 6% on a core organic basis due to the new platform launches and continued volume growth in both gas and diesel light vehicle applications. On the gas side, we saw double-digit growth in both Europe and China. On a reported basis, TS sales increased 3%, reflecting the stronger U.S. dollar. Aerospace segment margin expanded 70 basis points or 90 basis points, excluding dilutive impact of acquisitions. This was driven by productivity net of inflation and commercial excellence, partially offset by continued investments for growth, including the higher OEM incentives.
Let's turn to the ACS results on Slide 8. ACS sales were up 4% on a core organic basis in the first quarter, above the high end of our guidance. ACS continues to outperform in high-growth regions. Sales in both China and India grew double-digit in the quarter, driven by our connected ACS strategy and the benefits from our ongoing investments for growth. Sales in energy, safety and security to the products businesses were flat on a core organic basis in the first quarter and include a 3 -- a negative 3% or 3-point impact from the 2015 completion of the U.S. Postal Services contract in Sensing & Productivity Solutions.
That is excluding security and productivity solutions, the -- I'm sorry, excluding Sensing & Productivity Solutions, the other 3 business units within [indiscernible] were up this quarter on an average of 3%. The momentum continued in security and fire globally with strong growth rates in both residential and commercial markets, coupled with the benefit from new product introductions and further penetration in high-growth regions. We expect S&PS to return to growth in the fourth quarter.
Building Solutions & Distribution sales were up 11% on a core organic basis, outpacing our expectations. We continue to see strength in the Americas distribution business where sales increased over 15% on both the residential and commercial sides and growth has improved sequentially every quarter since the beginning of 2015. 
In Building Solutions, sales grew mid-single digit, reflecting strength in both project installation and service businesses. Orders growth was also healthy approaching 20%, with particular strength in the services and energy retrofit businesses. 
We're encouraged by the solid improvements we have seen in our energy portfolio in HPS this quarter. Our selections, though we have chosen in an RFP [ph], but have not yet booked the order, those selections stand at nearly $500 million and have been growing steadily over the past 18 months. In the past, I described the slow pace of the conversion of this selection pool into orders, while we're starting to see some of the acceleration of that conversion. 
Energy orders were up over 350% in the first quarter, and we expect orders growth north of 25% in the second quarter. And for the full year, energy orders should nearly double. This has been driven by sales excellence and a differentiated offering that is leading to multiple awards in an industry that is expected to grow at strong mid-single digits over the next 5 years.
We're also seeing traction in the service business in HPS, driven by focused investments in FBI [ph]. Overall, the HPS backlog increased mid-single digit on an organic basis, driven primarily by growth in Europe and Asia Pacific, and the conversion of backlog is improving. We converted on a number of larger projects in high-growth regions, particularly in India.
The ACS margin rate contracted 140 basis points in the quarter, but was up 10 basis points, excluding a dilutive impact of acquisitions. As I mentioned earlier, the margin expansion was below our expectations, primarily driven by higher project installation and distribution sales, which carry lower margins. ACS continues to benefit from commercial excellence, productivity initiatives and impacts from restructuring. We continue to invest for growth in our connected product offerings and in high-growth regions sales, marketing and engineering resources. As an example, we've received great feedback thus far on our second-generation of Lyric products, including our water leak and freeze detector products following our launch in April.
I'm now on Slide 9 with the PMT results. Sales in the quarter were better than expected, primarily driven by strength in Process Solutions, the business that continues to outperform its peers in a challenging environment. Process Solutions' sales grew 9% on a core organic basis, driven by double-digit growth in our project businesses and by higher services sales. Conversion of the global megaproject wins and backlog, where we serve as the main contractor providing control and safety solutions for large installations, picked up in the first quarter, and we expect this trend to continue throughout 2016.
Orders were down low single digits on a core organic basis, but improved in our higher-margin software and service businesses. In particular, we see increased demand for our assurance to the 60 service partnership offering, which is a multi-year agreement to maintain, support and optimize the performance of Honeywell process control systems.
In UOP, sales were down as expected, driven by lower gas processing, catalysts and equipment sales. Gas processing faced tough prior year comparisons in the first quarter. And while the domestic gas processing environment remains muted, international activity continues to be encouraging. Catalyst demand overall remains strong, but it's not unusual to see variations from quarter-to-quarter as we've highlighted in the past. The first quarter declines were consistent with this trend following strong catalyst shipments in 2015. 
UOP's backlog was up low single digits, driven by our catalyst business. Advanced Materials sales were up 11% on a core organic basis, driven by demand for our Solstice low-global-warming products as well as higher volume in Resins & Chemicals. The Solstice growth is accelerating even more than we had expected, and we continue to build out our capacity to meet the increasing global customer demand. In Resins & Chemicals, the volume favorability was offset somewhat by challenging market conditions.
PMT segment margins were down 90 basis points to 20.6% or down 70 basis points excluding the dilutive impact of acquisitions. The decline was primarily due to lower UOP petrochemical catalyst sales, partially offset by strong improvements in margin rates in HPS and Advanced Materials. PMT benefited from commercial excellence with favorable impact of raw materials pass-through in Resins & Chemicals and the impact from previous restructuring actions.
I'm now on Slide 10 with a preview of the second quarter. For Honeywell total, we're conservatively planning for sales of $10 billion to $10.2 billion, up 2% to 4% reported or down 2% to flat on a core organic basis. Segment margins are expected to be up 40 to 60 basis points, excluding M&A, or down 10 to up 10 basis points on a reported basis. We see credible drivers to improving sales and margin expansion for the rest of the year, including higher catalyst sales in UOP, higher product sales in ESS and improving segment profit from acquisitions, as onetime M&A related charges taper off. We expect the tax rate to be 26.5%. EPS is expected to be $1.61 to $1.66, up 7% to 10% versus 2015.
Starting with Aerospace. Sales are expected to be flat to up 1% on a reported and core organic basis. In Commercial Aviation OE, we're expecting sales to be down mid-single digit, driven by the impact of Aerospace OEM incentives. Excluding the OEM incentives, Commercial Aviation OE is expected to be up low single digit with a ramp-up on key platforms in Air Transport and Regional, partially offset by declines in BGA following significant double-digit growth in the second quarter of 2015, driven by strong engine shipments.
Commercial Aviation Aftermarket sales are expected to grow mid-single digit, again, with an increase in airline spares sales, improvement in BGA RMU sales and higher Repair & Overhaul activity.
ATR flight hours continue to be strong, are also delivering higher satcom and other software upgrades to enhance our growth. We're seeing good traction from customers on our JetWave onboard connectivity terminal, which is currently undergoing certification testing for 26 different aircraft models. 
Defense & Space sales are expected to be roughly flat with higher product sales, U.S. government offset by a tough prior year comparisons in the international business as larger projects are completed and by continued softness in the U.S. services business.
In Transportation Systems, sales are expected to be up low single digit, with continued strong growth in light vehicle gas applications, partially offset by slower growth in diesel, based on the timing of new launches. As for the Aerospace margin rates, we expect a reported increase of 60 to 80 basis points, in line with the first quarter performance, and an increase of 80 to 100 basis points, excluding the dilutive impact of M&A.
ACS sales are expected to be down 1% to up 1% on a core organic basis or up 9% to 11% reported, driven by the addition of Elster and the 3 acquisitions we announced and closed in the first quarter. We expect ESS sales growth to be similar in the first quarter on a core organic basis as we continue momentum in our security and fire businesses, and in our key high-growth regions is more than offset by the declines we highlighted in S&PS. S&PS is expected to return to growth in the fourth quarter where we lack the comparisons to periods containing the completed U.S. Postal Service contract. 
In Building Solutions & Distribution, we're expecting low single-digit core organic growth, driven primarily by continued strength in the America's distribution business and a recent improvements in the HPS orders and backlog.
Excluding a dilutive impact from M&A, the ACS margin rate is expected to improve 50 to 70 basis points, driven by commercial excellence, continued productivity and the benefits of restructuring. ACS's reported segment margin rate in the second quarter is expected to be down 20 basis points to flat.
In PMT, sales are expected to be down 3% to 4% on both the reported and core organic basis. UOP sales are expected to improve sequentially in the quarter, but will still be down double digit on a year-over-year basis, driven primarily by continued declines in gas processing, particularly in the U.S., and the timing of catalyst shipments.
Based on our stable UOP backlog and strong anticipated second quarter orders, we expect the catalyst business growth rates to improve in the second half of the year. HPS sales are expected to be up low single digit on a core organic basis, driven by continued conversion of global megaprojects and higher software and services sales, partially offset by declines in sales of field instrumentation products.
Advanced Materials sales are expected to be of low single digit, driven by strength in Fluorine Products, Solstice sales and improving specialty products lines, partially offset by the aforementioned pricing conditions in Resins & Chemicals.
The PMT reported segment margin rate is expected to be down 10 to 30 basis points and down 20 basis points to flat, excluding the dilutive impact of M&A. And this is driven by strong productivity net of inflation and the favorable margin rate impact of the raw materials pass-through pricing in Resins & Chemicals.
Let's move to Slide 11 to discuss what to expect for the rest of 2016. Our planning framework for 2016 contemplates a second half organic -- core organic sales guide of approximately 2%, and our full year guidance remains at up 1% to 2%. There are few drivers, which we expect, will contribute to this modest second half core organic sales growth acceleration. 
We expect aero and ACS growth rates in the second half to be similar to the first half. So in Aerospace, we're expecting similar strong growth in aftermarket sales and for modest pickups in our Defense & Space and TS businesses to offset modest declines in the Commercial OE business. We'll see tougher comps in the second half of this year across commercial aviation OE, which as you'll recall, grew 5 single digit on a core organic basis in the second half of 2015.
At ACS, we expect S&PS business to return to growth in the fourth quarter as we lap the tough comps stemming from the completion of the U.S. Postal Service contract. We also continue to see traction on our new product investments, including the award-winning water leak detector part of the Lyric 2.0 suite of products. This, together with ACS' continued strong performance in high-growth regions, particularly China and India, will support continued modest second half growth.
The majority of the improvement in the second half growth is expected to be driven by PMT. Our UOP business was down significantly in the first quarter, as we discussed. We expect a substantial improvement in catalyst sales as shipments accelerate on robust demand with the refining and petrochemical segments. We also expect improvement in the other UOP businesses. UOP's backlog is healthy, up 2% at the end of the first quarter, driven by the nearly $1 billion in fourth quarter orders of -- fourth quarter orders in 2015, and we're expecting robust orders performance again in the second quarter.
So with that, let's move to our full year 2016 guidance summary on Slide 12. As Dave mentioned earlier, we're raising the low end of the full year EPS guide by $0.10 with a new range of $6.55 to $6.70, up 7% to 10% over the prior year. There's some minor puts and takes among the segments from the guidance we provided in March, but overall, another very strong year expected for Honeywell in 2016. 
As we look at Honeywell in total, we expect 1% to 2% core organic sales growth, and total sales are now expected to be between $40.3 billion and $40.9 billion, up 4% to 6% on a reported basis. This increase in the reported sales reflect the incremental sales from the 3 new acquisition and an update to our foreign currency assumptions. From a sales perspective, we're now planning the euro rate at approximately 1 10 for the remainder of 2016, roughly in line with the prior year and up from our previous assumption of the euro at parity with the U.S. dollar. This change in assumption, of course, does not impact the expected core organic growth rate.
Segment margin expansion is expected to be up 10 to 50 basis points or 80 to 110 basis points, excluding the dilutive impact of M&A, driven by commercial excellence, restructuring benefits and the continued proactive cost management. Below segment profit, our restructuring and other expenses remain stable and in line with our previous guidance, and we still expect the full year tax rate to be 26.5%.
Our pension OPEB income is expected to be approximately $100 million higher than we anticipated in December due to lower service and interest cost as a result of our adoption to stock rate methodology for our pension plans in the U.S. and U.K. We continue to expect our share count for the full year to be approximately 774 million shares or approximately 2% lower than the 2015 weighted average share count of 789 million shares. We plan to offset any incremental dilution for new exercises over the course of the year to keep the share count at roughly 774 million.  We've already spent over $1 billion in share repurchases in the quarter, where our strategy to keep our share count flat over the long term remains. We will continue to be opportunistic in our approach as the market allows. 
As I mentioned earlier, we expect free cash flow to be in the range of $4.6 billion to $4.8 billion, up 5% to 10% from 2015 with CapEx investments roughly flat to 2015 at approximately $1.1 billion. This will drive free cash flow conversion of approximately 90% for the full year.  And as I said, as a result of our strong first quarter performance and the benefit from lower share count, we're raising the low end of our 2016 earnings guidance by $0.10 at this time.
Let's move to Slide 16 for a quick summary before turning it back to Mark for Q&A. Once again, we've demonstrated we can deliver on our earnings commitments, hitting the high end of our guidance range even in a slow-growth environment, a big reminder of the value of our diversified and balanced portfolio and the strength of the Honeywell Operating System. Sales growth was better than anticipated in the quarter, and we continue to invest for future growth in new products and technologies, high ROI CapEx and our presence in high-growth regions. We're also continuing to invest in and execute on process improvements and restructuring, and we again put to work a sizable amount of shareowner capital, which will pave the way for future earnings and cash growth. We have confidence in our full year guidance based on the tenets of supporting growth, being cautious on sales, planning costs and spending conservatively and continued seed planting. So while 2016 isn't the easiest economic environment, we are confident we will continue outperforming our peers and performing well for our shareholders.
As always, we're also thinking about what's beyond 2016. Each of our HOS Gold enterprise is at -- are hard at work focusing on breakthrough goals and profitable growth that we expect will drive earnings outperformance through our Five-Year Plan and beyond. We look forward to sharing more over the course of year.
With that, Mark, let's move to Q&A."

So you're right. Those will not be with us for the rest of the year, but that was already contemplated in our organic guidance that we have given you. So if you look at it on that basis for the first quarter, we certainly did have the productivity impacts that we felt we were going to have. But with good material cost productivity, good performance on indirects, and we actually had good performance on the commercial side. The issue was what Dave highlighted. I mean, we had more sales in distribution, more sales of Building Solutions product. I mean, 17% up in our Distribution business, 7% up in Building Solution. And we also had in S&PS a little bit of unfavorability beyond the Postal Service contract that we talk about. A little bit of channel softness and inventory shifts. We're keeping our eye on that as well, so those are the puts and takes. As we said, second quarter, we expect to snap back to 50 to 70 basis points of expansion. We'll get the productivity. I don't think the sales -- we're not planning for the -- market of sales growth in BSD, as we had in the first quarter, and we'll get more restructuring benefit as we move along.

But right now, we're going to stay with this whole idea that this is a slow-growth global environment, and it's just the smart way to plan. And you see that reflected in how we are forecasting the second quarter and how we're forecasting the total year. I just don't think there's any percentage right now on being bullish about it. If it happens, great. I think there's a greater chance it happens than there is -- than it doesn't. But that being said, I don't see any percentage in being bullish about it."

As I'm sure you've seen by now, Honeywell delivered another strong quarter to kick off 2016. EPS of $1.53, increased 9% coming in at the high end of our guidance range; sales of $9.5 billion were up 1% on a core organic basis, abov",965,"Good morning, everyone. As I'm sure you've seen by now, Honeywell delivered another strong quarter to kick off 2016. EPS of $1.53, increased 9% coming in at the high end of our guidance range; sales of $9.5 billion were up 1% on a core organic basis, above the high end of our sales guidance.
We outperformed and saw growth accelerate in the Aerospace Commercial Aftermarket and Transportation Systems, in our residential and commercial and China businesses within ACS and in Process Solutions and Fluorine Products in PMT. Excluding the dilutive impact of M&A, segment margin expanded 20 basis points in the quarter to 18.9%. We generated significant sustainable productivity in the quarter. The Honeywell user experience is driving new products at higher margins. Our factories and sourcing organizations continue to mature, and we continue to re-engineer our products to make them easier and less expensive to manufacture.
HOS Gold and our key process initiatives that generated their productivity allowed us to overcome previously discussed significant headwinds in segment profit. These included over $40 million of additional Aerospace OEM incentives, additional depreciation stemming from our ramp-up in high ROI CapEx, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar and difficult comparisons at UOP and Sensing & Productivity Solutions, which Tom will take you through further.
Our segment margin rate was slightly lower than our guidance range, primarily due to a combination of higher-than-expected sales of lower-margin products, like in BSD and Commercial Aviation OE, and lower sales of higher-margin products, like in ESS and UOP catalysts. We still expect to be within our segment margin guidance range for the full year as sales growth modestly improves in the second half of the year, basically just from the absence of declines in UOP that we encounter in the first half. We will, of course, continue with our disciplined cost controls, focus on commercial excellence and execution of previously funded restructuring actions. Our strong stack and the momentum we see in parts of the portfolio allow us to raise the low end of our 2016 full year earnings guidance to a new range of $6.55 to $6.70 or up 7% to 10% year-over-year.
Our planning framework has not changed. We will support growth wherever we have it to drive outperformance. We'll be cautious in our sales planning. We will continue to plan our costs and spending conservatively, ensuring we remain flexible as a company. And we'll maintain our seed planting investments for the future, supported by a robust pipeline of funded restructuring projects and continued investments in R&D.
In the second quarter, we expect EPS growth of 7% to 10%, in line with the full year range. There's a number of exciting things that are happening across the company, I'd like to spend a moment on them here. Earlier this month, we appointed Darius Adamczyk to the newly created role of President and Chief Operating Officer reporting to me. In this role, he will drive continued profitable growth of our operating businesses through HOS Gold breakthrough strategies, and advanced software offerings that complement Honeywell's diverse technology portfolio. Honeywell remain very active on the capital allocation front in this quarter. We opportunistically repurchased over $1 billion of Honeywell shares at a weighted average price of approximately $104, and we deployed another $1 billion to acquisitions.
We announced and closed 3 deals in ACS, Xtralis and RSI video technologies in security and fire and Movilizer in Sensing & Productivity Solutions. And as we discussed in January, we acquired the remaining 30% stake in UOP Russell, a global leader in modular gas processing technology and equipment. Each acquisition brings differentiated technology and a software focus to drive new growth and greater profitability, while building on our great positions in good industries.
Our acquisitions across the portfolio last year that bolster our connectivity in software offerings are already paying dividends with new wins announced by Elster, Aviaso and COM DEV. In excess [ph], one of the largest multi-utility distribution system operators in the Netherlands, selected Honeywell outfit to deliver more than 1 million smart electricity meters over the next 5 years as part of the country's efforts to meet European Union energy efficiency goals. Aerospace's Aviaso business was selected by Etihad Airways to provide fuel efficiency software and analysis to uncover opportunities for fuel savings, and measure the effectiveness of fuel efficiency initiatives already in place.
COM DEV, part of Defense & Space in aero, recently announced the launch of our world-leading ferrite technology on the European Space Agency's Sentinel-3A satellite. Our systems enable fast, reliable connectivity to provide near real-time data from the satellite specimen systems. We continue to be excited about the growth opportunities these businesses bring to Honeywell, and look forward to telling you more about our progress.
And some of you may have seen last month that Honeywell Green Jet Fuel is now being used by United Airlines to power 12,500 flights from LA to San Francisco as part of its efforts to reduce carbon emissions and support energy diversification. Honeywell Green Jet Fuel can replace as much as 50% as petroleum-derived jet fuel used in flight without any changes to the aircraft technology, while meeting the current ASTM jet fuel specs for flight. Depending on the bio feedstock, Honeywell Green Jet Fuel can offer a 65% to 85% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions compared with petroleum-based fuels. We have lots of exciting new innovations and initiatives driving growth and margin expansion across the portfolio. Our big wins, capacity expansions and software and connectivity focus drive significant growth. We've got a lot of momentum across the portfolio. Innovation and execution, our seed planting for the future, great positions in good industries and the power of One Honeywell continue to be differentiators.
So with that, I'll turn it over to Tom."
1340740,328792692,962031,"Honeywell International Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 22, 2016",2016-04-22,"Earnings Calls","Honeywell International Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Dave, and good morning. I'm on Slide 3, which shows the first quarter results. So sales of $9.5 billion increased 1% on a core organic basis. Each of the segments exceeded the sales guidance we provided in January, led by Commercial Aviation, Buil",4530,"Thanks, Dave, and good morning. I'm on Slide 3, which shows the first quarter results. So sales of $9.5 billion increased 1% on a core organic basis. Each of the segments exceeded the sales guidance we provided in January, led by Commercial Aviation, Building Solutions & Distribution and Process Solutions, which I'll talk more about on business slides.
By region, core organic sales modestly declined in the Americas and increased high single digit in Europe. In our high-growth regions; India grew double digit, while in China, aero and ACS increased double-digit, partially offset by declines in PMT. On a reported basis, total sales increased 3% as acquisitions more than offset the unfavorable impact of the stronger U.S. dollar and lower pass-through pricing in Resins & Chemicals.
Segment margin was down 60 basis points versus the prior year, but up 20 basis points, excluding a dilutive impact of acquisitions. The businesses are driving benefits from HOS Gold, our focus on commercial excellence, new product development and functional transformation, while maintaining our investments for growth. I'll talk more about the segment margin in a minute.
Earnings per share of $1.53 was up 9% coming in at the high end of our guidance range. Items below segment profit were favorable on a year-over-year basis. Consistent with our long-term framework, we recorded approximately $40 million of new restructuring projects, partially offsetting the benefit from higher pension income. For the full year, we anticipate that additional restructuring charges will largely offset the incremental pension income, positioning us well for margin expansion.
Noncontrolling interest was also favorable year-over-year, as anticipated, given the purchase of the remaining 30% stake in UOP Russell. 
On share count, as Dave mentioned, we repurchased over $1 billion of shares at attractive prices, which brought our weighted average fully diluted share count to approximately 777 million for the quarter. We have been, and will continue to be opportunistic when it comes to share repurchases and deploy capital to opportunity that will create the greatest value for our shareholders.
Free cash flow in the quarter of $63 million was down from the first quarter of 2015, driven primarily by the timing of tax payments and higher capital expenditures, offset by better working capital performance. Capital expenditures of almost $200 million in the quarter increased 18% year-over-year. First quarter has historically proven to be our lowest from a cash perspective, and we'll remain on track to our full year cash guidance of $4.6 billion to $4.8 billion. Overall, we continue to generate strong results in a relatively low-growth environment.
I'm now on Slide 4 to provide more detail on our segment margin expansion. Our operating initiatives continue to drive segment margin growth, led by the deployment of HOS Gold. We generated an 80 basis point operational improvement in the quarter, which compares well with 100-plus basis point improvement for the full year 2015. We have differentiated technologies and a software focus. Our supply chains are becoming more lean. Our back office continues to get more efficient, and their strong collaboration across the organization to drive down our material costs and indirect spend.
The previously funded restructuring as well as new restructuring actions have enabled us to continue improving our overall cost position. We were encouraged by the outperformance on the top line in Building Solutions & Distribution and in our Commercial Aviation OE businesses this quarter, but better overdrive as well as the lower UOP petrochemical catalyst sales and lower-than-expected products growth in ACS Scanning & Productivity Solutions business constrained the operational margin improvement to the 80 basis points that you see.
Lower raw materials pass-through pricing in Resins & Chemicals added 10 basis points. The impact from the pricing dynamics in Resins & Chemicals should be minimal for all of 2016.
The other 3 impacts you see on the slide combine for 150 basis points of margin contraction in the quarter. First, M&A accounted for 80 basis points, primarily due to acquisition accounting and pay-as-you-go costs. The incremental amortization from the deals will be a margin headwind for the rest of the year as anticipated. We're in the midst of integrating 8 acquisitions and are happy to report that each one is performing well, and is ahead of our deal financial model. Second, as we previewed on our December outlook call, Aerospace OEM incentives increased by approximately $44 million from 2015, reflecting our continued investment in developing and growing our installed base on the right platforms in the Commercial Aviation industry. Depending on their nature, the incentives are treated as a reduction to revenue or as a cost. But either way, they reduce segment profit as they are incurred.
Third, on foreign exchange, as previewed, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar drove our margin -- drove down our margins, principally in Transportation Systems. You'll recall that we were able to hedge our euro earnings at approximately 1.24 in 2015 versus our 2016 euro hedge rate of 1.10.
So put it into perspective, these 3 items accounted for approximately $63 million of headwind in the quarter or roughly $0.06 of earnings per share. In that light, the $0.12 of earnings per share growth for the first quarter certainly stands out. 
I'm now on Slide 5, summarizing our first quarter segment margin performance versus guidance. We were off 30 basis points at the midpoint. This chart provides some color on that.
Aero and PMT were generally in line with what we guided. In aero, we continue to drive strong productivity improvements, but we did see some impact from the higher-than-planned Commercial OE content. In PMT, we hit the high end of the guidance range. In ACS, we experienced the sales shift. That is lower-than-anticipated ESS sales, including a double-digit decline in security -- Scanning & Productivity Solutions, but higher-than-expected sales in Building Solutions & Distribution.
The adverse margin impact of these sales shifts offset the continued improvements we're seeing across the ACS portfolio from productivity initiatives, commercial excellence and restructuring.
As you'll see later, we continue to maintain our full year margin guidance, which includes an acceleration of restructuring benefits in the second half of the year. This, while absorbing the adverse margin impacts of the M&A accounting, the Aerospace OEM incentives and the strengthening of the U.S. dollar.
Let's turn to Slide 6 with a quick update on some of our recent acquisitions. In 2015, we announced 5 acquisitions aggregating over $5.5 billion in purchase price. These were across all of our SBGs, following our consistent qualitative and quantitative methodologies.
We've continued this into 2016 having already announced and closed the 3 additional deals highlighted on this page. Each of these deals allows us to put non-U.S. cash to work and each advances the software content in the Honeywell portfolio.
Starting with Xtralis and RSI Video technologies. Each of these acquisitions has excellent technologies, including video analytics and software that complement and expand our current security entire [ph] offerings. Xtralis is a pioneer in very early warning smoke detection technology, which enables customers to protect high-value assets, such as museums and historical buildings, or facilities where continuity is critical, such as IP data centers and warehouses. Xtralis is the clear leader in that space.
RSI's advanced motion technology allows our commercial and residential customers to receive intrusion alerts through a live video stream over the cloud providing visual verification that an intrusion event has indeed occurred. This verification is legislatively mandated throughout Europe as a means of reducing unnecessary police response to false alarms, and we expect this type of legislation will become more prevalent globally.
Movilizer allows us to expand our offerings for the Connected Worker in Sensing and Productivity Solutions. Movilizer's cloud platform plugged seamlessly into our customer's ERP systems and enables them to develop, deploy and manage their workflow and field service operations through the Movilizer app. Each of these 2016 acquisitions are being integrated into Honeywell right now and each is tracking ahead of our financial deal model.
Let's move to Slide 7 and discuss the Aerospace results. Sales were up 3% on a core organic basis and above our expectations, driven by better-than-expected growth in the Commercial Aviation business. Aerospace recently created one unified commercial strategic business unit named Commercial Aviation. This organization combines our business and general aviation and our Air Transport and Regional business units to provide the consistent and world-class support required to win and grow our OEM and Aftermarket business.
Commercial Aviation OE sales increased by 4% on a core organic basis, driven by continued strong engine shipments and increased JetWave satcom sales in Business and General Aviation and higher sales to OEMs in air transport and regional, partially offset by a 6-point headwind from the higher OEM incentives that I previously mentioned. As we mentioned in January, the growth in BGA OE is driven by our HTF7000 series engine, which has won 4 of the 5 super midsized business jet platforms.
Commercial Aviation Aftermarket sales were up 6% on a core organic basis, driven by better-than-expected ATR flight hours and double-digit growth in Repair & Overhaul activities. On the spares side, we saw an increase in airline spares, partially offset by lower spare sales in other parts of BGA due to the timing of channel provisioning.
In China, both spares and R&O sales increased double digit on strong flight hours.
Defense & Space sales declined 2% on a core organic basis, driven by program delays and project timing in our U.S. service businesses. International business, in particular, faced a difficult prior comparison as larger projects were completed. As a reminder, the international defense business grew north of 20% in the first quarter of 2015. Additionally, we closed the COM DEV acquisition. That's the satellite communications business we bought in February, and that integration is progressing nicely.
Transportation System sales increased 6% on a core organic basis due to new platform launches and continued volume growth in both gas and diesel light vehicle applications. On the gas side, we saw double-digit growth in both Europe and China. On a reported basis, TS sales increased 3%, reflecting the stronger U.S. dollar. Aerospace segment margin expanded 70 basis points or 90 basis points excluding the dilutive impact of acquisitions. This was driven by productivity net of inflation and commercial excellence, partially offset by continued investments for growth, including the higher OEM incentives.
Let's turn to the ACS results on Slide 8. ACS sales were up 4% on a core organic basis in the first quarter, above the high end of our guidance. ACS continues to outperform in high-growth regions. Sales in both China and India grew double-digit in the quarter, driven by our connected ACS strategy and the benefits from our ongoing investments for growth. Sales in energy, safety and security to the products businesses were flat on a core organic basis in the first quarter and include a 3 -- a negative 3% or 3-point impact from the 2015 completion of the U.S. Postal Services contract in Sensing & Productivity Solutions.
That is excluding security and productivity solutions, the -- I'm sorry, excluding Sensing & Productivity Solutions, the other 3 business units within ES&S were up this quarter on an average of 3%. The momentum continued in security and fire globally with strong growth rates in both residential and commercial markets, coupled with the benefit from new product introductions and further penetration in high-growth regions. We expect S&PS to return to growth in the fourth quarter.
Building Solutions & Distribution sales were up 11% on a core organic basis, outpacing our expectations. We continue to see strength in the Americas distribution business where sales increased over 15% on both the residential and commercial sides and growth has improved sequentially every quarter since the beginning of 2015. 
In Building Solutions, sales grew mid-single digit, reflecting strength in both project installation and service businesses. Orders growth was also healthy approaching 20%, with particular strength in the services and energy retrofit businesses. 
We're encouraged by the solid improvements we have seen in our energy portfolio in HBS this quarter. Our selections, though what we have chosen in an RFP [ph], but have not yet booked the order, those selections stand at nearly $500 million and have been growing steadily over the past 18 months. In the past, I described the slow pace of the conversion of this selection pool into orders, while we're starting to see some of the acceleration of that conversion. 
Energy orders were up over 350% in the first quarter, and we expect orders growth north of 25% in the second quarter. And for the full year, energy orders should nearly double. This has been driven by sales excellence and a differentiated offering that is leading to multiple awards in an industry that is expected to grow at strong mid-single digits over the next 5 years.
We're also seeing traction in the service business in HBS, driven by focused investments in NPI. Overall, the HBS backlog increased mid-single digit on an organic basis, driven primarily by growth in Europe and Asia Pacific, and the conversion of backlog is improving. We converted on a number of larger projects in high-growth regions, particularly in India.
The ACS margin rate contracted 140 basis points in the quarter, but was up 10 basis points, excluding a dilutive impact of acquisitions. As I mentioned earlier, the margin expansion was below our expectations, primarily driven by higher project installation and distribution sales, which carry lower margins. ACS continues to benefit from commercial excellence, productivity initiatives and impacts from restructuring. We continue to invest for growth in our connected product offerings and in high-growth regions sales, marketing and engineering resources. As an example, we've received great feedback thus far on our second-generation of Lyric products, including our water leak and freeze detector products following our launch in April.
I'm now on Slide 9 with the PMT results. Sales in the quarter were better than expected, primarily driven by strength in Process Solutions, a business that continues to outperform its peers in a challenging environment. Process Solutions' sales grew 9% on a core organic basis, driven by double-digit growth in our project businesses and by higher services sales. Conversion of the global megaproject wins and backlog, where we serve as the main contractor providing control and safety solutions for large installations, picked up in the first quarter, and we expect this trend to continue throughout 2016.
Orders were down low single digits on a core organic basis, but improved in our higher-margin software and service businesses. In particular, we see increased demand for our Assurance 360 service partnership offering, which is a multi-year agreement to maintain, support and optimize the performance of Honeywell process control systems.
In UOP, sales were down as expected, driven by lower gas processing, catalysts and equipment sales. Gas processing faced tough prior year comparisons in the first quarter. And while the domestic gas processing environment remains muted, international activity continues to be encouraging. Catalyst demand overall remains strong, but it's not unusual to see variations from quarter-to-quarter as we've highlighted in the past. The first quarter declines were consistent with this trend following strong catalyst shipments in 2015. 
UOP's backlog was up low single digits, driven by our catalyst business. Advanced Materials sales were up 11% on a core organic basis, driven by demand for our Solstice low-global-warming products as well as higher volume in Resins & Chemicals. The Solstice growth is accelerating even more than we had expected, and we continue to build out our capacity to meet the increasing global customer demand. In Resins & Chemicals, the volume favorability was offset somewhat by challenging market conditions.
PMT segment margins were down 90 basis points to 20.6% or down 70 basis points excluding the dilutive impact of acquisitions. The decline was primarily due to lower UOP petrochemical catalyst sales, partially offset by strong improvements in margin rates in HPS and Advanced Materials. PMT benefited from commercial excellence with favorable impact of raw materials pass-through in Resins & Chemicals and the impact from previous restructuring actions.
I'm now on Slide 10 with a preview of the second quarter. For Honeywell total, we're conservatively planning for sales of $10 billion to $10.2 billion, up 2% to 4% reported or down 2% to flat on a core organic basis. Segment margins are expected to be up 40 to 60 basis points, excluding M&A, or down 10 to up 10 basis points on a reported basis. We see credible drivers to improving sales and margin expansion for the rest of the year, including higher catalyst sales in UOP, higher product sales in ESS and improving segment profit from acquisitions, as onetime M&A related charges taper off. We expect the tax rate to be 26.5%. EPS is expected to be $1.61 to $1.66, up 7% to 10% versus 2015.
Starting with Aerospace. Sales are expected to be flat to up 1% on a reported and core organic basis. In Commercial Aviation OE, we're expecting sales to be down mid-single digit, driven by the impact of Aerospace OEM incentives. Excluding the OEM incentives, Commercial Aviation OE is expected to be up low single digit with a ramp-up on key platforms in Air Transport and Regional, partially offset by declines in BGA following significant double-digit growth in the second quarter of 2015, driven by strong engine shipments.
Commercial Aviation Aftermarket sales are expected to grow mid-single digit, again, with an increase in airline spares sales, improvement in BGA RMU sales and higher Repair & Overhaul activity.
ATR flight hours continue to be strong, while also delivering higher satcom and other software upgrades to enhance our growth. We're seeing good traction from customers on our JetWave onboard connectivity terminal, which is currently undergoing certification testing for 26 different aircraft models. 
Defense & Space sales are expected to be roughly flat with higher product sales the U.S. government offset by tough prior year comparisons in the international business as larger projects are completed and by continued softness in the U.S. services business.
In Transportation Systems, sales are expected to be up low single digit, with continued strong growth in light vehicle gas applications, partially offset by slower growth in diesel, based on the timing of new launches. As for the Aerospace margin rates, we expect a reported increase of 60 to 80 basis points, in line with the first quarter performance, and an increase of 80 to 100 basis points, excluding the dilutive impact of M&A.
ACS sales are expected to be down 1% to up 1% on a core organic basis or up 9% to 11% reported, driven by the addition of Elster and the 3 acquisitions we announced and closed in the first quarter. We expect ESS sales growth to be similar in the first quarter on a core organic basis as we continue momentum in our security and fire businesses, and in our key high-growth regions is more than offset by the declines we highlighted in S&PS. S&PS is expected to return to growth in the fourth quarter where we lack the comparisons to periods containing the completed U.S. Postal Service contract. 
In Building Solutions & Distribution, we're expecting low single-digit core organic growth, driven primarily by continued strength in the America's distribution business and recent improvements in the HBS orders and backlog.
Excluding a dilutive impact from M&A, the ACS margin rate is expected to improve 50 to 70 basis points, driven by commercial excellence, continued productivity and the benefits of restructuring. ACS's reported segment margin rate in the second quarter is expected to be down 20 basis points to flat.
In PMT, sales are expected to be down 3% to 4% on both the reported and core organic basis. UOP sales are expected to improve sequentially in the quarter, but will still be down double digit on a year-over-year basis, driven primarily by continued declines in gas processing, particularly in the U.S., and the timing of catalyst shipments.
Based on our stable UOP backlog and strong anticipated second quarter orders, we expect the catalyst business growth rates to improve in the second half of the year. HPS sales are expected to be up low single digit on a core organic basis, driven by continued conversion of global megaprojects and higher software and services sales, partially offset by declines in sales of field instrumentation products.
Advanced Materials sales are expected to be up low single digit, driven by strength in Fluorine Products, Solstice sales and improving specialty products lines, partially offset by the aforementioned pricing conditions in Resins & Chemicals.
The PMT reported segment margin rate is expected to be down 10 to 30 basis points and down 20 basis points to flat, excluding the dilutive impact of M&A. And this is driven by strong productivity net of inflation and the favorable margin rate impact of the raw materials pass-through pricing in Resins & Chemicals.
Let's move to Slide 11 to discuss what to expect for the rest of 2016. Our planning framework for 2016 contemplates a second half organic -- core organic sales guide of approximately 2%, and our full year guidance remains at up 1% to 2%. There are few drivers, which we expect will contribute to this modest second half core organic sales growth acceleration. 
We expect aero and ACS growth rates in the second half to be similar to the first half. So in Aerospace, we're expecting similar strong growth in aftermarket sales and for modest pickups in our Defense & Space and TS businesses to offset modest declines in the Commercial OE business. We'll see tougher comps in the second half of this year across commercial aviation OV, which as you'll recall, grew 5 single digit on a core organic basis in the second half of 2015.
At ACS, we expect S&PS business to return to growth in the fourth quarter as we lap the tough comps stemming from the completion of the U.S. Postal Service contract. We also continue to see traction on our new product investments, including the award-winning water leak detector, part of the Lyric 2.0 suite of products. This, together with ACS' continued strong performance in high-growth regions, particularly China and India, will support continued modest second half growth.
The majority of the improvement in the second half growth is expected to be driven by PMT. Our UOP business was down significantly in the first quarter, as we discussed. We expect a substantial improvement in catalyst sales as shipments accelerate on robust demand in the refining and petrochemical segments. We also expect improvement in the other UOP businesses. UOP's backlog is healthy, up 2% at the end of the first quarter, driven by the nearly $1 billion in fourth quarter orders of -- fourth quarter orders in 2015, and we're expecting a robust orders performance again in the second quarter.
So with that, let's move to our full year 2016 guidance summary on Slide 12. As Dave mentioned earlier, we're raising the low end of the full year EPS guide by $0.10 with a new range of $6.55 to $6.70, up 7% to 10% over the prior year. There's some minor puts and takes among the segments from the guidance we provided in March, but overall, another very strong year expected for Honeywell in 2016. 
As we look at Honeywell in total, we expect 1% to 2% core organic sales growth, and total sales are now expected to be between $40.3 billion and $40.9 billion, up 4% to 6% on a reported basis. This increase in the reported sales reflect the incremental sales from the 3 new acquisition and an update to our foreign currency assumptions. From a sales perspective, we're now planning the euro rate at approximately 1 10 for the remainder of 2016, roughly in line with the prior year and up from our previous assumption of the euro at parity with the U.S. dollar. This change in assumption, of course, does not impact the expected core organic growth rate.
Segment margin expansion is expected to be up 10 to 50 basis points or 80 to 110 basis points, excluding the dilutive impact of M&A, driven by commercial excellence, restructuring benefits and a continued proactive cost management. Below segment profit, our restructuring and other expenses remain stable and in line with our previous guidance, and we still expect the full year tax rate to be 26.5%.
Our pension OPEB income is expected to be approximately $100 million higher than we anticipated in December due to lower service and interest cost as a result of our adoption to stock rate methodology for our pension plans in the U.S. and the U.K. We continue to expect our share count for the full year to be approximately 774 million shares or approximately 2% lower than the 2015 weighted average share count of 789 million shares. We plan to offset any incremental dilution for new exercises over the course of the year to keep the share count at roughly 774 million. We've already spent over $1 billion in share repurchases in the quarter. While our strategy to keep our share count flat over the long term remains, we will continue to be opportunistic in our approach as the market allows. 
As I mentioned earlier, we expect free cash flow to be in a range of $4.6 billion to $4.8 billion, up 5% to 10% from 2015 with CapEx investments roughly flat to 2015 at approximately $1.1 billion. This will drive free cash flow conversion of approximately 90% for the full year.  And as I said, as a result of our strong first quarter performance and the benefit from lower share count, we're raising the low end of our 2016 earnings guidance by $0.10 at this time.
Let's move to Slide 16 for a quick summary before turning it back to Mark for Q&A. Once again, we've demonstrated we can deliver on our earnings commitments, hitting the high end of our guidance range even in a slow-growth environment, a big reminder of the value of our diversified and balanced portfolio and the strength of the Honeywell Operating System. Sales growth was better than anticipated in the quarter, and we continue to invest for future growth in new products and technologies, high ROI CapEx and our presence in high-growth regions. We're also continuing to invest in and execute on process improvements and restructuring, and we again put to work a sizable amount of shareowner capital, which will pave the way for future earnings and cash growth. We have confidence in our full year guidance based on the tenets of supporting growth, being cautious on sales, planning costs and spending conservatively and continued seed planting. So while 2016 isn't the easiest economic environment, we are confident we will continue outperforming our peers and performing well for our shareholders.
As always, we're also thinking about what's beyond 2016. Each of our HOS Gold enterprise is at -- are hard at work focusing on breakthrough goals and profitable growth that we expect will drive earnings outperformance through our Five-Year Plan and beyond. We look forward to sharing more over the course of the year.
With that, Mark, let's move to Q&A."

So you're right. Those will not be with us for the rest of the year, but that was already contemplated in our organic guidance that we had given you. But if you look at it on that basis for the first quarter, we certainly did have the productivity impacts that we felt we were going to have. We had good material cost productivity, good performance on indirects, and we think we actually had good performance on the commercial side. The issue was what Dave highlighted. I mean, we had more sales in distribution, more sales of Building Solutions product. I mean, 17% up in our Distribution business, 7% up in Building Solution. And we also had in S&PS a little bit of unfavorability beyond the Postal Service contract that we talked about. A little bit of channel softness and inventory shifts. We're keeping our eye on that as well, so those are the puts and takes. As we said, second quarter, we expect to snap back to 50 to 70 basis points of expansion. We'll get the productivity.

And you see that reflected in how we are forecasting the second quarter and how we're forecasting the total year. I just don't think there's any percentage right now on being bullish about it. If it happens, great. I think there's a greater chance it happens than there is -- than it doesn't. But that being said, I don't see any percentage in being bullish about it."

As I'm sure you've seen by now, Honeywell delivered another strong quarter to kick off 2016. EPS of $1.53, increased 9% coming in at the high end of our guidance range; sales of $9.5 billion were up 1% on a core organic basis, abov",963,"Good morning, everyone. As I'm sure you've seen by now, Honeywell delivered another strong quarter to kick off 2016. EPS of $1.53, increased 9% coming in at the high end of our guidance range; sales of $9.5 billion were up 1% on a core organic basis, above the high end of our sales guidance.
We outperformed and saw growth accelerate in the Aerospace Commercial Aftermarket and Transportation Systems, in our residential and commercial and China businesses within ACS and in Process Solutions and Fluorine Products in PMT. Excluding the dilutive impact of M&A, segment margin expanded 20 basis points in the quarter to 18.9%. We generated significant sustainable productivity in the quarter. The Honeywell user experience is driving new products at higher margins. Our factories and sourcing organizations continue to mature, and we continue to re-engineer our products to make them easier and less expensive to manufacture.
HOS Gold and our key process initiatives that generated their productivity allowed us to overcome previously discussed significant headwinds in segment profit. These included over $40 million of additional Aerospace OEM incentives, additional depreciation stemming from our ramp-up in high ROI CapEx, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar and difficult comparisons at UOP and Sensing & Productivity Solutions, which Tom will take you through further.
Our segment margin rate was slightly lower than our guidance range, primarily due to a combination of higher-than-expected sales of lower-margin products, like in BSD and Commercial Aviation OE, and lower sales of higher-margin products, like in ESS and UOP catalysts. We still expect to be within our segment margin guidance range for the full year as sales growth modestly improves in the second half of the year, basically just from the absence of declines in UOP that we encounter in the first half. We will, of course, continue with our disciplined cost controls, focus on commercial excellence and execution of previously funded restructuring actions. Our strong stack and the momentum we see in parts of the portfolio allow us to raise the low end of our 2016 full year earnings guidance to a new range of $6.55 to $6.70 or up 7% to 10% year-over-year.
Our planning framework has not changed. We will support growth wherever we have it to drive outperformance. We'll be cautious in our sales planning. We will continue to plan our costs and spending conservatively, ensuring we remain flexible as a company. And we'll maintain our seed planting investments for the future, supported by a robust pipeline of funded restructuring projects and continued investments in R&D.
In the second quarter, we expect EPS growth of 7% to 10%, in line with the full year range. There's a number of exciting things that are happening across the company, I'd like to spend a moment on them here. Earlier this month, we appointed Darius Adamczyk to the newly created role of President and Chief Operating Officer reporting to me. In this role, he will drive continued profitable growth of our operating businesses through HOS Gold breakthrough strategies, and advanced software offerings that complement Honeywell's diverse technology portfolio. Honeywell remain very active on the capital allocation front in this quarter. We opportunistically repurchased over $1 billion of Honeywell shares at a weighted average price of approximately $104, and we deployed another $1 billion to acquisitions.
We announced and closed 3 deals in ACS, Xtralis and RSI video technologies in security and fire and Movilizer in Sensing & Productivity Solutions. And as we discussed in January, we acquired the remaining 30% stake in UOP Russell, a global leader in modular gas processing technology and equipment. Each acquisition brings differentiated technology and a software focus to drive new growth and greater profitability, while building on our great positions in good industries.
Our acquisitions across the portfolio last year that bolster our connectivity in software offerings are already paying dividends with new wins announced by Elster, Aviaso and COM DEV. Enexis, one of the largest multi-utility distribution system operators in the Netherlands, selected Honeywell outfit to deliver more than 1 million smart electricity meters over the next 5 years as part of the country's efforts to meet European Union energy efficiency goals. Aerospace's Aviaso business was selected by Etihad Airways to provide fuel efficiency software and analysis to uncover opportunities for fuel savings, and measure the effectiveness of fuel efficiency initiatives already in place.
COM DEV, part of Defense & Space in aero, recently announced the launch of our world-leading ferrite technology on the European Space Agency's Sentinel-3A satellite. Our systems enable fast, reliable connectivity to provide near real-time data from the satellite specimen systems. We continue to be excited about the growth opportunities these businesses bring to Honeywell, and look forward to telling you more about our progress.
And some of you may have seen last month that Honeywell Green Jet Fuel is now being used by United Airlines to power 12,500 flights from LA to San Francisco as part of its efforts to reduce carbon emissions and support energy diversification. Honeywell Green Jet Fuel can replace as much as 50% as petroleum-derived jet fuel used in flight without any changes to the aircraft technology, while meeting the current ASTM jet fuel specs for flight. Depending on the bio feedstock, Honeywell Green Jet Fuel can offer a 65% to 85% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions compared with petroleum-based fuels. We have lots of exciting new innovations and initiatives driving growth and margin expansion across the portfolio. Our big wins, capacity expansions and software and connectivity focus drive significant growth. We've got a lot of momentum across the portfolio. Innovation and execution, our seed planting for the future, great positions in good industries and the power of One Honeywell continue to be differentiators.
So with that, I'll turn it over to Tom."
1340740,328792692,962197,"Honeywell International Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 22, 2016",2016-04-22,"Earnings Calls","Honeywell International Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Dave, and good morning. I'm on Slide 3, which shows the first quarter results. So sales of $9.5 billion increased 1% on a core organic basis. Each of the segments exceeded the sales guidance we provided in January, led by Commercial Aviation, Buil",4529,"Thanks, Dave, and good morning. I'm on Slide 3, which shows the first quarter results. So sales of $9.5 billion increased 1% on a core organic basis. Each of the segments exceeded the sales guidance we provided in January, led by Commercial Aviation, Building Solutions & Distribution and Process Solutions, which I'll talk more about on business slides.
By region, core organic sales modestly declined in the Americas and increased high single digit in Europe. In our high-growth regions; India grew double digit, while in China, aero and ACS increased double-digit, partially offset by declines in PMT. On a reported basis, total sales increased 3% as acquisitions more than offset the unfavorable impact of the stronger U.S. dollar and lower pass-through pricing in Resins & Chemicals.
Segment margin was down 60 basis points versus the prior year, but up 20 basis points, excluding a dilutive impact of acquisitions. The businesses are driving benefits from HOS Gold, our focus on commercial excellence, new product development and functional transformation, while maintaining our investments for growth. I'll talk more about the segment margin in a minute.
Earnings per share of $1.53 was up 9% coming in at the high end of our guidance range. Items below segment profit were favorable on a year-over-year basis. Consistent with our long-term framework, we recorded approximately $40 million of new restructuring projects, partially offsetting the benefit from higher pension income. For the full year, we anticipate that additional restructuring charges will largely offset the incremental pension income, positioning us well for margin expansion.
Noncontrolling interest was also favorable year-over-year, as anticipated, given the purchase of the remaining 30% stake in UOP Russell. 
On share count, as Dave mentioned, we repurchased over $1 billion of shares at attractive prices, which brought our weighted average fully diluted share count to approximately 777 million for the quarter. We have been, and will continue to be opportunistic when it comes to share repurchases and deploy capital to opportunity that will create the greatest value for our shareholders.
Free cash flow in the quarter of $63 million was down from the first quarter of 2015, driven primarily by the timing of tax payments and higher capital expenditures, offset by better working capital performance. Capital expenditures of almost $200 million in the quarter increased 18% year-over-year. First quarter has historically proven to be our lowest from a cash perspective, and we'll remain on track to our full year cash guidance of $4.6 billion to $4.8 billion. Overall, we continue to generate strong results in a relatively low-growth environment.
I'm now on Slide 4 to provide more detail on our segment margin expansion. Our operating initiatives continue to drive segment margin growth, led by the deployment of HOS Gold. We generated an 80 basis point operational improvement in the quarter, which compares well with 100-plus basis point improvement for the full year 2015. We have differentiated technologies and a software focus. Our supply chains are becoming more lean. Our back office continues to get more efficient, and their strong collaboration across the organization to drive down our material costs and indirect spend.
The previously funded restructuring as well as new restructuring actions have enabled us to continue improving our overall cost position. We were encouraged by the outperformance on the top line in Building Solutions & Distribution and in our Commercial Aviation OE businesses this quarter, but better overdrive as well as the lower UOP petrochemical catalyst sales and lower-than-expected products growth in ACS Scanning & Productivity Solutions business constrained the operational margin improvement to the 80 basis points that you see.
Lower raw materials pass-through pricing in Resins & Chemicals added 10 basis points. The impact from the pricing dynamics in Resins & Chemicals should be minimal for all of 2016.
The other 3 impacts you see on the slide combine for 150 basis points of margin contraction in the quarter. First, M&A accounted for 80 basis points, primarily due to acquisition accounting and pay-as-you-go costs. The incremental amortization from the deals will be a margin headwind for the rest of the year as anticipated. We're in the midst of integrating 8 acquisitions and are happy to report that each one is performing well, and is ahead of our deal financial model. Second, as we previewed on our December outlook call, Aerospace OEM incentives increased by approximately $44 million from 2015, reflecting our continued investment in developing and growing our installed base on the right platforms in the Commercial Aviation industry. Depending on their nature, the incentives are treated as a reduction to revenue or as a cost. But either way, they reduce segment profit as they are incurred.
Third, on foreign exchange, as previewed, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar drove our margin -- drove down our margins, principally in Transportation Systems. You'll recall that we were able to hedge our euro earnings at approximately 1.24 in 2015 versus our 2016 euro hedge rate of 1.10.
So put it into perspective, these 3 items accounted for approximately $63 million of headwind in the quarter or roughly $0.06 of earnings per share. In that light, the $0.12 of earnings per share growth for the first quarter certainly stands out. 
I'm now on Slide 5, summarizing our first quarter segment margin performance versus guidance. We were off 30 basis points at the midpoint. This chart provides some color on that.
Aero and PMT were generally in line with what we guided. In aero, we continue to drive strong productivity improvements, but we did see some impact from the higher-than-planned Commercial OE content. In PMT, we hit the high end of the guidance range. In ACS, we experienced the sales shift. That is lower-than-anticipated ESS sales, including a double-digit decline in security -- Scanning & Productivity Solutions, but higher-than-expected sales in Building Solutions & Distribution.
The adverse margin impact of these sales shifts offset the continued improvements we're seeing across the ACS portfolio from productivity initiatives, commercial excellence and restructuring.
As you'll see later, we continue to maintain our full year margin guidance, which includes an acceleration of restructuring benefits in the second half of the year. This, while absorbing the adverse margin impacts of the M&A accounting, the Aerospace OEM incentives and the strengthening of the U.S. dollar.
Let's turn to Slide 6 with a quick update on some of our recent acquisitions. In 2015, we announced 5 acquisitions aggregating over $5.5 billion in purchase price. These were across all of our SBGs, following our consistent qualitative and quantitative methodologies.
We've continued this into 2016 having already announced and closed the 3 additional deals highlighted on this page. Each of these deals allows us to put non-U.S. cash to work and each advances the software content in the Honeywell portfolio.
Starting with Xtralis and RSI Video technologies. Each of these acquisitions has excellent technologies, including video analytics and software that complement and expand our current security and fire offerings. Xtralis is a pioneer in very early warning smoke detection technology, which enables customers to protect high-value assets, such as museums and historical buildings, or facilities where continuity is critical, such as IP data centers and warehouses. Xtralis is the clear leader in that space.
RSI's advanced motion technology allows our commercial and residential customers to receive intrusion alerts through a live video stream over the cloud providing visual verification that an intrusion event has indeed occurred. This verification is legislatively mandated throughout Europe as a means of reducing unnecessary police response to false alarms, and we expect this type of legislation will become more prevalent globally.
Movilizer allows us to expand our offerings for the Connected Worker in Sensing and Productivity Solutions. Movilizer's cloud platform plugged seamlessly into our customer's ERP systems and enables them to develop, deploy and manage their workflow and field service operations through the Movilizer app. Each of these 2016 acquisitions are being integrated into Honeywell right now and each is tracking ahead of our financial deal model.
Let's move to Slide 7 and discuss the Aerospace results. Sales were up 3% on a core organic basis and above our expectations, driven by better-than-expected growth in the Commercial Aviation business. Aerospace recently created one unified commercial strategic business unit named Commercial Aviation. This organization combines our business and general aviation and our Air Transport and Regional business units to provide the consistent and world-class support required to win and grow our OEM and Aftermarket business.
Commercial Aviation OE sales increased by 4% on a core organic basis, driven by continued strong engine shipments and increased JetWave satcom sales in Business and General Aviation and higher sales to OEMs in air transport and regional, partially offset by a 6-point headwind from the higher OEM incentives that I previously mentioned. As we mentioned in January, the growth in BGA OE is driven by our HTF7000 series engine, which has won 4 of the 5 super midsized business jet platforms.
Commercial Aviation Aftermarket sales were up 6% on a core organic basis, driven by better-than-expected ATR flight hours and double-digit growth in Repair & Overhaul activities. On the spares side, we saw an increase in airline spares, partially offset by lower spare sales in other parts of BGA due to the timing of channel provisioning.
In China, both spares and R&O sales increased double digit on strong flight hours.
Defense & Space sales declined 2% on a core organic basis, driven by program delays and project timing in our U.S. service businesses. International business, in particular, faced a difficult prior comparison as larger projects were completed. As a reminder, the international defense business grew north of 20% in the first quarter of 2015. Additionally, we closed the COM DEV acquisition. That's the satellite communications business we bought in February, and that integration is progressing nicely.
Transportation System sales increased 6% on a core organic basis due to new platform launches and continued volume growth in both gas and diesel light vehicle applications. On the gas side, we saw double-digit growth in both Europe and China. On a reported basis, TS sales increased 3%, reflecting the stronger U.S. dollar. Aerospace segment margin expanded 70 basis points or 90 basis points excluding the dilutive impact of acquisitions. This was driven by productivity net of inflation and commercial excellence, partially offset by continued investments for growth, including the higher OEM incentives.
Let's turn to the ACS results on Slide 8. ACS sales were up 4% on a core organic basis in the first quarter, above the high end of our guidance. ACS continues to outperform in high-growth regions. Sales in both China and India grew double-digit in the quarter, driven by our connected ACS strategy and the benefits from our ongoing investments for growth. Sales in energy, safety and security to the products businesses were flat on a core organic basis in the first quarter and include a 3 -- a negative 3% or 3-point impact from the 2015 completion of the U.S. Postal Services contract in Sensing & Productivity Solutions.
That is excluding security and productivity solutions, the -- I'm sorry, excluding Sensing & Productivity Solutions, the other 3 business units within ES&S were up this quarter on an average of 3%. The momentum continued in security and fire globally with strong growth rates in both residential and commercial markets, coupled with the benefit from new product introductions and further penetration in high-growth regions. We expect S&PS to return to growth in the fourth quarter.
Building Solutions & Distribution sales were up 11% on a core organic basis, outpacing our expectations. We continue to see strength in the Americas distribution business where sales increased over 15% on both the residential and commercial sides and growth has improved sequentially every quarter since the beginning of 2015. 
In Building Solutions, sales grew mid-single digit, reflecting strength in both project installation and service businesses. Orders growth was also healthy approaching 20%, with particular strength in the services and energy retrofit businesses. 
We're encouraged by the solid improvements we have seen in our energy portfolio in HBS this quarter. Our selections, though what we have chosen in an RFP, but have not yet booked the order, those selections stand at nearly $500 million and have been growing steadily over the past 18 months. In the past, I described the slow pace of the conversion of this selection pool into orders, while we're starting to see some of the acceleration of that conversion. 
Energy orders were up over 350% in the first quarter, and we expect orders growth north of 25% in the second quarter. And for the full year, energy orders should nearly double. This has been driven by sales excellence and a differentiated offering that is leading to multiple awards in an industry that is expected to grow at strong mid-single digits over the next 5 years.
We're also seeing traction in the service business in HBS, driven by focused investments in NPI. Overall, the HBS backlog increased mid-single digit on an organic basis, driven primarily by growth in Europe and Asia Pacific, and the conversion of backlog is improving. We converted on a number of larger projects in high-growth regions, particularly in India.
The ACS margin rate contracted 140 basis points in the quarter, but was up 10 basis points, excluding a dilutive impact of acquisitions. As I mentioned earlier, the margin expansion was below our expectations, primarily driven by higher project installation and distribution sales, which carry lower margins. ACS continues to benefit from commercial excellence, productivity initiatives and impacts from restructuring. We continue to invest for growth in our connected product offerings and in high-growth regions sales, marketing and engineering resources. As an example, we've received great feedback thus far on our second-generation of Lyric products, including our water leak and freeze detector products following our launch in April.
I'm now on Slide 9 with the PMT results. Sales in the quarter were better than expected, primarily driven by strength in Process Solutions, a business that continues to outperform its peers in a challenging environment. Process Solutions' sales grew 9% on a core organic basis, driven by double-digit growth in our project businesses and by higher services sales. Conversion of the global megaproject wins and backlog, where we serve as the main contractor providing control and safety solutions for large installations, picked up in the first quarter, and we expect this trend to continue throughout 2016.
Orders were down low single digits on a core organic basis, but improved in our higher-margin software and service businesses. In particular, we see increased demand for our Assurance 360 service partnership offering, which is a multi-year agreement to maintain, support and optimize the performance of Honeywell process control systems.
In UOP, sales were down as expected, driven by lower gas processing, catalysts and equipment sales. Gas processing faced tough prior year comparisons in the first quarter. And while the domestic gas processing environment remains muted, international activity continues to be encouraging. Catalyst demand overall remains strong, but it's not unusual to see variations from quarter-to-quarter as we've highlighted in the past. The first quarter declines were consistent with this trend following strong catalyst shipments in 2015. 
UOP's backlog was up low single digits, driven by our catalyst business. Advanced Materials sales were up 11% on a core organic basis, driven by demand for our Solstice low-global-warming products as well as higher volume in Resins & Chemicals. The Solstice growth is accelerating even more than we had expected, and we continue to build out our capacity to meet the increasing global customer demand. In Resins & Chemicals, the volume favorability was offset somewhat by challenging market conditions.
PMT segment margins were down 90 basis points to 20.6% or down 70 basis points excluding the dilutive impact of acquisitions. The decline was primarily due to lower UOP petrochemical catalyst sales, partially offset by strong improvements in margin rates in HPS and Advanced Materials. PMT benefited from commercial excellence with favorable impact of raw materials pass-through in Resins & Chemicals and the impact from previous restructuring actions.
I'm now on Slide 10 with a preview of the second quarter. For Honeywell total, we're conservatively planning for sales of $10 billion to $10.2 billion, up 2% to 4% reported or down 2% to flat on a core organic basis. Segment margins are expected to be up 40 to 60 basis points, excluding M&A, or down 10 to up 10 basis points on a reported basis. We see credible drivers to improving sales and margin expansion for the rest of the year, including higher catalyst sales in UOP, higher product sales in ESS and improving segment profit from acquisitions, as onetime M&A related charges taper off. We expect the tax rate to be 26.5%. EPS is expected to be $1.61 to $1.66, up 7% to 10% versus 2015.
Starting with Aerospace. Sales are expected to be flat to up 1% on a reported and core organic basis. In Commercial Aviation OE, we're expecting sales to be down mid-single digit, driven by the impact of Aerospace OEM incentives. Excluding the OEM incentives, Commercial Aviation OE is expected to be up low single digit with a ramp-up on key platforms in Air Transport and Regional, partially offset by declines in BGA following significant double-digit growth in the second quarter of 2015, driven by strong engine shipments.
Commercial Aviation Aftermarket sales are expected to grow mid-single digit, again, with an increase in airline spares sales, improvement in BGA RMU sales and higher Repair & Overhaul activity.
ATR flight hours continue to be strong, while also delivering higher satcom and other software upgrades to enhance our growth. We're seeing good traction from customers on our JetWave onboard connectivity terminal, which is currently undergoing certification testing for 26 different aircraft models. 
Defense & Space sales are expected to be roughly flat with higher product sales the U.S. government offset by tough prior year comparisons in the international business as larger projects are completed and by continued softness in the U.S. services business.
In Transportation Systems, sales are expected to be up low single digit, with continued strong growth in light vehicle gas applications, partially offset by slower growth in diesel, based on the timing of new launches. As for the Aerospace margin rates, we expect a reported increase of 60 to 80 basis points, in line with the first quarter performance, and an increase of 80 to 100 basis points, excluding the dilutive impact of M&A.
ACS sales are expected to be down 1% to up 1% on a core organic basis or up 9% to 11% reported, driven by the addition of Elster and the 3 acquisitions we announced and closed in the first quarter. We expect ESS sales growth to be similar in the first quarter on a core organic basis as we continue momentum in our security and fire businesses, and in our key high-growth regions is more than offset by the declines we highlighted in S&PS. S&PS is expected to return to growth in the fourth quarter where we lack the comparisons to periods containing the completed U.S. Postal Service contract. 
In Building Solutions & Distribution, we're expecting low single-digit core organic growth, driven primarily by continued strength in the America's distribution business and recent improvements in the HBS orders and backlog.
Excluding a dilutive impact from M&A, the ACS margin rate is expected to improve 50 to 70 basis points, driven by commercial excellence, continued productivity and the benefits of restructuring. ACS's reported segment margin rate in the second quarter is expected to be down 20 basis points to flat.
In PMT, sales are expected to be down 3% to 4% on both the reported and core organic basis. UOP sales are expected to improve sequentially in the quarter, but will still be down double digit on a year-over-year basis, driven primarily by continued declines in gas processing, particularly in the U.S., and the timing of catalyst shipments.
Based on our stable UOP backlog and strong anticipated second quarter orders, we expect the catalyst business growth rates to improve in the second half of the year. HPS sales are expected to be up low single digit on a core organic basis, driven by continued conversion of global megaprojects and higher software and services sales, partially offset by declines in sales of field instrumentation products.
Advanced Materials sales are expected to be up low single digit, driven by strength in Fluorine Products, Solstice sales and improving specialty products lines, partially offset by the aforementioned pricing conditions in Resins & Chemicals.
The PMT reported segment margin rate is expected to be down 10 to 30 basis points and down 20 basis points to flat, excluding the dilutive impact of M&A. And this is driven by strong productivity net of inflation and the favorable margin rate impact of the raw materials pass-through pricing in Resins & Chemicals.
Let's move to Slide 11 to discuss what to expect for the rest of 2016. Our planning framework for 2016 contemplates a second half organic -- core organic sales guide of approximately 2%, and our full year guidance remains at up 1% to 2%. There are few drivers, which we expect will contribute to this modest second half core organic sales growth acceleration. 
We expect aero and ACS growth rates in the second half to be similar to the first half. So in Aerospace, we're expecting similar strong growth in aftermarket sales and for modest pickups in our Defense & Space and TS businesses to offset modest declines in the Commercial OE business. We'll see tougher comps in the second half of this year across commercial aviation OE, which as you'll recall, grew 5 single digit on a core organic basis in the second half of 2015.
At ACS, we expect S&PS business to return to growth in the fourth quarter as we lap the tough comps stemming from the completion of the U.S. Postal Service contract. We also continue to see traction on our new product investments, including the award-winning water leak detector, part of the Lyric 2.0 suite of products. This, together with ACS' continued strong performance in high-growth regions, particularly China and India, will support continued modest second half growth.
The majority of the improvement in the second half growth is expected to be driven by PMT. Our UOP business was down significantly in the first quarter, as we discussed. We expect a substantial improvement in catalyst sales as shipments accelerate on robust demand in the refining and petrochemical segments. We also expect improvement in the other UOP businesses. UOP's backlog is healthy, up 2% at the end of the first quarter, driven by the nearly $1 billion in fourth quarter orders of -- fourth quarter orders in 2015, and we're expecting a robust orders performance again in the second quarter.
So with that, let's move to our full year 2016 guidance summary on Slide 12. As Dave mentioned earlier, we're raising the low end of the full year EPS guide by $0.10 with a new range of $6.55 to $6.70, up 7% to 10% over the prior year. There's some minor puts and takes among the segments from the guidance we provided in March, but overall, another very strong year expected for Honeywell in 2016. 
As we look at Honeywell in total, we expect 1% to 2% core organic sales growth, and total sales are now expected to be between $40.3 billion and $40.9 billion, up 4% to 6% on a reported basis. This increase in the reported sales reflect the incremental sales from the 3 new acquisition and an update to our foreign currency assumptions. From a sales perspective, we're now planning the euro rate at approximately 1 10 for the remainder of 2016, roughly in line with the prior year and up from our previous assumption of the euro at parity with the U.S. dollar. This change in assumption, of course, does not impact the expected core organic growth rate.
Segment margin expansion is expected to be up 10 to 50 basis points or 80 to 110 basis points, excluding the dilutive impact of M&A, driven by commercial excellence, restructuring benefits and a continued proactive cost management. Below segment profit, our restructuring and other expenses remain stable and in line with our previous guidance, and we still expect the full year tax rate to be 26.5%.
Our pension OPEB income is expected to be approximately $100 million higher than we anticipated in December due to lower service and interest cost as a result of our adoption to stock rate methodology for our pension plans in the U.S. and the U.K. We continue to expect our share count for the full year to be approximately 774 million shares or approximately 2% lower than the 2015 weighted average share count of 789 million shares. We plan to offset any incremental dilution for new exercises over the course of the year to keep the share count at roughly 774 million. We've already spent over $1 billion in share repurchases in the quarter. While our strategy to keep our share count flat over the long term remains, we will continue to be opportunistic in our approach as the market allows. 
As I mentioned earlier, we expect free cash flow to be in a range of $4.6 billion to $4.8 billion, up 5% to 10% from 2015 with CapEx investments roughly flat to 2015 at approximately $1.1 billion. This will drive free cash flow conversion of approximately 90% for the full year. And as I said, as a result of our strong first quarter performance and the benefit from lower share count, we're raising the low end of our 2016 earnings guidance by $0.10 at this time.
Let's move to Slide 16 for a quick summary before turning it back to Mark for Q&A. Once again, we've demonstrated we can deliver on our earnings commitments, hitting the high end of our guidance range even in a slow-growth environment, a big reminder of the value of our diversified and balanced portfolio and the strength of the Honeywell Operating System. Sales growth was better than anticipated in the quarter, and we continue to invest for future growth in new products and technologies, high ROI CapEx and our presence in high-growth regions. We're also continuing to invest in and execute on process improvements and restructuring, and we again put to work a sizable amount of shareowner capital, which will pave the way for future earnings and cash growth. We have confidence in our full year guidance based on the tenets of supporting growth, being cautious on sales, planning costs and spending conservatively and continued seed planting. So while 2016 isn't the easiest economic environment, we are confident we will continue outperforming our peers and performing well for our shareholders.
As always, we're also thinking about what's beyond 2016. Each of our HOS Gold enterprise is at -- are hard at work focusing on breakthrough goals and profitable growth that we expect will drive earnings outperformance through our Five-Year Plan and beyond. We look forward to sharing more over the course of the year.
With that, Mark, let's move to Q&A."

So you're right. Those will not be with us for the rest of the year, but that was already contemplated in our organic guidance that we had given you. But if you look at it on that basis for the first quarter, we certainly did have the productivity impacts that we felt we were going to have. We had good material cost productivity, good performance on indirects, and we think we actually had good performance on the commercial side. The issue was what Dave highlighted. I mean, we had more sales in distribution, more sales of Building Solutions product. I mean, 17% up in our Distribution business, 7% up in Building Solution. And we also had in S&PS a little bit of unfavorability beyond the Postal Service contract that we talked about. A little bit of channel softness and inventory shifts. We're keeping our eye on that as well, so those are the puts and takes. As we said, second quarter, we expect to snap back to 50 to 70 basis points of expansion. We'll get the productivity.

As I'm sure you've seen by now Honeywell delivered another quarter of double-digit earnings growth capping off a strong first half of the year in a challenging global economy. Earnings per share of $1.66 increased 10% coming in at",1103,"Good morning, everyone. As I'm sure you've seen by now Honeywell delivered another quarter of double-digit earnings growth capping off a strong first half of the year in a challenging global economy. Earnings per share of $1.66 increased 10% coming in at the high end of our guidance range. Sales of $10 billion were up 2% on a reported basis and down 2% on a core organic basis, in line with our guidance for the quarter.
We saw good growth in commercial aviation aftermarket and transportation systems, in our residential, commercial and China businesses within ACS and in process solutions and fluorine products in PMT.
Segment margin expanded 10 basis points to 18.5%. On an operational basis, this was 110 basis points of improvement as we continue our focus on commercial excellence, execution on previously funded restructuring actions and maintaining disciplined cost controls. We are again raising the low end of our 2016 full year earnings guidance to a new range of $6.60 to $6.70 or up 8% to 10% year-over-year given our first half performance.
During the second quarter, we had several announcements that I'd like to highlight this morning. We announced that Darius Adamczyk will be our next CEO effective March 31, 2017, and I will serve as Executive Chairman through April 2018. This announcement is the next step in ensuring a seamless leadership transition, which will position Honeywell for continued outperformance in 2017 and beyond. Darius is the right person to lead the company into a new era where we will need to keep evolving, become even more global, to become more of a software company and to become more nimble. He has the growth mindset, global acumen and software expertise to be a highly successful CEO for Honeywell. The board and I are confident that Darius will be a great leader in executing our strategic plans and driving organic growth. My leadership team and I remain as focused as ever in delivering on our commitments while ensuring a smooth leadership transition.
In addition, this morning, we announced that we will realign ACS into 2 new segments: Home and Building Technologies and Safety and Productivity Solutions. We will begin reporting results on this basis in the third quarter. Tom will speak more about this later, but we think this is the right time to separate ACS into 2 smaller more nimble businesses that will operate more efficiently and adapt more quickly to changing global markets. We have 2 fantastic leaders in Terrence Hahn and John Waldron to lead the new segments, and we're excited about the growth opportunities in each portfolio as we look ahead to 2017.
Alex is may [indiscernible] serve as President and CEO of Automation and Control Solutions for the past 2 years will leave the company. Alex had a very successful career at Honeywell in Aerospace; Transportation Systems; and most recently, ACS where he delivered strong operating margin expansion and improved operational excellence, completed several acquisitions in new strategic adjacencies like smart meters, accelerated growth in high-growth regions and built a strong pipeline of new products, IoT solutions and software for home building and worker applications. Alex is very supportive of the change. He's a well-liked and respected leader, and we wish him the best in his next endeavor. 
We remain very active on the capital deployment front also. Earlier this month, we announced the acquisition of Intelligrated for $1.5 billion. Intelligrated serves the high-growth e-commerce industry, offering complete warehouse automation solutions, software and services. Intelligrated has a large and growing installed base to customers that align well with our new Safety and Productivity Solutions business and has served a highly attractive market that is forecasted to grow 8% to 10% a year. 
We also announced the spinoff of our Resins & Chemicals business into an independent public company called AdvanSix. The spinoff of AdvanSix is progressing well, and we expect completion this year. These portfolio of changes continue to move our growth profile upward and build on our great positions in good industries.
In June, Shane [ph] and his team hosted approximately 20 investors and analysts in China to learn more about Honeywell's tremendous growth opportunities in high-growth regions. The trip covered 4 cities in 5 days and included meetings with Chinese government officials, local economists and CEOs, business innovation centers and high-tech incubators, site tours of Honeywell's treble factory in [indiscernible] and S&PS factory in Suzhou as well as an in-depth HDR business review. This trip served as an excellent venue for our shareowners and analysts to better understand our HGR strategies, including becoming the Chinese competitor, ease for ease and ease for us, and how our experience in China has driven our strategic thinking and provided a foundation for further growth in other high-growth regions. High-growth regions have driven approximately 50% of our growth over the last 10 years, and we expect it to continue to be a key growth engine for Honeywell going forward.
And our focus on suffer continues with the announcement of our new digital transportation business part of Honeywell process solutions. This business will help industrial companies harness the power of the industrial Internet of Things to make their operations more reliable, more efficient and safer. Industrial Internet of Things was the key topic at our 30 -- 41st Annual Honeywell User Group Conference in San Antonio, where we introduced our new uniform suite. This suite is our analytics platform that provides realtime digital intelligence to turn plant dater into actionable information. At the user group conference, more than 1,000 people gathered to discuss IIoT's tremendous potential to solve the toughest challenges facing industrial companies today. Honeywell's portfolio of technologies, advanced analytics and deep domain knowledge position us well to utilize dater to help customers operate their plants for safety and efficiency and reduce unplanned downtime.
We're also monitoring the macro environment in light of Britain's recently announced exit from the European Union, and we expect minimal near-term impact. Tom will take you through some of the actions were taken to mitigate potential risks, but it's important to note that our planning framework hasn't change. We'll be cautious in our sales planning and continue to plan our costs and spending conservatively, ensuring we remain flexible as a company. And we'll maintain our seed planting for the future supported by a robust pipeline of funded restructuring projects. We'll continue to support growth, focusing on winning in high-growth regions, advancing our superiors of our capabilities and effectively using HOS Gold to drive breakthrough initiatives and deliver high-quality products for our customers globally.
So with that, I'll turn it over to Tom."
1340740,366859639,1010671,"Honeywell International Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 22, 2016",2016-07-22,"Earnings Calls","Honeywell International Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Dave, and good morning. I'm now on Slide 3, which shows the second quarter results. Reported sales of $10 billion increased 2% reflecting impact of acquisitions and declined 2% on a core organic basis. We saw a continued growth on our commercial a",4816,"Thanks, Dave, and good morning. I'm now on Slide 3, which shows the second quarter results. Reported sales of $10 billion increased 2% reflecting impact of acquisitions and declined 2% on a core organic basis. We saw a continued growth on our commercial aviation aftermarket, security and fire, Process Solutions and transportation systems, which I'll talk more about on the business slides. 
The continued declines in our oil and gas businesses in UOP and difficult comps in S&PS were largely as we expected. In our high-growth regions, India grew 30% -- nearly 30%, while in China, Airline ACS continued the momentum from the first quarter, partially offset by moderating declines in PMT. All of our recent acquisitions are performing at or above the deal financial model, and the sales from our 7 recent acquisitions collectively grew in the high single-digit basis on a core organic basis this quarter.
Segment margin was up 10 basis points versus the prior year, at the high end of our guidance range or of 50 basis points, excluding the dilutive impact of acquisitions. As Dave mentioned, on an operational basis -- so that's further excluding the impacts of foreign exchange, the Aerospace OEM incentives and raw materials pass-through pricing in Resins & Chemicals. Segment margin improved 110 basis points. We expect the overall margin expansion will continue to improve in the second half.
Earnings per share of $1.66 were up 10%, coming in at the high end of our guidance range. Also we funded $97 million of restructuring projects. That's $53 million net of reversals, largely offsetting the benefit from higher pension income in the quarter as expected.
On share count, we've repurchased another 500 million of shares at attractive prices. On a full year basis, we expect the fully diluted weighted average share count to be approximately 774 million shares. We have been and will continue to deploy capital to appropriate opportunities that will create the greatest value for our shareowners.
Free cash flow in the quarter, $1.3 billion, improved sequentially and was up 8% as compared to the second quarter of 2015, representing approximately 100% free cash flow conversion. The increase year-over-year was driven primarily by improving net income. Even with the increasing free cash flow, we were able to fund 16% more in capital expenditures or approximately $280 million in the quarter. These are principally the high ROI projects that we've discussed in the past. So as you can see, we continue to generate strong results in a relatively strong slow growth environment.
Slide 4 provides a quick recap of our year-to-date growth in the portfolio. Roughly 70% of the Honeywell portfolio is growing at a 5% core organic rate, led by fluorine products, security and fire, Process Solutions and Transportation Systems and -- as well as the 5 other businesses shown here. We have good visibility to continued outperformance based on our orders and backlog, stable end markets and new wins. And this outperformance includes overcoming the significant aero OEM incentives we face in our commercial aviation business. So a good sign as we head into the second half of 2016.
For the other 30% of the portfolio, core organic sales growth year-to-date has declined 13% due to the known headwinds that we've discussed previously. We've highlighted the market headwinds in our oil and gas businesses and UOP, which bottoms out in 2016, also the tough comps from the completion of the U.S. Postal Service win in S&PS and the softness in our services and international business within Defense & Space as well as the market pricing headwinds in Resins & Chemicals. These headwinds are largely expected to subside in the second half of 2016 and into 2017.
We think the slide illustrates the diversity of opportunity within the Honeywell portfolio. There's not one business that will make or break us. We continue to be confident about the portfolio and positions we have as we look to the second half of 2016 and to 2017.
Slide 5 provides more detail on our earnings per share for the quarter. Our operating initiatives, led by the deployment of HOS, continue to drive segment profit growth. On an operational basis, segment profit accounted for $0.16 of EPS growth in the quarter. We generated 110 basis points of operational improvement in segment margin, which compares well with the 100-plus basis point improvement we saw for the full year of 2015. Each of the segments are contributing. We have differentiated technologies with a software focus, and Honeywell user experience is driving the development of new products at higher margins. Our factories and sourcing organizations continue to mature. Our functional transportation is improving the quality of our back office while reducing its cost, and we continue to manage our indirect spend stringently. In addition, the previously funded restructuring as well as new restructuring actions have enabled us to continue improving our overall cost position.
The other impacts you see on the slide combine for $0.01 decline in earnings for the quarter. First, the M&A-related charges stemming from the 8 deals in the last 12 months resulted in $0.05 in year-over-year dilution, primarily due to acquisition accounting and pay-as-you-go costs with Elster having the largest impact. The incremental amortization from the deals will be a margin headwind for the rest of the year as we anticipated, but the net result from all acquisitions should improve in the second half as we lap some of the large onetime costs. Each of our acquisitions are performing well and are at or above our deal models. And as I mentioned, the organic growth embedded in these portfolio that we acquired, which is not included in our overall organic growth numbers, has been outstanding.
Second, foreign currency represented a $0.04 headwind in the quarter and should be roughly $0.15 for the full year. You'll recall that our hedging approach result in a euro rate of 1 24 for 2015 versus 1 10 for 2016.
Third, Aerospace OEM incentives reflect our continued investment in developing and growing our installed base on the right platforms in the commercial aviation industry. We now anticipate the full year 2016 year-over-year impact from OEM incentives to be more than $200 million, and the Q2 impact was approximately $0.03.
Lastly, below the line items and share count, we're net positive year-over-year by $0.07 and $0.04, respectively, as we previewed. On share count, our repurchases through the end of the second quarter were an average price of 106 per share. So overall, strong earnings results while overcoming significant headwind in what continues to be an uncertain macro environment.
Let's move to Slide 6. As Dave said, we announced the acquisition of Intelligrated earlier this month, building on the $6 billion-plus of acquisitions we completed since the beginning of 2015. Intelligrated designs, manufactures, integrates and installs complete warehouse automation solutions. Software and services that result in smarter distribution and fulfillment operations. Its supply chain and warehouse solutions drive improved productivity and lower costs for retailers, manufacturers and logistic providers around the world. The company's offerings include conveyor, sortation, [indiscernible] and robotics as well as automated storage and retrieval systems, all managed by advanced machine controls and software.
Intelligrated's software offers warehouse execution systems of scalable suite of software that managers -- manage the entire fulfillment process, including equipment, labor and business intelligence, integrated with voice and light-directed picking and coding technologies.
Intelligrated's mission-critical warehouse execution systems and software are fantastic complement to the scanning, mobile computer and voice automation technologies in S&PS. They have a large and growing installed base, which includes 30 of the top 50 U.S. retailers and 50 of the top 100 Internet retailers. They also maintain a strong leadership position, the approximately 20 billion warehouse automation segment. About 90% of the business today is in the U.S. so there's significant opportunities to expand globally through Honeywell's footprint and customer diversification.
Intelligrated's at the intersection of several key global megatrends namely e-commerce, software and automation with distinguished sales growth in a market that is forecast to grow 8% to 10% a year. S&PS was built initially through acquisitions, which we've continually expanded through strong organic growth and operational improvements. A good testament to our rigorous and proven M&A approach and the benefits of being patient with our capital deployment. We expect that this transaction to close by the end of the third quarter, and we're excited about the opportunities this acquisition has to offer.
Let's turn to Page 7. We wanted to spend a moment addressing Honeywell's proactive positioning ahead of Britain's recently announced exit from the European Union. You're all familiar with the developments and uncertainties, and we received a lot of questions about the impact on Honeywell. The process of actually exiting the EU will take sometime and thus may cause greater uncertainty in the short term, in addition to potentially slower U.K. and EU economic growth longer term. We'll continue to monitor our European short-cycle businesses for any signs of change. But as a reference point, our core organic sales in EU region has held up nicely year-to-date. We will continue to be cautious in our sales planning and stay conservative in terms of our cost structure and investments in the region. 
In addition to the ongoing productivity initiatives in our supply chain and functions, we're also prepared to leverage the flexibility we have to quickly adjust cost levels as the need arises. 
As it relates to currency, we've continued our foreign currency hedging approach. We hedged approximately 75% of our 2017 euro P&L exposure at $1.15 and roughly 50% of our 2017 British P&L exposure at $1.44. So while there may continue to be volatility on the sales line, our euro and pound-based earnings are protected, similar to the approach we took for 2016. We will continue to actively monitor the situation as we head into 2017.
Let's move to Slide 8 and discuss the Aerospace results. Sales declined 1% or 2% on a core organic basis below our expectations, primarily driven by the weaker-than-expected sales in Defense & Space, which I'll swing further in a moment. The Commercial Aviation OE sales decreased by 8% on a core organic basis, as higher volumes with OEMs and air transport and regional were more than offset by a 7-point headwind from higher OEM incentives and lower engine shipments in business and general aviation. The BGA OE business in particular faced a difficult prior year comparison which, as a reminder, grew north of 20% in the second quarter of 2015. And as we highlighted last month, the demand environment in business jets overall is slower.
Commercial aviation aftermarket sales continue to be robust, growing 6% on a core organic basis. On the spares side, we saw an increase in airline and BGA spares, driven by strong mechanical demand and higher GX aviation sales, including satcom and software upgrades. Repair and overhaul activities increased, in line with flight hours, which remain strong in the second quarter as well.
Defense & Space sales declined 10% on a core organic basis, driven primarily by difficult prior year comparisons in the international business as larger projects were completed as well as the lower sales to key channel partners. Our U.S. services and space businesses declined year-over-year due to unexpected program delays and completions of other programs. Though we continue to perform well in our U.S. aftermarket business, we've increased spares and retrofit sales. In addition, our commercial helicopter business continues to be impacted by the declines in the oil and gas markets. Reported sales reflect the impact of COM DEV of the satellite communications acquisition, which has performed well this year.
Transportation Systems sales increased 3% on a core organic basis due to new platform launches and continued volume growth in both gas and diesel-light vehicle applications. We continue to grow in our light-vehicle diesel business in Europe, which was up single-digit in the quarter. The growth in light vehicle gas was also the most prominent in Europe and China.
Aerospace segment margin expanded 60 basis points or 80 basis points, excluding the dilutive impact of acquisitions. This was driven by productivity net of inflation and commercial excellence, partially offset by continued investments for growth, including higher OEM incentives and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency.
Let's turn to the ACS results on Slide 9. ACS sales increased 9%, reflecting the favorable impact from acquisition, primarily Elster. On a core organic basis, sales were down minus 1% in the second quarter, in line with our guidance. The segment margin expanded -- or segment margin expansion improved to 50 basis points in the quarter, excluding the impact of M&A. A big improvement from the 10 basis points expansion in the first quarter, and we expect ongoing acceleration the second half of the year.
Sales in energy, safety and security, so the products businesses, were down 2% on a core organic basis in the second quarter. The momentum continued in security and fire globally with strong growth rates in both residential and commercial markets, coupled with the benefit from new product introductions and further penetration in high-growth regions. Our China business overall in the ACS grew high single digit in the quarter, and we saw a double-digit growth in India. We've continued to outperform in our high-growth regions driven by our connected ACS China strategy and the benefits from our ongoing investments for growth. These improvements were offset by lower volume S&PS, primarily from the 2015 completion of the U.S. Postal  service contract. We expect S&PS to return to growth in the fourth quarter.
Building Solutions & Distribution sales were up 3% on a core organic basis in the quarter. We experienced continued strength on the distribution side with strong growth in North America and EMEA across our a video, access and intrusion product line. In building solutions, we saw modest growth, reflecting strength in services, partially offset by softness in the project installation business. Orders growth in the services and energy retrofit businesses was more than offset by decline in the project businesses. While we remain encouraged by the solid improvements we've seen in our energy portfolio in HDS, orders that doubled in that portfolio through the first half 2016. This is been driven by sales excellence and a differentiated offering that is leading to multiple awards. The buildings solutions backlog and service bank increased low single digit in the quarter on an organic basis. 
Segment margins ACS continues to benefit from productivity initiatives, a favorable impact from restructuring in commercial excellence while maintaining investments for growth in our connected product offerings and in high-growth regions. Mix was slightly better last quarter, and we expect this to continue in the second half.
On Page 10 -- I'm now on Page 10. This morning, we highlighted that ACS will be split into 2 newly created business groups. I want to share a little bit more information on that. 
The first, Home and Building Technologies will be roughly a $9 billion enterprise, which comprises our legacy Environmental & Energy Solutions, including Elster; security and fire; and Building Solutions & Distribution businesses. E&ES' Industrial Combustion and Thermal business will be reclassified to PMT. The HBT business will be led by Terrence Hahn, who previously ran our Transportation Systems unit for the past 3 years and has been with Honeywell for over 9 years.
The second segment, Safety and Productivity Solutions, will be roughly a $5 billion business comprising the former sensing and productivity solutions and industrial safety businesses, including the recent acquisition, Intelligrated. The new S&PS will be led by John Waldron, who's currently President of our sensing and productivity solutions business unit and previously was President of Scanning and Mobility. Today's announcement represents yet another step in the evolution of the Honeywell portfolio. We're constantly looking at ways to improve our organic growth profile. We think a smaller, more focused segment structure will allow us to accelerate breakthrough growth in new product introduction by being close to our customers. Also [indiscernible] instructors will lead the faster decision making in a more efficient organization. This analysis build on the momentum in ACS and across the entire portfolio following the acquisition of Elster, Xtralis, Intelligrated and 5 other acquisitions since July of last year. The change further positions these businesses to invest in growth and execute the strategic plans best suited to each portfolio, and we have the right leaders in place to drive these actions.
We expect to begin reporting under the new segment structure effective with our third quarter 2016 results and expect to provide comparative financial information at that time. So more to come on this in the coming months.
Let's move to Slide 11 to discuss the PMT results. PMT sales declined 4% on a core organic basis, in line with our guidance. It continues to be a challenging market environment for oil and gas. Our orders and backlog have remained resilient, and the leadership team has been unrelenting in its focus to overcome these headwinds. 
So starting with EOP, sales were down as expected driven by lower gas processing, licensing and equipment sale. The rate of sales declined improved significantly from the first quarter. In gas processing, we secured 5 new domestic wins in the first half, although that market remains a bit sluggish. On the catalyst side, overall demand remain strong, and we expect an acceleration of growth in the second half of the year. UOP orders were modestly higher in the quarter, including a strong double-digit increase in the catalyst business, and UOP backlog was close to 10% higher than second quarter 2015.
Process Solutions continues to outperform its peers in the challenging environment. We have a unique combination of automation technology, field instrumentation products and aftermarket offerings, including software solutions. Core organic sales increased 8% in the quarter, driven by double-digit growth on our projects business and higher software and service sales. Conversion of the global megaproject backlog where we serve as the main contractor providing control and safety solutions for large installations remain strong in the second quarter, and we expect this trend to continue throughout the rest of the year.
Through the recent mega project wins, HPS continues to build out its massive installed base, which will benefit our services and aftermarket business in future periods. Reported sales were higher in the quarter due to the impact from the Elster acquisition.
Advanced Materials sales were down 2% on a core organic basis, driven by a challenging pricing conditions in Resins & Chemicals, partially offset by continued strong demand and more than 20% growth for Solstice low global warming products. We presently have roughly $3.5 billion of signed agreements for Solstice and are building out production capacity to meet the increased global customer demand.
As expected, PMT segment margins were down 20 basis points to 21.1%, primarily due the impact of lower volumes overall and continued growth investments, partially offset by benefits from previous restructuring actions in commercial excellence. So overall market conditions continue to be tough for our businesses in PMT are doing well, and we expect an even better second half.
I'm now on Slide 12 with a preview of the third quarter. You'll note that the guidance reflects the ACS structure prior to this morning's announcement. We'll be updating the reporting for the new structure starting the third quarter, as I mentioned.
So for total Honeywell, we're planning for sales of $10 billion to $10.2 billion. That's up 4% to 6% reported or up flat -- or flat to up 1% on a core organic basis. The sales guidance for the quarter does not reflect the impact back of the Intelligrated acquisition as we expect the transaction to close near quarter end.
Segment margins are expected to be down 10 basis points to up 10 basis points, excluding M&A, or down 40 to 60 basis points on a reported basis. Finally, EPS is expected to be in the range of $1.67 to $1.72, up 6% to 10% normalized for income tax at 26.5% in both years.
Starting with Aerospace. Sales are expected to be down 1% to up 1% on a core organic basis. In commercial aviation OE, we're expecting sales to be down double digit, driven by the impact of OEM incentives and continued decline in business and general aviation, partially offset by a ramp-up on key platforms in air transport and regional.
Excluding the OEM incentives, commercial aviation OE is expected to be down mid-single-digit. Commercial aviation aftermarket sales are expected to grow mid-single digit, again with strength in both airline and business jet spare sales, including higher satcom and other software upgrades. 
Defense & Space sales are expected to improve sequentially, but be modestly down on a year-over-year basis as higher product sales to the U.S. government are more than offset by challenging prior year comparisons in the international business, the impact of large project wind down and the continued softness in U.S. services. 
In Transportation Systems, sales are expected to be up low single digit with continued strong growth in light vehicle gas applications, partially offset by slower growth in diesel, based on the timing of new launches. As for Aerospace margin rates, we expect to be down 30 to 50 basis points, excluding M&A, driven by higher OEM incentives, the unfavorable impact of foreign currency and the unfavorable impact on margin of higher OE shipments to air transport and regional customers. Now this will be partially offset by productivity and commercial excellence.
Moving to ACS. Sales are expected to be flat to up 1% on a core organic basis or up 11% to 12% on a reported basis driven by acquisitions. We expect ESS growth sales to be similar to the second quarter on a core organic basis, led by continued momentum in our security and fire businesses and in our high-growth regions, but more than offset by the declines we highlighted in S&PS.
In BSD, we're expecting low to mid-single digit core organic growth, driven primarily by continued strength in the Americas Distribution business in both residential and commercial and markets.
Excluding the dilutive impact from M&A, ACS margin rate is expected to improve 90 to 110 basis points, driven by commercial excellence, continued productivity and the benefits of restructuring. ACS's reported segment margin rate in the second quarter is expected to be up 10 to 30 basis points -- sorry, third quarter, expected to be up 10 to 30 basis points. In PMT, sales are expected to be up flat -- or expected to be up flat to up 2% on a core organic basis or up 2% to 4% reported. UOP sales declines are expected to moderate in the third quarter but still be down double digits on a year-over-year basis, driven primarily by continued declines in licensing, equipment and gas processing, partially offset by strength in the catalyst business.
Based on our growing UOP backlog, we expect the catalyst sales growth rates to improve in the second half of the year, particularly in the fourth quarter. HPS sales are expected to be up mid-single digits on a core organic basis, driven by continued conversion of global megaprojects as I mentioned earlier as well as higher software and service sales.
Advanced Materials sales are expected to be up low to mid-single digits on a core organic basis, driven by strength in fluorine products and solstice sales and improving specialty products line, benefiting from new product introductions.
PMT reported segment margin rate expected to be down 100 to 120 basis points and down 70 to 90 basis points, excluding the dilutive impact of M&A, driven by lower volumes, the unfavorable impact of lower UOP licensing sales, market pricing headwinds in Resins & Chemicals  and continued investments for growth, partially offset by productivity, net of inflation.
Slide 13 provides our full year 2000 expectations by business as compared to the initial guidance we provided back in December. While there are a number of puts and takes within the overall portfolio, we're tracking to our initial full year core organic sales guidance for Honeywell.
In Aerospace, commercial OE continue to see improvement in ATR with a ramp-up of key platforms like the A350 and A320 as well as a Boeing 737, 787. While the rest we saw this quarter, the demand environment in business jets is slower than we anticipated, and we expect this trend to continue from [ph] the second half. Meanwhile, our commercial aftermarket business is coming better than anticipated as we build on a 6% core organic growth achieve year-to-date driven, by stronger flight hours and continued spares growth in repair and overhaul activities. Defense and space will remain challenged throughout the year as the U.S. services and space businesses anticipate further program delays in the second half and as oil and gas market declines continue to adversely impact the commercial helicopter market.
In total, ACS is performing largely as we expected. The products businesses are coming in slightly lower largely due to lower volume in our sensing and productivity solutions businesses due to some channel headwinds while building solutions and distribution is coming in much better, driven by double-digit core organic growth performance in this first quarter and continued strength in Americas distribution as we move into the second half.
In PMT, our Process Solutions business continues to outperform, driven by the strong conversion of the global megaproject backlog. Our software solutions for generating strong demand, and we anticipate this to continue through the remainder of the year.
In UOP, activity continues to be soft given the slowdowns in orders in our gas processing, licensing and equipment businesses, but as I indicated, we expect a very strong second half for UOP's catalyst business. The one balance no change to our core organic sales outlook in total, but we continue to monitor the businesses closely.
I'm moving to Slide 14. As Dave mentioned, we're raising the low end of our full year EPS guidance by $0.05 with a new range of $6.60 to $6.70. That's up 8 to 10 basis -- or 8% to 10% from 2015. The new range reflects the outperformance in the first half of the year. There's some puts and takes among these segments from the guidance we provided in April, but overall, very strong year expected for Honeywell in 2016 once again.
In total, we now expect core organic sales growth of approximately 1% and total sales to be between $40 billion and $40.6 billion so up 4% to 5% reported. The revised guidance reflects the incremental headwinds we've seen Aerospace, particularly in our BGA and Defense & Space businesses. This guidance does not reflect the Intelligrated acquisition or the planed spinoff of Resins & Chemicals.
Segment margin expansion is still expected to be up 10 to 50 basis points or 80 to 110 basis points, excluding the dilutive impact of M&A, driven by commercial excellence, restructuring benefits and continued proactive cost management. We expect the full year income tax rate to be approximately 26.5% and our share count to be approximately 774 million shares or approximately 2% lower than the 2015 weighted average share count of 789 million.
Finally, we continue to expect free cash flow in the range of $4.6 billion to $4.8 billion, up 5% to 10% from 2015, with CapEx investments roughly flat to 2015 at approximately $1.1 billion. This will drive free cash flow conversion of approximately 90% for the full year.
Let me move to Slide 15 for a quick summary, before heading it -- or turning it back to Mark for Q&A. We had a solid first half adding to our strong performance track record and generating moment for the rest of the year. Once again, we've demonstrated that we can deliver at the high end of our aggressive earnings commitments even with limited help from the macro environment. A big reminder of the value of our diversified and balanced portfolio and the strength of the Honeywell Operating System. And we again put to work a sizable amount of shareowner capital in the quarter, including $1.5 billion in additional acquisitions and $0.5 billion in share repurchases, which will pave the way for future earnings and cash growth.
The uncertainty in the macro environment is not new for us. We have and will continue to plan conservatively. We continue to focus in executing sustainable productivity actions, including delivering on the strong restructuring pipeline. We have roughly $300 million of actions to be carried out.
We're making smart bets on innovation and breakthrough initiatives to continue our investments to further penetrate high-growth regions and expand capacity. We're in the process of planning for 2017, and our management team is focused on execution. We feel confident that our balanced portfolio is in line to favorable macro trends and focused cost disciplined will continue to outperform.
Without further ado, let's move to Q&A"

What's going on out there that gives you the confidence that we're not walking into an even tougher back half of the year because the first half of this year has been pretty tough, and some of your peers reported pretty tough numbers, too. So it's not just you guys. But I mean, negative core growth is something we don't normally see in an expansionary time period, right? So I guess, I'm asking a general question what you think about the world."

I don't think we've ever referred to this environment as being expansionary. And the way I would describe the overall performance and why we say strong, if you take a look at the cash we generated, if you take a look at the operational margin rate improvement, 110 basis points, which is consistent with what we were doing last year. It's just all the stuff to the right of the chart was moving in the right direction. This year, it's not. If you take a look at the EPS growth, we've been able to deliver on that, and the chart Tom showed that said about $0.15 or $0.16 of the total $0.14 increase or $0.15 increase came from operations. That's pretty strong operational performance. Now you could say, okay, this 2% negative core organic, that's true. It's also consistent with what we had forecasted. It was our guidance range, so it's not like it came as a surprise. And the headwinds are no different than what we've talked about in the past. And that's why Tom tried to show that 70% of the portfolio is actually growing 5%. We've just got these unusual headwinds, most of which -- well, all of which dissipate this year. If you take a look at UOP, I mean, you know what's happening on the oil and gas side, and we've always said our diversity of opportunity will offset that. And we do believe that in 2016, that ends. This is the bottom for that sector. If you take a look at sensing and productivity solutions business and think of this as a lot driven by scanning and mobility where we had this huge U.S. Postal Service auto last year that we're -- in terms of a comp, it's just going to be negative. It just did. It would have been impossible to make that up. Our Resins & Chemicals pricing, which you're familiar with, really has no effect on the bottom line, does affect growth when we look at the overall number. And then some in Defense & Space where there's just been delays in orders and the commercial helo [ph] market largely driven by oil and gas has been difficult. Both headwinds stopped. It's just a matter of dealing with them as they are today, and 70% of the portfolio is growing 5%. So I think it's pretty darn good overall. And yes, I understand the point about minus 2, but we also forecasted, it's not like it came as a surprise."

I would say that in addition to the operational improvement that's in the triple digits, I mean, when you look at the items that brought us back to a reported margin rate that was lower than that 110 basis points, they're either items that are -- will turn for us or that are of an investment nature. So, for example, you look at foreign exchange, we're going from an FX rate of 1 24 last year to 1 10 this quarter. I talked about 2017 at some of the hedging we've done. So that will be an actual -- at our tails next year. When I look at the OEM incentives that we're making, I mean, this was the year that we've always flagged as having to deal with over 200 million of P&L impacts from the increased incentives. Those level off next year and actually help us to build an installed base for service opportunities and in the longer term, those decrease so it will be another tailwind for us. And third, you've got a lot of M&A going on. We've done 8 acquisitions in the last year. There is a lot of focus on that. But when you're doing acquisitions, especially the sizable amounts we've done, you do get some headwinds in the earlier quarters from the purchase accounting step up, the integration team costs and the like. And those will all turn on -- turn for us as well and really be a nice margin driver for us in the future. We're really happy with the acquisitions. And as I said, we don't include the organic growth that we're experiencing in those acquisitions in the minus 2% organic growth rate that we talked about, but those acquisitions grew 8% to 9% on their own if you compare it how they did under prior ownership to how they did with Honeywell. So pretty strong performance. So we're really actually excited about these various factors because they're going to be -- they're going to turn and have a positive influence for next year."

As I'm sure you've seen by now, Honeywell delivered another quarter of double-digit earnings growth, capping off a strong first half of the year in a challenging global economy. Earnings per share of $1.66 increased 10% coming in at the high end of our guidance range. Sales of $10 billion were up 2% on a reported basis and down 2% on a core organic basis, in line with our guidance for the quarter.
We saw a good growth in commercial aviation aftermarket and transportation systems, in our residential, commercial and China businesses within ACS, and in process solutions and fluorine products in PMT.
Segment margin expanded 10 basis points to 18.5%. On an operational basis, this was 110 basis points of improvement as we continue our focus on commercial excellence, execution on previously funded restructuring actions and maintaining disciplined cost controls. We are again raising the low end of our 2016 full year earnings guidance to a new range of $6.60 to $6.70 or up 8% to 10% year-over-year given our first half performance.
During the second quarter, we had several announcements that I'd like to highlight this morning. We announced that Darius Adamczyk will be our next CEO effective March 31, 2017, and I will serve as Executive Chairman through April 2018. This announcement is the next step in ensuring a seamless leadership transition, which will position Honeywell for continued outperformance in 2017 and beyond. Darius is the right person to lead the company into a new era, where we will need to keep evolving, become even more global, to become more of a software company and to become more nimble. He has the growth mindset, global acumen and software expertise to be a highly successful CEO for Honeywell. The board and I are confident that Darius will be a great leader in executing our strategic plans and driving organic growth. My leadership team and I remain as focused as ever in delivering on our commitments while ensuring a smooth leadership transition.
In addition, this morning, we announced that we will realign ACS into 2 new segments: Home and Building Technologies, and Safety and Productivity Solutions. We will begin reporting results on this basis in the third quarter. Tom will speak more about this later, but we think this is the right time to separate ACS into 2 smaller, more nimble businesses that will operate more efficiently and adapt more quickly to changing global markets. We have 2 fantastic leaders in Terrence Hahn and John Waldron to lead the new segments, and we're excited about the growth opportunities in each portfolio as we look ahead to 2017.
Alex Ismail, who served as President and CEO of Automation and Control Solutions for the past 2 years, will leave the company. Alex had a very successful career at Honeywell in Aerospace; Transportation Systems; and most recently, ACS where he delivered strong operating margin expansion and improved operational excellence, completed several acquisitions in new strategic adjacencies like smart meters, accelerated growth in high-growth regions and built a strong pipeline of new products, IoT solutions and software for home, building and worker applications. Alex is very supportive of the change. He's a well-liked and respected leader, and we wish him the best in his next endeavor. 
We remain very active on the capital deployment front also. Earlier this month, we announced the acquisition of Intelligrated for $1.5 billion. Intelligrated serves the high-growth e-commerce industry, offering complete warehouse automation solutions, software and services. Intelligrated has a large and growing installed base to customers that align well with our new Safety and Productivity Solutions business and they serve a highly attractive market that is forecasted to grow 8% to 10% a year. 
We also announced the spinoff of our Resins & Chemicals business into an independent public company called AdvanSix. The spinoff of AdvanSix is progressing well, and we expect completion this year. These portfolio of changes continue to move our growth profile upward and build on our great positions, good industries.
In June, Shane Tedjarati and his team hosted approximately 20 investors and analysts in China to learn more about Honeywell's tremendous growth opportunities in high-growth regions. The trip covered 4 cities in 5 days and included meetings with Chinese government officials, local economists and CEOs, business innovation centers and high-tech incubators, site tours of Honeywell's turbo factory in Wuhan and S&PS factory in Suzhou as well as an in-depth HGR business review. This trip served as an excellent venue for our shareowners and analysts to better understand our HGR strategies, including becoming the Chinese competitor, East-For-East and East For Rest, and how our experience in China has driven our strategic thinking and provided a foundation for further growth in other high-growth regions. High-growth regions have driven approximately 50% of our growth over the last 10 years, and we expect it to continue to be a key growth engine for Honeywell going forward.
And our focus on software continues with the announcement of our new digital transportation business, part of Honeywell process solutions. This business will help industrial companies harness the power of the industrial Internet of Things to make their operations more reliable, more efficient and safer. The Industrial Internet of Things was the key topic at our 41st Annual Honeywell User Group Conference in San Antonio, where we introduced our new uniformed suite. This suite is our analytics platform that provides realtime digital intelligence to turn plant data into actionable information. At the user group conference, more than 1,000 people gathered to discuss IIoT's tremendous potential to solve the toughest challenges facing industrial companies today. Honeywell's portfolio of technologies, advanced analytics and deep domain knowledge position us well to utilize data to help customers operate their plants more safely and efficiently, and reduce unplanned downtime.
We're also monitoring the macro environment in light of Britain's recently announced exit from the European Union, and we expect minimal near-term impact. Tom will take you through some of the actions we've taken to mitigate potential risks, but it's important to note that our planning framework hasn't changed. We'll be cautious in our sales planning and continue to plan our costs and spending conservatively, ensuring we remain flexible as a company. And we'll maintain our seed planting for the future supported by a robust pipeline of funded restructuring projects. We'll continue to support growth, focusing on winning in high-growth regions, advancing our superior software capabilities, and effectively using HOS Gold to drive breakthrough initiatives and deliver high-quality products to our customers globally.
So with that, I'll turn it over to Tom."

I'm now on Slide 3, which shows the second quarter results. Reported sales of $10 billion increased 2% reflecting impact of acquisitions and declined 2% on a core organic basis. We saw a continued growth in our commercial a",4822,"Thanks, Dave, and good morning. I'm now on Slide 3, which shows the second quarter results. Reported sales of $10 billion increased 2% reflecting impact of acquisitions and declined 2% on a core organic basis. We saw a continued growth in our commercial aviation aftermarket, security and fire, Process Solutions and Transportation Systems, which I'll talk more about on the business slides. 
The continued declines in our oil and gas businesses in UOP and difficult comps in S&PS were largely as we expected. In our high-growth regions, India grew 30% -- nearly 30%, while in China, Aero and ACS continued the momentum from the first quarter, partially offset by moderating declines in PMT. All of our recent acquisitions are performing at or above the deal financial model, and the sales from our 7 recent acquisitions collectively grew in the high single-digit basis on a core organic basis this quarter.
Segment margin was up 10 basis points versus the prior year, at the high end of our guidance range, or up 50 basis points, excluding the dilutive impact of acquisitions. As Dave mentioned, on an operational basis -- so that's further excluding the impacts of foreign exchange, the Aerospace OEM incentive and raw material pass-through pricing in Resins & Chemicals, segment margin improved 110 basis points. We expect the overall margin expansion will continue to improve in the second half.
Earnings per share of $1.66 were up 10%, coming in at the high end of our guidance range. Also we funded $97 million of restructuring projects. That's $53 million net of reversals, largely offsetting the benefit from higher pension income in the quarter as expected.
On share count, we've repurchased another 500 million of shares at attractive prices. On a full year basis, we expect the fully diluted weighted average share count to be approximately 774 million shares. We have been and will continue to deploy capital to appropriate opportunities that will create the greatest value for our shareowners.
Free cash flow in the quarter, $1.3 billion, improved sequentially and was up 8% as compared to the second quarter of 2015, representing approximately 100% free cash flow conversion. The increase year-over-year was driven primarily by improving net income. Even with the increase in free cash flow, we were able to fund 16% more in capital expenditures or approximately $280 million in the quarter. These are principally the high ROI projects that we've discussed in the past. So as you can see, we continue to generate strong results in a relatively slow growth environment.
Slide 4 provides a quick recap of our year-to-date growth in the portfolio. Roughly 70% of the Honeywell portfolio is growing at a 5% core organic rate, led by Fluorine Products, security and fire, Process Solutions and Transportation Systems and -- as well as the 5 other businesses shown here. We have good visibility to continued outperformance based on our orders and backlog, stable end markets and new wins. And this outperformance includes overcoming the significant Aero OEM incentives we face in our commercial aviation business. So a good sign as we head into the second half of 2016.
For the other 30% of the portfolio, core organic sales growth year-to-date has declined 13% due to the known headwinds that we've discussed previously. We've highlighted the market headwinds in our oil and gas businesses in UOP, which bottoms out in 2016, also the tough comps from the completion of the U.S. Postal Service win in S&PS, and the softness in our services and international business within Defense & Space as well as the market pricing headwinds in Resins & Chemicals. These headwinds are largely expected to subside in the second half of 2016 and into 2017.
We think the slide illustrates the diversity of opportunity within the Honeywell portfolio. There's not one business that will make or break us. We continue to be confident about the portfolio and the positions we have as we look to the second half of 2016 and to 2017.
Slide 5 provides more detail on our earnings per share for the quarter. Our operating initiatives, led by the deployment of HOS, continue to drive segment profit growth. On an operational basis, segment profit accounted for $0.16 of EPS growth in the quarter. We generated 110 basis points of operational improvement in segment margin, which compares well with the 100-plus basis point improvement we saw for the full year of 2015. Each of the segments are contributing. We have differentiated technologies with a software focus, and Honeywell user experience is driving the development of new products at higher margins. 
Our factories and sourcing organizations continue to mature. Our functional transformation is improving the quality of our back office while reducing its cost, and we continue to manage our indirect spend stringently. In addition, the previously funded restructuring as well as new restructuring actions have enabled us to continue improving our overall cost position.
The other impacts you see on the slide combined for a $0.01 decline in earnings for the quarter. First, the M&A-related charges stemming from the 8 deals in the last 12 months resulted in $0.05 in year-over-year dilution, primarily due to acquisition accounting and pay-as-you-go costs with Elster having the largest impact. The incremental amortization from the deals will be a margin headwind for the rest of the year as we anticipated, but the net results from all acquisitions should improve in the second half as we lap some of the large onetime costs. Each of our acquisitions are performing well and are at or above our deal models. And as I mentioned, the organic growth embedded in these portfolios that we acquired, which is not included in our overall organic growth numbers, has been outstanding.
Second, foreign currency represented a $0.04 headwind in the quarter and should be roughly $0.15 for the full year. You'll recall that our hedging approach result in a euro rate of 1.24 for 2015 versus 1.10 for 2016.
Third, Aerospace OEM incentives reflect our continued investment in developing and growing our installed base on the right platforms in the commercial aviation industry. We now anticipate the full year 2016 year-over-year impact from OEM incentives to be more than $200 million, and the Q2 impact was approximately $0.03.
Lastly, below-the-line items and share count were net positive year-over-year by $0.07 and $0.04, respectively, as we previewed. On share count, our repurchases through the end of the second quarter were at an average price of $106 per share. So overall, strong earnings results while overcoming significant headwinds in what continues to be an uncertain macro environment.
Let's move to Slide 6. As Dave said, we announced the acquisition of Intelligrated earlier this month, building on the $6 billion-plus of acquisitions we've completed since the beginning of 2015. Intelligrated designs, manufactures, integrates and installs complete warehouse automation solutions. Software and services that result in smarter distribution and fulfillment operations. Its supply chain and warehouse solutions drive improved productivity and lower costs for retailers, manufacturers and logistic providers around the world. The company's offerings include conveyor, sortation, palletizers and robotics as well as automated storage and retrieval systems, all managed by advanced machine control and software.
Intelligrated's software offers warehouse execution systems of scalable suite of software that managers -- manage the entire fulfillment process, including equipment, labor and business intelligence, integrated with voice and light-directed picking and putting technologies.
Intelligrated's mission-critical warehouse execution systems and software are a fantastic complement to the scanning, mobile computer and voice automation technologies in S&PS. They have a large and growing installed base, which includes 30 of the top 50 U.S. retailers and 50 of the top 100 Internet retailers. They also maintain a strong leadership position, the approximately 20 billion warehouse automation segment. About 90% of the business today is in the U.S. so there are significant opportunities to expand globally through Honeywell's footprint and customer diversification.
Intelligrated is at the intersection of several key global megatrends namely e-commerce, software and automation with distinguished sales growth in a market that is forecast to grow 8% to 10% a year. S&PS was built initially through acquisitions, which we've continually expanded through strong organic growth and operational improvements, a good testament to our rigorous and proven M&A approach and the benefits of being patient with our capital deployment. We expect this transaction to close by the end of the third quarter, and we're excited about the opportunities this acquisition has to offer.
Let's turn to Page 7. We wanted to spend a moment addressing Honeywell's proactive positioning ahead of Britain's recently announced exit from the European Union. You're all familiar with the developments and uncertainties, and we received a lot of questions about the impact on Honeywell. The process of actually exiting the EU will take some time and thus may cause greater uncertainty in the short term, in addition to potentially slower U.K. and EU economic growth longer term. We'll continue to monitor our European short-cycle businesses for any signs of change. But as a reference point, our core organic sales in EU region has held up nicely year-to-date. We will continue to be cautious in our sales planning and stay conservative in terms of our cost structure and investments in the region. 
In addition to the ongoing productivity initiatives in our supply chain and functions, we're also prepared to leverage the flexibility we have to quickly adjust cost levels as the need arises. 
As it relates to currency, we've continued our foreign currency hedging approach. We've hedged approximately 75% of our 2017 euro P&L exposure at $1.15 and roughly 50% of our 2017 British P&L exposure at $1.44. So while there may continue to be volatility on the sales line, our euro and pound-based earnings are protected, similar to the approach we took for 2016. We will continue to actively monitor the situation as we head into 2017.
Let's move to Slide 8 and discuss the Aerospace results. Sales declined 1% or 2% on a core organic basis below our expectations, primarily driven by weaker-than-expected sales in Defense & Space, which I'll explain further in a moment. The commercial aviation OE sales decreased by 8% on a core organic basis, as higher volumes with OEMs and Air Transport and Regional were more than offset by a 7-point headwind from higher OEM incentives and lower engine shipments in business and general aviation. The BGA OE business, in particular, faced a difficult prior year comparison which, as a reminder, grew north of 20% in the second quarter of 2015. And as we highlighted last month, the demand environment in business jets overall is slower.
Commercial aviation aftermarket sales continue to be robust, growing 6% on a core organic basis. On the spares side, we saw an increase in airline and BGA spares, driven by strong mechanical demand and higher GX aviation sales, including Satcom and software upgrades. Repair and overhaul activities increased, in line with flight hours, which remain strong in the second quarter as well.
Defense & Space sales declined 10% on a core organic basis, driven primarily by difficult prior year comparisons in the international business as larger projects were completed as well as lower sales to key channel partners. Our U.S. services and space businesses declined year-over-year due to unexpected program delays and completions of other programs, but we continue to perform well in our U.S. aftermarket business with increased spares and retrofit sales. In addition, our commercial helicopter business continues to be impacted by declines in the oil and gas markets. Reported sales reflect the impact of COM DEV of the satellite communications acquisition, which has performed well this year.
Transportation Systems sales increased 3% on a core organic basis due to new platform launches and continued volume growth in both gas and diesel-light vehicle applications. We continue to grow in our light-vehicle diesel business in Europe, which was up single digit in the quarter. The growth in light vehicle gas was also most prominent in Europe and China.
Aerospace segment margin expanded 60 basis points or 80 basis points, excluding the dilutive impact of acquisitions. This was driven by productivity, net of inflation and commercial excellence, partially offset by continued investments for growth, including higher OEM incentives and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency.
Let's turn to the ACS results on Slide 9. ACS sales increased 9%, reflecting the favorable impact from acquisitions, primarily Elster. On a core organic basis, sales were down minus 1% in the second quarter, in line with our guidance. The segment margin expanded -- or segment margin expansion improved to 50 basis points in the quarter, excluding the impact of M&A. A big improvement from the 10 basis points expansion in the first quarter, and we expect ongoing acceleration the second half of the year.
Sales in Energy, Safety and Security, so the products businesses, were down 2% on a core organic basis in the second quarter. The momentum continued in security and fire, globally, with strong growth rates in both residential and commercial markets, coupled with the benefit from new product introductions and further penetration in the high-growth regions. Our China business overall in ACS grew high single digit in the quarter, and we saw a double-digit growth in India. We've continued to outperform in our high-growth regions driven by our connected ACS China strategy and the benefits from our ongoing investments for growth. These improvements were offset by lower volume S&PS, primarily from the 2015 completion of the U.S. Postal Service contract. We expect S&PS to return to growth in the fourth quarter.
Building Solutions & Distribution sales were up 3% on a core organic basis in the quarter. We experienced continued strength on the distribution side with strong growth in North America and EMEA across our a video, access and intrusion product line. In Building Solutions, we saw a modest growth, reflecting strength in services, partially offset by softness in the project installation business. Orders growth in the services and energy retrofit businesses was more than offset by decline in the project businesses. So we remain encouraged by the solid improvements we've seen in our energy portfolio in HBS. Orders have doubled in that portfolio through the first half of 2016. This has been driven by sales excellence and a differentiated offering that is leading to multiple awards. The Buildings Solutions backlog and service increased low single digit in the quarter on an organic basis. 
Segment margins ACS continues to benefit from productivity initiatives, the favorable impact from restructuring and commercial excellence while maintaining investments for growth in our connected product offerings and in high-growth regions. Mix was slightly better than last quarter, and we expect this to continue in the second half.
On Page 10 -- I'm now on Page 10. This morning, we highlighted that ACS will be split into 2 newly created business groups. I want to share a little bit more information on that. 
The first, Home and Building Technologies will be roughly a $9 billion enterprise, which comprises our legacy Environmental & Energy Solutions, including Elster; security and fire; and Building Solutions & Distribution businesses. E&ES' Industrial Combustion and Thermal business will be reclassified to PMT. The HBT business will be led by Terrence Hahn, who previously ran our Transportation Systems unit for the past 3 years and has been with Honeywell for over 9 years.
The second segment, Safety and Productivity Solutions, will be roughly a $5 billion business comprising the former Sensing and Productivity Solutions and industrial safety businesses, including the recent acquisition, Intelligrated. The new S&PS will be led by John Waldron, who's currently President of our Sensing and Productivity Solutions business unit and previously was President of Scanning and Mobility. 
Today's announcement represents yet another step in the evolution of the Honeywell portfolio. We're constantly looking at ways to improve our organic growth profile. We think a smaller, more focused segment structure will allow us to accelerate breakthrough growth and new product introduction by being closer to our customers. Also, fewer layers and structures will lead the faster decision making in a more efficient organization. This analysis builds on the momentum in ACS and across the entire portfolio following the acquisitions of Elster, Xtralis, Intelligrated and 5 other acquisitions since July of last year. The change further positions these businesses to invest in growth and execute the strategic plans best suited to each portfolio, and we have the right leaders in place to drive these actions.
We expect to begin reporting under the new segment structure effective with our third quarter 2016 results and expect to provide comparative financial information at that time. So more to come on this in the coming months.
Let's move to Slide 11 to discuss the PMT results. PMT sales declined 4% on a core organic basis, in line with our guidance. It continues to be a challenging market environment for oil and gas. Our orders and backlog have remained resilient, and the leadership team has been unrelenting in its focus to overcome these headwinds. 
So starting with UOP, sales were down as expected driven by lower gas processing, licensing and equipment sale. The rate of sales decline improved significantly from the first quarter. In gas processing, we secured 5 new domestic wins in the first half, however that market remains a bit sluggish. On the catalyst side, overall demand remain strong, and we expect an acceleration of growth in the second half of the year. UOP orders were modestly higher in the quarter, including a strong double-digit increase in the catalyst business, and UOP backlog was close to 10% higher than the second quarter of 2015.
Process Solutions continues to outperform its peers in a challenging environment. We have a unique combination of automation technology, field instrumentation products and aftermarket offerings, including software solutions. Core organic sales increased 8% in the quarter, driven by double-digit growth on our projects business and higher software and service sales. Conversion of the global megaproject backlog where we serve as the main contractor providing control and safety solutions for large installations remain strong in the second quarter, and we expect this trend to continue throughout the rest of the year.
Through the recent megaproject wins, HPS continues to build out its massive installed base, which will benefit our services and aftermarket business in future periods. Reported sales were higher in the quarter due to the impact from the Elster acquisition.
Advanced Materials sales were down 2% on a core organic basis, driven by a challenging pricing conditions in Resins & Chemicals, partially offset by continued strong demand and more than 20% growth for Solstice low global warming products. We presently have roughly $3.5 billion of signed agreements for Solstice and are building out production capacity to meet the increased global customer demand.
As expected, PMT segment margins were down 20 basis points to 21.1%, primarily due the impact of lower volumes overall and continued growth investments, partially offset by benefits from previous restructuring actions and commercial excellence. So overall, market conditions continue to be tough, but our businesses in PMT are doing well, and we expect an even better second half.
I'm now on Slide 12 with a preview of the third quarter. You'll note that the guidance reflects the ACS structure prior to this morning's announcement. We'll be updating the reporting for the new structure starting the third quarter, as I mentioned.
So for total Honeywell, we're planning for sales of $10 billion to $10.2 billion. That's up 4% to 6% reported or up flat -- or flat to up 1% on a core organic basis. The sales guidance for the quarter does not reflect the impact of the Intelligrated acquisition as we expect the transaction to close near quarter end.
Segment margins are expected to be down 10 basis points to up 10 basis points, excluding M&A, or down 40 to 60 basis points on a reported basis. Finally, EPS is expected to be in the range of $1.67 to $1.72, up 6% to 10% normalized for income tax at 26.5% in both years.
Starting with Aerospace. Sales are expected to be down 1% to up 1% on a core organic basis. In commercial aviation OE, we're expecting sales to be down double digit, driven by the impact of OEM incentives and continued declines in business and general aviation, partially offset by a ramp-up on key platforms in Air Transport and Regional.
Excluding the OEM incentives, commercial aviation OE is expected to be down mid-single digit. Commercial aviation aftermarket sales are expected to grow mid-single digit, again, with strength in both airline and business jet spare sales, including Higher satcom and other software upgrades. 
Defense & Space sales are expected to improve sequentially, but be modestly down on a year-over-year basis as higher product sales to the U.S. government are more than offset by challenging prior year comparisons in the international business, the impact of large project wind down and the continued softness in U.S. services. 
In Transportation Systems, sales are expected to be up low single digit with continued strong growth in light vehicle gas applications, partially offset by slower growth in diesel based on the timing of new launches. As for Aerospace margin rates, we expect to be down 30 to 50 basis points, excluding M&A, driven by higher OEM incentives, the unfavorable impact of foreign currency and the unfavorable impact on margin of higher OE shipments to Air Transport and Regional customers. Now this will be partially offset by productivity and commercial excellence.
Moving to ACS. Sales are expected to be flat to up 1% on a core organic basis or up 11% to 12% on a reported basis driven by acquisitions. We expect ESS sales growth to be similar to the second quarter on a core organic basis, led by continued momentum in our security and fire businesses and in our high-growth regions, but more than offset by the declines we highlighted in S&PS.
In BSD, we're expecting low to mid-single digit core organic growth, driven primarily by continued strength in Americas Distribution business in both residential and commercial end markets.
Excluding the dilutive impact from M&A, ACS margin rate is expected to improve 90 to 110 basis points, driven by commercial excellence, continued productivity and the benefits of restructuring. ACS's reported segment margin rate in the second quarter is expected to be up 10 to 30 basis points -- I'm sorry, third quarter is expected to be up 10 to 30 basis points. In PMT, sales are expected to be up flat -- or expected to be flat to up 2% on a core organic basis or up 2% to 4% reported. UOP sales declines are expected to moderate in the third quarter, but still be down double digits on a year-over-year basis, driven primarily by continued declines in licensing, equipment and gas processing, partially offset by strength in the catalyst business.
Based on our growing UOP backlog, we expect the catalyst sales growth rates to improve in the second half of the year, particularly in the fourth quarter. HPS sales are expected to be up mid-single digits on a core organic basis, driven by continued conversion of global megaprojects, as I mentioned earlier, as well as higher software and service sales.
Advanced Materials sales are expected to be up low to mid-single digits on a core organic basis, driven by strength in Fluorine Products and Solstice sales and improving specialty products line, benefiting from new product introductions.
PMT reported segment margin rate expected to be down 100 to 120 basis points and down 70 to 90 basis points, excluding the dilutive impact of M&A, driven by lower volumes, the unfavorable impact of lower UOP licensing sales, market pricing headwinds in Resins & Chemicals and continued investments for growth, partially offset by productivity, net of inflation.
Slide 13 provides our full year 2000 (sic) [ 2016 ] expectations by business compared to the initial guidance we provided back in December. While there are a number of puts and takes within the overall portfolio, we're tracking our initial full year core organic sales guidance for Honeywell.
In Aerospace, the Commercial OE continued to see improvement in ATR with a ramp-up of key platforms like A350 and A320 as well as Boeing 737 and 787. However, as we saw this quarter, the demand environment in business jets is slower than we anticipated, and we expect this trend to continue in the second half. Meanwhile, our Commercial Aftermarket business is coming better than anticipated as we build on the 6% core organic growth achieved year-to-date, driven by stronger flight hours and continued spares growth and repair and overhaul activities. Defense $ Space will remain challenged throughout the year as the U.S. services and space businesses anticipate further program delays in the second half, and as oil and gas market declines continue to adversely impact the commercial helicopter market.
In total, ACS is performing largely as we expected. The products businesses are coming in slightly lower largely due to lower volume in our Sensing and Productivity Solutions businesses due to some channel headwinds while Building Solutions and Distribution is coming in much better, driven by double-digit core organic growth performance in this first quarter and continued strength in Americas Distribution as we move into the second half.
In PMT, our Process Solutions business continues to outperform, driven by the strong conversion of the global megaproject backlog. Our software solutions are generating strong demand, and we anticipate this to continue for the remainder of the year.
In UOP, activity continues to be soft given the slowdowns in orders in our gas processing, licensing and equipment businesses, but as I indicated, we expect a very strong second half for UOP's catalyst business. So on balance, no change to our core organic sales outlook in total, but we continue to monitor the businesses closely.
I'm moving to Slide 14. As Dave mentioned, we're raising the low end of our full year EPS guidance by $0.05 with a new range of $6.60 to $6.70. That's up 8 to 10 -- or 8% to 10% from 2015. The new range reflects the outperformance in the first half of the year. There's some puts and takes among these segments from the guidance we provided in April, but overall, very strong year expected for Honeywell in 2016 once again.
In total, we now expect core organic sales growth of approximately 1% and total sales to be between $40 billion and $40.6 billion, so up 4% to 5% reported. The revised guidance reflects the incremental headwinds we've seen in Aerospace, particularly in our BGA and Defense & Space businesses. This guidance does not reflect the Intelligrated acquisition or the planed spinoff of Resins & Chemicals.
Segment margin expansion is still expected to be up 10 to 50 basis points or 80 to 110 basis points, excluding the dilutive impact of M&A, driven by commercial excellence, restructuring benefits and continued proactive cost management. We expect the full year income tax rate to be approximately 26.5% and our share count to be approximately 774 million shares or approximately 2% lower than the 2015 weighted average share count of 789 million.
Finally, we continue to expect free cash flow in the range of $4.6 billion to $4.8 billion, up 5% to 10% from 2015, with CapEx investments roughly flat to 2015 at approximately $1.1 billion. This will drive free cash flow conversion of approximately 90% for the full year.
Let me move to Slide 15 for a quick summary before heading it -- or turning it back to Mark for Q&A. We had a solid first half adding to our strong performance track record and generating momentum for the rest of the year. Once again, we've demonstrated that we can deliver at the high end of our aggressive earnings commitments even with limited help from the macro environment, a big reminder of the value of our diversified and balanced portfolio and the strength of the Honeywell Operating System. And we, again, put to work a sizable amount of share owner capital in the quarter, including $1.5 billion in additional acquisitions and $0.5 billion in share repurchases, which will pave the way for future earnings and cash growth.
The uncertainty in the macro environment is not new for us. We have and will continue to plan conservatively. We continue to focus on executing sustainable productivity actions, including delivering on the strong restructuring pipeline. We have roughly $300 million of actions to be carried out.
We're making smart bets on innovation and breakthrough initiatives in continuing our investments to further penetrate high-growth regions and expand capacity. We're in the process of planning for 2017, and our management team is focused on execution. We feel confident that our balanced portfolio mix, in line to favorable macro trends, and focused cost discipline will continue to outperform.
Without further ado, let's move to Q&A."

What's going on out there that gives you the confidence that we're not walking into an even tougher back half of the year? Because the first half of this year has been pretty tough, and some of your peers reported pretty tough numbers, too. So it's not just you guys. But I mean, negative core growth is something we don't normally see in an expansionary time period, right? So I guess, I'm asking a general question on what you think about the world."

I don't think we've ever referred to this environment as being expansionary. And the way I would describe the overall performance and why we say strong, if you take a look at the cash we generated, if you take a look at the operational margin rate improvement, 110 basis points, which is consistent with what we were doing last year, it's just all the stuff to the right of the chart was moving in the right direction. This year, it's not. If you take a look at the EPS growth, we've been able to deliver on that, and the chart Tom showed that said about $0.15 or $0.16 of the total $0.14 increase or $0.15 increase came from operations. That's pretty strong operational performance. Now you could say, okay, this 2% negative core organic, that's true. It's also consistent with what we had forecasted. It was our guidance range, so it's not like it came as a surprise. And the headwinds are no different than what we've talked about in the past, and that's why Tom tried to show that 70% of the portfolio is actually growing 5%. We've just got these unusual headwinds, most of which -- well, all of which dissipate this year. If you take a look at UOP, I mean, you know what's happening on the oil and gas side. And we've always said our diversity of opportunity will offset that. And we do believe that in 2016, that ends. This is the bottom for that sector. If we take a look at the sensing and productivity solutions business and think of this as a lot driven by scanning and mobility, where we had this huge U.S. Postal Service auto last year that we're -- in terms of a comp, it's just going to be negative. It just did. It would have been impossible to make that up. Our Resins & Chemicals pricing, which you're familiar with, really has no effect on the bottom line, does affect growth when we look at the overall number. And then some in Defense & Space, where there's just been delays in orders. And the commercial helo market, largely driven by oil and gas, has been difficult. Both headwinds stopped. It's just a matter of dealing with them as they are today, and 70% of the portfolio is growing 5%. So I think it's pretty darn good overall. And yes, I understand the point about minus 2%. But we also forecasted, it's not like it came as a surprise."

When you take a look at Aerospace, it's still a case where you don't have this big increase in incentives that hurt you on the growth side year to year. The biz jet applications even in tougher market still help you. UOP does bottom out this year. Some of the CapEx expansions that we are talking about in PMT are still there for us next year -- or are still there for us next year when you look at fluorines, in particular, and what we've been able to achieve with some of the acquisitions. When you look at ACS, we still expect that to be a good performer for us again next year, although, of course, split into 2 pieces. So the conditions are all still there. What the macro environment looks like as we get into that year? I guess, we'll have to assess as it moves on, but all the conditions that we talked about are still present."

I'm pretty well convinced that when consumers actually start to feel the difference between existing services and what we're able to provide with JetWave, they're going to be quite impressed, and it's good to get to a point where consumers ask for it. It's going to be a differentiating item for airlines, for their consumers. Interestingly, some of the surveys that have been done showed that on a 3-hour flight or less, passengers prefer strong WiFi to access to a bathroom. Quite significant when you look at it. Anyway, so it's -- we're really hot on what this connectivity initiative is going to be able to do for us. And on ADS-B, it's typical with any mandate is that it seems to all be back-end loaded as customers wait, and we'll be prepared for it."

Well, this year, it's just going the other way. The operational improvement is still pretty darn good and consistent with last year. And if you look over on the right-hand side in this continued slow-growth environment just like last year, it's just going the other way, is all. But at the end of the day, the operational performance continues to be very good in a slow-growth environment. That part is not changing, and we're the same company that we were before. And what we're trying to do is just highlight these kind of swing items, and say don't focus on these. We're not asking for credit when it goes our way, and you shouldn't be dinging us when it goes the other way. Because the fundamentals of the company are still there, are still good and portends for a very good future for Honeywell share owners."

I would say that in addition to the operational improvement that's in the triple digits, I mean, when you look at the items that brought us back to a reported margin rate that was lower than that 110 basis points, they're either items that are -- will turn for us or that are of an investment nature. So for example, you look at foreign exchange, we're going from an FX rate of 1.24 last year to 1.10 this quarter. I talked about 2017 at some of the hedging we've done. So that will be an actual -- at our tails next year. When I look at the OEM incentives that we're making, I mean, this was the year that we've always flagged as having to deal with over $200 million of P&L impacts from the increased incentives. Those will level off next year and actually help us to build an installed base for service opportunities. And in the longer term, those decrease, so it will be another tailwind for us. And third, you've got a lot of M&A going on. We've done 8 acquisitions in the last year. There is a lot of focus on that. But when you're doing acquisitions, especially the sizable ones that we've done, you do get some headwinds in the earlier quarters from the purchase accounting step-up, the integration team costs and the like. And those will all turn on -- turn for us as well and really be a nice margin driver for us in the future. We're really happy with the acquisitions. And as I said, we don't include the organic growth that we're experiencing in those acquisitions in the minus 2% organic growth rate that we talked about. But those acquisitions grew 8% to 9% on their own if you compare it how they did under prior ownership to how they did with Honeywell, so pretty strong performance. So we're really actually excited about these various factors because they're going to be -- they're going to turn and have a positive influence for next year."

As I'm sure you've seen by now, Honeywell delivered another quarter of double-digit earnings growth, capping off a strong first half of the year in a challenging global economy.

As I'm sure you've seen by now, Honeywell delivered another quarter of double-digit earnings growth, capping off a strong first half of the year in a challenging global economy. Earnings per share of $1.66 increased 10%, coming in at the high end of our guidance range. Sales of $10 billion were up 2% on a reported basis and down 2% on a core organic basis, in line with our guidance for the quarter.
We saw good growth in Commercial Aviation Aftermarket and Transportation Systems; in our residential, commercial and China businesses within ACS; and in Process Solutions and Fluorine Products within PMT.
Segment margin expanded 10 basis points to 18.5%. On an operational basis, this was 110 basis points of improvement as we continue our focus on commercial excellence, execution on previously funded restructuring actions and maintaining disciplined cost controls. We are again raising the low end of our 2016 full year earnings guidance to a new range of $6.60 to $6.70 or up 8% to 10% year-over-year given our first half performance.
During the second quarter, we had several announcements that I'd like to highlight this morning. We announced that Darius Adamczyk will be our next CEO effective March 31, 2017, and I will serve as Executive Chairman through April 2018. This announcement is the next step in ensuring a seamless leadership transition, which will position Honeywell for continued outperformance in 2017 and beyond. Darius is the right person to lead the company into a new era, where we will need to keep evolving, become even more global, to become more of a software company and to become more nimble. He has the growth mindset, global acumen and software expertise to be a highly successful CEO for Honeywell. The board and I are confident that Darius will be a great leader in executing our strategic plans and driving organic growth. My leadership team and I remain as focused as ever in delivering on our commitments while ensuring a smooth leadership transition.
In addition, this morning, we announced that we will realign ACS into 2 new segments: Home and Building Technologies, and Safety and Productivity Solutions. We will begin reporting results on this basis in the third quarter. Tom will speak more about this later, but we think this is the right time to separate ACS into 2 smaller, more nimble businesses that will operate more efficiently and adapt more quickly to changing global markets. We have 2 fantastic leaders in Terrence Hahn and John Waldron to lead the new segments, and we're excited about the growth opportunities in each portfolio as we look ahead to 2017.
Alex Ismail, who served as President and CEO of Automation and Control Solutions for the past 2 years, will leave the company. Alex had a very successful career at Honeywell in Aerospace, Transportation Systems, and most recently, ACS, where he delivered strong operating margin expansion and improved operational excellence, completed several acquisitions in new strategic adjacencies like smart meters, accelerated growth in high-growth regions and built a strong pipeline of new products, IoT solutions and software for home, building and worker applications. Alex is very supportive of the change. He's a well-liked and respected leader, and we wish him the best in his next endeavor. 
We remain very active on the capital deployment front also. Earlier this month, we announced the acquisition of Intelligrated for $1.5 billion. Intelligrated serves the high-growth e-commerce industry, offering complete warehouse automation solutions, software and services. Intelligrated has a large and growing installed base of customers that align well with our new Safety and Productivity Solutions business and they serve a highly attractive market that is forecasted to grow 8% to 10% a year. 
We also announced the spinoff of our Resins & Chemicals business into an independent public company called AdvanSix. The spinoff of AdvanSix is progressing well, and we expect completion this year. These portfolio changes continue to move our growth profile upward and build on our Great Positions in Good Industries.
In June, Shane Tedjarati and his team hosted approximately 20 investors and analysts in China to learn more about Honeywell's tremendous growth opportunities in high-growth regions. The trip covered 4 cities in 5 days and included meetings with Chinese government officials, local economists and CEOs, business innovation centers and high-tech incubators, site tours of Honeywell's turbo factory in Wuhan and S&PS factory in Suzhou as well as an in-depth HGR business review. This trip served as an excellent venue for our shareowners and analysts to better understand our HGR strategies, including becoming the Chinese competitor, East-For-East and East-To-Rest, and how our experience in China has driven our strategic thinking and provided a foundation for further growth in other high-growth regions. High-growth regions have driven approximately 50% of our growth over the last 10 years, and we expect it to continue to be a key growth engine for Honeywell going forward.
And our focus on software continues with the announcement of our new digital transformation business, part of Honeywell Process Solutions. This business will help industrial companies harness the power of the industrial Internet of Things to make their operations more reliable, more efficient and safer. The industrial Internet of Things was the key topic at our 41st Annual Honeywell User Group Conference in San Antonio, where we introduced our new Uniformance suite. This suite is our analytics platform that provides realtime digital intelligence to turn plant data into actionable information. At the User Group Conference, more than 1,000 people gathered to discuss IIoT's tremendous potential to solve the toughest challenges facing industrial companies today. Honeywell's portfolio of technologies, advanced analytics and deep domain knowledge position us well to utilize data to help customers operate their plants more safely and efficiently, and reduce unplanned downtime.
We're also monitoring the macro environment in light of Britain's recently announced exit from the European Union, and we expect minimal near-term impact. Tom will take you through some of the actions we've taken to mitigate potential risks, but it's important to note that our planning framework hasn't changed. We'll be cautious in our sales planning and continue to plan our costs and spending conservatively, ensuring we remain flexible as a company. And we'll maintain our seed planting for the future, supported by a robust pipeline of funded restructuring projects. We'll continue to support growth, focusing on winning in high-growth regions, advancing our superior software capabilities, and effectively using HOS Gold to drive breakthrough initiatives and deliver high-quality products to our customers globally.
So with that, I'll turn it over to Tom."

I'm now on Slide 3, which shows the second quarter results. Reported sales of $10 billion increased 2%, reflecting impact of acquisitions, and declined 2% on a core organic basis. We saw a continued growth in our Commercial",4813,"Thanks, Dave, and good morning. I'm now on Slide 3, which shows the second quarter results. Reported sales of $10 billion increased 2%, reflecting impact of acquisitions, and declined 2% on a core organic basis. We saw a continued growth in our Commercial Aviation Aftermarket, Security and Fire, Process Solutions and Transportation Systems, which I'll talk more about on the business slides. 
The continued declines in our oil and gas businesses in UOP and difficult comps in S&PS were largely as we expected. In our high-growth regions, India grew 30% -- nearly 30%, while in China, Aero and ACS continued the momentum from the first quarter, partially offset by moderating declines in PMT. All of our recent acquisitions are performing at or above the deal financial models, and the sales from our 7 recent acquisitions collectively grew in the high single-digit basis on a core organic basis this quarter.
Segment margin was up 10 basis points versus the prior year, at the high end of our guidance range, or up 50 basis points, excluding the dilutive impact of acquisitions. As Dave mentioned, on an operational basis -- so that's further excluding the impacts of foreign exchange, the Aerospace OEM incentives and raw material pass-through pricing in Resins & Chemicals, segment margin improved 110 basis points. We expect the overall margin expansion will continue to improve in the second half.
Earnings per share of $1.66 were up 10%, coming in at the high end of our guidance range. Also we funded $97 million of restructuring projects. That's $53 million net of reversals, largely offsetting the benefit from higher pension income in the quarter, as expected.
On share count, we've repurchased another $500 million of shares at attractive prices. On a full year basis, we expect the fully diluted weighted average share count to be approximately 774 million shares. We have been and will continue to deploy capital to appropriate opportunities that will create the greatest value for our shareowners.
Free cash flow in the quarter, $1.3 billion, improved sequentially and was up 8% as compared to the second quarter of 2015, representing approximately 100% free cash flow conversion. The increase year-over-year was driven primarily by improving net income. Even with the increase in free cash flow, we were able to fund 16% more in capital expenditures or approximately $280 million in the quarter. These are principally the high-ROI projects that we've discussed in the past. So as you can see, we continue to generate strong results in a relatively slow growth environment.
Slide 4 provides a quick recap of our year-to-date growth in the portfolio. Roughly 70% of the Honeywell portfolio is growing at a 5% core organic rate, led by Fluorine Products, Security and Fire, Process Solutions and Transportation Systems and -- as well as the 5 other businesses shown here. We have good visibility to continued outperformance based on our orders and backlog, stable end markets and new wins. And this outperformance includes overcoming the significant Aero OEM incentives we face in our Commercial Aviation business. So a good sign as we head into the second half of 2016.
For the other 30% of the portfolio, core organic sales growth year-to-date has declined 13% due to the known headwinds that we've discussed previously. We've highlighted the market headwinds in our oil and gas businesses in UOP, which bottoms out in 2016, also the tough comps from the completion of the U.S. Postal Service win in S&PS, and the softness in our services and international business within Defense & Space as well as the market pricing headwinds in Resins & Chemicals. These headwinds are largely expected to subside in the second half of 2016 and into 2017.
We think the slide illustrates the diversity of opportunity within the Honeywell portfolio. There's not one business that will make or break us. We continue to be confident about the portfolio and the positions we have as we look to the second half of 2016 and to 2017.
Slide 5 provides more detail on our earnings per share for the quarter. Our operating initiatives, led by the deployment of HOS, continue to drive segment profit growth. On an operational basis, segment profit accounted for $0.16 of EPS growth in the quarter. We generated 110 basis points of operational improvement in segment margin, which compares well with the 100-plus basis point improvement we saw for the full year of 2015. Each of the segments are contributing. We have differentiated technologies with a software focus, and the Honeywell user experience is driving the development of new products at higher margins. 
Our factories and sourcing organizations continue to mature. Our functional transformation is improving the quality of our back office while reducing its cost, and we continue to manage our indirect spend stringently. In addition, the previously funded restructuring as well as new restructuring actions have enabled us to continue improving our overall cost position.
The other impacts you see on the slide combined for a $0.01 decline in earnings for the quarter. First, the M&A-related charges stemming from the 8 deals in the last 12 months resulted in $0.05 in year-over-year dilution, primarily due to acquisition accounting and pay-as-you-go costs, with Elster having the largest impact. The incremental amortization from the deals will be a margin headwind for the rest of the year as we anticipated, but the net results from all acquisitions should improve in the second half as we lap some of the large onetime costs. Each of our acquisitions are performing well and are at or above our deal models. And as I mentioned, the organic growth embedded in these portfolios that we acquired, which is not included in our overall organic growth numbers, has been outstanding.
Second, foreign currency represented a $0.04 headwind in the quarter and should be roughly $0.15 for the full year. You'll recall that our hedging approach results in a euro rate of $1.24 for 2015 versus $1.10 for 2016.
Third, Aerospace OEM incentives reflect our continued investment in developing and growing our installed base on the right platforms in the commercial aviation industry. We now anticipate the full year 2016 year-over-year impact from OEM incentives to be more than $200 million, and the Q2 impact was approximately $0.03.
Lastly, below-the-line items and share count were net positive year-over-year by $0.07 and $0.04, respectively, as we previewed. On share count, our repurchases through the end of the second quarter were at an average price of $106 per share. So overall, strong earnings results while overcoming significant headwinds in what continues to be an uncertain macro environment.
Let's move to Slide 6. As Dave said, we announced the acquisition of Intelligrated earlier this month, building on the $6 billion-plus of acquisitions we've completed since the beginning of 2015. Intelligrated designs, manufactures, integrates and installs complete warehouse automation solutions, software and services that result in smarter distribution and fulfillment operations. Its supply chain and warehouse solutions drive improved productivity and lower costs for retailers, manufacturers and logistic providers around the world. The company's offerings include conveyor, sortation, palletizers and robotics as well as automated storage and retrieval systems, all managed by advanced machine control and software.
Intelligrated's software offers warehouse execution systems a scalable suite of software that managers -- manage the entire fulfillment process, including equipment, labor and business intelligence, integrated with voice and light-directed picking and putting technologies.
Intelligrated's mission-critical warehouse execution systems and software are a fantastic complement to the scanning, mobile computer and voice automation technologies in S&PS. They have a large and growing installed base, which includes 30 of the top 50 U.S. retailers and 50 of the top 100 Internet retailers. They also maintain a strong leadership position in the approximately $20 billion warehouse automation segment. About 90% of the business today is in the U.S. so there are significant opportunities to expand globally through Honeywell's footprint and customer diversification.
Intelligrated is at the intersection of several key global megatrends, namely e-commerce, software and automation, with distinguished sales growth in a market that is forecast to grow 8% to 10% a year. S&PS was built initially through acquisitions, which we've continually expanded through strong organic growth and operational improvements, a good testament to our rigorous and proven M&A approach and the benefits of being patient with our capital deployment. We expect this transaction to close by the end of the third quarter, and we're excited about the opportunities this acquisition has to offer.
Let's turn to Page 7. We wanted to spend a moment addressing Honeywell's proactive positioning ahead of Britain's recently announced exit from the European Union. You're all familiar with the developments and uncertainties, and we received a lot of questions about the impact on Honeywell. The process of actually exiting the EU will take some time and thus, may cause greater uncertainty in the short term, in addition to potentially slower U.K. and EU economic growth longer term. We'll continue to monitor our European short-cycle businesses for any signs of change. But as a reference point, our core organic sales in the EU region has held up nicely year-to-date. We will continue to be cautious in our sales planning and stay conservative in terms of our cost structure and investments in the region. 
In addition to the ongoing productivity initiatives in our supply chain functions, we're also prepared to leverage the flexibility we have to quickly adjust cost levels as the need arises. 
As it relates to currency, we've continued our foreign currency hedging approach. We've hedged approximately 75% of our 2017 euro P&L exposure at $1.15 and roughly 50% of our 2017 British P&L exposure at $1.44. So while there may continue to be volatility on the sales line, our euro and pound-based earnings are protected, similar to the approach we took for 2016. We will continue to actively monitor the situation as we head into 2017.
Let's move to Slide 8 and discuss the Aerospace results. Sales declined 1%, or 2% on a core organic basis, below our expectations, primarily driven by weaker-than-expected sales in Defense & Space, which I'll explain further in a moment. The Commercial Aviation OE sales decreased by 8% on a core organic basis, as higher volumes with OEMs in Air Transport and Regional were more than offset by a 7-point headwind from higher OEM incentives and lower engine shipments in Business and General Aviation. The BGA OE business, in particular, faced a difficult prior year comparison which, as a reminder, grew north of 20% in the second quarter of 2015. And as we highlighted last month, the demand environment in business jets overall is slower.
Commercial Aviation Aftermarket sales continue to be robust, growing 6% on a core organic basis. On the spares side, we saw an increase in airline and BGA spares, driven by strong mechanical demand and higher GX aviation sales, including Satcom and software upgrades. Repair and overhaul activities increased in line with flight hours, which remain strong in the second quarter as well.
Defense & Space sales declined 10% on a core organic basis, driven primarily by difficult prior year comparisons in the international business as larger projects were completed as well as lower sales to key channel partners. Our U.S. services and space businesses declined year-over-year due to unexpected program delays and completions of other programs, but we continue to perform well in our U.S. aftermarket business with increased spares and retrofit sales. In addition, our commercial helicopter business continues to be impacted by declines in the oil and gas markets. Reported sales reflect the impact of COM DEV, the satellite communications acquisition, which has performed well this year.
Transportation Systems sales increased 3% on a core organic basis due to new platform launches and continued volume growth in both gas and diesel light-vehicle applications. We continue to grow in our light-vehicle diesel business in Europe, which was up single digit in the quarter. The growth in light-vehicle gas was also most prominent in Europe and China.
Aerospace segment margin expanded 60 basis points, or 80 basis points excluding the dilutive impact of acquisitions. This was driven by productivity, net of inflation, and commercial excellence, partially offset by continued investments for growth, including higher OEM incentives, and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency.
Let's turn to the ACS results on Slide 9. ACS sales increased 9%, reflecting the favorable impact from acquisitions, primarily Elster. On a core organic basis, sales were down minus 1% in the second quarter, in line with our guidance. The segment margin expanded -- or segment margin expansion improved to 50 basis points in the quarter, excluding the impact of M&A, a big improvement from the 10 basis points expansion in the first quarter. And we expect ongoing acceleration the second half of the year.
Sales in Energy, Safety and Security, so the products businesses, were down 2% on a core organic basis in the second quarter. The momentum continued in Security and Fire, globally, with strong growth rates in both residential and commercial markets, coupled with the benefit from new product introductions and further penetration in high-growth regions. Our China business overall in ESS grew high single digit in the quarter, and we saw a double-digit growth in India. We've continued to outperform in our high-growth regions, driven by our connected ACS China strategy and the benefits from our ongoing investments for growth. These improvements were offset by lower volume in S&PS, primarily from the 2015 completion of the U.S. Postal Service contract. We expect S&PS to return to growth in the fourth quarter.
Building Solutions & Distribution sales were up 3% on a core organic basis in the quarter. We experienced continued strength on the distribution side with strong growth in North America and EMEA across our video, access and intrusion product lines. In Building Solutions, we saw modest growth, reflecting strength in services, partially offset by softness in the project installation business. Orders growth in the services and energy retrofit businesses was more than offset by a decline in the project businesses, but we remain encouraged by the solid improvements we've seen in our energy portfolio in HBS. Orders have doubled in that portfolio through the first half of 2016. This has been driven by sales excellence and a differentiated offering that is leading to multiple awards. The Buildings Solutions backlog and service bank increased low single digit in the quarter on an organic basis. 
Segment margins in ACS continues to benefit from productivity initiatives, the favorable impact from restructuring and commercial excellence while maintaining investments for growth in our connected product offerings and in high-growth regions. Mix was slightly better than last quarter, and we expect this to continue in the second half.
On Page 10 -- I'm now on Page 10. This morning, we highlighted that ACS will be split into 2 newly created business groups. I want to share a little bit more information on that. 
The first, Home and Building Technologies, will be roughly a $9 billion enterprise, which comprises our legacy Environmental & Energy Solutions, including Elster; Security and Fire; and Building Solutions & Distribution businesses. E&ES' industrial combustion and thermal business will be reclassified to PMT. The HBT business will be led by Terrence Hahn, who previously ran our Transportation Systems unit for the past 3 years and has been with Honeywell for over 9 years.
The second segment, Safety and Productivity Solutions, will be roughly a $5 billion business, comprising the former Sensing and Productivity Solutions and industrial safety businesses, including the recent acquisition, Intelligrated. The new S&PS will be led by John Waldron, who's currently President of our Sensing and Productivity Solutions business unit and previously was President of Scanning and Mobility. 
Today's announcement represents yet another step in the evolution of the Honeywell portfolio. We're constantly looking at ways to improve our organic growth profile. We think a smaller, more focused segment structure will allow us to accelerate breakthrough growth and new product introduction by being closer to our customers. Also, fewer layers and structures will lead to faster decision-making and a more efficient organization. This analysis builds on the momentum in ACS and across the entire portfolio following the acquisitions of Elster, Xtralis, Intelligrated and 5 other acquisitions since July of last year. The change further positions these businesses to invest in growth and execute the strategic plans best suited to each portfolio, and we have the right leaders in place to drive these actions.
We expect to begin reporting under the new segment structure effective with our third quarter 2016 results and expect to provide comparative financial information at that time. So more to come on this in the coming months.
Let's move to Slide 11 to discuss the PMT results. PMT sales declined 4% on a core organic basis, in line with our guidance. It continues to be a challenging market environment for oil and gas. Our orders and backlog have remained resilient, and the leadership team has been unrelenting in its focus to overcome these headwinds. 
So starting with UOP, sales were down as expected, driven by lower gas processing, licensing and equipment sales. The rate of sales decline improved significantly from the first quarter. In gas processing, we secured 5 new domestic wins in the first half, however that market remains a bit sluggish. On the catalyst side, overall demand remain strong, and we expect an acceleration of growth in the second half of the year. UOP orders were modestly higher in the quarter, including a strong double-digit increase in the catalyst business, and UOP backlog was close to 10% higher than the second quarter of 2015.
Process Solutions continues to outperform its peers in a challenging environment. We have a unique combination of automation technology, field instrumentation products and aftermarket offerings, including software solutions. Core organic sales increased 8% in the quarter, driven by double-digit growth in our projects business and higher software and service sales. Conversion of the global megaproject backlog, where we serve as the main contractor providing control and safety solutions for large installations, remained strong in the second quarter, and we expect this trend to continue throughout the rest of the year.
Through the recent megaproject wins, HPS continues to build out its massive installed base, which will benefit our services and aftermarket business in future periods. Reported sales were higher in the quarter due to the impact from the Elster acquisition.
Advanced Materials sales were down 2% on a core organic basis, driven by challenging pricing conditions in Resins & Chemicals, partially offset by continued strong demand and more than 20% growth for Solstice low-global-warming products. We presently have roughly $3.5 billion of signed agreements for Solstice and are building out production capacity to meet the increased global customer demand.
As expected, PMT segment margins were down 20 basis points to 21.1%, primarily due the impact of lower volumes overall and continued growth investments, partially offset by benefits from previous restructuring actions and commercial excellence. So overall, market conditions continue to be tough, but our businesses in PMT are doing well, and we expect an even better second half.
I'm now on Slide 12 with a preview of the third quarter. You'll note that the guidance reflects the ACS structure prior to this morning's announcement. We'll be updating the reporting for the new structure starting the third quarter, as I mentioned.
So for total Honeywell, we're planning for sales of $10 billion to $10.2 billion. That's up 4% to 6% reported or up flat -- or flat to up 1% on a core organic basis. The sales guidance for the quarter does not reflect the impact of the Intelligrated acquisition as we expect the transaction to close near quarter-end.
Segment margins are expected to be down 10 basis points to up 10 basis points, excluding M&A, or down 40 to 60 basis points on a reported basis. Finally, EPS is expected to be in the range of $1.67 to $1.72, up 6% to 10% normalized for income tax at 26.5% in both years.
Starting with Aerospace. Sales are expected to be down 1% to up 1% on a core organic basis. In Commercial Aviation OE, we're expecting sales to be down double digit, driven by the impact of OEM incentives and continued declines in Business and General Aviation, partially offset by a ramp-up on key platforms in Air Transport and Regional.
Excluding the OEM incentives, Commercial Aviation OE is expected to be down mid-single digit. Commercial Aviation Aftermarket sales are expected to grow mid-single digit again, with strength in both airline and business jet spare sales, including higher Satcom and other software upgrades. 
Defense & Space sales are expected to improve sequentially, but be modestly down on a year-over-year basis as higher product sales to the U.S. government are more than offset by challenging prior year comparisons in the international business, the impact of large project wind-downs and the continued softness in U.S. services. 
In Transportation Systems, sales are expected to be up low single digit with continued strong growth in light-vehicle gas applications, partially offset by slower growth in diesel based on the timing of new launches. As for Aerospace margin rates, we expect to be down 30 to 50 basis points, excluding M&A, driven by higher OEM incentives, the unfavorable impact of foreign currency and the unfavorable impact on margin of higher OE shipments to Air Transport and Regional customers. Now this will be partially offset by productivity and commercial excellence.
Moving to ACS. Sales are expected to be flat to up 1% on a core organic basis or up 11% to 12% on a reported basis, driven by acquisitions. We expect ESS sales growth to be similar to the second quarter on a core organic basis, led by continued momentum in our Security and Fire businesses and in our high-growth regions, but more than offset by the declines we highlighted in S&PS.
In BSD, we're expecting low to mid-single digit core organic growth, driven primarily by continued strength in Americas Distribution business in both residential and commercial end markets.
Excluding the dilutive impact from M&A, ACS margin rate is expected to improve 90 to 110 basis points, driven by commercial excellence, continued productivity and the benefits of restructuring. ACS's reported segment margin rate in the second quarter is expected to be up 10 to 30 basis points -- I'm sorry, third quarter is expected to be up 10 to 30 basis points. In PMT, sales are expected to be up flat -- or expected to be flat to up 2% on a core organic basis or up 2% to 4% reported. UOP sales declines are expected to moderate in the third quarter, but still be down double digits on a year-over-year basis, driven primarily by continued declines in licensing, equipment and gas processing, partially offset by strength in the catalyst business.
Based on our growing UOP backlog, we expect the catalyst sales growth rates to improve in the second half of the year, particularly in the fourth quarter. HPS sales are expected to be up mid-single digits on a core organic basis, driven by continued conversion of global megaprojects, as I mentioned earlier, as well as higher software and service sales.
Advanced Materials sales are expected to be up low to mid-single digits on a core organic basis, driven by strength in Fluorine Products and Solstice sales and improving specialty products lines, benefiting from new product introductions.
PMT reported segment margin rate expected to be down 100 to 120 basis points and down 70 to 90 basis points, excluding the dilutive impact of M&A, driven by lower volumes, the unfavorable impact of lower UOP licensing sales, market pricing headwinds in Resins & Chemicals and continued investments for growth, partially offset by productivity, net of inflation.
Slide 13 provides our full year 2000 (sic) [ 2016 ] expectations by business compared to the initial guidance we provided back in December. While there are a number of puts and takes within the overall portfolio, we're tracking to our initial full year core organic sales guidance for Honeywell.
In Aerospace, Commercial OE continue to see improvement in ATR with a ramp-up of key platforms like A350 and A320 as well as Boeing 737 and 787. However, as we saw this quarter, the demand environment in business jets is slower than we anticipated, and we expect this trend to continue in the second half. Meanwhile, our Commercial Aftermarket business is coming better than anticipated as we build on the 6% core organic growth achieved year-to-date, driven by stronger flight hours and continued spares growth and repair and overhaul activities. Defense & Space will remain challenged throughout the year as the U.S. services and space businesses anticipate further program delays in the second half, and as oil and gas market declines continue to adversely impact the commercial helicopter market.
In total, ACS is performing largely as we expected. The products businesses are coming in slightly lower, largely due to lower volumes in our Sensing and Productivity Solutions businesses due to some channel headwinds, while Building Solutions and Distribution is coming in much better, driven by double-digit core organic growth performance in this first quarter and continued strength in Americas Distribution as we move into the second half.
In PMT, our Process Solutions business continues to outperform, driven by the strong conversion of the global megaproject backlog. Our software solutions are generating strong demand, and we anticipate this to continue for the remainder of the year.
In UOP, activity continues to be soft given the slowdowns in orders in our gas processing, licensing and equipment businesses, but as I indicated, we expect a very strong second half for UOP's catalyst business. So on balance, no change to our core organic sales outlook in total, but we continue to monitor the businesses closely.
I'm moving to Slide 14. As Dave mentioned, we're raising the low end of our full year EPS guidance by $0.05 with a new range of $6.60 to $6.70. That's up 8 to 10 -- or 8% to 10% from 2015. The new range reflects the outperformance in the first half of the year. There's some puts and takes among these segments from the guidance we provided in April, but overall, very strong year expected for Honeywell in 2016 once again.
In total, we now expect core organic sales growth of approximately 1% and total sales to be between $40 billion and $40.6 billion, so up 4% to 5% reported. The revised guidance reflects the incremental headwinds we've seen in Aerospace, particularly in our BGA and Defense & Space businesses. This guidance does not reflect the Intelligrated acquisition or the planned spinoff of Resins & Chemicals.
Segment margin expansion is still expected to be up 10 to 50 basis points, or 80 to 110 basis points excluding the dilutive impact of M&A, driven by commercial excellence, restructuring benefits and continued proactive cost management. We expect the full year income tax rate to be approximately 26.5% and our share count to be approximately 774 million shares or approximately 2% lower than the 2015 weighted average share count of 789 million.
Finally, we continue to expect free cash flow in the range of $4.6 billion to $4.8 billion, up 5% to 10% from 2015, with CapEx investments roughly flat to 2015 at approximately $1.1 billion. This will drive free cash flow conversion of approximately 90% for the full year.
Let me move to Slide 15 for a quick summary before heading it -- or turning it back to Mark for Q&A. We had a solid first half, adding to our strong performance track record and generating momentum for the rest of the year. Once again, we've demonstrated that we can deliver at the high end of our aggressive earnings commitments even with limited help from the macro environment, a big reminder of the value of our diversified and balanced portfolio and the strength of the Honeywell Operating System. And we, again, put to work a sizable amount of shareowner capital in the quarter, including $1.5 billion in additional acquisitions and $0.5 billion in share repurchases, which will pave the way for future earnings and cash growth.
The uncertainty in the macro environment is not new for us. We have and will continue to plan conservatively. We continue to focus on executing sustainable productivity actions, including delivering on the strong restructuring pipeline. We have roughly $300 million of actions to be carried out.
We're making smart bets on innovation and breakthrough initiatives and continuing our investments to further penetrate high-growth regions and expand capacity. We're in the process of planning for 2017, and our management team is focused on execution. We feel confident that our balanced portfolio mix aligned to favorable macro trends and focused cost discipline will continue to outperform.
Without further ado, let's move to Q&A."

What's going on out there that gives you the confidence that we're not walking into an even tougher back half of the year? Because the first half of this year has been pretty tough, and some of your peers reported pretty tough numbers, too. So it's not just you guys. But I mean, negative core growth is something we don't normally see in an expansionary time period, right? So I guess, I'm asking a general question on what you think about the world."

I don't think we've ever referred to this environment as being expansionary. And the way I would describe the overall performance and why we say strong, if you take a look at the cash we generated, if you take a look at the operational margin rate improvement, 110 basis points, which is consistent with what we were doing last year, it's just all the stuff to the right of the chart was moving in the right direction. This year, it's not. If you take a look at the EPS growth, we've been able to deliver on that, and the chart Tom showed that said about $0.15 or $0.16 of the total $0.14 increase or $0.15 increase came from operations. That's pretty strong operational performance. Now you could say, okay, this 2% negative core organic, that's true. It's also consistent with what we had forecasted. It was our guidance range, so it's not like it came as a surprise. And the headwinds are no different than what we've talked about in the past, and that's why Tom tried to show that 70% of the portfolio is actually growing 5%. We've just got these unusual headwinds, most of which -- well, all of which dissipate this year. If you take a look at UOP, I mean, you know what's happening on the oil and gas side. And we've always said our diversity of opportunity will offset that. And we do believe that in 2016, that ends. This is the bottom for that sector. If we take a look at the Sensing and Productivity Solutions business and think of this as a lot driven by scanning and mobility, where we had this huge U.S. Postal Service order last year that we're -- in terms of a comp, it's just going to be negative. It just is. It would have been impossible to make that up. Our Resins & Chemicals pricing, which you're familiar with, really has no effect on the bottom line, does affect growth when we look at the overall number. And then some in Defense & Space, where there's just been delays in orders. And the commercial helo market, largely driven by oil and gas, has been difficult. Those headwinds stop. It's just a matter of dealing with them as they are today, and 70% of the portfolio is growing 5%. So I think it's pretty darn good overall. And yes, I understand the point about minus 2%. But we also forecasted, it's not like it came as a surprise."

We just need to be able to get the certifications done with the airframer so that we can get it out there. I'm pretty well convinced that when consumers actually start to feel the difference between existing services and what we're able to provide with JetWave, they're going to be quite impressed, and it's good to get to a point where consumers ask for it. It's going to be a differentiating item for airlines, for their consumers. Interestingly, some of the surveys that have been done showed that on a 3-hour flight or less, passengers prefer strong WiFi to access to a bathroom. Quite significant when you look at it that way. But it's -- we're really hot on what this connectivity initiative is going to be able to do for us. And on ADS-B, as typical with any mandate is that it seems to all be back-end loaded as customers wait, and we'll be prepared for it."

Well, this year, it's just going the other way. The operational improvement is still pretty darn good and consistent with last year. And if you look over on the right-hand side in this continued slow-growth environment, just like last year, it's just going the other way is all. But at the end of the day, the operational performance continues to be very good in a slow-growth environment. That part is not changing, and we're the same company that we were before. And what we're trying to do is just highlight these kind of swing items, and say don't focus on these.

So for example, if you look at foreign exchange, we're going from an FX rate of $1.24 last year to $1.10 this quarter. I talked about 2017 and some of the hedging we've done. So that will be an actual -- at our tails next year. When I look at the OEM incentives that we're making, I mean, this was the year that we've always flagged as having to deal with over $200 million of P&L impacts from the increased incentives. Those will level off next year and actually help us to build an installed base for service opportunities. And in the longer term, those decrease, so it will be another tailwind for us. And third, you've got a lot of M&A going on. We've done 8 acquisitions in the last year. There is a lot of focus on that. But when you're doing acquisitions, especially the sizable ones that we've done, you do get some headwinds in the earlier quarters from the purchase accounting step-up, the integration team costs and the like. And those will all turn on -- turn for us as well and really be a nice margin driver for us in the future. We're really happy with the acquisitions. And as I said, we don't include the organic growth that we're experiencing in those acquisitions in the minus 2% organic growth rate that we talked about. But those acquisitions grew 8% to 9% on their own if you compare how they did under prior ownership to how they did with Honeywell, so pretty strong performance. So we're really actually excited about these various factors because they're going to be -- they're going to turn and have a positive influence for next year."

As I'm sure you've seen by now, Honeywell delivered another quarter of double-digit earnings growth, capping off a strong first half of the year in a challenging global economy. Earnings per share of $1.66 increased 10%, coming in at the high end of our guidance range. Sales of $10 billion were up 2% on a reported basis and down 2% on a core organic basis, in line with our guidance for the quarter.
We saw good growth in Commercial Aviation Aftermarket and Transportation Systems; in our residential, commercial and China businesses within ACS; and in Process Solutions and Fluorine Products within PMT.
Segment margin expanded 10 basis points to 18.5%. On an operational basis, this was 110 basis points of improvement as we continue our focus on commercial excellence, execution on previously funded restructuring actions and maintaining disciplined cost controls. We are again raising the low end of our 2016 full year earnings guidance to a new range of $6.60 to $6.70 or up 8% to 10% year-over-year given our first half performance.
During the second quarter, we had several announcements that I'd like to highlight this morning. We announced that Darius Adamczyk will be our next CEO effective March 31, 2017, and I will serve as Executive Chairman through April 2018. This announcement is the next step in ensuring a seamless leadership transition, which will position Honeywell for continued outperformance in 2017 and beyond. Darius is the right person to lead the company into a new era, where we will need to keep evolving, become even more global, to become more of a software company and to become more nimble. He has the growth mindset, global acumen and software expertise to be a highly successful CEO for Honeywell. The board and I are confident that Darius will be a great leader in executing our strategic plans and driving organic growth. My leadership team and I remain as focused as ever in delivering on our commitments while ensuring a smooth leadership transition.
In addition, this morning, we announced that we will realign ACS into 2 new segments: Home and Building Technologies, and Safety and Productivity Solutions. We will begin reporting results on this basis in the third quarter. Tom will speak more about this later, but we think this is the right time to separate ACS into 2 smaller, more nimble businesses that will operate more efficiently and adapt more quickly to changing global markets. We have 2 fantastic leaders in Terrence Hahn and John Waldron to lead the new segments, and we're excited about the growth opportunities in each portfolio as we look ahead to 2017.
Alex Ismail, who served as President and CEO of Automation and Control Solutions for the past 2 years, will leave the company. Alex had a very successful career at Honeywell in Aerospace, Transportation Systems, and most recently, ACS, where he delivered strong operating margin expansion and improved operational excellence, completed several acquisitions in new strategic adjacencies like smart meters, accelerated growth in high-growth regions and built a strong pipeline of new products, IoT solutions and software for home, building and worker applications. Alex is very supportive of the change. He's a well-liked and respected leader, and we wish him the best in his next endeavor. 
We remain very active on the capital deployment front also. Earlier this month, we announced the acquisition of Intelligrated for $1.5 billion. Intelligrated serves the high-growth e-commerce industry, offering complete warehouse automation solutions, software and services. Intelligrated has a large and growing installed base of customers that align well with our new Safety and Productivity Solutions business and they serve a highly attractive market that is forecasted to grow 8% to 10% a year. 
We also announced the spinoff of our Resins & Chemicals business into an independent public company called AdvanSix. The spinoff of AdvanSix is progressing well, and we expect completion this year. These portfolio changes continue to move our growth profile upward and build on our Great Positions in Good Industries.
In June, Shane Tedjarati and his team hosted approximately 20 investors and analysts in China to learn more about Honeywell's tremendous growth opportunities in high-growth regions. The trip covered 4 cities in 5 days and included meetings with Chinese government officials, local economists and CEOs, business innovation centers and high-tech incubators, site tours of Honeywell's turbo factory in Wuhan and S&PS factory in Suzhou as well as an in-depth HGR business review. This trip served as an excellent venue for our shareowners and analysts to better understand our HGR strategies, including becoming the Chinese competitor, East-For-East and East-To-Rest, and how our experience in China has driven our strategic thinking and provided a foundation for further growth in other high-growth regions. High-growth regions have driven approximately 50% of our growth over the last 10 years, and we expect it to continue to be a key growth engine for Honeywell going forward.
And our focus on software continues with the announcement of our new digital transformation business, part of Honeywell Process Solutions. This business will help industrial companies harness the power of the industrial Internet of Things to make their operations more reliable, more efficient and safer. The industrial Internet of Things was the key topic at our 41st Annual Honeywell User Group Conference in San Antonio, where we introduced our new Uniformance suite. This suite is our analytics platform that provides realtime digital intelligence to turn plant data into actionable information. At the User Group Conference, more than 1,000 people gathered to discuss IIoT's tremendous potential to solve the toughest challenges facing industrial companies today. Honeywell's portfolio of technologies, advanced analytics and deep domain knowledge position us well to utilize data to help customers operate their plants more safely and efficiently, and reduce unplanned downtime.
We're also monitoring the macro environment in light of Britain's recently announced exit from the European Union, and we expect minimal near-term impact. Tom will take you through some of the actions we've taken to mitigate potential risks, but it's important to note that our planning framework hasn't changed. We'll be cautious in our sales planning and continue to plan our costs and spending conservatively, ensuring we remain flexible as a company. And we'll maintain our seed planting for the future, supported by a robust pipeline of funded restructuring projects. We'll continue to support growth, focusing on winning in high-growth regions, advancing our superior software capabilities, and effectively using HOS Gold to drive breakthrough initiatives and deliver high-quality products to our customers globally.
So with that, I'll turn it over to Tom."

I'm now on Slide 3, which shows the second quarter results. Reported sales of $10 billion increased 2%, reflecting impact of acquisitions, and declined 2% on a core organic basis. We saw a continued growth in our Commercial",4813,"Thanks, Dave, and good morning. I'm now on Slide 3, which shows the second quarter results. Reported sales of $10 billion increased 2%, reflecting impact of acquisitions, and declined 2% on a core organic basis. We saw a continued growth in our Commercial Aviation Aftermarket, Security and Fire, Process Solutions and Transportation Systems, which I'll talk more about on the business slides. 
The continued declines in our oil and gas businesses in UOP and difficult comps in S&PS were largely as we expected. In our high-growth regions, India grew 30% -- nearly 30%, while in China, Aero and ACS continued the momentum from the first quarter, partially offset by moderating declines in PMT. All of our recent acquisitions are performing at or above the deal financial models, and the sales from our 7 recent acquisitions collectively grew in the high single-digit basis on a core organic basis this quarter.
Segment margin was up 10 basis points versus the prior year, at the high end of our guidance range, or up 50 basis points, excluding the dilutive impact of acquisitions. As Dave mentioned, on an operational basis -- so that's further excluding the impacts of foreign exchange, the Aerospace OEM incentives and raw material pass-through pricing in Resins & Chemicals, segment margin improved 110 basis points. We expect the overall margin expansion will continue to improve in the second half.
Earnings per share of $1.66 were up 10%, coming in at the high end of our guidance range. Also we funded $97 million of restructuring projects. That's $53 million net of reversals, largely offsetting the benefit from higher pension income in the quarter, as expected.
On share count, we've repurchased another $500 million of shares at attractive prices. On a full year basis, we expect the fully diluted weighted average share count to be approximately 774 million shares. We have been and will continue to deploy capital to appropriate opportunities that will create the greatest value for our shareowners.
Free cash flow in the quarter, $1.3 billion, improved sequentially and was up 8% as compared to the second quarter of 2015, representing approximately 100% free cash flow conversion. The increase year-over-year was driven primarily by improving net income. Even with the increase in free cash flow, we were able to fund 16% more in capital expenditures or approximately $280 million in the quarter. These are principally the high-ROI projects that we've discussed in the past. So as you can see, we continue to generate strong results in a relatively slow growth environment.
Slide 4 provides a quick recap of our year-to-date growth in the portfolio. Roughly 70% of the Honeywell portfolio is growing at a 5% core organic rate, led by Fluorine Products, Security and Fire, Process Solutions and Transportation Systems and -- as well as the 5 other businesses shown here. We have good visibility to continued outperformance based on our orders and backlog, stable end markets and new wins. And this outperformance includes overcoming the significant Aero OEM incentives we face in our Commercial Aviation business. So a good sign as we head into the second half of 2016.
For the other 30% of the portfolio, core organic sales growth year-to-date has declined 13% due to the known headwinds that we've discussed previously. We've highlighted the market headwinds in our oil and gas businesses in UOP, which bottoms out in 2016, also the tough comps from the completion of the U.S. Postal Service win in S&PS, and the softness in our services and international business within Defense & Space as well as the market pricing headwinds in Resins & Chemicals. These headwinds are largely expected to subside in the second half of 2016 and into 2017.
We think the slide illustrates the diversity of opportunity within the Honeywell portfolio. There's not one business that will make or break us. We continue to be confident about the portfolio and the positions we have as we look to the second half of 2016 and to 2017.
Slide 5 provides more detail on our earnings per share for the quarter. Our operating initiatives, led by the deployment of HOS, continue to drive segment profit growth. On an operational basis, segment profit accounted for $0.16 of EPS growth in the quarter. We generated 110 basis points of operational improvement in segment margin, which compares well with the 100-plus basis point improvement we saw for the full year of 2015. Each of the segments are contributing. We have differentiated technologies with a software focus, and the Honeywell user experience is driving the development of new products at higher margins. 
Our factories and sourcing organizations continue to mature. Our functional transformation is improving the quality of our back office while reducing its cost, and we continue to manage our indirect spend stringently. In addition, the previously funded restructuring as well as new restructuring actions have enabled us to continue improving our overall cost position.
The other impacts you see on the slide combined for a $0.01 decline in earnings for the quarter. First, the M&A-related charges stemming from the 8 deals in the last 12 months resulted in $0.05 in year-over-year dilution, primarily due to acquisition accounting and pay-as-you-go costs, with Elster having the largest impact. The incremental amortization from the deals will be a margin headwind for the rest of the year as we anticipated, but the net results from all acquisitions should improve in the second half as we lap some of the large onetime costs. Each of our acquisitions are performing well and are at or above our deal models. And as I mentioned, the organic growth embedded in these portfolios that we acquired, which is not included in our overall organic growth numbers, has been outstanding.
Second, foreign currency represented a $0.04 headwind in the quarter and should be roughly $0.15 for the full year. You'll recall that our hedging approach results in a euro rate of $1.24 for 2015 versus $1.10 for 2016.
Third, Aerospace OEM incentives reflect our continued investment in developing and growing our installed base on the right platforms in the commercial aviation industry. We now anticipate the full year 2016 year-over-year impact from OEM incentives to be more than $200 million, and the Q2 impact was approximately $0.03.
Lastly, below-the-line items and share count were net positive year-over-year by $0.07 and $0.04, respectively, as we previewed. On share count, our repurchases through the end of the second quarter were at an average price of $106 per share. So overall, strong earnings results while overcoming significant headwinds in what continues to be an uncertain macro environment.
Let's move to Slide 6. As Dave said, we announced the acquisition of Intelligrated earlier this month, building on the $6 billion-plus of acquisitions we've completed since the beginning of 2015. Intelligrated designs, manufactures, integrates and installs complete warehouse automation solutions, software and services that result in smarter distribution and fulfillment operations. Its supply chain and warehouse solutions drive improved productivity and lower costs for retailers, manufacturers and logistic providers around the world. The company's offerings include conveyor, sortation, palletizers and robotics as well as automated storage and retrieval systems, all managed by advanced machine control and software.
Intelligrated's software offers warehouse execution systems a scalable suite of software that managers -- manage the entire fulfillment process, including equipment, labor and business intelligence, integrated with voice and light-directed picking and putting technologies.
Intelligrated's mission-critical warehouse execution systems and software are a fantastic complement to the scanning, mobile computer and voice automation technologies in S&PS. They have a large and growing installed base, which includes 30 of the top 50 U.S. retailers and 50 of the top 100 Internet retailers. They also maintain a strong leadership position in the approximately $20 billion warehouse automation segment. About 90% of the business today is in the U.S. so there are significant opportunities to expand globally through Honeywell's footprint and customer diversification.
Intelligrated is at the intersection of several key global megatrends, namely e-commerce, software and automation, with distinguished sales growth in a market that is forecast to grow 8% to 10% a year. S&PS was built initially through acquisitions, which we've continually expanded through strong organic growth and operational improvements, a good testament to our rigorous and proven M&A approach and the benefits of being patient with our capital deployment. We expect this transaction to close by the end of the third quarter, and we're excited about the opportunities this acquisition has to offer.
Let's turn to Page 7. We wanted to spend a moment addressing Honeywell's proactive positioning ahead of Britain's recently announced exit from the European Union. You're all familiar with the developments and uncertainties, and we received a lot of questions about the impact on Honeywell. The process of actually exiting the EU will take some time and thus, may cause greater uncertainty in the short term, in addition to potentially slower U.K. and EU economic growth longer term. We'll continue to monitor our European short-cycle businesses for any signs of change. But as a reference point, our core organic sales in the EU region has held up nicely year-to-date. We will continue to be cautious in our sales planning and stay conservative in terms of our cost structure and investments in the region. 
In addition to the ongoing productivity initiatives in our supply chain functions, we're also prepared to leverage the flexibility we have to quickly adjust cost levels as the need arises. 
As it relates to currency, we've continued our foreign currency hedging approach. We've hedged approximately 75% of our 2017 euro P&L exposure at $1.15 and roughly 50% of our 2017 British P&L exposure at $1.44. So while there may continue to be volatility on the sales line, our euro and pound-based earnings are protected, similar to the approach we took for 2016. We will continue to actively monitor the situation as we head into 2017.
Let's move to Slide 8 and discuss the Aerospace results. Sales declined 1%, or 2% on a core organic basis, below our expectations, primarily driven by weaker-than-expected sales in Defense & Space, which I'll explain further in a moment. The Commercial Aviation OE sales decreased by 8% on a core organic basis, as higher volumes with OEMs in Air Transport and Regional were more than offset by a 7-point headwind from higher OEM incentives and lower engine shipments in Business and General Aviation. The BGA OE business, in particular, faced a difficult prior year comparison which, as a reminder, grew north of 20% in the second quarter of 2015. And as we highlighted last month, the demand environment in business jets overall is slower.
Commercial Aviation Aftermarket sales continue to be robust, growing 6% on a core organic basis. On the spares side, we saw an increase in airline and BGA spares, driven by strong mechanical demand and higher GX aviation sales, including Satcom and software upgrades. Repair and overhaul activities increased in line with flight hours, which remain strong in the second quarter as well.
Defense & Space sales declined 10% on a core organic basis, driven primarily by difficult prior year comparisons in the international business as larger projects were completed as well as lower sales to key channel partners. Our U.S. services and space businesses declined year-over-year due to unexpected program delays and completions of other programs, but we continue to perform well in our U.S. aftermarket business with increased spares and retrofit sales. In addition, our commercial helicopter business continues to be impacted by declines in the oil and gas markets. Reported sales reflect the impact of COM DEV, the satellite communications acquisition, which has performed well this year.
Transportation Systems sales increased 3% on a core organic basis due to new platform launches and continued volume growth in both gas and diesel light-vehicle applications. We continue to grow in our light-vehicle diesel business in Europe, which was up single digit in the quarter. The growth in light-vehicle gas was also most prominent in Europe and China.
Aerospace segment margin expanded 60 basis points, or 80 basis points excluding the dilutive impact of acquisitions. This was driven by productivity, net of inflation, and commercial excellence, partially offset by continued investments for growth, including higher OEM incentives, and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency.
Let's turn to the ACS results on Slide 9. ACS sales increased 9%, reflecting the favorable impact from acquisitions, primarily Elster. On a core organic basis, sales were down minus 1% in the second quarter, in line with our guidance. The segment margin expanded -- or segment margin expansion improved to 50 basis points in the quarter, excluding the impact of M&A, a big improvement from the 10 basis points expansion in the first quarter. And we expect ongoing acceleration the second half of the year.
Sales in Energy, Safety and Security, so the products businesses, were down 2% on a core organic basis in the second quarter. The momentum continued in Security and Fire, globally, with strong growth rates in both residential and commercial markets, coupled with the benefit from new product introductions and further penetration in high-growth regions. Our China business overall in ESS grew high single digit in the quarter, and we saw a double-digit growth in India. We've continued to outperform in our high-growth regions, driven by our connected ACS China strategy and the benefits from our ongoing investments for growth. These improvements were offset by lower volume in S&PS, primarily from the 2015 completion of the U.S. Postal Service contract. We expect S&PS to return to growth in the fourth quarter.
Building Solutions & Distribution sales were up 3% on a core organic basis in the quarter. We experienced continued strength on the distribution side with strong growth in North America and EMEA across our video, access and intrusion product lines. In Building Solutions, we saw modest growth, reflecting strength in services, partially offset by softness in the project installation business. Orders growth in the services and energy retrofit businesses was more than offset by a decline in the project businesses, but we remain encouraged by the solid improvements we've seen in our energy portfolio in HBS. Orders have doubled in that portfolio through the first half of 2016. This has been driven by sales excellence and a differentiated offering that is leading to multiple awards. The Buildings Solutions backlog and service bank increased low single digit in the quarter on an organic basis. 
Segment margins in ACS continues to benefit from productivity initiatives, the favorable impact from restructuring and commercial excellence while maintaining investments for growth in our connected product offerings and in high-growth regions. Mix was slightly better than last quarter, and we expect this to continue in the second half.
On Page 10 -- I'm now on Page 10. This morning, we highlighted that ACS will be split into 2 newly created business groups. I want to share a little bit more information on that. 
The first, Home and Building Technologies, will be roughly a $9 billion enterprise, which comprises our legacy Environmental & Energy Solutions, including Elster; Security and Fire; and Building Solutions & Distribution businesses. E&ES' industrial combustion and thermal business will be reclassified to PMT. The HBT business will be led by Terrence Hahn, who previously ran our Transportation Systems unit for the past 3 years and has been with Honeywell for over 9 years.
The second segment, Safety and Productivity Solutions, will be roughly a $5 billion business, comprising the former Sensing and Productivity Solutions and industrial safety businesses, including the recent acquisition, Intelligrated. The new S&PS will be led by John Waldron, who's currently President of our Sensing and Productivity Solutions business unit and previously was President of Scanning and Mobility. 
Today's announcement represents yet another step in the evolution of the Honeywell portfolio. We're constantly looking at ways to improve our organic growth profile. We think a smaller, more focused segment structure will allow us to accelerate breakthrough growth and new product introduction by being closer to our customers. Also, fewer layers and structures will lead to faster decision-making and a more efficient organization. This analysis builds on the momentum in ACS and across the entire portfolio following the acquisitions of Elster, Xtralis, Intelligrated and 5 other acquisitions since July of last year. The change further positions these businesses to invest in growth and execute the strategic plans best suited to each portfolio, and we have the right leaders in place to drive these actions.
We expect to begin reporting under the new segment structure effective with our third quarter 2016 results and expect to provide comparative financial information at that time. So more to come on this in the coming months.
Let's move to Slide 11 to discuss the PMT results. PMT sales declined 4% on a core organic basis, in line with our guidance. It continues to be a challenging market environment for oil and gas. Our orders and backlog have remained resilient, and the leadership team has been unrelenting in its focus to overcome these headwinds. 
So starting with UOP, sales were down as expected, driven by lower gas processing, licensing and equipment sales. The rate of sales decline improved significantly from the first quarter. In gas processing, we secured 5 new domestic wins in the first half, however that market remains a bit sluggish. On the catalyst side, overall demand remain strong, and we expect an acceleration of growth in the second half of the year. UOP orders were modestly higher in the quarter, including a strong double-digit increase in the catalyst business, and UOP backlog was close to 10% higher than the second quarter of 2015.
Process Solutions continues to outperform its peers in a challenging environment. We have a unique combination of automation technology, field instrumentation products and aftermarket offerings, including software solutions. Core organic sales increased 8% in the quarter, driven by double-digit growth in our projects business and higher software and service sales. Conversion of the global megaproject backlog, where we serve as the main contractor providing control and safety solutions for large installations, remained strong in the second quarter, and we expect this trend to continue throughout the rest of the year.
Through the recent megaproject wins, HPS continues to build out its massive installed base, which will benefit our services and aftermarket business in future periods. Reported sales were higher in the quarter due to the impact from the Elster acquisition.
Advanced Materials sales were down 2% on a core organic basis, driven by challenging pricing conditions in Resins & Chemicals, partially offset by continued strong demand and more than 20% growth for Solstice low-global-warming products. We presently have roughly $3.5 billion of signed agreements for Solstice and are building out production capacity to meet the increased global customer demand.
As expected, PMT segment margins were down 20 basis points to 21.1%, primarily due the impact of lower volumes overall and continued growth investments, partially offset by benefits from previous restructuring actions and commercial excellence. So overall, market conditions continue to be tough, but our businesses in PMT are doing well, and we expect an even better second half.
I'm now on Slide 12 with a preview of the third quarter. You'll note that the guidance reflects the ACS structure prior to this morning's announcement. We'll be updating the reporting for the new structure starting the third quarter, as I mentioned.
So for total Honeywell, we're planning for sales of $10 billion to $10.2 billion. That's up 4% to 6% reported or up flat -- or flat to up 1% on a core organic basis. The sales guidance for the quarter does not reflect the impact of the Intelligrated acquisition as we expect the transaction to close near quarter-end.
Segment margins are expected to be down 10 basis points to up 10 basis points, excluding M&A, or down 40 to 60 basis points on a reported basis. Finally, EPS is expected to be in the range of $1.67 to $1.72, up 6% to 10% normalized for income tax at 26.5% in both years.
Starting with Aerospace. Sales are expected to be down 1% to up 1% on a core organic basis. In Commercial Aviation OE, we're expecting sales to be down double digit, driven by the impact of OEM incentives and continued declines in Business and General Aviation, partially offset by a ramp-up on key platforms in Air Transport and Regional.
Excluding the OEM incentives, Commercial Aviation OE is expected to be down mid-single digit. Commercial Aviation Aftermarket sales are expected to grow mid-single digit again, with strength in both airline and business jet spare sales, including higher Satcom and other software upgrades. 
Defense & Space sales are expected to improve sequentially, but be modestly down on a year-over-year basis as higher product sales to the U.S. government are more than offset by challenging prior year comparisons in the international business, the impact of large project wind-downs and the continued softness in U.S. services. 
In Transportation Systems, sales are expected to be up low single digit with continued strong growth in light-vehicle gas applications, partially offset by slower growth in diesel based on the timing of new launches. As for Aerospace margin rates, we expect to be down 30 to 50 basis points, excluding M&A, driven by higher OEM incentives, the unfavorable impact of foreign currency and the unfavorable impact on margin of higher OE shipments to Air Transport and Regional customers. Now this will be partially offset by productivity and commercial excellence.
Moving to ACS. Sales are expected to be flat to up 1% on a core organic basis or up 11% to 12% on a reported basis, driven by acquisitions. We expect ESS sales growth to be similar to the second quarter on a core organic basis, led by continued momentum in our Security and Fire businesses and in our high-growth regions, but more than offset by the declines we highlighted in S&PS.
In BSD, we're expecting low to mid-single digit core organic growth, driven primarily by continued strength in Americas Distribution business in both residential and commercial end markets.
Excluding the dilutive impact from M&A, ACS margin rate is expected to improve 90 to 110 basis points, driven by commercial excellence, continued productivity and the benefits of restructuring. ACS's reported segment margin rate in the second quarter is expected to be up 10 to 30 basis points -- I'm sorry, third quarter is expected to be up 10 to 30 basis points. In PMT, sales are expected to be up flat -- or expected to be flat to up 2% on a core organic basis or up 2% to 4% reported. UOP sales declines are expected to moderate in the third quarter, but still be down double digits on a year-over-year basis, driven primarily by continued declines in licensing, equipment and gas processing, partially offset by strength in the catalyst business.
Based on our growing UOP backlog, we expect the catalyst sales growth rates to improve in the second half of the year, particularly in the fourth quarter. HPS sales are expected to be up mid-single digits on a core organic basis, driven by continued conversion of global megaprojects, as I mentioned earlier, as well as higher software and service sales.
Advanced Materials sales are expected to be up low to mid-single digits on a core organic basis, driven by strength in Fluorine Products and Solstice sales and improving specialty products lines, benefiting from new product introductions.
PMT reported segment margin rate expected to be down 100 to 120 basis points and down 70 to 90 basis points, excluding the dilutive impact of M&A, driven by lower volumes, the unfavorable impact of lower UOP licensing sales, market pricing headwinds in Resins & Chemicals and continued investments for growth, partially offset by productivity, net of inflation.
Slide 13 provides our full year 2000 (sic) [ 2016 ] expectations by business compared to the initial guidance we provided back in December. While there are a number of puts and takes within the overall portfolio, we're tracking to our initial full year core organic sales guidance for Honeywell.
In Aerospace, Commercial OE continue to see improvement in ATR with a ramp-up of key platforms like A350 and A320 as well as Boeing 737 and 787. However, as we saw this quarter, the demand environment in business jets is slower than we anticipated, and we expect this trend to continue in the second half. Meanwhile, our Commercial Aftermarket business is coming better than anticipated as we build on the 6% core organic growth achieved year-to-date, driven by stronger flight hours and continued spares growth and repair and overhaul activities. Defense & Space will remain challenged throughout the year as the U.S. services and space businesses anticipate further program delays in the second half, and as oil and gas market declines continue to adversely impact the commercial helicopter market.
In total, ACS is performing largely as we expected. The products businesses are coming in slightly lower, largely due to lower volumes in our Sensing and Productivity Solutions businesses due to some channel headwinds, while Building Solutions and Distribution is coming in much better, driven by double-digit core organic growth performance in this first quarter and continued strength in Americas Distribution as we move into the second half.
In PMT, our Process Solutions business continues to outperform, driven by the strong conversion of the global megaproject backlog. Our software solutions are generating strong demand, and we anticipate this to continue for the remainder of the year.
In UOP, activity continues to be soft given the slowdowns in orders in our gas processing, licensing and equipment businesses, but as I indicated, we expect a very strong second half for UOP's catalyst business. So on balance, no change to our core organic sales outlook in total, but we continue to monitor the businesses closely.
I'm moving to Slide 14. As Dave mentioned, we're raising the low end of our full year EPS guidance by $0.05 with a new range of $6.60 to $6.70. That's up 8 to 10 -- or 8% to 10% from 2015. The new range reflects the outperformance in the first half of the year. There's some puts and takes among these segments from the guidance we provided in April, but overall, very strong year expected for Honeywell in 2016 once again.
In total, we now expect core organic sales growth of approximately 1% and total sales to be between $40 billion and $40.6 billion, so up 4% to 5% reported. The revised guidance reflects the incremental headwinds we've seen in Aerospace, particularly in our BGA and Defense & Space businesses. This guidance does not reflect the Intelligrated acquisition or the planned spinoff of Resins & Chemicals.
Segment margin expansion is still expected to be up 10 to 50 basis points, or 80 to 110 basis points excluding the dilutive impact of M&A, driven by commercial excellence, restructuring benefits and continued proactive cost management. We expect the full year income tax rate to be approximately 26.5% and our share count to be approximately 774 million shares or approximately 2% lower than the 2015 weighted average share count of 789 million.
Finally, we continue to expect free cash flow in the range of $4.6 billion to $4.8 billion, up 5% to 10% from 2015, with CapEx investments roughly flat to 2015 at approximately $1.1 billion. This will drive free cash flow conversion of approximately 90% for the full year.
Let me move to Slide 15 for a quick summary before heading it -- or turning it back to Mark for Q&A. We had a solid first half, adding to our strong performance track record and generating momentum for the rest of the year. Once again, we've demonstrated that we can deliver at the high end of our aggressive earnings commitments even with limited help from the macro environment, a big reminder of the value of our diversified and balanced portfolio and the strength of the Honeywell Operating System. And we, again, put to work a sizable amount of shareowner capital in the quarter, including $1.5 billion in additional acquisitions and $0.5 billion in share repurchases, which will pave the way for future earnings and cash growth.
The uncertainty in the macro environment is not new for us. We have and will continue to plan conservatively. We continue to focus on executing sustainable productivity actions, including delivering on the strong restructuring pipeline. We have roughly $300 million of actions to be carried out.
We're making smart bets on innovation and breakthrough initiatives and continuing our investments to further penetrate high-growth regions and expand capacity. We're in the process of planning for 2017, and our management team is focused on execution. We feel confident that our balanced portfolio mix aligned to favorable macro trends and focused cost discipline will continue to outperform.
Without further ado, let's move to Q&A."

What's going on out there that gives you the confidence that we're not walking into an even tougher back half of the year? Because the first half of this year has been pretty tough, and some of your peers reported pretty tough numbers, too. So it's not just you guys. But I mean, negative core growth is something we don't normally see in an expansionary time period, right? So I guess, I'm asking a general question on what you think about the world."

I don't think we've ever referred to this environment as being expansionary. And the way I would describe the overall performance and why we say strong, if you take a look at the cash we generated, if you take a look at the operational margin rate improvement, 110 basis points, which is consistent with what we were doing last year, it's just all the stuff to the right of the chart was moving in the right direction. This year, it's not. If you take a look at the EPS growth, we've been able to deliver on that, and the chart Tom showed that said about $0.15 or $0.16 of the total $0.14 increase or $0.15 increase came from operations. That's pretty strong operational performance. Now you could say, okay, this 2% negative core organic, that's true. It's also consistent with what we had forecasted. It was our guidance range, so it's not like it came as a surprise. And the headwinds are no different than what we've talked about in the past, and that's why Tom tried to show that 70% of the portfolio is actually growing 5%. We've just got these unusual headwinds, most of which -- well, all of which dissipate this year. If you take a look at UOP, I mean, you know what's happening on the oil and gas side. And we've always said our diversity of opportunity will offset that. And we do believe that in 2016, that ends. This is the bottom for that sector. If we take a look at the Sensing and Productivity Solutions business and think of this as a lot driven by scanning and mobility, where we had this huge U.S. Postal Service order last year that we're -- in terms of a comp, it's just going to be negative. It just is. It would have been impossible to make that up. Our Resins & Chemicals pricing, which you're familiar with, really has no effect on the bottom line, does affect growth when we look at the overall number. And then some in Defense & Space, where there's just been delays in orders. And the commercial helo market, largely driven by oil and gas, has been difficult. Those headwinds stop. It's just a matter of dealing with them as they are today, and 70% of the portfolio is growing 5%. So I think it's pretty darn good overall. And yes, I understand the point about minus 2%. But we also forecasted, it's not like it came as a surprise."

Is -- what is sort of the implications of perhaps you leaving or stepping aside a little bit sooner? Is it that there is a lot of, say, growth initiatives the company has been looking to do, and you sort of decided that maybe Darius should be assuming this on his own? Or perhaps, there is M&A implications? I'm just curious. It's almost a personal question, if there's something you could share with us."

It's going to be a differentiating item for airlines, for their consumers.

Well, this year, it's just going the other way. The operational improvement is still pretty darn good and consistent with last year. And if you look over on the right-hand side in this continued slow-growth environment, just like last year, it's just going the other way is all. But at the end of the day, the operational performance continues to be very good in a slow-growth environment. That part is not changing, and we're the same company that we were before.

I would say that in addition to the operational improvement that's in the triple digits, I mean, when you look at the items that brought us back to a reported margin rate that was lower than that 110 basis points, they're either items that are -- will turn for us or that are of an investment nature. So for example, if you look at foreign exchange, we're going from an FX rate of $1.24 last year to $1.10 this quarter. I talked about 2017 and some of the hedging we've done. So that will be an actual -- at our tails next year. When I look at the OEM incentives that we're making, I mean, this was the year that we've always flagged as having to deal with over $200 million of P&L impacts from the increased incentives. Those will level off next year and actually help us to build an installed base for service opportunities. And in the longer term, those decrease, so it will be another tailwind for us. And third, you've got a lot of M&A going on. We've done 8 acquisitions in the last year. There is a lot of focus on that. But when you're doing acquisitions, especially the sizable ones that we've done, you do get some headwinds in the earlier quarters from the purchase accounting step-up, the integration team costs and the like. And those will all turn on -- turn for us as well and really be a nice margin driver for us in the future. We're really happy with the acquisitions. And as I said, we don't include the organic growth that we're experiencing in those acquisitions in the minus 2% organic growth rate that we talked about. But those acquisitions grew 8% to 9% on their own if you compare how they did under prior ownership to how they did with Honeywell, so pretty strong performance. So we're really actually excited about these various factors because they're going to be -- they're going to turn and have a positive influence for next year."

As we previewed during our update call 2 weeks ago, for the third quarter, we reported earnings per share of $1.60 or $1.67, excluding the $0.07 we deployed to restructuring. We expect to return to double-digit EPS growth in the fourth quarter, which yield our full year EPS growth target of 8% to 9% that we communicated on October 7. 
Q3 was a quarter of important changes in many areas to position the company for better performance next year. These include the split of the former Automation and Control Solutions segment, ACS; the acquisition of Intelligrated; the sale of our government services business, HTSI; and the spin of Resins & Chemicals. Combined with nearly $250 million in restructuring actions, these changes are lasting improvements to the portfolio that yield benefits beginning in the fourth quarter and into 2017 when we expect year-over-year benefits exceeding $175 million from the restructuring actions alone.
In the fourth quarter, we'll lap the impact of our U.S. Postal Service project and productivity solutions, the UOP return to growth and expect the continued ramp of our Solstice low-global-warming products sales. Darius and Tom will provide more details about 2017 during our annual outlook call in December, but we have a favorable setup. The fourth quarter momentum continues. Our long-cycle businesses are improving, and our inflections start to kick in. It remains a slow-growth environment, but we've continue to invest heavily in the business in capital projects, research and development, hiring salespeople, winning content on new aerospace platforms, improving our growth profile through strategic M&A and divestitures and executing on restructuring projects to improve our fixed cost position. With all the work we've done to improve the growth profile, our continued emphasis on the Honeywell Operating System and our performance culture, we are well positioned for long-term growth and are committed to creating long-term shareowner value.
On October 7, we communicated all the changes or moving parts that occurred in the quarter. In our attempt to lend transparency to all the moving parts, we lost sight of the importance of conveying our confidence in our future for the fourth quarter, 2017 and beyond. For that miscommunication, I take full responsibility. 
Last week, we released a number of charts explaining why we were confident in our future. We've included several of those charts in this morning's package because we wanted to explain a bit behind each of them. We've continued to invest heavily, seed planting, if you will, and the returns will be there. We've outperform historically, and we'll continue to do so. We largely discussed third quarter a couple of weeks ago, so much of today's presentation focuses on the future and why we think Honeywell is an exciting place for you to be.
So with that, I'll turn it over to Tom."

I'm now on Slide 3 with a quick recap of our third quarter results. Reported sales of $9.8 billion increased 2%, primarily reflecting the impact of acquisitions.

Reported sales of $9.8 billion increased 2%, primarily reflecting the impact of acquisitions. On a core organic basis, sales were down 3%. Our growth was led by Process Solutions, Transportation Systems and Home and Building Technologies, but was more than offset by softness in business Jets, Defense & Space, productivity solutions and UOP. The softness in UOP has moderated throughout the year to the extent that in the fourth quarter, we expect high single-digit sales growth in that business.
The decline in segment margin in the quarter reflects the impact of OEM incentives, M&A integration costs and the lower volumes, partially offset by benefit from previously our funded restructuring. Earnings per share were up 4% to $1.67, excluding the restructuring charge deployed from the retroactive portion of the stock compensation accounting change. The individual researching projects in the third quarter have an average payback of about 2 years and provide attractive accretion in both 2017 and 2018. 
Free cash flow in the quarter was $1.3 billion. That's 103% conversion on net income. We continue to put substantial capital to work for our shareowners. Our CapEx and reinvestment ratio was 150% this quarter, and we bought back approximately $1.9 billion worth of Honeywell shares through the end of the third quarter.
Let me move on to Slide 4 to discuss the segment performance. In aero, the sales decline is consistent with what we previewed. The negative 6% headline number reflects the softness we described in our Business Jet OEM revenues and in Defense & Space, but also, to a larger degree, the increase in OEM incentives. I'll discuss the incentives more later. But in the third quarter, year-over-year increase in OEM incentives drove 4% of the minus 6% decline in the top line growth for Aerospace. 
Excluding the impact of OEM incentives, the commercial aviation OEM business was down 8%, with the Business Jet softness being partially offset by steady growth in air transport. Our Commercial aftermarket business was up 1% on a core organic basis. We're seeing continued repair and overhaul demand within air transport, but the softness in the business jet market is impacting the aftermarket. And we've seen fewer engine repair and overhaul events as a result.
Defense & Space was down 6% on a core organic basis, driven by program completions in U.S. space and international defense and lower volumes for commercial helicopters, primarily related to oil and gas. While disappointing, we are encouraged by the double-digit increase in Defense & Space year-to-date orders and backlog. Although as you can appreciate, much of this activity is longer term in nature, extending into 2017 and beyond.
Transportation Systems sales increased 3% organically in the quarter, driven by new program launches in light vehicles gas segment where we saw growth of nearly 20%. Aerospace segment margins were down, reflecting the increase in OEM incentives and lower volumes. 
In Home and Building Technologies, sales were up 5% on a core organic basis, driven by growth in both products and distribution businesses. The products business grew 1% organically, thanks to more than 15% growth in China and strength in the Americas Environmental & Energy Solutions businesses. The distribution business was up 8% organically in the quarter, driven by continued strength in the global distribution business and energy and services contracts within building solutions. The segment margin rate declines, excluding the impact of M&A, were primarily due to the mix of products versus distribution revenues this quarter.
In Performance Materials and Technologies, sales were down 3% on a core organic basis, driven by UOP, partially offset by strong global megaproject conversion in Process Solutions, which was up 3% organically. UOP sales were down 10% on a core organic basis, driven primarily by declines in gas processing and licensing and partially offset by higher catalyst shipments. Notably, UOP's backlog was up 15% at the quarter end. Demand for our catalysts continue to be strong, driven by reloads as a result of increased refinery turnarounds. Advanced Materials sales were down 2% on a core organic basis as demand for our Solstice line of low-global-warming materials within cooling products continue to be strong, partially offsetting the significant market pricing headwinds within Resins & Chemicals. These Resins & Chemicals headwinds are obviously now behind us as a result of the AdvanSix spin.
PMT segment margin was up 80 basis points to 21.6%, driven by strong productivity and cost controls, higher catalyst shipments and the favorable impact of acquisition integrations. Finally, in Safety and Productivity Solutions, sales were down 8% on a core organic basis. The safety business was down 3%, primarily due to softness in the general personal protective equipment business and lower demand for retail products. The productivity solutions business was down 12% on a core organic basis due to a tough comparison of the third quarter of 2015 and continued channel headwinds in productivity solutions. We will not face the U.S. Postal Service headwind next quarter as we've said. Segment margin was down 90 basis points, excluding M&A, to 15.2%, primarily reflecting the lower volumes.
Slide 5 shows our path to the fourth quarter EPS of $1.74 to $1.78. It's very consistent with what we have previously articulated a couple of weeks ago. We expect UOP to grow at high single digits on a core organic basis, driving significant sequential quarter-to-quarter EPS improvement. Catalyst sales are expected to be up about 20% in the quarter, and licensing and equipment sales will be up about 15%. Additionally, in Process Solutions, we expect to see the normal fourth quarter pickup in our short-cycle products and services businesses. We continue to closely monitor the oil and gas market but all in all, our outlook has improved.
We expect a 2% to 3% improvement from Safety and Productivity Solutions and $0.03 to $0.04 from restructuring. I spoke earlier about the rapid paybacks we expect on the restructuring we funded in the third quarter. All in, we have a funded pool of about -- of more than $400 million in restructuring projects.
All other is a $0.05 to $0.06 headwind reflecting the removal of Resins & Chemicals and the government services business from the portfolio, the normal onetime M&A costs from Intelligrated and the expected lower number of option exercises resulting in lower income tax benefits. This works to a Q4 earnings range of $1.74 to $1.78 per share as a 10% to 13% increase from the same period in 2015.
Let's turn to Slide 6 to provide some further color on our fourth quarter outlook. We expect that sales declines in Aerospace will continue into the fourth quarter, particularly in business Jets and Defense and space. We expect our total commercial OEM business to be down nearly 20%, with growth in Air Transport and Regional more than offset by declines in Business and General Aviation. In our aftermarket business, repair and overhaul will moderate slightly on lower events and lower aircraft utilization while growth in spares should be steady, primarily due to the new JetWave installations and channel and customer demand. 
The backlog in Defense & Space, as I said, is improving as we head into the fourth quarter but we still expect the business to be down in the mid-single-digit range on lower volumes globally. And finally, Transportation Systems, we see continued global gas turbo penetration, offset by slower diesel penetration, which will drive flat to slightly higher core organic sales in the quarter.
In HBT, we expect organic growth in the low single-digit range in both the products and distribution businesses. The reported growth is much higher, reflecting the Elster smart energy business, where we have significant rollouts in the U.K. and expected strength in the Americas gas business. On the product side, sales in Environmental & Energy Solutions business will continue to improve, driven by new product introductions in the Americas and strong double-digit growth in China and India. In the distribution segment, which consists of the global distribution business and buildings solutions, we expect strong backlog conversions, specifically in our energy business. And in EMEA and China. Our global distribution business will grow at a slower rate due to very tough comps from the fourth quarter 2015 when this business grew nearly 12%. Margin expansion will be driven mostly by productivity net of inflation, the benefits of restructuring, higher volumes and commercial excellence, offset slightly by the impact of the Elster acquisition.
In PMT, we see a return to growth in UOP, driven by continued strong orders. Orders were up 9% in the third quarter, particularly in the catalyst business. We also see some traction on the equipment side. Our orders over the past 3 months were over $700 million, and we're expecting a similar amount in the fourth quarter. Importantly, we see oil prices stabilizing in the $50 range. Generally, activity is picking up across the globe, including in China, and some projects that have been delayed or stalled are now resuming. Our year-to-date book-to-bill is 1.1 and was closer to 1.3 in the third quarter. 
And our win rates across all lines of business in UOP are strong. UOP should grow by high single digits in the fourth quarter as a result. In Process Solutions, sales will be down in the mid-single-digit range on lower megaproject sales growth, however, this should improve in 2017 as we replenish the backlog on anticipated healthy project orders in the fourth quarter. Finally, in Advanced Materials, core organic sales growth will be north of 10% driven by Solstice, which will grow considerably this quarter, and from higher volumes in specialty products across all lines of business. The significant increase in segment margin will be driven by the higher catalyst shipment content, the volume growth in Fluorine Products from Solstice and the favorable margin impact from the spinoff of AdvanSix.
In Safety and Productivity Solutions, we're finally past the headwinds associated with the U.S. Postal Service deployment. And as a result, we expect the business will be flat to slightly down in the fourth quarter, which represents a nearly 800 basis point improvement sequentially. This is also supported by slightly easier setup in industrial safety, driven by prior year oil and gas-related declines. We should see things improve overall from here, especially with the addition of Intelligrated, which we continue to be very excited about.
We've taken aggressive cost actions to address the slowdown in the third quarter. This should provide additional runway for margin expansion in the fourth quarter and into 2017. With more than $1.9 billion in share repurchases this year, our share count will be approximately 1% lower in the fourth quarter. And finally, as a result of last quarter's adoption of the stock compensation accounting standard, we now expect that our tax rate will be approximately 25% in the fourth quarter and about 24.5% for the full year.
Let's turn to Slide 7 to discuss our expected full year segment margin. On a reported basis, we expect to be down approximately 70 basis points, but this belies the significant operational improvement. We expect to deliver approximately 80 basis points. We continue to realize volume leverage in our growth segments and work with our suppliers to drive down material costs. Additionally, by deploying the Honeywell Operating System and our restructuring capacity, we continue to reduce our fixed costs throughout the enterprise, including in our plants and our administrative functions. These are permanent improvements in our cost structure that will drive significant margin expansion as growth more fully permeates the portfolio.
Offsetting this operational goodness are the upfront effects of investments we're making to improve the future. You'll recall that we are completing the first year of our 9 recent acquisitions. This first year is heavily burdened by costs for inventory accounting, amortization of intangibles, deal costs and integration costs. This will be an approximate 50 basis point headwind this year. OEM incentives are a 60 basis point headwind. I have a later slide on what these OEM incentives mean for our future growth. But given the conservative accounting we deploy in this area, we're experiencing a $0.25 EPS headwind in 2016 that will not repeat.
Finally, the foreign currency movement from 2015, principally the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, has driven approximately 40 basis points of margin rate headwind. Based on our hedging positions, we expect this to turn into a similar-sized benefit in 2017. So as you can see, we expect to end the year with segment margin at 18.1%, but are well positioned for 2017 as the favorable operational impacts from the Honeywell Operating System continue and the impact from the other factors recedes or flips around.
I'm now on Slide 8. We're reaffirming our full year EPS growth target of 8% to 9% or $6.60 to $6.64, excluding the anticipated fourth quarter pension mark-to-market adjustment of about $1.5 billion. This is based on current discount rates and asset return assumptions as of September 30 and is driven primarily by the decline in interest rates.
The sales and segment margin guidance you see here is consistent with the preview from October 7. With a lower-than-anticipated net income, principally in Aerospace, we now expect that free cash flow will be between $4.2 billion and $4.3 billion for the full year.
Slide 9 summarizes the end market dynamics that we anticipate in 2017 versus what we're experiencing this year. First, in homes and buildings, we'll continue to see steady growth, driven by new product introductions, connected offerings and the expansion of our installed base. Next, the dynamics we described for commercial aviation will continue in 2017, including declines in business jet market, steady performance in air transport driven by program ramp-ups, including on the A350 platform; and a reasonably stable aftermarket. What will change in commercial aviation is that the massive 2016 headwinds from OEM incentives will become a modest tailwind.
We expect the decline from Defense & Space will moderate a bit in 2017. While but we anticipate that demand in our commercial helicopter and domestic space businesses will continue to be slow, we'll no longer have the impact from our government services businesses following the sale of HTSI. And in addition, our long-cycle backlogs are improving, as I noted earlier. More than 3/4 of our expected fourth quarter sales are firm, which is above where we were at this point heading into the third quarter.
To moderate the effects of the overall declines in Aerospace, we've made significant improvements to our cost structure while investing for growth, including in sales headcount, research and development and in new products like JetWave. We anticipate stronger performance in our businesses that serve the industrial and workers end market. We'll no longer have the U.S. Postal Service comp, and Intelligrated will contribute to growth. We also expect our safety sales will improve over the course of the year.
The vehicles market will continue to be strong with increasing global penetration of turbos and growth in light vehicle gas applications. We also expect modest improvements on the commercial vehicles side in 2017. And on a global basis, we expect turbo penetration to be approximately 40%.
Lastly, Advanced Materials will be a strong contributor, highlighted by more than 25% growth in our Solstice products. Solstice is meeting or exceeding all expectations and is expected to be about $1 billion business for us by 2020.
Let me turn to Slide 10 for a preview of 2017. We've not finalized our 2017 planning. And as Dave said, Darius and I will provide a full update in December upon the completion of the process. We expect a continued slow growth environment but also believe that the inflection we've mentioned are still intact to enable us to grow faster than the markets we serve.
With that said, we're taking a conservative approach to the planning frameworks, specifically relative to Business Jets, Defense & Space and commercial helicopters. While we're targeting double-digit EPS growth, we're not counting on a recovery in these specific end markets to achieve that. We continue to work on the things we can control, and we see the result of this in the forecasted 45 to 75 basis points improvement in the margins on low single-digit core organic sales growth.
Still, we're constantly pressed on why we feel confident in our ability to deliver in '17, so let's spend a few minutes to explain the rationale underlying our outlook. Let me move to Slide 11.
First off, we've continued to deploy large amounts of shareowner capital. We've increased our dividend 15% in each of the 2 years. And including the $0.5 billion of value created through the spinoff of AdvanSix, that's nearly $2.4 billion of dividends alone in 2016. And we're committed to further growing the dividend faster than our rate of earnings growth. 
On share repurchase, we've been very active in 2016 and have already matched our total repurchases for all of last year. You'll recall that it takes about $1 billion of repurchases each year to keep our share count flat, and we've been doing twice that amount. 
M&A activity is significantly accelerated over the last 18 months. For the past few quarters, we've been dealing with the incremental acquisition and amortization costs from these deals. And as that begins to roll off, the contribution from this M&A will really be felt. And the M&A benefits do not even take into account the sales and commercial synergies we expect from combining sales forces, leveraging Honeywell's channels in high-growth regions and from general commercial excellence that we drive in our own businesses. Needless to say, we expect M&A will be a significant value driver in 2017 and for many years to come. 
Slide 12, we cast the deals we've completed. Each of these businesses participates in an attractive fast-growing market where they are perceived leaders in their space. They're accretive to Honeywell's growth rates. We believe there's a big opportunity for us to expand a number of these businesses into high-growth regions given the Honeywell presence, leadership teams and infrastructure already in place. Many of these businesses also have a strong technology and software component, and that will drive superior growth and improving gross and segment margins. I also don't want to lose the point that we continue to find strong, new talent through our acquisition that makes the combined companies better and further drives our software and technology initiatives.
Let me turn to Slide 13. We've talked extensively about OEM incentives. What you need to remember is, one, they're investments that have gotten us on a number of attractive new business jet and air transport platforms that build upon our already strong installed base. Two, we expense these incentives to our P&L as they're incurred, a more conservative treatment than most of our peers. Three, there's a very clear visibility to the incentives. They're negotiated years in advance, and any accelerated recognition of the cost does not change the aggregate cost, only the timing of the recognition as you saw in the third quarter. And lastly, 2016 is our peak for these investments. They're still significant, but they begin to decline in 2017, as you can see on the chart. We're excited about the extensions to our Aerospace franchise that these investments are enabling.
You can see on Slide 14 some of the other investments that we've made to grow our business. We've talked extensively over the past few years about our capital expenditures. We have been investing in about 1.6x depreciation for the last several years. The returns on the incremental investments, like Solstice, are phenomenal, twice that of any M&A deal we could do. And while they do temporarily dilute free cash flow, the investments are essential to our growth. We're nearing completion of this investment cycle. After which, we expect the reinvestment rate to normalize between 1.0 and 1.2x depreciation. 
We'll also continue to invest in research and development at a rate that's approximately 7.5% of sales, including R&D that's customer funded. Our R&D is fueling the next generation of Honeywell products, including our software offerings. 
And to ensure we have enough feet on the street to win in our end markets, we're also investing heavily on our sales force. You may think of this as a short-term investment, but it's not. A sales person really isn't productive enough in his first year on the job, so we have to ensure we have enough sales employees in place today to support tomorrow's business. The same applies in our high-growth regions where headcount has grown nearly 14% in the last 3 years, and we have funded more than $260 million in restructuring so far this year.
Slide 15 has more details on capital investments in Performance Materials and Technologies. These projects add capacity to our highly profitable businesses, like Solstice within Fluorine Products and catalysts within UOP. They deliver returns in the 30% to 40% range, and we expect more than $1 billion in sales in Solstice revenues per year by 2020. After that, and this is timely, we'll see additional demand generated by the Kigali amendment to the Montreal Protocol, which was just agreed to this week. In UOP, we continue to add catalyst capacity in the U.S. and abroad to support our large installed base in both refining and petrochemical segments.
On Slide 16, we profile another breakthrough technology that we're investing in, the connected aircraft. Our vision is to create a fast, seamless online experience for passengers, pilots and operations staff on the ground. To supplement our core product, we've invested in M&A in this space with EMS, Aviaso, Satcom1 and COM DEV, and those investments are beginning to pay off. With COM DEV's content on 95% of commercial satellites, we have insight into the networks and services that are going to be needed for connectivity now and in the future. EMS and Satcom1 provide us with antenna, modem and router technology, which is helping us to optimize the way data travels through the aerospace ecosystem, providing our customers with incremental value versus the competition. Lastly, Aviaso provides the software and data analytics necessary to serve airlines, and we have recent wins with Etihad Airways, Finnair and Lufthansa Cargo to support this. With all these capabilities, we're now able to supply an aircraft with a big data pipe, JetWave, that is 1,000 times faster and costs 20x less per mega weight than the previous systems. No one has the solution that we do with JetWave. Combined with our legacy expertise around avionics, mechanical equipment and services, we're positioned to win in the emerging $7 billion connected aircraft space. As you heard Tim say, we anticipate that the connected aircraft business will be larger than $1 billion for us by 2020.
Let's turn to Slide 17 to talk about another great position in a good industry, turbochargers. As you see -- as you heard us say before, we're in the golden age of turbos. Turbocharger adoption continues to be driven by regulations around fuel economy and emissions. To comply, automakers are downsizing engines. But to preserve engine performance, they look to our technology to -- which provides 30% more torque, 25% greater fuel efficiency and 20% lower carbon dioxide emissions. In the graph on the right, you can see that these factors are driving incredible growth and penetration. Today, more than 1/3 of all vehicles have a turbocharger. And by 2020, we anticipate roughly half of all vehicles will have one on board. And every year, when we look at our data, our long-term forecast for turbo penetration improves. This is a fantastic growth story for us, both in the short term and long term, particularly as adoption of our light vehicle gas applications continues to ramp up. We continue to win more than 40% of the OEM platform competitions globally.
Slide 18 highlights another aspect of why we're so well positioned for the future, our software capability. We've been developing software for a long time, much longer than the industrial Internet of Things became popular. More than half of our 23,000 engineers globally are developing software. More than 75% of our HOS Gold breakthrough goals are software related. While our expertise has traditionally been in software that is embedded within our products, we also have about $1 billion of highly profitable stand-alone software revenue, and that number is expected to grow significantly over the next 5 years.
The engineers are building on our strong industrial heritage to blend physical products with software. Last year, Honeywell became the first and only large Western company to announce that it is 100% compatible with capability maturity model integration at CMMI Level 5 across all global operations and in every business. This is a big deal. It means we can develop products faster and at a lower cost than many of our competitors. We also continue to make investments in our engineering base to ensure we have the best pool of talent driving the software growth at Honeywell.
Let me turn to Slide 19 and talk about high-growth regions, which represent about 40% of the world's GDP and collectively are growing north of 4%. When you compare that to the other 60% of the world, which is growing at less than 2%, it's clearly essential that we are there. And we need to be local if we're going to be successful in HGRs. We saw these trends early and made the right investments to ensure that we get on our fair share of growth.
Since 2003, we've increased our census in high-growth regions by 220%. Our presence is impressive: 140 offices, 70 manufacturing facilities and over 58,000 employees. And thanks to our investments, Honeywell's business in high-growth regions has grown at 12% CAGR. Today, HDR represents about 1/4 of our overall sales growth, and we expect that number will continue to grow.
Slide 20 conveys the attractive trends and dynamics for the markets in which we participate. Flight hours are growing, and passengers are demanding an on-the-ground experience when it comes to connectivity. Our Aerospace business is leading the way with JetWave. Turbo penetration is increasing. We have the global scale and industry-leading technology that is being adopted by automakers around the world. When it comes to the Internet of Things, we have over 11,000 engineers working on valuable software solutions that are helping our customers optimize their operations. In high-growth regions, we're addressing demand in the world's fastest-growing economies through innovative local products and solutions.
In PMT, we've invested for growth through capital expansions. It's too early to call a recovery but we are seeing signs that the bottom may have been reached in oil and gas, including month-over-month improvement in rig counts and drilled but uncompleted wells and a stabilizing oil price. We have a broad catalyst portfolio that allows us to capture a large percentage of upcoming catalysts reloads in areas where we participate. We also have leading modular gas processing technology for midstream gas applications and strong positions in refining and petrochemicals. 
We've also invested in capacity for Solstice, which is being rapidly adopted by automotive and building customers throughout the world to meet the demand for low-global-warming products as HFCs are phased out. And nearly half of Honeywell's current portfolio is dedicated to energy efficiency. 
The future's bright for Honeywell. The people and technologies we have and the investments we have made are tied to favorable trends in fast-growing industries. All this is going to drive future growth.
With that, I'll turn it back over to Dave."

When we did this aggregation of ACS, we also went through a significant management spends and layers, exercise. So what we tried to do was limit and reduce the number of layers that we had from the top boss down to the lowest level person in the organization. We've also tried to increase the span of control for each of our managers. So that also took up a bunch of the capacity that we spent in the third quarter. And I'd say thirdly, in our supply chain, we continue to have lots of opportunities whether it's continued integration of acquisitions that we've done or just addressing legacy sites. We found opportunities and still have more ahead of us to invest in restructuring and attractive payback projects. So it's a combination of the reorganization that we've done as well as the continuing address -- continue addressing of our ISC, our supply chain. Then the third thing I'd say is the acquisitions that we've done to achieve the cost synergies that we talked about. We do have to apply a restructuring. And again, those do deliver anywhere between 6% and 8% of cost synergies on the acquisitions, a bunch of that comes from just leveraging our sourcing agreements, but some of it's from restructuring as well. And so those are the 3 principal areas. And as a result, you're seeing that 2017 tailwind from the pool, from the projects that we have, as I said."

As we previewed during our update call 2 weeks ago, for the third quarter, we reported earnings per share of $1.60 or $1.67, excluding the $0.07 we deployed to restructuring. We expect to return to double-digit EPS growth in the fourth quarter, which yield our full year EPS growth target of 8% to 9% that we communicated on October 7. 
Q3 was a quarter of important changes in many areas to position the company for better performance next year. These include the split of the former Automation and Control Solutions segment, ACS; the acquisition of Intelligrated; the sale of our government services business, HTSI; and the spin of Resins & Chemicals. Combined with nearly $250 million in restructuring actions, these changes are lasting improvements to the portfolio that yield benefits beginning in the fourth quarter and into 2017 when we expect year-over-year benefits exceeding $175 million from the restructuring actions alone.
In the fourth quarter, we'll lap the impact of our U.S. Postal Service project and productivity solutions, the UOP return to growth and expect the continued ramp of our Solstice low-global-warming products sales. Darius and Tom will provide more details about 2017 during our annual outlook call in December, but we have a favorable setup. The fourth quarter momentum continues. Our long-cycle businesses are improving, and our inflections start to kick in. It remains a slow-growth environment, but we've continue to invest heavily in the business in capital projects, research and development, hiring salespeople, winning content on new aerospace platforms, improving our growth profile through strategic M&A and divestitures and executing on restructuring projects to improve our fixed cost position. With all the work we've done to improve the growth profile, our continued emphasis on the Honeywell Operating System and our performance culture, we are well positioned for long-term growth and are committed to creating long-term shareowner value.
On October 7, we communicated all the changes or moving parts that occurred in the quarter. In our attempt to lend transparency to all the moving parts, we lost sight of the importance of conveying our confidence in our future for the fourth quarter, 2017 and beyond. For that miscommunication, I take full responsibility. 
Last week, we released a number of charts explaining why we were confident in our future. We've included several of those charts in this morning's package because we wanted to explain a bit behind each of them. We've continued to invest heavily, seed planting, if you will, and the returns will be there. We've outperform historically, and we'll continue to do so. We largely discussed third quarter a couple of weeks ago, so much of today's presentation focuses on the future and why we think Honeywell is an exciting place for you to be.
So with that, I'll turn it over to Tom."

I'm now on Slide 3 with a quick recap of our third quarter results. Reported sales of $9.8 billion increased 2%, primarily reflecting the impact of acquisitions.

Reported sales of $9.8 billion increased 2%, primarily reflecting the impact of acquisitions. On a core organic basis, sales were down 3%. Our growth was led by Process Solutions, Transportation Systems and Home and Building Technologies, but was more than offset by softness in business Jets, Defense & Space, productivity solutions and UOP. The softness in UOP has moderated throughout the year to the extent that in the fourth quarter, we expect high single-digit sales growth in that business.
The decline in segment margin in the quarter reflects the impact of OEM incentives, M&A integration costs and the lower volumes, partially offset by benefit from previously our funded restructuring. Earnings per share were up 4% to $1.67, excluding the restructuring charge deployed from the retroactive portion of the stock compensation accounting change. The individual researching projects in the third quarter have an average payback of about 2 years and provide attractive accretion in both 2017 and 2018. 
Free cash flow in the quarter was $1.3 billion. That's 103% conversion on net income. We continue to put substantial capital to work for our shareowners. Our CapEx and reinvestment ratio was 150% this quarter, and we bought back approximately $1.9 billion worth of Honeywell shares through the end of the third quarter.
Let me move on to Slide 4 to discuss the segment performance. In aero, the sales decline is consistent with what we previewed. The negative 6% headline number reflects the softness we described in our Business Jet OEM revenues and in Defense & Space, but also, to a larger degree, the increase in OEM incentives. I'll discuss the incentives more later. But in the third quarter, year-over-year increase in OEM incentives drove 4% of the minus 6% decline in the top line growth for Aerospace. 
Excluding the impact of OEM incentives, the commercial aviation OEM business was down 8%, with the Business Jet softness being partially offset by steady growth in air transport. Our commercial aftermarket business was up 1% on a core organic basis. We're seeing continued repair and overhaul demand within air transport, but the softness in the business jet market is impacting the aftermarket. And we've seen fewer engine repair and overhaul events as a result.
Defense & Space was down 6% on a core organic basis, driven by program completions in U.S. space and international defense and lower volumes for commercial helicopters, primarily related to oil and gas. While disappointing, we are encouraged by the double-digit increase in Defense & Space year-to-date orders and backlog. Although as you can appreciate, much of this activity is longer term in nature, extending into 2017 and beyond.
Transportation Systems sales increased 3% organically in the quarter, driven by new program launches in light vehicles gas segment where we saw growth of nearly 20%. Aerospace segment margins were down, reflecting the increase in OEM incentives and lower volumes. 
In Home and Building Technologies, sales were up 5% on a core organic basis, driven by growth in both products and distribution businesses. The products business grew 1% organically, thanks to more than 15% growth in China and strength in the Americas Environmental & Energy Solutions businesses. The distribution business was up 8% organically in the quarter, driven by continued strength in the global distribution business and energy and services contracts within building solutions. The segment margin rate declines, excluding the impact of M&A, were primarily due to the mix of products versus distribution revenues this quarter.
In Performance Materials and Technologies, sales were down 3% on a core organic basis, driven by UOP, partially offset by strong global megaproject conversion in Process Solutions, which was up 3% organically. UOP sales were down 10% on a core organic basis, driven primarily by declines in gas processing and licensing and partially offset by higher catalyst shipments. Notably, UOP's backlog was up 15% at the quarter end. Demand for our catalysts continue to be strong, driven by reloads as a result of increased refinery turnarounds. Advanced Materials sales were down 2% on a core organic basis as demand for our Solstice line of low-global-warming materials within cooling products continue to be strong, partially offsetting the significant market pricing headwinds within Resins & Chemicals. These Resins & Chemicals headwinds are obviously now behind us as a result of the AdvanSix spin.
PMT segment margin was up 80 basis points to 21.6%, driven by strong productivity and cost controls, higher catalyst shipments and the favorable impact of acquisition integrations. Finally, in Safety and Productivity Solutions, sales were down 8% on a core organic basis. The safety business was down 3%, primarily due to softness in the general personal protective equipment business and lower demand for retail products. The productivity solutions business was down 12% on a core organic basis due to a tough comparison of the third quarter of 2015 and continued channel headwinds in productivity solutions. We will not face the U.S. Postal Service headwind next quarter as we've said. Segment margin was down 90 basis points, excluding M&A, to 15.2%, primarily reflecting the lower volumes.
Slide 5 shows our path to the fourth quarter EPS of $1.74 to $1.78. It's very consistent with what we have previously articulated a couple of weeks ago. We expect UOP to grow at high single digits on a core organic basis, driving significant sequential quarter-to-quarter EPS improvement. Catalyst sales are expected to be up about 20% in the quarter, and licensing and equipment sales will be up about 15%. Additionally, in Process Solutions, we expect to see the normal fourth quarter pickup in our short-cycle products and services businesses. We continue to closely monitor the oil and gas market but all in all, our outlook has improved.
We expect a 2% to 3% improvement from Safety and Productivity Solutions and $0.03 to $0.04 from restructuring. I spoke earlier about the rapid paybacks we expect on the restructuring we funded in the third quarter. All in, we have a funded pool of about -- of more than $400 million in restructuring projects.
All other is a $0.05 to $0.06 headwind reflecting the removal of Resins & Chemicals and the government services business from the portfolio, the normal onetime M&A costs from Intelligrated and the expected lower number of option exercises resulting in lower income tax benefits. This works to a Q4 earnings range of $1.74 to $1.78 per share as a 10% to 13% increase from the same period in 2015.
Let's turn to Slide 6 to provide some further color on our fourth quarter outlook. We expect that sales declines in Aerospace will continue into the fourth quarter, particularly in business Jets and Defense and space. We expect our total commercial OEM business to be down nearly 20%, with growth in Air Transport and Regional more than offset by declines in Business and General Aviation. In our aftermarket business, repair and overhaul will moderate slightly on lower events and lower aircraft utilization while growth in spares should be steady, primarily due to the new JetWave installations and channel and customer demand. 
The backlog in Defense & Space, as I said, is improving as we head into the fourth quarter but we still expect the business to be down in the mid-single-digit range on lower volumes globally. And finally, Transportation Systems, we see continued global gas turbo penetration, offset by slower diesel penetration, which will drive flat to slightly higher core organic sales in the quarter.
In HBT, we expect organic growth in the low single-digit range in both the products and distribution businesses. The reported growth is much higher, reflecting the Elster smart energy business, where we have significant rollouts in the U.K. and expected strength in the Americas gas business. On the product side, sales in Environmental & Energy Solutions business will continue to improve, driven by new product introductions in the Americas and strong double-digit growth in China and India. In the distribution segment, which consists of the global distribution business and buildings solutions, we expect strong backlog conversions, specifically in our energy business. And in EMEA and China. Our global distribution business will grow at a slower rate due to very tough comps from the fourth quarter 2015 when this business grew nearly 12%. Margin expansion will be driven mostly by productivity net of inflation, the benefits of restructuring, higher volumes and commercial excellence, offset slightly by the impact of the Elster acquisition.
In PMT, we see a return to growth in UOP, driven by continued strong orders. Orders were up 9% in the third quarter, particularly in the catalyst business. We also see some traction on the equipment side. Our orders over the past 3 months were over $700 million, and we're expecting a similar amount in the fourth quarter. Importantly, we see oil prices stabilizing in the $50 range. Generally, activity is picking up across the globe, including in China, and some projects that have been delayed or stalled are now resuming. Our year-to-date book-to-bill is 1.1 and was closer to 1.3 in the third quarter. 
And our win rates across all lines of business in UOP are strong. UOP should grow by high single digits in the fourth quarter as a result. In Process Solutions, sales will be down in the mid-single-digit range on lower megaproject sales growth, however, this should improve in 2017 as we replenish the backlog on anticipated healthy project orders in the fourth quarter. Finally, in Advanced Materials, core organic sales growth will be north of 10% driven by Solstice, which will grow considerably this quarter, and from higher volumes in specialty products across all lines of business. The significant increase in segment margin will be driven by the higher catalyst shipment content, the volume growth in Fluorine Products from Solstice and the favorable margin impact from the spinoff of AdvanSix.
In Safety and Productivity Solutions, we're finally past the headwinds associated with the U.S. Postal Service deployment. And as a result, we expect the business will be flat to slightly down in the fourth quarter, which represents a nearly 800 basis point improvement sequentially. This is also supported by slightly easier setup in industrial safety, driven by prior year oil and gas-related declines. We should see things improve overall from here, especially with the addition of Intelligrated, which we continue to be very excited about.
We've taken aggressive cost actions to address the slowdown in the third quarter. This should provide additional runway for margin expansion in the fourth quarter and into 2017. With more than $1.9 billion in share repurchases this year, our share count will be approximately 1% lower in the fourth quarter. And finally, as a result of last quarter's adoption of the stock compensation accounting standard, we now expect that our tax rate will be approximately 25% in the fourth quarter and about 24.5% for the full year.
Let's turn to Slide 7 to discuss our expected full year segment margin. On a reported basis, we expect to be down approximately 70 basis points, but this belies the significant operational improvement. We expect to deliver approximately 80 basis points. We continue to realize volume leverage in our growth segments and work with our suppliers to drive down material costs. Additionally, by deploying the Honeywell Operating System and our restructuring capacity, we continue to reduce our fixed costs throughout the enterprise, including in our plants and our administrative functions. These are permanent improvements in our cost structure that will drive significant margin expansion as growth more fully permeates the portfolio.
Offsetting this operational goodness are the upfront effects of investments we're making to improve the future. You'll recall that we are completing the first year of our 9 recent acquisitions. This first year is heavily burdened by costs for inventory accounting, amortization of intangibles, deal costs and integration costs. This will be an approximate 50 basis point headwind this year. OEM incentives are a 60 basis point headwind. I have a later slide on what these OEM incentives mean for our future growth. But given the conservative accounting we deploy in this area, we're experiencing a $0.25 EPS headwind in 2016 that will not repeat.
Finally, the foreign currency movement from 2015, principally the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, has driven approximately 40 basis points of margin rate headwind. Based on our hedging positions, we expect this to turn into a similar-sized benefit in 2017. So as you can see, we expect to end the year with segment margin at 18.1%, but are well positioned for 2017 as the favorable operational impacts from the Honeywell Operating System continue and the impact from the other factors recedes or flips around.
I'm now on Slide 8. We're reaffirming our full year EPS growth target of 8% to 9% or $6.60 to $6.64, excluding the anticipated fourth quarter pension mark-to-market adjustment of about $1.5 billion. This is based on current discount rates and asset return assumptions as of September 30 and is driven primarily by the decline in interest rates.
The sales and segment margin guidance you see here is consistent with the preview from October 7. With a lower-than-anticipated net income, principally in Aerospace, we now expect that free cash flow will be between $4.2 billion and $4.3 billion for the full year.
Slide 9 summarizes the end market dynamics that we anticipate in 2017 versus what we're experiencing this year. First, in homes and buildings, we'll continue to see steady growth, driven by new product introductions, connected offerings and the expansion of our installed base. Next, the dynamics we described for commercial aviation will continue in 2017, including declines in business jet market, steady performance in air transport driven by program ramp-ups, including on the A350 platform; and a reasonably stable aftermarket. What will change in commercial aviation is that the massive 2016 headwinds from OEM incentives will become a modest tailwind.
We expect the decline from Defense & Space will moderate a bit in 2017. While but we anticipate that demand in our commercial helicopter and domestic space businesses will continue to be slow, we'll no longer have the impact from our government services businesses following the sale of HTSI. And in addition, our long-cycle backlogs are improving, as I noted earlier. More than 3/4 of our expected fourth quarter sales are firm, which is above where we were at this point heading into the third quarter.
To moderate the effects of the overall declines in Aerospace, we've made significant improvements to our cost structure while investing for growth, including in sales headcount, research and development and in new products like JetWave. We anticipate stronger performance in our businesses that serve the industrial and workers end market. We'll no longer have the U.S. Postal Service comp, and Intelligrated will contribute to growth. We also expect our safety sales will improve over the course of the year.
The vehicles market will continue to be strong with increasing global penetration of turbos and growth in light vehicle gas applications. We also expect modest improvements on the commercial vehicles side in 2017. And on a global basis, we expect turbo penetration to be approximately 40%.
Lastly, Advanced Materials will be a strong contributor, highlighted by more than 25% growth in our Solstice products. Solstice is meeting or exceeding all expectations and is expected to be about $1 billion business for us by 2020.
Let me turn to Slide 10 for a preview of 2017. We've not finalized our 2017 planning. And as Dave said, Darius and I will provide a full update in December upon the completion of the process. We expect a continued slow growth environment but also believe that the inflection we've mentioned are still intact to enable us to grow faster than the markets we serve.
With that said, we're taking a conservative approach to the planning frameworks, specifically relative to Business Jets, Defense & Space and commercial helicopters. While we're targeting double-digit EPS growth, we're not counting on a recovery in these specific end markets to achieve that. We continue to work on the things we can control, and we see the result of this in the forecasted 45 to 75 basis points improvement in the margins on low single-digit core organic sales growth.
Still, we're constantly pressed on why we feel confident in our ability to deliver in '17, so let's spend a few minutes to explain the rationale underlying our outlook. Let me move to Slide 11.
First off, we've continued to deploy large amounts of shareowner capital. We've increased our dividend 15% in each of the 2 years. And including the $0.5 billion of value created through the spinoff of AdvanSix, that's nearly $2.4 billion of dividends alone in 2016. And we're committed to further growing the dividend faster than our rate of earnings growth. 
On share repurchase, we've been very active in 2016 and have already matched our total repurchases for all of last year. You'll recall that it takes about $1 billion of repurchases each year to keep our share count flat, and we've been doing twice that amount. 
M&A activity is significantly accelerated over the last 18 months. For the past few quarters, we've been dealing with the incremental acquisition and amortization costs from these deals. And as that begins to roll off, the contribution from this M&A will really be felt. And the M&A benefits do not even take into account the sales and commercial synergies we expect from combining sales forces, leveraging Honeywell's channels in high-growth regions and from general commercial excellence that we drive in our own businesses. Needless to say, we expect M&A will be a significant value driver in 2017 and for many years to come. 
Slide 12, we cast the deals we've completed. Each of these businesses participates in an attractive fast-growing market where they are perceived leaders in their space. They're accretive to Honeywell's growth rates. We believe there's a big opportunity for us to expand a number of these businesses into high-growth regions given the Honeywell presence, leadership teams and infrastructure already in place. Many of these businesses also have a strong technology and software component, and that will drive superior growth and improving gross and segment margins. I also don't want to lose the point that we continue to find strong, new talent through our acquisition that makes the combined companies better and further drives our software and technology initiatives.
Let me turn to Slide 13. We've talked extensively about OEM incentives. What you need to remember is, one, they're investments that have gotten us on a number of attractive new business jet and air transport platforms that build upon our already strong installed base. Two, we expense these incentives to our P&L as they're incurred, a more conservative treatment than most of our peers. Three, there's a very clear visibility to the incentives. They're negotiated years in advance, and any accelerated recognition of the cost does not change the aggregate cost, only the timing of the recognition as you saw in the third quarter. And lastly, 2016 is our peak for these investments. They're still significant, but they begin to decline in 2017, as you can see on the chart. We're excited about the extensions to our Aerospace franchise that these investments are enabling.
You can see on Slide 14 some of the other investments that we've made to grow our business. We've talked extensively over the past few years about our capital expenditures. We have been investing in about 1.6x depreciation for the last several years. The returns on the incremental investments, like Solstice, are phenomenal, twice that of any M&A deal we could do. And while they do temporarily dilute free cash flow, the investments are essential to our growth. We're nearing completion of this investment cycle. After which, we expect the reinvestment rate to normalize between 1.0 and 1.2x depreciation. 
We'll also continue to invest in research and development at a rate that's approximately 7.5% of sales, including R&D that's customer funded. Our R&D is fueling the next generation of Honeywell products, including our software offerings. 
And to ensure we have enough feet on the street to win in our end markets, we're also investing heavily on our sales force. You may think of this as a short-term investment, but it's not. A sales person really isn't productive enough in his first year on the job, so we have to ensure we have enough sales employees in place today to support tomorrow's business. The same applies in our high-growth regions where headcount has grown nearly 14% in the last 3 years, and we have funded more than $260 million in restructuring so far this year.
Slide 15 has more details on capital investments in Performance Materials and Technologies. These projects add capacity to our highly profitable businesses, like Solstice within Fluorine Products and catalysts within UOP. They deliver returns in the 30% to 40% range, and we expect more than $1 billion in sales in Solstice revenues per year by 2020. After that, and this is timely, we'll see additional demand generated by the Kigali amendment to the Montreal Protocol, which was just agreed to this week. In UOP, we continue to add catalyst capacity in the U.S. and abroad to support our large installed base in both refining and petrochemical segments.
On Slide 16, we profile another breakthrough technology that we're investing in, the connected aircraft. Our vision is to create a fast, seamless online experience for passengers, pilots and operations staff on the ground. To supplement our core product, we've invested in M&A in this space with EMS, Aviaso, Satcom1 and COM DEV, and those investments are beginning to pay off. With COM DEV's content on 95% of commercial satellites, we have insight into the networks and services that are going to be needed for connectivity now and in the future. EMS and Satcom1 provide us with antenna, modem and router technology, which is helping us to optimize the way data travels through the aerospace ecosystem, providing our customers with incremental value versus the competition. Lastly, Aviaso provides the software and data analytics necessary to serve airlines, and we have recent wins with Etihad Airways, Finnair and Lufthansa Cargo to support this. With all these capabilities, we're now able to supply an aircraft with a big data pipe, JetWave, that is 1,000 times faster and costs 20x less per mega weight than the previous systems. No one has the solution that we do with JetWave. Combined with our legacy expertise around avionics, mechanical equipment and services, we're positioned to win in the emerging $7 billion connected aircraft space. As you heard Tim say, we anticipate that the connected aircraft business will be larger than $1 billion for us by 2020.
Let's turn to Slide 17 to talk about another great position in a good industry, turbochargers. As you see -- as you heard us say before, we're in the golden age of turbos. Turbocharger adoption continues to be driven by regulations around fuel economy and emissions. To comply, automakers are downsizing engines. But to preserve engine performance, they look to our technology to -- which provides 30% more torque, 25% greater fuel efficiency and 20% lower carbon dioxide emissions. In the graph on the right, you can see that these factors are driving incredible growth and penetration. Today, more than 1/3 of all vehicles have a turbocharger. And by 2020, we anticipate roughly half of all vehicles will have one on board. And every year, when we look at our data, our long-term forecast for turbo penetration improves. This is a fantastic growth story for us, both in the short term and long term, particularly as adoption of our light vehicle gas applications continues to ramp up. We continue to win more than 40% of the OEM platform competitions globally.
Slide 18 highlights another aspect of why we're so well positioned for the future, our software capability. We've been developing software for a long time, much longer than the industrial Internet of Things became popular. More than half of our 23,000 engineers globally are developing software. More than 75% of our HOS Gold breakthrough goals are software related. While our expertise has traditionally been in software that is embedded within our products, we also have about $1 billion of highly profitable stand-alone software revenue, and that number is expected to grow significantly over the next 5 years.
The engineers are building on our strong industrial heritage to blend physical products with software. Last year, Honeywell became the first and only large Western company to announce that it is 100% compatible with capability maturity model integration at CMMI Level 5 across all global operations and in every business. This is a big deal. It means we can develop products faster and at a lower cost than many of our competitors. We also continue to make investments in our engineering base to ensure we have the best pool of talent driving the software growth at Honeywell.
Let me turn to Slide 19 and talk about high-growth regions, which represent about 40% of the world's GDP and collectively are growing north of 4%. When you compare that to the other 60% of the world, which is growing at less than 2%, it's clearly essential that we are there. And we need to be local if we're going to be successful in HGRs. We saw these trends early and made the right investments to ensure that we get on our fair share of growth.
Since 2003, we've increased our census in high-growth regions by 220%. Our presence is impressive: 140 offices, 70 manufacturing facilities and over 58,000 employees. And thanks to our investments, Honeywell's business in high-growth regions has grown at 12% CAGR. Today, HDR represents about 1/4 of our overall sales growth, and we expect that number will continue to grow.
Slide 20 conveys the attractive trends and dynamics for the markets in which we participate. Flight hours are growing, and passengers are demanding an on-the-ground experience when it comes to connectivity. Our Aerospace business is leading the way with JetWave. Turbo penetration is increasing. We have the global scale and industry-leading technology that is being adopted by automakers around the world. When it comes to the Internet of Things, we have over 11,000 engineers working on valuable software solutions that are helping our customers optimize their operations. In high-growth regions, we're addressing demand in the world's fastest-growing economies through innovative local products and solutions.
In PMT, we've invested for growth through capital expansions. It's too early to call a recovery but we are seeing signs that the bottom may have been reached in oil and gas, including month-over-month improvement in rig counts and drilled but uncompleted wells and a stabilizing oil price. We have a broad catalyst portfolio that allows us to capture a large percentage of upcoming catalysts reloads in areas where we participate. We also have leading modular gas processing technology for midstream gas applications and strong positions in refining and petrochemicals. 
We've also invested in capacity for Solstice, which is being rapidly adopted by automotive and building customers throughout the world to meet the demand for low-global-warming products as HFCs are phased out. And nearly half of Honeywell's current portfolio is dedicated to energy efficiency. 
The future's bright for Honeywell. The people and technologies we have and the investments we have made are tied to favorable trends in fast-growing industries. All this is going to drive future growth.
With that, I'll turn it back over to Dave."

Because while flight hours develop pretty consistently over time, and they tend to go up 3% or 4% a year even in a bad time, they'll go down for a single year and then pop back up again. So that trend is always relatively smooth. The aftermarket stream associated with it though bounces around in sometimes crazy directions. And if you recall the recession, for example, where flight hours were down 3% or 4%, aftermarket was down something like 20% or 30% in that same year. So the long-term trend is generally consistent with what those flight hours are. In the short term, it can bounce around quite a bit. So being able to explain the difference between, say, 3% and 1% is easily within the realm of typical variability."

I mean, you know that over the course of the year, because of the volumes as well as driving HOS, we've deployed a fair amount of restructuring to that business. And a lot of that is pretty quick turnaround kinds of paybacks. When we did the disaggregation of ACS, we also went through a significant management spans and layers, exercise. So what we tried to do was limit and reduce the number of layers that we had from the top boss to down to the lowest-level person in the organization. We've also tried to increase the span of control for each of our managers. So that also took up a bunch of the capacity that we spent in the third quarter. And I'd say thirdly, in our supply chain, we continue to have lots of opportunities whether it's continued integration of acquisitions that we've done or just addressing legacy sites. We found opportunities and still have more ahead of us to invest in restructuring attractive payback projects. So it's a combination of the reorganization that we've done as well as the continuing address -- continued addressing of our ISC, our supply chain. Then the third thing I'd say is the acquisitions that we've done to achieve the cost synergies that we talk about, you do have to apply restructuring. And again, those do deliver anywhere between 6% and 8% of cost synergies on the acquisitions. A bunch of that comes from just leveraging our sourcing agreements, but some of it is from restructuring as well. And so those are the 3 principal areas.

But this has to be a high-return project, the same sort of thing that we look at for any internal investment, because that's what it is. And that's why we pay so much attention to what platform is it and what do we really think is going to happen. So we don't just take an, say, an external look or the customer's look at what do they think it's going to be. We really go through this ourselves to say, what do we really think is possible here? And how do we make sure that this is going to generate a good return for the company? I'd say our guys do a pretty good job at this so that we pick the right platforms. And when you see the concessions that we are paying, it's been so that we could do that. So these are going to be high-return, a good -- very good IRR projects and platforms that we're on. We're pretty confident on that based on what we've done and what we see."

As we previewed during our update call 2 weeks ago, for the third quarter, we reported earnings per share of $1.60 or $1.67, excluding the $0.07 we deployed to restructuring. We expect to return to double-digit EPS growth in the fourth quarter, which yields our full year EPS growth target of 8% to 9% that we communicated on October 7. 
Q3 was a quarter of important changes in many areas to position the company for better performance next year. These include the split of the former Automation and Control Solutions segment, ACS; the acquisition of Intelligrated; the sale of our government services business, HTSI; and the spin of Resins & Chemicals. Combined with nearly $250 million in restructuring actions, these changes are lasting improvements to the portfolio that yield benefits beginning in the fourth quarter and into 2017 when we expect year-over-year benefits exceeding $175 million from the restructuring actions alone.
In the fourth quarter, we'll lap the impact of our U.S. Postal Service project and productivity solutions, the UOP return to growth and expect the continued ramp of our Solstice low-global-warming products sales. Darius and Tom will provide more details about 2017 during our annual outlook call in December, but we have a favorable setup. The fourth quarter momentum continues. Our long-cycle businesses are improving, and our inflections start to kick in. It remains a slow-growth environment, but we've continue to invest heavily in the business in capital projects, research and development, hiring salespeople, winning content on new aerospace platforms, improving our growth profile through strategic M&A and divestitures and executing on restructuring projects to improve our fixed cost position. With all the work we've done to improve the growth profile, our continued emphasis on the Honeywell Operating System and our performance culture, we are well positioned for long-term growth and are committed to creating long-term shareowner value.
On October 7, we communicated all the changes or moving parts that occurred in the quarter. In our attempt to lend transparency to all the moving parts, we lost sight of the importance of conveying our confidence in our future for the fourth quarter, 2017 and beyond. For that miscommunication, I take full responsibility. 
Last week, we released a number of charts explaining why we were confident in our future. We've included several of those charts in this morning's package because we wanted to explain a bit behind each of them. We've continued to invest heavily, seed planting, if you will, and the returns will be there. We've outperformed historically and will continue to do so. We largely discussed third quarter a couple of weeks ago, so much of today's presentation focuses on the future and why we think Honeywell is an exciting place for you to be.
So with that, I'll turn it over to Tom."

I'm now on Slide 3 with a quick recap of our third quarter results. Reported sales of $9.8 billion increased 2%, primarily reflecting the impact of acquisitions.

Reported sales of $9.8 billion increased 2%, primarily reflecting the impact of acquisitions. On a core organic basis, sales were down 3%. Our growth was led by Process Solutions, Transportation Systems and Home and Building Technologies, but was more than offset by softness in Business Jets, Defense & Space, productivity solutions and UOP. The softness in UOP has moderated throughout the year to the extent that in the fourth quarter, we expect high single-digit sales growth in that business.
The decline in segment margins in the quarter reflect the impact of OEM incentives, M&A integration costs and the lower volumes, partially offset by benefits from previously funded restructuring. Earnings per share were up 4% to $1.67, excluding the restructuring charge deployed from the retroactive portion of the stock compensation accounting change. The individual restructuring projects in the third quarter have an average payback of about 2 years and provide attractive accretion in both 2017 and 2018. 
Free cash flow in the quarter was $1.3 billion. That's 103% conversion on net income. We continue to put substantial capital to work for our shareowners. Our CapEx and reinvestment ratio was 150% this quarter, and we bought back approximately $1.9 billion worth of Honeywell shares through the end of the third quarter.
Let me move on to Slide 4 to discuss the segment performance. In aero, the sales decline is consistent with what we previewed. The negative 6% headline number reflects the softness we described in our Business Jet OEM revenues and in Defense & Space, but also, to a larger degree, the increase in OEM incentives. I'll discuss the incentives more later. But in the third quarter, year-over-year increase in OEM incentives drove 4% of the minus 6% decline in the top line growth for Aerospace. 
Excluding the impact of OEM incentives, the commercial aviation OEM business was down 8%, with the Business Jet softness being partially offset by steady growth in air transport. Our commercial aftermarket business was up 1% on a core organic basis. We're seeing continued repair and overhaul demand within air transport, but the softness in the business jet market is impacting the aftermarket. And we've seen fewer engine repair and overhaul events as a result.
Defense & Space was down 6% on a core organic basis, driven by program completions in U.S. space and international defense and lower volumes for commercial helicopters, primarily related to oil and gas. While disappointing, we are encouraged by the double-digit increase in Defense & Space year-to-date orders and backlog. Although as you can appreciate, much of this activity is longer term in nature, extending into 2017 and beyond.
Transportation Systems sales increased 3% organically in the quarter, driven by new program launches in light vehicles gas segment where we saw growth of nearly 20%. Aerospace segment margins were down, reflecting the increase in OEM incentives and lower volumes. 
In Home and Building Technologies, sales were up 5% on a core organic basis, driven by growth in both products and distribution businesses. The products business grew 1% organically, thanks to more than 15% growth in China and strength in the Americas Environmental & Energy Solutions business. The distribution business was up 8% organically in the quarter, driven by continued strength in the global distribution business and energy and services contracts within building solutions. The segment margin rate declines, excluding the impact of M&A, were primarily due to the mix of products versus distribution revenues this quarter.
In Performance Materials and Technologies, sales were down 3% on a core organic basis, driven by UOP, partially offset by strong global megaproject conversion in Process Solutions, which was up 3% organically. UOP sales were down 10% on a core organic basis, driven primarily by declines in gas processing and licensing and partially offset by higher catalyst shipments. Notably, UOP's backlog was up 15% at the quarter-end. Demand for our catalysts continue to be strong, driven by reloads as a result of increased refinery turnarounds. Advanced Materials sales were down 2% on a core organic basis as demand for our Solstice line of low-global-warming materials within Fluorine products continue to be strong, partially offsetting the significant market pricing headwinds within Resins & Chemicals. These Resins & Chemicals headwinds are obviously now behind us as a result of the AdvanSix spin.
PMT segment margin was up 80 basis points to 21.6%, driven by strong productivity and cost controls, higher catalyst shipments and the favorable impact of acquisition integrations. Finally, in Safety and Productivity Solutions, sales were down 8% on a core organic basis. The safety business was down 3%, primarily due to softness in the general personal protective equipment business and lower demand for retail products. The productivity solutions business was down 12% on a core organic basis due to a tough comparison of the third quarter of 2015 and continued channel headwinds in productivity solutions. We will not face the U.S. Postal Service headwind next quarter as we've said. Segment margin was down 90 basis points, excluding M&A, to 15.2%, primarily reflecting the lower volumes.
Slide 5 shows our path to the fourth quarter EPS of $1.74 to $1.78. It's very consistent with what we have previously articulated a couple of weeks ago. We expect UOP to grow at high single digits on a core organic basis, driving significant sequential quarter-to-quarter EPS improvement. Catalyst sales are expected to be up about 20% in the quarter, and licensing and equipment sales will be up about 15%. Additionally, in Process Solutions, we expect to see the normal fourth quarter pickup in our short-cycle products and services businesses. We continue to closely monitor the oil and gas market, but all in all, our outlook has improved.
We expect a 2% to 3% improvement from Safety and Productivity Solutions and $0.03 to $0.04 from restructuring. I spoke earlier about the rapid paybacks we expect on the restructuring we funded in the third quarter. All in, we have a funded pool of about -- of more than $400 million in restructuring projects.
All other is a $0.05 to $0.06 headwind reflecting the removal of Resins & Chemicals and the government services business from the portfolio, the normal onetime M&A costs from Intelligrated and the expected lower number of option exercises resulting in lower income tax benefits. This works to a Q4 earnings range of $1.74 to $1.78 per share as a 10% to 13% increase from the same period in 2015.
Let's turn to Slide 6 to provide some further color on our fourth quarter outlook. We expect that sales declines in Aerospace will continue into the fourth quarter, particularly in Business Jets and Defense and Space. We expect our total commercial OEM business to be down nearly 20%, with growth in Air Transport and Regional more than offset by declines in Business and General Aviation. In our aftermarket business, repair and overhaul will moderate slightly on lower events and lower aircraft utilization while growth in spares should be steady, primarily due to the new JetWave installations and channel and customer demand. 
The backlog in Defense & Space, as I said, is improving as we head into the fourth quarter but we still expect the business to be down in the mid-single-digit range on lower volumes globally. And finally, Transportation Systems, we see continued global gas turbo penetration, offset by slower diesel penetration, which will drive flat to slightly higher core organic sales in the quarter.
In HBT, we expect organic growth in the low single-digit range in both the products and distribution businesses. The reported growth is much higher, reflecting the Elster smart energy business, where we have significant rollouts in the U.K. and expected strength in the Americas gas business. On the product side, sales in Environmental & Energy Solutions business will continue to improve, driven by new product introductions in the Americas and strong double-digit growth in China and India. In the distribution segment, which consists of the global distribution business and buildings solutions, we expect strong backlog conversions, specifically in our energy business. And in EMEA and China. Our global distribution business will grow at a slower rate due to very tough comps from the fourth quarter 2015 when this business grew nearly 12%. Margin expansion will be driven mostly by productivity net of inflation, the benefits of restructuring, higher volumes and commercial excellence, offset slightly by the impact of the Elster acquisition.
In PMT, we see a return to growth in UOP, driven by continued strong orders. Orders were up 9% in the third quarter, particularly in the catalyst business. We also see some traction on the equipment side. Our orders over the past 3 months were over $700 million, and we're expecting a similar amount in the fourth quarter. Importantly, we see oil prices stabilizing in the $50 range. Generally, activity is picking up across the globe, including in China, and some projects that have been delayed or stalled are now resuming. Our year-to-date book-to-bill is 1.1 and was closer to 1.3 in the third quarter. 
And our win rates across all lines of business in UOP are strong. UOP should grow by high single digits in the fourth quarter as a result. In Process Solutions, sales will be down in the mid-single-digit range on lower megaproject sales growth, however, this should improve in 2017 as we replenish the backlog on anticipated healthy project orders in the fourth quarter. Finally, in Advanced Materials, core organic sales growth will be north of 10% driven by Solstice, which will grow considerably this quarter, and from higher volumes in specialty products across all lines of business. The significant increase in segment margin will be driven by the higher catalyst shipment content, the volume growth in Fluorine Products from Solstice and the favorable margin impact from the spinoff of AdvanSix.
In Safety and Productivity Solutions, we're finally past the headwinds associated with the U.S. Postal Service deployment. And as a result, we expect the business will be flat to slightly down in the fourth quarter, which represents a nearly 800 basis point improvement sequentially. This is also supported by slightly easier setup in industrial safety, driven by prior year oil and gas-related declines. We should see things improve overall from here, especially with the addition of Intelligrated, which we continue to be very excited about.
We've taken aggressive cost actions to address the slowdown in the third quarter. This should provide additional runway for margin expansion in the fourth quarter and into 2017. With more than $1.9 billion in share repurchases this year, our share count will be approximately 1% lower in the fourth quarter. And finally, as a result of last quarter's adoption of the stock compensation accounting standard, we now expect that our tax rate will be approximately 25% in the fourth quarter and about 24.5% for the full year.
Let's turn to Slide 7 to discuss our expected full year segment margin. On a reported basis, we expect to be down approximately 70 basis points, but this belies the significant operational improvement. We expect to deliver approximately 80 basis points. We continue to realize volume leverage in our growth segments and work with our suppliers to drive down material costs. Additionally, by deploying the Honeywell Operating System and our restructuring capacity, we continue to reduce our fixed costs throughout the enterprise, including in our plants and our administrative functions. These are permanent improvements in our cost structure that will drive significant margin expansion as growth more fully permeates the portfolio.
Offsetting this operational goodness are the upfront effects of investments we're making to improve the future. You'll recall that we are completing the first year of our 9 recent acquisitions. This first year is heavily burdened by costs for inventory accounting, amortization of intangibles, deal costs and integration costs. This will be an approximate 50 basis point headwind this year. OEM incentives are a 60 basis point headwind. I have a later slide on what these OEM incentives mean for our future growth. But given the conservative accounting we deploy in this area, we're experiencing a $0.25 EPS headwind in 2016 that will not repeat.
Finally, the foreign currency movement from 2015, principally the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, has driven approximately 40 basis points of margin rate headwind. Based on our hedging positions, we expect this to turn into a similar-sized benefit in 2017. So as you can see, we expect to end the year with segment margin at 18.1%, but are well positioned for 2017 as the favorable operational impacts from the Honeywell Operating System continue and the impact from the other factors recedes or flips around.
I'm now on Slide 8. We're reaffirming our full year EPS growth target of 8% to 9% or $6.60 to $6.64, excluding the anticipated fourth quarter pension mark-to-market adjustment of about $1.5 billion. This is based on current discount rates and asset return assumptions as of September 30 and is driven primarily by the decline in interest rates.
The sales and segment margin guidance you see here is consistent with the preview from October 7. With a lower-than-anticipated net income, principally in Aerospace, we now expect that free cash flow will be between $4.2 billion and $4.3 billion for the full year.
Slide 9 summarizes the end market dynamics that we anticipate in 2017 versus what we're experiencing this year. First, in homes and buildings, we'll continue to see steady growth, driven by new product introductions, connected offerings and the expansion of our installed base. Next, the dynamics we described for commercial aviation will continue in 2017, including declines in business jet market, steady performance in air transport driven by program ramp-ups, including on the A350 platform; and a reasonably stable aftermarket. What will change in commercial aviation is that the massive 2016 headwinds from OEM incentives will become a modest tailwind.
We expect the declines in Defense & Space will moderate a bit in 2017. While we anticipate that demand in our commercial helicopter and domestic space businesses will continue to be slow, we'll no longer have the impact from our government services businesses following the sale of HTSI. And in addition, our long-cycle backlogs are improving, as I noted earlier. More than 3/4 of our expected fourth quarter sales are firm, which is above where we were at this point heading into the third quarter.
To moderate the effects of the overall declines in Aerospace, we've made significant improvements to our cost structure while investing for growth, including in sales headcount, research and development and in new products like JetWave. We anticipate stronger performance in our businesses that serve the industrial and workers end market. We'll no longer have the U.S. Postal Service comp, and Intelligrated will contribute to growth. We also expect our safety sales will improve over the course of the year.
The vehicles market will continue to be strong with increasing global penetration of turbos and growth in light vehicle gas applications. We also expect modest improvements on the commercial vehicles side in 2017. And on a global basis, we expect turbo penetration to be approximately 40%.
Lastly, Advanced Materials will be a strong contributor, highlighted by more than 25% growth in our Solstice products. Solstice is meeting or exceeding all expectations and is expected to be about $1 billion business for us by 2020.
Let me turn to Slide 10 for a preview of 2017. We've not finalized our 2017 planning. And as Dave said, Darius and I will provide a full update in December upon the completion of the process. We expect a continued slow growth environment but also believe that the inflection we've mentioned are still intact to enable us to grow faster than the markets we serve.
With that said, we're taking a conservative approach to the planning frameworks, specifically relative to Business Jets, Defense & Space and commercial helicopters. While we're targeting double-digit EPS growth, we're not counting on a recovery in these specific end markets to achieve that. We continue to work on the things we can control, and we see the result of this in the forecasted 45 to 75 basis points improvement in the margins on low single-digit core organic sales growth.
Still, we're constantly pressed on why we feel confident in our ability to deliver in '17, so let's spend a few minutes to explain the rationale underlying our outlook. Let me move to Slide 11.
First off, we've continued to deploy large amounts of shareowner capital. We've increased our dividend 15% in each of the last 2 years. And including the $0.5 billion of value created through the spinoff of AdvanSix, that's nearly $2.4 billion of dividends alone in 2016. And we're committed to further growing the dividend faster than our rate of earnings growth. 
On share repurchase, we've been very active in 2016 and have already matched our total repurchases for all of last year. You'll recall that it takes about $1 billion of repurchases each year to keep our share count flat, and we've been doing twice that amount. 
M&A activity is significantly accelerated over the last 18 months. For the past few quarters, we've been dealing with the incremental acquisition and amortization costs from these deals. And as that begins to roll off, the contribution from this M&A will really be felt. And the M&A benefits do not even take into account the sales and commercial synergies we expect from combining sales forces, leveraging Honeywell's channels and high-growth regions and from general commercial excellence that we drive in our own businesses. Needless to say, we expect M&A will be a significant value driver in 2017 and for many years to come. 
Slide 12, we cast the deals we've completed. Each of these businesses participates in an attractive fast-growing market where they are perceived as leaders in their space. They're accretive to Honeywell's growth rates. We believe there's a big opportunity for us to expand a number of these businesses into high-growth regions given the Honeywell presence, leadership teams and infrastructure already in place. Many of these businesses also have a strong technology and software component, and that will drive superior growth and improving gross and segment margins. I also don't want to lose the point that we continue to find strong, new talent through our acquisition that makes the combined companies better and further drives our software and technology initiatives.
Let me turn to Slide 13. We've talked extensively about OEM incentives. What you need to remember is, one, they're investments that have gotten us on a number of attractive new business jet and air transport platforms that build upon our already strong installed base. Two, we expense these incentives to our P&L as they're incurred, a more conservative treatment than most of our peers. Three, there's a very clear visibility to the incentives. They're negotiated years in advance, and any accelerated recognition of the cost does not change the aggregate cost, only the timing of the recognition as you saw in the third quarter. And lastly, 2016 is our peak for these investments. They're still significant, but they begin to decline in 2017, as you can see on the chart. We're excited about the extensions to our Aerospace franchise that these investments are enabling.
You can see on Slide 14 some of the other investments that we've made to grow our business. We've talked extensively over the past few years about our capital expenditures. We have been investing in about 1.6x depreciation for the last several years. The returns on the incremental investments, like Solstice, are phenomenal, twice that of any M&A deal we could do. And while they do temporarily dilute free cash flow, the investments are essential to our growth. We're nearing completion of this investment cycle. After which, we expect the reinvestment rate to normalize between 1.0 and 1.2x depreciation. 
We'll also continue to invest in research and development at a rate that's approximately 7.5% of sales, including R&D that's customer funded. Our R&D is fueling the next generation of Honeywell products, including our software offerings. 
And to ensure we have enough feet on the street to win in our end markets, we're also investing heavily on our sales force. You may think of this as a short-term investment, but it's not. A sales person really isn't productive enough in his first year on the job, so we have to ensure we have enough sales employees in place today to support tomorrow's business. The same applies in our high-growth regions where headcount has grown nearly 14% in the last 3 years, and we have funded more than $260 million in restructuring so far this year. 
Slide 15 has more details on capital investments in Performance Materials and Technologies. These projects add capacity to our highly profitable businesses, like Solstice within Fluorine Products and catalysts within UOP. They deliver returns in the 30% to 40% range, and we expect more than $1 billion in sales in Solstice revenues per year by 2020. After that, and this is timely, we'll see additional demand generated by the Kigali amendment to the Montreal Protocol, which was just agreed to this week. In UOP, we continue to add catalyst capacity in the U.S. and abroad to support our large installed base in both refining and petrochemical segments.
On Slide 16, we profile another breakthrough technology that we're investing in, the connected aircraft. Our vision is to create a fast, seamless online experience for passengers, pilots and operations staff on the ground. To supplement our core product, we've invested in M&A in this space with EMS, Aviaso, Satcom1 and COM DEV, and those investments are beginning to pay off. With COM DEV's content on 95% of commercial satellites, we have insight into the networks and services that are going to be needed for connectivity now and in the future. EMS and Satcom1 provide us with antenna, modem and router technology, which is helping us to optimize the way data travels through the aerospace ecosystem, providing our customers with incremental value versus the competition. Lastly, Aviaso provides the software and data analytics necessary to serve airlines, and we have recent wins with Etihad Airways, Finnair and Lufthansa Cargo to support this. With all these capabilities, we're now able to supply an aircraft with a big data pipe, JetWave, that is 1,000 times faster and costs 20x less per mega weight than the previous systems. No one has the solution that we do with JetWave. Combined with our legacy expertise around avionics, mechanical equipment and services, we're positioned to win in the emerging $7 billion connected aircraft space. As you heard Tim say, we anticipated the connected aircraft business will be larger than $1 billion for us by 2020.
Let's turn to Slide 17 to talk about another great position in a good industry, turbochargers. As you see -- as you heard us say before, we're in the golden age of turbos. Turbocharger adoption continues to be driven by regulations around fuel economy and emissions. To comply, automakers are downsizing engines. But to preserve engine performance, they look to our technology to -- which provides 30% more torque, 25% greater fuel efficiency and 20% lower carbon dioxide emissions. In the graph on the right, you can see that these factors are driving incredible growth and penetration. Today, more than 1/3 of all vehicles have a turbocharger. And by 2020, we anticipate roughly half of all vehicles will have one on board. And every year, when we look at our data, our long-term forecast for turbo penetration improves. This is a fantastic growth story for us, both in the short term and long term, particularly as adoption of our light vehicle gas applications continues to ramp up. We continue to win more than 40% on the OEM platform competitions globally.
Slide 18 highlights another aspect of why we're so well positioned for the future, our software capability. We've been developing software for a long time, much longer than the industrial Internet of Things became popular. More than half of our 23,000 engineers globally are developing software. More than 75% of our HOS Gold breakthrough goals are software related. While our expertise has traditionally been in software that is embedded within our products, we also have about $1 billion of highly profitable stand-alone software revenue, and that number is expected to grow significantly over the next 5 years.
The engineers are building on our strong industrial heritage to blend physical products with software. Last year, Honeywell became the first and only large Western company to announce that it is 100% compatible with capability maturity model integration at CMMI Level 5 across all global operations and in every business. This is a big deal. It means we can develop products faster and at a lower cost than many of our competitors. We also continue to make investments in our engineering base to ensure we have the best pool of talent driving the software growth at Honeywell.
Let me turn to Slide 19 and talk about high-growth regions, which represent about 40% of the world's GDP and collectively are growing north of 4%. When you compare that to the other 60% of the world, which is growing at less than 2%, it's clearly essential that we are there. And we need to be local if we're going to be successful in HGRs. We saw these trends early and made the right investments to ensure that we get on our fair share of growth.
Since 2003, we've increased our census in high-growth regions by 220%. Our presence is impressive: 140 offices, 70 manufacturing facilities and over 58,000 employees. And thanks to our investments, Honeywell's business in high-growth regions has grown at a 12% CAGR. Today, HGRs represent about 1/4 of our overall sales growth, and we expect that number will continue to grow.
Slide 20 conveys the attractive trends and dynamics for the markets in which we participate. Flight hours are growing, and passengers are demanding an on-the-ground experience when it comes to connectivity. Our Aerospace business is leading the way with JetWave. Turbo penetration is increasing. We have the global scale and industry-leading technology that is being adopted by automakers around the world. When it comes to the Internet of Things, we have over 11,000 engineers working on valuable software solutions that are helping our customers optimize their operations. In high-growth regions, we're addressing demand in the world's fastest-growing economies through innovative local products and solutions.
In PMT, we've invested for growth through capital expansions. It's too early to call a recovery but we are seeing signs that the bottom may have been reached in oil and gas, including month-over-month improvement in rig counts and drilled but uncompleted wells and a stabilizing oil price. We have a broad catalyst portfolio that allows us to capture a large percentage of upcoming catalysts reloads in areas where we participate. We also have leading modular gas processing technology for midstream gas applications and strong positions in refining and petrochemicals. 
We've also invested in capacity for Solstice, which is being rapidly adopted by automotive and building customers throughout the world to meet the demand for low-global-warming products as HFCs are phased out. And nearly half of Honeywell's current portfolio is dedicated to energy efficiency. 
The future's bright for Honeywell. The people and technologies we have and the investments we have made are tied to favorable trends in fast-growing industries. All this is going to drive future growth.
With that, I'll turn it back over to Dave."

It's obviously collaborative. Darius is involved. Tom is. We discuss it with the board. It's not a surprise to anyone when -- well, except maybe externally, when we do announce it because we want to be thoughtful in what we do. And the way we've always tried to run the company, not just on buyback, but any decision, is that we want all the input, all the opinions, conflicting, agreeing, whatever they are, so that at the end of the day, we make the best decisions. I've always felt like we get measured on the quality of our decisions, not on whether somebody was right or wrong from the beginning. And that's how we handle the buyback decisions also."

So that trend is always relatively smooth. The aftermarket stream associated with it though bounces around in sometimes crazy directions.

I mean, you know that over the course of the year, because of the volumes, as well as driving HOS, we've deployed a fair amount of restructuring to that business. And a lot of that is pretty quick turnaround kinds of paybacks. When we did the disaggregation of ACS, we also went through a significant management spans and layers exercise. So what we tried to do was limit and reduce the number of layers that we have from the top boss to down to the lowest-level person in the organization. We've also tried to increase the span of control for each of our managers. So that also took up a bunch of the capacity that we spent in the third quarter. And I'd say thirdly, in our supply chain, we continue to have lots of opportunities whether it's continued integration of acquisitions that we've done or just addressing legacy sites. We found opportunities and still have more ahead of us to invest in restructuring and attractive payback projects. So it's a combination of the reorganizations that we've done as well as the continuing address -- continual addressing of our ISC, our supply chain. Then the third thing I'd say is the acquisitions that we've done to achieve the cost synergies that we talk about, you do have to apply restructuring. And again, those do deliver anywhere between 6% and 8% of cost synergies on the acquisitions. A bunch of that comes from just leveraging our sourcing agreements, but some of it is from restructuring as well. And so those are the 3 principal areas. And as a result, you're seeing that 2017 tailwind from the pool of funded projects that we have, as I said."

These include the split of the former Automation and Control Solutions segment, ACS; the acquisition of Intelligrated; the sale of our government services business, HTSI; and the spin of Resins & Chemicals. Combined with nearly $250 million in restructuring actions, these changes are lasting improvements to the portfolio that yield benefits beginning in the fourth quarter and into 2017 when we expect year-over-year benefits exceeding $175 million from the restructuring actions alone.
In the fourth quarter, we'll lap the impact of our U.S. Postal Service project and productivity solutions, the UOP return to growth and expect the continued ramp of our Solstice low-global-warming products sales. Darius and Tom will provide more details about 2017 during our annual outlook call in December, but we have a favorable setup. The fourth quarter momentum continues. Our long-cycle businesses are improving, and our inflections start to kick in. It remains a slow-growth environment, but we've continue to invest heavily in the business in capital projects, research and development, hiring salespeople, winning content on new aerospace platforms, improving our growth profile through strategic M&A and divestitures and executing on restructuring projects to improve our fixed cost position. With all the work we've done to improve the growth profile, our continued emphasis on the Honeywell Operating System and our performance culture, we are well positioned for long-term growth and are committed to creating long-term shareowner value.
On October 7, we communicated all the changes or moving parts that occurred in the quarter. In our attempt to lend transparency to all the moving parts, we lost sight of the importance of conveying our confidence in our future for the fourth quarter, 2017 and beyond. For that miscommunication, I take full responsibility. 
Last week, we released a number of charts explaining why we were confident in our future. We've included several of those charts in this morning's package because we wanted to explain a bit behind each of them. We've continued to invest heavily, seed planting, if you will, and the returns will be there. We've outperformed historically and will continue to do so. We largely discussed third quarter a couple of weeks ago, so much of today's presentation focuses on the future and why we think Honeywell is an exciting place for you to be.
So with that, I'll turn it over to Tom."

I'm now on Slide 3 with a quick recap of our third quarter results. Reported sales of $9.8 billion increased 2%, primarily reflecting the impact of acquisitions.

Reported sales of $9.8 billion increased 2%, primarily reflecting the impact of acquisitions. On a core organic basis, sales were down 3%. Our growth was led by Process Solutions, Transportation Systems and Home and Building Technologies, but was more than offset by softness in Business Jets, Defense & Space, productivity solutions and UOP. The softness in UOP has moderated throughout the year to the extent that in the fourth quarter, we expect high single-digit sales growth in that business.
The decline in segment margins in the quarter reflect the impact of OEM incentives, M&A integration costs and the lower volumes, partially offset by benefits from previously funded restructuring. Earnings per share were up 4% to $1.67, excluding the restructuring charge deployed from the retroactive portion of the stock compensation accounting change. The individual restructuring projects in the third quarter have an average payback of about 2 years and provide attractive accretion in both 2017 and 2018. 
Free cash flow in the quarter was $1.3 billion. That's 103% conversion on net income. We continue to put substantial capital to work for our shareowners. Our CapEx and reinvestment ratio was 150% this quarter, and we bought back approximately $1.9 billion worth of Honeywell shares through the end of the third quarter.
Let me move on to Slide 4 to discuss the segment performance. In aero, the sales decline is consistent with what we previewed. The negative 6% headline number reflects the softness we described in our Business Jet OEM revenues and in Defense & Space, but also, to a larger degree, the increase in OEM incentives. I'll discuss the incentives more later. But in the third quarter, year-over-year increase in OEM incentives drove 4% of the minus 6% decline in the top line growth for Aerospace. 
Excluding the impact of OEM incentives, the commercial aviation OEM business was down 8%, with the Business Jet softness being partially offset by steady growth in air transport. Our commercial aftermarket business was up 1% on a core organic basis. We're seeing continued repair and overhaul demand within air transport, but the softness in the business jet market is impacting the aftermarket. And we've seen fewer engine repair and overhaul events as a result.
Defense & Space was down 6% on a core organic basis, driven by program completions in U.S. space and international defense and lower volumes for commercial helicopters, primarily related to oil and gas. While disappointing, we are encouraged by the double-digit increase in Defense & Space year-to-date orders and backlog. Although as you can appreciate, much of this activity is longer term in nature, extending into 2017 and beyond.
Transportation Systems sales increased 3% organically in the quarter, driven by new program launches in light vehicles gas segment where we saw growth of nearly 20%. Aerospace segment margins were down, reflecting the increase in OEM incentives and lower volumes. 
In Home and Building Technologies, sales were up 5% on a core organic basis, driven by growth in both products and distribution businesses. The products business grew 1% organically, thanks to more than 15% growth in China and strength in the Americas Environmental & Energy Solutions business. The distribution business was up 8% organically in the quarter, driven by continued strength in the global distribution business and energy and services contracts within building solutions. The segment margin rate declines, excluding the impact of M&A, were primarily due to the mix of products versus distribution revenues this quarter.
In Performance Materials and Technologies, sales were down 3% on a core organic basis, driven by UOP, partially offset by strong global megaproject conversion in Process Solutions, which was up 3% organically. UOP sales were down 10% on a core organic basis, driven primarily by declines in gas processing and licensing and partially offset by higher catalyst shipments. Notably, UOP's backlog was up 15% at the quarter-end. Demand for our catalysts continue to be strong, driven by reloads as a result of increased refinery turnarounds. Advanced Materials sales were down 2% on a core organic basis as demand for our Solstice line of low-global-warming materials within Fluorine products continue to be strong, partially offsetting the significant market pricing headwinds within Resins & Chemicals. These Resins & Chemicals headwinds are obviously now behind us as a result of the AdvanSix spin.
PMT segment margin was up 80 basis points to 21.6%, driven by strong productivity and cost controls, higher catalyst shipments and the favorable impact of acquisition integrations. Finally, in Safety and Productivity Solutions, sales were down 8% on a core organic basis. The safety business was down 3%, primarily due to softness in the general personal protective equipment business and lower demand for retail products. The productivity solutions business was down 12% on a core organic basis due to a tough comparison of the third quarter of 2015 and continued channel headwinds in productivity solutions. We will not face the U.S. Postal Service headwind next quarter as we've said. Segment margin was down 90 basis points, excluding M&A, to 15.2%, primarily reflecting the lower volumes.
Slide 5 shows our path to the fourth quarter EPS of $1.74 to $1.78. It's very consistent with what we have previously articulated a couple of weeks ago. We expect UOP to grow at high single digits on a core organic basis, driving significant sequential quarter-to-quarter EPS improvement. Catalyst sales are expected to be up about 20% in the quarter, and licensing and equipment sales will be up about 15%. Additionally, in Process Solutions, we expect to see the normal fourth quarter pickup in our short-cycle products and services businesses. We continue to closely monitor the oil and gas market, but all in all, our outlook has improved.
We expect a 2% to 3% improvement from Safety and Productivity Solutions and $0.03 to $0.04 from restructuring. I spoke earlier about the rapid paybacks we expect on the restructuring we funded in the third quarter. All in, we have a funded pool of about -- of more than $400 million in restructuring projects.
All other is a $0.05 to $0.06 headwind reflecting the removal of Resins & Chemicals and the government services business from the portfolio, the normal onetime M&A costs from Intelligrated and the expected lower number of option exercises resulting in lower income tax benefits. This works to a Q4 earnings range of $1.74 to $1.78 per share as a 10% to 13% increase from the same period in 2015.
Let's turn to Slide 6 to provide some further color on our fourth quarter outlook. We expect that sales declines in Aerospace will continue into the fourth quarter, particularly in Business Jets and Defense and Space. We expect our total commercial OEM business to be down nearly 20%, with growth in Air Transport and Regional more than offset by declines in Business and General Aviation. In our aftermarket business, repair and overhaul will moderate slightly on lower events and lower aircraft utilization while growth in spares should be steady, primarily due to the new JetWave installations and channel and customer demand. 
The backlog in Defense & Space, as I said, is improving as we head into the fourth quarter but we still expect the business to be down in the mid-single-digit range on lower volumes globally. And finally, Transportation Systems, we see continued global gas turbo penetration, offset by slower diesel penetration, which will drive flat to slightly higher core organic sales in the quarter.
In HBT, we expect organic growth in the low single-digit range in both the products and distribution businesses. The reported growth is much higher, reflecting the Elster smart energy business, where we have significant rollouts in the U.K. and expected strength in the Americas gas business. On the product side, sales in Environmental & Energy Solutions business will continue to improve, driven by new product introductions in the Americas and strong double-digit growth in China and India. In the distribution segment, which consists of the global distribution business and buildings solutions, we expect strong backlog conversions, specifically in our energy business. And in EMEA and China. Our global distribution business will grow at a slower rate due to very tough comps from the fourth quarter 2015 when this business grew nearly 12%. Margin expansion will be driven mostly by productivity net of inflation, the benefits of restructuring, higher volumes and commercial excellence, offset slightly by the impact of the Elster acquisition.
In PMT, we see a return to growth in UOP, driven by continued strong orders. Orders were up 9% in the third quarter, particularly in the catalyst business. We also see some traction on the equipment side. Our orders over the past 3 months were over $700 million, and we're expecting a similar amount in the fourth quarter. Importantly, we see oil prices stabilizing in the $50 range. Generally, activity is picking up across the globe, including in China, and some projects that have been delayed or stalled are now resuming. Our year-to-date book-to-bill is 1.1 and was closer to 1.3 in the third quarter. 
And our win rates across all lines of business in UOP are strong. UOP should grow by high single digits in the fourth quarter as a result. In Process Solutions, sales will be down in the mid-single-digit range on lower megaproject sales growth, however, this should improve in 2017 as we replenish the backlog on anticipated healthy project orders in the fourth quarter. Finally, in Advanced Materials, core organic sales growth will be north of 10% driven by Solstice, which will grow considerably this quarter, and from higher volumes in specialty products across all lines of business. The significant increase in segment margin will be driven by the higher catalyst shipment content, the volume growth in Fluorine Products from Solstice and the favorable margin impact from the spinoff of AdvanSix.
In Safety and Productivity Solutions, we're finally past the headwinds associated with the U.S. Postal Service deployment. And as a result, we expect the business will be flat to slightly down in the fourth quarter, which represents a nearly 800 basis point improvement sequentially. This is also supported by slightly easier setup in industrial safety, driven by prior year oil and gas-related declines. We should see things improve overall from here, especially with the addition of Intelligrated, which we continue to be very excited about.
We've taken aggressive cost actions to address the slowdown in the third quarter. This should provide additional runway for margin expansion in the fourth quarter and into 2017. With more than $1.9 billion in share repurchases this year, our share count will be approximately 1% lower in the fourth quarter. And finally, as a result of last quarter's adoption of the stock compensation accounting standard, we now expect that our tax rate will be approximately 25% in the fourth quarter and about 24.5% for the full year.
Let's turn to Slide 7 to discuss our expected full year segment margin. On a reported basis, we expect to be down approximately 70 basis points, but this belies the significant operational improvement. We expect to deliver approximately 80 basis points. We continue to realize volume leverage in our growth segments and work with our suppliers to drive down material costs. Additionally, by deploying the Honeywell Operating System and our restructuring capacity, we continue to reduce our fixed costs throughout the enterprise, including in our plants and our administrative functions. These are permanent improvements in our cost structure that will drive significant margin expansion as growth more fully permeates the portfolio.
Offsetting this operational goodness are the upfront effects of investments we're making to improve the future. You'll recall that we are completing the first year of our 9 recent acquisitions. This first year is heavily burdened by costs for inventory accounting, amortization of intangibles, deal costs and integration costs. This will be an approximate 50 basis point headwind this year. OEM incentives are a 60 basis point headwind. I have a later slide on what these OEM incentives mean for our future growth. But given the conservative accounting we deploy in this area, we're experiencing a $0.25 EPS headwind in 2016 that will not repeat.
Finally, the foreign currency movement from 2015, principally the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, has driven approximately 40 basis points of margin rate headwind. Based on our hedging positions, we expect this to turn into a similar-sized benefit in 2017. So as you can see, we expect to end the year with segment margin at 18.1%, but are well positioned for 2017 as the favorable operational impacts from the Honeywell Operating System continue and the impact from the other factors recedes or flips around.
I'm now on Slide 8. We're reaffirming our full year EPS growth target of 8% to 9% or $6.60 to $6.64, excluding the anticipated fourth quarter pension mark-to-market adjustment of about $1.5 billion. This is based on current discount rates and asset return assumptions as of September 30 and is driven primarily by the decline in interest rates.
The sales and segment margin guidance you see here is consistent with the preview from October 7. With a lower-than-anticipated net income, principally in Aerospace, we now expect that free cash flow will be between $4.2 billion and $4.3 billion for the full year.
Slide 9 summarizes the end market dynamics that we anticipate in 2017 versus what we're experiencing this year. First, in homes and buildings, we'll continue to see steady growth, driven by new product introductions, connected offerings and the expansion of our installed base. Next, the dynamics we described for commercial aviation will continue in 2017, including declines in business jet market, steady performance in air transport driven by program ramp-ups, including on the A350 platform; and a reasonably stable aftermarket. What will change in commercial aviation is that the massive 2016 headwinds from OEM incentives will become a modest tailwind.
We expect the declines in Defense & Space will moderate a bit in 2017. While we anticipate that demand in our commercial helicopter and domestic space businesses will continue to be slow, we'll no longer have the impact from our government services businesses following the sale of HTSI. And in addition, our long-cycle backlogs are improving, as I noted earlier. More than 3/4 of our expected fourth quarter sales are firm, which is above where we were at this point heading into the third quarter.
To moderate the effects of the overall declines in Aerospace, we've made significant improvements to our cost structure while investing for growth, including in sales headcount, research and development and in new products like JetWave. We anticipate stronger performance in our businesses that serve the industrial and workers end market. We'll no longer have the U.S. Postal Service comp, and Intelligrated will contribute to growth. We also expect our safety sales will improve over the course of the year.
The vehicles market will continue to be strong with increasing global penetration of turbos and growth in light vehicle gas applications. We also expect modest improvements on the commercial vehicles side in 2017. And on a global basis, we expect turbo penetration to be approximately 40%.
Lastly, Advanced Materials will be a strong contributor, highlighted by more than 25% growth in our Solstice products. Solstice is meeting or exceeding all expectations and is expected to be about $1 billion business for us by 2020.
Let me turn to Slide 10 for a preview of 2017. We've not finalized our 2017 planning. And as Dave said, Darius and I will provide a full update in December upon the completion of the process. We expect a continued slow growth environment but also believe that the inflection we've mentioned are still intact to enable us to grow faster than the markets we serve.
With that said, we're taking a conservative approach to the planning frameworks, specifically relative to Business Jets, Defense & Space and commercial helicopters. While we're targeting double-digit EPS growth, we're not counting on a recovery in these specific end markets to achieve that. We continue to work on the things we can control, and we see the result of this in the forecasted 45 to 75 basis points improvement in the margins on low single-digit core organic sales growth.
Still, we're constantly pressed on why we feel confident in our ability to deliver in '17, so let's spend a few minutes to explain the rationale underlying our outlook. Let me move to Slide 11.
First off, we've continued to deploy large amounts of shareowner capital. We've increased our dividend 15% in each of the last 2 years. And including the $0.5 billion of value created through the spinoff of AdvanSix, that's nearly $2.4 billion of dividends alone in 2016. And we're committed to further growing the dividend faster than our rate of earnings growth. 
On share repurchase, we've been very active in 2016 and have already matched our total repurchases for all of last year. You'll recall that it takes about $1 billion of repurchases each year to keep our share count flat, and we've been doing twice that amount. 
M&A activity is significantly accelerated over the last 18 months. For the past few quarters, we've been dealing with the incremental acquisition and amortization costs from these deals. And as that begins to roll off, the contribution from this M&A will really be felt. And the M&A benefits do not even take into account the sales and commercial synergies we expect from combining sales forces, leveraging Honeywell's channels and high-growth regions and from general commercial excellence that we drive in our own businesses. Needless to say, we expect M&A will be a significant value driver in 2017 and for many years to come. 
Slide 12, we cast the deals we've completed. Each of these businesses participates in an attractive fast-growing market where they are perceived as leaders in their space. They're accretive to Honeywell's growth rates. We believe there's a big opportunity for us to expand a number of these businesses into high-growth regions given the Honeywell presence, leadership teams and infrastructure already in place. Many of these businesses also have a strong technology and software component, and that will drive superior growth and improving gross and segment margins. I also don't want to lose the point that we continue to find strong, new talent through our acquisition that makes the combined companies better and further drives our software and technology initiatives.
Let me turn to Slide 13. We've talked extensively about OEM incentives. What you need to remember is, one, they're investments that have gotten us on a number of attractive new business jet and air transport platforms that build upon our already strong installed base. Two, we expense these incentives to our P&L as they're incurred, a more conservative treatment than most of our peers. Three, there's a very clear visibility to the incentives. They're negotiated years in advance, and any accelerated recognition of the cost does not change the aggregate cost, only the timing of the recognition as you saw in the third quarter. And lastly, 2016 is our peak for these investments. They're still significant, but they begin to decline in 2017, as you can see on the chart. We're excited about the extensions to our Aerospace franchise that these investments are enabling.
You can see on Slide 14 some of the other investments that we've made to grow our business. We've talked extensively over the past few years about our capital expenditures. We have been investing in about 1.6x depreciation for the last several years. The returns on the incremental investments, like Solstice, are phenomenal, twice that of any M&A deal we could do. And while they do temporarily dilute free cash flow, the investments are essential to our growth. We're nearing completion of this investment cycle. After which, we expect the reinvestment rate to normalize between 1.0 and 1.2x depreciation. 
We'll also continue to invest in research and development at a rate that's approximately 7.5% of sales, including R&D that's customer funded. Our R&D is fueling the next generation of Honeywell products, including our software offerings. 
And to ensure we have enough feet on the street to win in our end markets, we're also investing heavily on our sales force. You may think of this as a short-term investment, but it's not. A sales person really isn't productive enough in his first year on the job, so we have to ensure we have enough sales employees in place today to support tomorrow's business. The same applies in our high-growth regions where headcount has grown nearly 14% in the last 3 years, and we have funded more than $260 million in restructuring so far this year. 
Slide 15 has more details on capital investments in Performance Materials and Technologies. These projects add capacity to our highly profitable businesses, like Solstice within Fluorine Products and catalysts within UOP. They deliver returns in the 30% to 40% range, and we expect more than $1 billion in sales in Solstice revenues per year by 2020. After that, and this is timely, we'll see additional demand generated by the Kigali amendment to the Montreal Protocol, which was just agreed to this week. In UOP, we continue to add catalyst capacity in the U.S. and abroad to support our large installed base in both refining and petrochemical segments.
On Slide 16, we profile another breakthrough technology that we're investing in, the connected aircraft. Our vision is to create a fast, seamless online experience for passengers, pilots and operations staff on the ground. To supplement our core product, we've invested in M&A in this space with EMS, Aviaso, Satcom1 and COM DEV, and those investments are beginning to pay off. With COM DEV's content on 95% of commercial satellites, we have insight into the networks and services that are going to be needed for connectivity now and in the future. EMS and Satcom1 provide us with antenna, modem and router technology, which is helping us to optimize the way data travels through the aerospace ecosystem, providing our customers with incremental value versus the competition. Lastly, Aviaso provides the software and data analytics necessary to serve airlines, and we have recent wins with Etihad Airways, Finnair and Lufthansa Cargo to support this. With all these capabilities, we're now able to supply an aircraft with a big data pipe, JetWave, that is 1,000 times faster and costs 20x less per mega weight than the previous systems. No one has the solution that we do with JetWave. Combined with our legacy expertise around avionics, mechanical equipment and services, we're positioned to win in the emerging $7 billion connected aircraft space. As you heard Tim say, we anticipated the connected aircraft business will be larger than $1 billion for us by 2020.
Let's turn to Slide 17 to talk about another great position in a good industry, turbochargers. As you see -- as you heard us say before, we're in the golden age of turbos. Turbocharger adoption continues to be driven by regulations around fuel economy and emissions. To comply, automakers are downsizing engines. But to preserve engine performance, they look to our technology to -- which provides 30% more torque, 25% greater fuel efficiency and 20% lower carbon dioxide emissions. In the graph on the right, you can see that these factors are driving incredible growth and penetration. Today, more than 1/3 of all vehicles have a turbocharger. And by 2020, we anticipate roughly half of all vehicles will have one on board. And every year, when we look at our data, our long-term forecast for turbo penetration improves. This is a fantastic growth story for us, both in the short term and long term, particularly as adoption of our light vehicle gas applications continues to ramp up. We continue to win more than 40% on the OEM platform competitions globally.
Slide 18 highlights another aspect of why we're so well positioned for the future, our software capability. We've been developing software for a long time, much longer than the industrial Internet of Things became popular. More than half of our 23,000 engineers globally are developing software. More than 75% of our HOS Gold breakthrough goals are software related. While our expertise has traditionally been in software that is embedded within our products, we also have about $1 billion of highly profitable stand-alone software revenue, and that number is expected to grow significantly over the next 5 years.
The engineers are building on our strong industrial heritage to blend physical products with software. Last year, Honeywell became the first and only large Western company to announce that it is 100% compatible with capability maturity model integration at CMMI Level 5 across all global operations and in every business. This is a big deal. It means we can develop products faster and at a lower cost than many of our competitors. We also continue to make investments in our engineering base to ensure we have the best pool of talent driving the software growth at Honeywell.
Let me turn to Slide 19 and talk about high-growth regions, which represent about 40% of the world's GDP and collectively are growing north of 4%. When you compare that to the other 60% of the world, which is growing at less than 2%, it's clearly essential that we are there. And we need to be local if we're going to be successful in HGRs. We saw these trends early and made the right investments to ensure that we get on our fair share of growth.
Since 2003, we've increased our census in high-growth regions by 220%. Our presence is impressive: 140 offices, 70 manufacturing facilities and over 58,000 employees. And thanks to our investments, Honeywell's business in high-growth regions has grown at a 12% CAGR. Today, HGRs represent about 1/4 of our overall sales growth, and we expect that number will continue to grow.
Slide 20 conveys the attractive trends and dynamics for the markets in which we participate. Flight hours are growing, and passengers are demanding an on-the-ground experience when it comes to connectivity. Our Aerospace business is leading the way with JetWave. Turbo penetration is increasing. We have the global scale and industry-leading technology that is being adopted by automakers around the world. When it comes to the Internet of Things, we have over 11,000 engineers working on valuable software solutions that are helping our customers optimize their operations. In high-growth regions, we're addressing demand in the world's fastest-growing economies through innovative local products and solutions.
In PMT, we've invested for growth through capital expansions. It's too early to call a recovery but we are seeing signs that the bottom may have been reached in oil and gas, including month-over-month improvement in rig counts and drilled but uncompleted wells and a stabilizing oil price. We have a broad catalyst portfolio that allows us to capture a large percentage of upcoming catalysts reloads in areas where we participate. We also have leading modular gas processing technology for midstream gas applications and strong positions in refining and petrochemicals. 
We've also invested in capacity for Solstice, which is being rapidly adopted by automotive and building customers throughout the world to meet the demand for low-global-warming products as HFCs are phased out. And nearly half of Honeywell's current portfolio is dedicated to energy efficiency. 
The future's bright for Honeywell. The people and technologies we have and the investments we have made are tied to favorable trends in fast-growing industries. All this is going to drive future growth.
With that, I'll turn it back over to Dave."

Because while flight hours develop pretty consistently over time, and they tend to go up 3% or 4% a year even in a bad time, they'll go down for a single year and then pop back up again. So that trend is always relatively smooth. The aftermarket stream associated with it though bounces around in sometimes crazy directions. And if you recall the recession, for example, where flight hours were down 3% or 4%, aftermarket was down something like 20% or 30% in that same year.

I mean, you know that over the course of the year, because of the volumes, as well as driving HOS, we've deployed a fair amount of restructuring to that business. And a lot of that is pretty quick turnaround kinds of paybacks. When we did the disaggregation of ACS, we also went through a significant management spans and layers exercise. So what we tried to do was limit and reduce the number of layers that we have from the top boss to down to the lowest-level person in the organization. We've also tried to increase the span of control for each of our managers. So that also took up a bunch of the capacity that we spent in the third quarter. And I'd say thirdly, in our supply chain, we continue to have lots of opportunities whether it's continued integration of acquisitions that we've done or just addressing legacy sites. We found opportunities and still have more ahead of us to invest in restructuring and attractive payback projects. So it's a combination of the reorganizations that we've done as well as the continuing address -- continual addressing of our ISC, our supply chain. Then the third thing I'd say is the acquisitions that we've done to achieve the cost synergies that we talk about, you do have to apply restructuring. And again, those do deliver anywhere between 6% and 8% of cost synergies on the acquisitions. A bunch of that comes from just leveraging our sourcing agreements, but some of it is from restructuring as well. And so those are the 3 principal areas. And as a result, you're seeing that 2017 tailwind from the pool of funded projects that we have, as I said."

So we're going to want to make sure that as we pull together a plan for 2017, that it's one that never ends up with the kind of sales surprise that we ended up taking this year."

Maybe my one follow-up is really just on the M&A that you've done. Tom, I think you'd mentioned on the prior call that the growth was running at about high single digits, and I think the accretion was kind of coming in towards the higher end of your range. I'm just wondering how much of the deal-related costs, the inventory step-up, how much of those costs go away next year? And then where -- are we still running at the same kind of growth in EPS rates for this year?"

Well, first if you look at the -- I mean, the deals that we've integrated this year, and most of them were closed in the fourth quarter or the first quarter. And yes, you had a lot of start-up costs in particularly the first 3 quarters of this year. Intelligrated, which we closed in late August, will add to those onetime start-ups. But net-net, when you consider amortization and inventory accounting and the other things, the year-over-year impact will be favorable on those deals. But the more important thing is that the operations and the cost synergies that we get typically start to ramp in this -- second half of the first year into the second year, and that's where you start to see the margin rate improvement. So we'll go through with the details in December, but this should be a nice contributor to what we had for 2017."

It's the sort of thing that shows up in the future. I won't -- difficult to quantify at this point what that's worth to us, say, next year and the year after. But it's another investment that -- where we take the expense upfront because, of course, you got to pay them while the sales numbers they deliver aren't quite enough to pay for themselves in those first years. So this is a good thing for us to be doing, a good way for us to expand our high-growth region presence, but it's the sort of thing that's another investment for the future for us.
