Thank you, Vic, and good morning, everyone, joining us on the call and webcast. This morning, we issued our earnings release for the fourth quarter of 2015. The release is consistent with the preview of the fourth quarter we issued earlier this",690,"All right. Thank you, Vic, and good morning, everyone, joining us on the call and webcast. This morning, we issued our earnings release for the fourth quarter of 2015. The release is consistent with the preview of the fourth quarter we issued earlier this month. Now I'll make a few comments on the quarter and our strategy, and then I'll turn the call over to Bill and Sam to provide more detail on the quarter, health reform and 2016 expectations. 
We were extremely pleased with the result of the fourth quarter. Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter totaled $2.131 billion and for the year, $7.915 billion. It was a record quarter, a record earnings quarter for HCA, and also a record earnings year. The fourth quarter performance was a result of solid volume growth, improved payer mix and service mix and effective cost management.
We believe the company is well-positioned for continued success. There are 3 aspects of the company that contribute to our consistency of growth and financial performance. Our growth strategy, our investments in developing health systems in large fast-growing urban markets has been delivering strong top line growth. To illustrate the consistency and effectiveness of our growth strategy, we have reported same facility admissions and adjusted admissions growth for 8 consecutive years, ER visit growth for 9 consecutive years and surgical growth for 7 consecutive quarters. We believe our strategies are well resourced, and we expect to see another year of volume growth in 2016.
The consistent execution of our growth strategy, consistent growth in adjusted EBITDA, which has grown from $5.9 billion in 2010 to $7.9 billion in 2015 has resulted in strong cash flows. Since our IPO in early 2011, we have maintained a well balanced, shareholder friendly approach to capital allocation. For example, since the IPO in 2011 through the fourth quarter of 2015, we have generated $20.1 billion of cash flows from operating activities. Over the same period, we invested $9.7 billion in our markets through capital expenditures or about 4% of cash generated. And we returned cash to shareholders, either in special dividends or by share repurchase, in the amount of $9.3 billion or about 46% of cash generated. The company had approximately $2.6 billion remaining under its $3 billion share repurchase authorization at year end.
We generated $4.73 billion of cash flows from operating activities in 2015, up 6.4% over 2014. We continued to have a balanced approach to capital allocation in 2015, deploying approximately $2.4 billion in capital spending and approximately $2.4 billion in share repurchases. In 2015, we repurchased approximately 32 million shares of our stock. 
Now in addition to our financial performance, I was pleased with our progress with respect to our clinical agenda. In 2015, 106 or 78% of our eligible hospitals were recognized as top performers by the Joint Commission compared to the approximately 31% of hospitals nationwide. The Joint Commission's top performance highest recognition for achieving excellence in evidence-based care processes for certain medical conditions. 
In 2016, we will continue to leverage clinical technology especially in concepts with big data, data analytics and clinical informatics to deliver safe, top-quality and compassionate care for our patients. We will also continue our focus on problematic development of service lines directed at expanding our clinical depth and capabilities. We will remain committed to continuous improvement in the quality of care and service as we strategically position the company to deliver value for all of our stakeholders. 
I'll close my comments with my thoughts on our 2016 guidance that is included in our release this morning. With respect to adjusted EBITDA growth, our guidance yields a 3% growth rate at the low point of the range and just under 7% at the high end. Our guidance reflects continued solid volume growth, reasonable pricing and well-managed expense growth, with little less contribution from the [indiscernible] the past 2 years. We transition into 2016 with momentum, and we believe the company is well positioned to achieve these goals for 2016. 
Now let me turn the call over to Bill to provide additional detail on the quarter, health reform and 2016 guidance."
261825,322783529,922341,"HCA Holdings, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 28, 2016",2016-01-28,"Earnings Calls","HCA Healthcare, Inc.","Executives","Great. Thank you, Milton, and good morning, everyone. I will cover some additional information relating to the fourth quarter results and review our 2016 guidance. Then I'll turn over the call to Sam for an update on our operations. As Milton commented,",1473,"Great. Thank you, Milton, and good morning, everyone. I will cover some additional information relating to the fourth quarter results and review our 2016 guidance. Then I'll turn over the call to Sam for an update on our operations. 
As Milton commented, we were extremely pleased with the quarter's results and the quarter finished a very strong 2015 for the company. Both quarter was coupled with a good payer mix and service mix and solid expense management, which combined to drive the quarter and the year's strong performance. 
During the quarter, adjusted EBITDA increased 8.9% to $2.131 billion from $1.956 billion last year. We reported an improvement of 50 basis points in adjusted EBITDA margin in the quarter to [indiscernible]. As a reminder, last year's fourth quarter, we recorded a $68 million increase to Medicaid revenues related to the Texas Medicaid Waiver Program, reversing the reduction we have made in the third quarter of last year. Adjusting for the impact of this item, as well as the decline of $27 million in EHR income and an increase of $24 million in share-based compensation, adjusted EBITDA grew 15.4% over the fourth quarter of last year. 
Now let me speak to volumes. In the fourth quarter, our same facility admissions increased 1.6% over the prior year and equivalent admissions increased 2.9%. Sam will provide more commentary on our volumes range in a moment. 
During the fourth quarter, same facility Medicare admissions and equivalent admissions increased 0.6% and 1.8%, respectively. This includes both traditional and Managed Medicare. Managed Medicare admissions increased 6.3% on a same facility basis and represent 32.8% of our total Medicare admissions. Same facility Medicaid admissions and equivalent admissions increased 3% and 4.8%, respectively, in the quarter, consistent with trends we experienced in the third quarter. Same facilities self-pay and charity admissions increased 8.6% in the quarter, representing 7.7% of our total admissions compared to 7.2% last year. Managed care, which includes exchange admissions, increased 0.6% and equivalent admissions increased 1.9% on a same facility basis in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year. Same facility emergency room visits increased 3.6% in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year. And same facility self-pay and charity ER visits represented 19.6% of our total ER visits in the quarter, which is consistent with last year. 
Intensity of service or acuity continued to increase in the quarter with our same facility case mix increasing 2.1% compared to the prior-year period. Same facility surgical volumes increased 1.9% in the quarter with same facility inpatient surgeries increasing 1.5% and outpatient surgeries increasing 2.2% from the prior year. Same facility revenue per equivalent admission increased 2.6% in the quarter. Same facility managed care and other, including exchanged revenue per equivalent admission increased 5.6% in the quarter, generally consistent with our third quarter results. Same facility managed care and other, including exchange case mix, increased 2.4% compared to the prior year.
Same facility charity care and uninsured discounts increased $494 million in the quarter compared to the prior year. Same facility charity care discounts totaled $958 million in the quarter or an increase of $46 million from the prior-year period, while same facility uninsured discounts totaled $2.873 billion, an increase of $448 million over the prior-year period.
Now turning to expenses. Expense management in the quarter was good as we were able to leverage strong volumes and higher intensity of service. We also saw improvement from our Q3 expense levels as a result of various management actions we began last quarter. Same facility operating expense per equivalent admission increased 1.2% compared to the last year's fourth quarter and, sequentially, operating expense per equivalent admissions declined 0.3% from the third quarter 2015. 
Salaries and benefits as a percentage of revenue increased 50 basis points to 44.9% compared to 44.4% in last year's fourth quarter. Sequentially, salaries and benefits as a percentage of revenue improved 200 basis points from the 46.9% we reported in Q3 of 2015. 
Same facility supply expense per equivalent admission declined 2.1% for the fourth quarter compared to the prior-year period and improved 80 basis points as a percentage of revenue from last year's fourth quarter, reflecting continued success on several supply chain initiatives. 
Our pharmacy cost trends moderated slightly in the quarter. Our total pharmacy cost was up approximately 9% in Q4 compared to the 13% increase we reported in Q3 of 2015. 
Other operating expenses improved 50 basis points from last year's fourth quarter to 18.0% of revenues. 
We recognized $1 million in electronic health record income in the quarter compared to $28 million last year, and this was consistent with our expectations. 
As previously mentioned, our adjusted EBITDA margins for the quarter increased 50 basis points over the prior-year period. But adjusting for the $68 million in Texas Waiver item in '14 and the changes in EHR income and share-based compensation, adjusted EBITDA margin increased 150 basis points for the quarter over the prior-year period.
Let me briefly touch on health reform activity in the quarter. In the fourth quarter of 2015, we saw 11,238 same facility exchange admissions as compared to the 7,700 we saw in the fourth quarter of last year and comparable to the 11,445 exchange admissions we recorded in the third quarter of 2015. We saw just under 38,000 same facility exchange ER visits in the fourth quarter compared to the 25,600 in the fourth quarter of '14 and the 40,200 we reported in the third quarter of 2015. When you all the components of health reform that we contract, we currently estimate health reform contributed just under 6% of adjusted EBITDA for the full year of 2015, and that was in line with our expectations. So all in all, a strong quarter has finished a very strong for the company.
Let me touch briefly on cash flow. Our cash flow remains very strong. In the fourth quarter, cash flow from operations was $1.558 billion compared to the $1.627 billion last year, just primarily result of changes in working capital offsetting the increase of net income. For the full year of 2015, cash flow from operations was $4.734 billion, up from $4.448 billion last year. And free cash flow for 2015 is just over $1.864 billion. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately $2.179 billion available under our revolving credit facilities.
So now let me move into a discussion of our 2016 guidance. Highlighted in our earnings release this morning, we estimate our 2016 consolidated revenues should range from $41.5 billion to $42.5 billion. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be between $8.15 billion and $8.45 billion. Within our revenue estimates, we estimate equivalent admission growth to range between 2.5% and 4% for the year and revenue per equivalent admission growth to range between 2% to 3% for 2016. We anticipate our Medicare revenues per equivalent admission to reflect the composite growth rate of approximately 1% to 2%, factoring in Market Basket changes in reductions as well as some anticipated intensity increases. Medicaid revenues per equivalent admission are estimated to be mostly flat year-over-year, excluding any changes in the Texas waiver revenues. And managed and commercial revenues per equivalent admission are estimated to grow between 4% and 5%. 
We expect a continued stepdown of our EHR incentive income of about $40 million. EHR-related costs are no longer being considered incremental expenses but do remain in the system to support EHR and other ongoing automation efforts. We also anticipate a growth in share-based compensation of approximately $40 million. So we anticipate operating expense per adjusted admission growth of approximately 2.5%.
Our guidance includes the estimated net impact of health reform. While we expect exchange volumes to continue to grow in the third year of health reform, isolating the net EBITDA impact of health reform from core operations is becoming more suggestive and increasingly difficult. We will continue to report on exchange volumes which we can identify, but converting these variables to an EBITDA impact has increased imprecision. We believe reform will continue to contribute to the growth of the company and our reasonable estimate today is reform will continue contribute approximately 1% [ph] of growth for the company in 2016. 
Relative to the other aspects of our guidance, we anticipate capital spending to increase to $2.7 billion in 2016, which is in line with our 3-year capital plan that we announced early in 2013. We estimate depreciation and amortization to be approximately $1.9 billion and interest expense to be approximately $1.75 billion. Our effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 38%. And lastly, our average diluted shares are projected to be approximately 404 million shares for the year and earnings per diluted share guidance for 2016 is between $6 and $6.45. 
So that concludes my remarks, and I'll turn the call over to Sam for some additional comments."
261825,322783529,922341,"HCA Holdings, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 28, 2016",2016-01-28,"Earnings Calls","HCA Healthcare, Inc.","Executives","Good morning.

As mentioned earlier, the fourth quarter was another solid quarter for volume growth across the company and capped off a very strong year of growth for HCA. Again, this quarter, we had broad-based growth across our divisions and we had broad-based growth across the various service lines that make up our business. 
To put a finer point on the consistency Milton highlighted, HCA has now grown its admissions and emergency room visits on a same facility basis in 18 out of the last 20 quarters. This consistency is not only seen in these growth metrics but also in many other areas of our business. For the fourth quarter, the company had very low flu volumes, which reduced our growth in admission by approximately 0.7% and also reduced our growth in emergency room visits by almost 2%. 10 of 14 divisions had growth in admissions and emergency room visits in the quarter. For the year, all divisions had growth in both of these categories. 13 of 14 divisions had growth in adjusted admissions for the quarter. For the year, all of divisions had growth in adjusted admissions. And within the divisions, 86% of all HCA domestic hospitals had growth in adjusted admissions. This broad-based performance reflects HCA's strong and diversified portfolio of networks in 42 domestic markets, most of which, we believe, still have good growth prospects. 
In addition to the strong portfolio performance, the company's growth across the diversified facilities and service lines was equally strong. On a same facility basis, inpatient surgeries grew by 1.5% in the quarter and 2.1% for the year. Surgical admits grew by 80 basis points to 28.4% of total admits in the quarter. And for the year, surgical admits were slightly up over the prior year at 27.5%. 
Outpatient surgeries grew by 2.2% in the quarter and 1.6% for the year. Both components of this service line, hospital-based and our freestanding ambulatory surgery Center division, showed solid growth. 
Behavioral health admissions grew by 7.9% in the quarter and 8.4% for the year. Rehab admissions grew by 6.4% in the quarter and 8.5% for the year. Deliveries were the only volumetric down for the quarter. It was down 1.8%. However, managed care deliveries were actually up. For the year, deliveries were up 0.8%. Average length of stay increased 1.1% in the quarter and 1.3% for the year. These increases are mostly a result of the company's growth agenda, which includes developing a more comprehensive and complex level of services across our provider networks. For example, trauma volumes across our growing network of trauma centers were up 27% for the year and cardiovascular surgery volumes were up over 6% for the year, which is the result of adding deeper, more complex capabilities to our existing programs. 
And finally, the company has been investing aggressively to expand its care centers. These centers improve convenience for our patients and increase access to our networks. This past year, we had over 1 million urgent care visits, a 500% increase. Our urgent care centers, coupled with the 3.3% growth in the number of physicians who have joined our medical staff, are making it easier for our patients to use an HCA network and improving our overall outreach efforts. 
As we move into 2016, we think HCA is well positioned to succeed. We believe the macros for our markets are still positive, and we believe the company is heading into the year with momentum. Demand growth in our market is strong. We estimate it at approximately 2% per year, driven primarily by population growth and positive economic trends. The pricing environment is stable, and we have good visibility into our contracts. The company has contracted for 85% of its commercial revenue in 2016, over 50% for 2017 and around 20% for 2018 at pricing terms that are consistent with the past few years. 
Market share is at an all-time high, and opportunities still exist to increase it as we execute our growth agenda and increase our capital spending. Over the next 2 years, we will add close to 1,000 inpatient beds and 400 ER beds to address capacity constraints and growth opportunities. 
The competitive landscape in HCA's markets is mostly unchanged. Complementary in market acquisitions are available, especially in outpatient areas. We have next-generation growth opportunities for many facilities within our portfolio. This past year, 80% of our hospitals had earnings growth. And lastly, we have a solid handle on cost trends, which we believe should be manageable in 2016. 
In summary, we believe the company has the right strategy and the right approach to the market for sustaining growth. We believe the company is resourcing it' growth agenda appropriately, and we are improving our ability to execute even better by investing in systems and specialization across the company. 
With that, let me turn the call back to Vic."

And those markets are yielding on a composite basis across the company approximately 2% increase in demand growth, just coming from population growth as well as aging baby boomers, increasing employment and so forth. On top of that, the company has achieved anywhere between 25 to 40 basis points of market share gain over the past few years. And as we look forward, we see those basic components being similar to what I just laid out. And so next year's guidance includes about 2% to  2.5% demand growth at this particular point with our estimates. And then roughly 25 to 30 basis points of market share gain. Our approach to gaining market share is clearly built around being the provider's system of choice for our patients and for our physicians and that involves 4, 5 major dimensions that we invest in very, very aggressively, we monitor very, very closely. And those are centered around do we have the right network of outpatient facilities and ease of access, if you will, into HCA's facilities, building out comprehensive service lines, I mentioned that in my comments, and then working with our physicians very, very effectively to enable them to do what they need to do for our patients. And we do that work with one other dimension that we're investing in even more, and that's coordinating care across the HCA continuum and the HCA network, and that's yielding gains for us. Obviously, our capital spending is enhancing our growth. We believe in putting us in a very strong competitive position within the market. And then finally, I think the competitive advantage at HCA has globally across these markets is that we have an incredible amount of best practice and solutions that we can export from one market to another and put that to use in a very timely go to market quickly kind of way.

So basically flat with the fourth quarter of last year. So I'm very pleased with that. What we saw year-over-year, and I'll speak the sequential in a moment because I think the sequential performance is most important here, but year-over-year, we had about 1% improvement in productivity. We had a slowdown in the rate of growth in contract labor. It did grow, but it was lower than what it had grown in the previous 9 months of the year. And so those are some year-over-year kind of metrics. But what was really impressive and what I was really pleased with our teams, and as I mentioned in the third quarter, we started to see this in September, but sequentially, we improved our productivity from third quarter to fourth quarter about 1.7%. Now in the previous 2 years, we had improved our productivity from the third quarter to the fourth quarter in low 10s, like 0.1% in 1 year, 0.3% in the other. So very significant movement by our teams to make some adjustments in our productivity. Contract labor did slow down, actually reduced by 1% from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. So that was encouraging. And as we mentioned in the third quarter call, we did see some stabilization, but we actually saw a bit of improvement sequentially in the fourth quarter as compared to the third. Contract labor still remains an opportunity for the company. Nursing contract labor is somewhere between 8.5% and 9%. That's stabilized a little bit but nonetheless an opportunity. As we look at what the company has been able to accomplish, I went back and studied, 80% of the last 20 weeks, we've actually had a net gain in full-time RN positions across the company. And we've also dropped about 900 FTEs from orientation into supporting our patients. So I'm very pleased with the progress we're making in our hiring efforts. OneHR, a program, is starting to get its legs, if you will, and really yield some benefit for the company. And as we finish our rollout in 2016, I'm eagerly awaiting improvements there. So as we think about wage rates for 2016, we are anticipating a little bit of acceleration but something that's very, very manageable, we believe within our overall budget. And so that's sort of the story on our labor for the fourth quarter."

That dropped in the fourth quarter to just under 9%, 8 9% in the fourth quarter. As we mentioned in our calls in the past, there have been some noise when we do year-over-year comparisons mainly because of the first year of health reform and Medicaid conversions. We did, as you mentioned, identified some processing issues in the third quarter of Medicaid applications in Texas and Kansas. We did see some improvements there. Didn't necessarily have a material effect on us in the quarter. Just as a reference, uninsured admission growth of 8.9% represent roughly 2,800 admissions. And then in the third quarter, it was roughly 4,400 admissions. So sequentially, we saw some improvement in there. Going forward, I would anticipate that our uninsured volume growth will track our uninsured volume growth. And right now, I believe kind of absent any change catalyst, such as a new state expanding or some other macro trends, I'd anticipate our uninsured volume trends to settle out in the high single digits.

In the fourth quarter, when I look at uncompensated care, we saw sequential improvement versus the third quarter. And when I look at year-over-year, that year-over-year growth in uncompensated care is tracking high single-digit uninsured volume growth there.

We are very disciplined into sort of markets and facilities that we want to invest in.

We bought a rural hospital that was contiguous to Orlando and Jacksonville. We were able to rechannel referrals out of that hospital into HCA system, pick up incremental market share. So these complementary acquisitions, on top of that I think we acquired 5 [indiscernible] surgery centers this past year and added it to our network within a couple of major markets. So these things are very, very strategic and create more durability, more competitiveness and allow us to grow organically in very high-growth markets.

Then about $1 billion of our spend is what I would call routine kind of investments. So then you got roughly $1 billion to $1.2 billion that's related to growth prospects, capacity constraints, new service line development, outpatient facilities and so forth. As I mentioned in my comments, the investments that we've been making are producing about 1,000 new beds over the course of 2016 and 2017. That's slightly up over the number of beds that we put into service in 2014 and '15 and slightly up over 2012 and 2013. We have a number of markets that are approaching capacity and they're very significant markets to HCA. And a lot of this capital is going specifically to these markets that are at a certain level of capacity, inpatient capacity, outpatient capacity, primarily in our ERs or surgical capacity. And so it's very well diversified, both in service line capability and also within our markets. So it's being shared very broadly across the company. Again, we think this diversified approach to different kind of service allocations and market allocation creates a very conservative return profile for HCA. The more we can put it on an existing chassis where we have physicians, we have fixed costs, we have a reputation in the market, the easier it is to produce a return because we are able to leverage those existing capabilities. So that's our fundamental approach. We do have a few markets where we are adding new facilities like new hospitals, they're more low startup hospitals that are very important to our geographical presence and also to network development, but those don't have a lot of volume but they do create new relationships. And over the long pull, we think they'll be very significant facilities to our markets."

And it is a conservative investment strategy versus an acquisition for the reasons Sam just noted. And just I guess to back up that, our performance, if you look back 2 years ago, our return on invested capital was 14.1%, and that's an incredibly I think incredible number to start with. But based on the 12 months ended December 2015, our return on invested capital is 15.4%. So as we are investing more capital in our existing markets, we are seeing our return growth.

The thing about HCA is we compete in a very fragmented sort of environment where the same competitor doesn't really exist from one market to the other. So what we compete against in Miami is not necessarily the same system that we compete against in Dallas nor is that the same system that we compete against in Salt Lake City or even San Jose. So that fragmentation allows us to, I think, have advantage in the market. And when we can deploy capital at a very unique way or effective way or create a service line capability or move some other initiative across the HCA markets, we're able to do that maybe without our competitors being able to see it like we are able to see it because of our multi-market perspective.

Thank you, Vic, and good morning to everyone joining us on the call or webcast. This morning, we issued our quarterly earnings release for the fourth quarter of 2015. The release is consistent with the preview of the fourth quarter we issued ea",700,"All right. Thank you, Vic, and good morning to everyone joining us on the call or webcast. This morning, we issued our quarterly earnings release for the fourth quarter of 2015. The release is consistent with the preview of the fourth quarter we issued earlier this month. And I'll make a few comments on the quarter and our strategy, and then I'll turn the call over to Bill and Sam to provide more detail on the quarter, health reform and 2016 expectations. 
We were extremely pleased with the result of the fourth quarter. Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter totaled $2.131 billion; and for the year, $7.915 billion. It was a record quarter, a record earnings quarter for HCA, and also a record earnings year. The fourth quarter performance was the result of solid volume growth, improved payer mix and service mix and effective cost management.
We believe the company is well-positioned for continued success. There are many aspects of the company that contribute to our consistency of growth and financial performance. Our growth strategy built upon our investments in developing health systems in large, fast-growing urban markets has been delivering strong top line growth. 
To illustrate the consistency and effectiveness of our growth strategy, we have reported same facility admissions and adjusted admissions growth for 8 consecutive years, ER visit growth for 9 consecutive years and surgical growth for 7 consecutive quarters. We believe our strategies are well resourced, and we expect to see another year of volume growth in 2016.
The consistent execution of our growth strategy, consistent growth in adjusted EBITDA, which has grown from $5.9 billion in 2010 to $7.9 billion in 2015, has resulted in strong cash flows. Since our IPO in early 2011, we have maintained a well balanced, shareholder-friendly approach to capital allocation. For example, since the IPO in 2011 through the fourth quarter of 2015, we have generated $20.1 billion of cash flows from operating activities. Over the same period, we invested $9.7 billion in our markets through capital expenditures or about 48% of cash generated. And we returned cash to shareholders, either in special dividends or by share repurchase, in the amount of $9.3 billion or about 46% of cash generated. The company had approximately $2.6 billion remaining under its $3 billion share repurchase authorization at year end.
We generated $4.73 billion of cash flows from operating activities in 2015, up 6.4% over 2014. We continue to have a balanced approach to capital allocation in 2015, deploying approximately $2.4 billion in capital spending and approximately $2.4 billion in share repurchases. In 2015, we had repurchased approximately 32 million shares of our stock. 
Now in addition to our financial performance, I was pleased with our progress with respect to our clinical agenda. In 2015, 106 or 78% of our eligible hospitals were recognized as top performers by the Joint Commission compared to the approximately 31% of hospitals nationwide. The Joint Commission's top performer status is the highest recognition for achieving excellence in evidence-based care processes for certain medical conditions. 
In 2016, we will continue to leverage clinical technology, especially in concepts of big data, data analytics and clinical informatics to deliver safe, high-quality and compassionate care for our patients. We will also continue our focus on programmatic [ph] development of service lines directed at expanding our clinical depth and capabilities. We will remain committed to continuous improvement in the quality of care and service as we strategically position the company to deliver value for all of our stakeholders. 
I'll close my comments with my thoughts on our 2016 guidance that is included in our release this morning. With respect to adjusted EBITDA growth, our guidance yields a 3% growth rate at the low point of the range and just under 7% at the high end. Our guidance reflects continued solid volume growth, reasonable pricing and well-managed expense growth with a little less contribution from the reforms in the past 2 years. We transition into 2016 with momentum, and we believe the company is well positioned to achieve its goals for 2016. 
Now let me turn the call over to Bill to provide additional detail on the quarter, health reform and 2016 guidance."

Thank you, Milton, and good morning, everyone. I will cover some additional information relating to the fourth quarter results and review of our 2016 guidance. Then I'll turn over the call to Sam for an update on our operations. As Milton comment",1479,"Great. Thank you, Milton, and good morning, everyone. I will cover some additional information relating to the fourth quarter results and review of our 2016 guidance. Then I'll turn over the call to Sam for an update on our operations. 
As Milton commented, we were extremely pleased with the quarter's results and the quarter finished a very strong 2015 for the company. Fourth quarter was coupled with a good payer mix and service mix and solid expense management, which combined to drive the quarter and the year's strong performance. 
During the quarter, adjusted EBITDA increased 8.9% to $2.131 billion from $1.956 billion last year. We reported an improvement of 50 basis points in adjusted EBITDA margin in the quarter to 20.8%. As a reminder, in  last year's fourth quarter, we recorded a $68 million increase to Medicaid revenues related to the Texas Medicaid Waiver Program, reversing the reduction we had made in the third quarter of last year. Adjusting for the impact of this item, as well as a decline of $27 million in EHR income and an increase of $24 million in share-based compensation, adjusted EBITDA grew 15.4% over the fourth quarter of last year. 
Now let me speak to volumes. In the fourth quarter, our same facility admissions increased 1.6% over the prior year and equivalent admissions increased 2.9%. Sam will provide more commentary on our volumes trends in a moment. 
During the fourth quarter, same facility Medicare admissions and equivalent admissions increased 0.6% and 1.8%, respectively. This included both traditional and Managed Medicare. Managed Medicare admissions increased 6.3% on a same facility basis and represent 32.8% of our total Medicare admissions. 
Same facility Medicaid admissions and equivalent admissions increased 3% and 4.8%, respectively, in the quarter, consistent with trends we experienced in the third quarter. 
Same facility self-pay and charity admission increased 8.6% in the quarter, representing 7.7% of our total admissions compared to 7.2% last year. 
Managed care and other, which includes exchange admissions, increased 0.6%, and equivalent admissions increased 1.9% on a same facility basis in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year. 
Same facility emergency room visits increased 3.6% in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year. And same facility self-pay and charity ER visits represented 19.6% of our total ER visits in the quarter, which is consistent with last year. 
Intensity of service or acuity continued to increase in the quarter, with our same facility case mix increasing 2.1% compared to the prior-year period. 
Same facility surgical volumes increased 1.9% in the quarter, with same facility inpatient surgeries increasing 1.5% and outpatient surgeries increasing 2.2% from the prior year. 
Same facility revenue per equivalent admission increased 2.6% in the quarter. Same facility managed care and other, including exchange revenue per equivalent admission increased 5.6% in the quarter, generally consistent with our third quarter results. 
Same facility managed care and other, including exchange case mix, increased 2.4% compared to the prior year.
Same facility charity care and uninsured discounts increased $494 million in the quarter compared to the prior year. Same facility charity care discounts totaled $958 million in the quarter or an increase of $46 million from the prior-year period, while same facility uninsured discounts totaled $2.873 billion, an increase of $448 million over the prior-year period.
Now turning to expenses. Expense management in the quarter was good as we were able to leverage strong volumes and higher intensity of service. We also saw improvement from our Q3 expense levels as a result of various management actions we began last quarter. Same facility operating expense per equivalent admission increased 1.2% compared to the last year's fourth quarter, and sequentially, operating expense per equivalent admissions declined 0.3% from the third quarter of 2015. 
Salaries and benefits as a percentage of revenue increased 50 basis points to 44.9% compared to 44.4% in last year's fourth quarter. Sequentially, salaries and benefits as a percentage of revenue improved 200 basis points from the 46.9% we reported in Q3 of 2015. 
Same facility supply expense per equivalent admission declined 2.1% for the fourth quarter compared to the prior-year period and improved 80 basis points as a percentage of revenue from last year's fourth quarter, reflecting continued success on several supply chain initiatives. 
Our pharmacy cost trends moderated slightly in the quarter. Our total pharmacy cost was up approximately 9% in Q4 compared to the 13% increase we reported in Q3 of 2015. 
Other operating expenses improved 50 basis points from last year's fourth quarter to 18.0% of revenues. 
We recognized $1 million in electronic health record income in the quarter compared to $28 million last year, and this was consistent with our expectations. 
As previously mentioned, our adjusted EBITDA margins for the quarter increased 50 basis points over the prior-year period. But adjusting for the $68 million Texas Waiver item in '14 and the changes in EHR income and share-based compensation, adjusted EBITDA margin increased 150 basis points for the quarter over the prior-year period.
Let me briefly touch on health reform activity in the quarter. In the fourth quarter of 2015, we saw 11,238 same facility exchange admissions as compared to the 7,700 we saw in the fourth quarter of last year and comparable to the 11,445 exchange admissions we reported in the third quarter of 2015. We saw just under 38,000 same facility exchange ER visits in the fourth quarter compared to 25,600 in the fourth quarter of '14 and the 40,200 we reported in the third quarter of 2015. 
When you roll all the components of health reform that we can track, we currently estimate health reform contributed just under 6% of adjusted EBITDA for the full year of 2015, and that was in line with our expectations. So all in all, a strong quarter has finished a very strong year for the company.
Let me touch briefly on cash flow. Our cash flow remains very strong. In the fourth quarter, cash flow from operations was $1.558 billion compared with the $1.627 billion last year, just primarily a result of changes in working capital offsetting the increase in net income. For the full year of 2015, cash flow from operations was $4.734 billion, up from $4.448 billion last year. And free cash flow for 2015 was just over $1.864 billion. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately $2.179 billion available under our revolving credit facilities.
So now let me move into a discussion about our 2016 guidance. Highlighted in our earnings release this morning, we estimate our 2016 consolidated revenues should range from $41.5 billion to $42.5 billion. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be between $8.15 billion and $8.45 billion. Within our revenue estimates, we estimate equivalent admission growth to range between 2.5% and 4% for the year and revenue per equivalent admission growth to range between 2% to 3% for 2016. 
We anticipate our Medicare revenues per equivalent admission to reflect a composite growth rate of approximately 1% to 2%, factoring in market basket changes and ACA reductions as well as some anticipated intensity increases. Medicaid revenues per equivalent admission are estimated to be mostly flat year-over-year, excluding any changes in the Texas waiver revenues. And managed and commercial revenues per equivalent admission are estimated to grow between 4% and 5%. 
We expect a continued stepdown of our EHR incentive income of about $40 million. EHR-related cost are no longer being considered incremental expenses, but do remain in the system to support EHR and other ongoing automation efforts. We also anticipate a growth in share-based compensation of approximately $40 million. So we anticipate operating expense per adjusted admission growth of approximately 2.5%.
Our guidance includes the estimated net impact of health reform. While we expect exchange volumes to continue to grow in the third year of health reform, isolating the net EBITDA impact of health reform from core operations is becoming more subjective and increasingly difficult. We will continue to report on exchange volumes which we can identify, but converting these variables to an EBITDA impact has increasing imprecision. We believe reform will continue to contribute to the growth of the company, and our reasonable estimate today is reform will continue contribute approximately 1% of growth for the company in 2016. 
Relative to other aspects of our guidance, we anticipate capital spending to increase to $2.7 billion in 2016, which is in line with our 3-year capital plan that we announced early in 2015. 
We estimate depreciation and amortization to be approximately $1.9 billion and interest expense to be approximately $1.75 billion. Our effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 38%. And lastly, our average diluted shares are projected to be approximately 404 million shares for the year, and earnings per diluted share guidance for 2016 is between $6 and $6.45. 
So that concludes my remarks, and I'll turn the call over to Sam for some additional comments."
261825,322783529,922557,"HCA Holdings, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 28, 2016",2016-01-28,"Earnings Calls","HCA Healthcare, Inc.","Executives","Good morning.

Again, this quarter, we had broad-based growth across our divisions and we had broad",809,"Good morning. As mentioned earlier, the fourth quarter was another solid quarter for volume growth across the company and capped off a very strong year of growth for HCA. Again, this quarter, we had broad-based growth across our divisions and we had broad-based growth across the various service lines that make up our business. 
To put a finer point on the consistency Milton highlighted, HCA has now grown its admissions and emergency room visits on a same facility basis in 18 out of the last 20 quarters. This consistency is not only seen in these growth metrics but also in many other areas of our business. 
For the fourth quarter, the company had very low flu volumes, which reduced our growth in admission by approximately 0.7% and also reduced our growth in emergency room visits almost 2%. 
10 of 14 divisions had growth in admissions and emergency room visits in the quarter. For the year, all divisions had growth in both of these categories. 13 of 14 divisions had growth in adjusted admissions for the quarter. For the year, all of divisions had growth in adjusted admissions. And within the divisions, 86% of all HCA domestic hospitals had growth in adjusted admissions. This broad-based performance reflects HCA's strong and diversified portfolio of networks in 42 domestic markets, most of which, we believe, still have good growth prospects. 
In addition to the strong portfolio performance, the company's growth across its diversified facilities and service lines was equally strong. On a same facility basis, inpatient surgeries grew by 1.5% in the quarter and 2.1% for the year. Surgical admits grew by 80 basis points to 28.4% of total admits in the quarter. And for the year, surgical admits were slightly up over the prior year at 27.5%. 
Outpatient surgeries grew by 2.2% in the quarter and 1.6% for the year. Both components of this service line, hospital-based and our freestanding Ambulatory Surgery Center division, showed solid growth. 
Behavioral health admissions grew by 7.9% in the quarter and 8.4% for the year. Rehab admissions grew by 6.4% in the quarter and 8.5% for the year. Deliveries were the only volume metric down for the quarter. It was down 1.8%. However, managed care deliveries were actually up. For the year, deliveries were up 0.8%. 
Average length of stay increased 1.1% in the quarter and 1.3% for the year. These increases are mostly a result of the company's growth agenda, which includes developing a more comprehensive and complex level of services across our provider networks. For example, trauma volumes across our growing network of trauma centers were up 27% for the year and cardiovascular surgery volumes were up over 6% for the year, which is the result of adding deeper, more complex capabilities to our existing programs. 
And finally, the company has been investing aggressively to expand its urgent care centers. These centers improve convenience for our patients and increase access to our networks. This past year, we had over 1 million urgent care visits, a 500% increase. Our urgent care centers, coupled with the 3.3% growth in the number of physicians who have joined our medical staff, are making it easier for our patients to use an HCA network and improving our overall outreach efforts. 
As we move into 2016, we think HCA is well positioned to succeed. We believe macros for our markets are still positive, and we believe the company is heading into the year with momentum. Demand growth in our market is strong. We estimate it at approximately 2% per year, driven primarily by population growth and positive economic trends. The pricing environment is stable, and we have good visibility into our contracts. The company is contracted for 85% of its commercial revenue in 2016, over 50% for 2017 and around 20% for 2018 at pricing terms that are consistent with the past few years. 
Market share is at an all-time high, and opportunities still exist to increase it as we execute our growth agenda and increase our capital spending. Over the next 2 years, we will add close to 1,000 inpatient beds and 400 ER beds to address capacity constraint and growth opportunities. 
The competitive landscape in HCA's markets is mostly unchanged. Complementary in-market acquisitions are available, especially in outpatient areas. We have next-generation growth opportunities for many facilities within our portfolio. This past year, 80% of our hospitals had earnings growth. And lastly, we have a solid handle on cost trends, which we believe should be manageable in 2016. 
In summary, we believe the company has the right strategy and the right approach to the market for sustained growth. We believe the company is resourcing its growth agenda appropriately, and we are improving our ability to execute even better by investing in systems and specialization across the company. 
With that, let me turn the call back to Vic."

And those markets are yielding, on a composite basis across the company, approximately 2% increase in demand growth just coming from population growth, as well as aging baby boomers, increasing employment and so forth. On top of that, the company has achieved anywhere between 25 to 40 basis points of market share gains over the past few years. And as we look forward, we see those basic components being similar to what I just laid out. And so next year's guidance includes about 2% to 2.5% demand growth at this particular point with our estimates and then roughly 25 to 30 basis points of market share gains. Our approach to gaining market share is clearly built around being the provider system of choice for our patients and for our physicians, and that involves 4 or 5 major dimensions that we invest in very, very aggressively, we monitor very, very closely. And those are centered around: Do we have the right network of outpatient facilities; and ease of access, if you will, into HCA's facilities; building out comprehensive service lines, I mentioned that in my comments; and then working with our physicians very, very effectively to enable them to do what they need to do for our patients. And we do that with one other dimension that we're investing in even more, and that's coordinating care across the HCA continuum and the HCA network, and that's yielding gains for us. Obviously, our capital spending is enhancing our growth, we believe, and putting us in a very strong competitive position within the markets. And then finally, I think the competitive advantage that HCA has globally across these markets is that we have an incredible amount of best practice and solutions that we can export from one market to another and put that to use in a very timely go to market quickly kind of way. And that gives us advantage, we believe, on all these dimensions and globally allows us to grow our business."

If you look at the fourth quarter and you make one adjustment that Bill mentioned in his comments about the $68 million of waiver revenue that was sort of misplaced in the third quarter to fourth quarter.

If you look at the fourth quarter and you make one adjustment that Bill mentioned in his comments about the $68 million of waiver revenue that was sort of misplaced in the third quarter to fourth quarter. That's probably not the right term, forgive me, Bill. But that reduced our SWB to basically flat with the fourth quarter of last year. So I was very pleased with that. What we saw year-over-year -- and I'll speak to sequential in a moment because I think the sequential performance is most important here. But year-over-year, we had about 1% improvement in productivity. We had a slowdown in the rate of growth in contract labor. It did grow, but it was slower than what it had grown in the previous 9 months of the year. And so those are some year-over-year kind of metrics. But what was really impressive and what I was really pleased with our teams, and as I mentioned in the third quarter, we started to see this in September, but sequentially, we improved our productivity from third quarter to fourth quarter about 1.7%. Now in the previous 2 years, we had improved our productivity from the third quarter to the fourth quarter in low tenths, like 0.1% in 1 year, 0.3% in the other. So very significant movement by our teams to make some adjustments in our productivity. Contract labor did slow down, actually reduced by 1% from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. So that was encouraging. And as we mentioned in the third quarter call, we did see some stabilization, but we actually saw a bit of improvement sequentially in the fourth quarter as compared to the third. I mean, contract labor still remains an opportunity for the company. Nursing contract labor is somewhere between 8.5% and 9%. That's stabilized a little bit but nonetheless an opportunity. As we look at what the company has been able to accomplish, I went back and studied 80% of the last 20 weeks, we've actually had a net gain in full-time RN positions across the company. And we've also dropped about 900 FTEs from orientation into supporting our patients. So I'm very pleased with the progress we're making in our hiring efforts. Our oneHR program is starting to get its sea legs, if you will, and really yield some benefit for the company. And as we finish our rollout in 2016, I'm eagerly awaiting improvements there. So as we think about wage rates for 2016, we are anticipating a little bit of acceleration but something that's very, very manageable, we believe, within our overall budget. And so that's sort of the story on our labor for the fourth quarter."

I'll start and give you some color on our uninsured and maybe Sam wants to add into this. So you're right, our uninsured admissions we called out in the third quarter, recall, we saw over a 13% growth in uninsured admissions in the third quarter. That dropped in the fourth quarter to just under 9%, 8 9% in the fourth quarter. As we mentioned in our calls in the past, there have been some noise when we do year-over-year comparisons mainly because of the first year of health reform and Medicaid conversions. We did, as you mentioned, identify some processing issues in the third quarter of Medicaid applications in Texas and Kansas. We did see some improvements there. Didn't necessarily have a material effect on us in the quarter. Just as a reference, uninsured admission growth of 8.9% represent roughly 2,800 admissions. And then the third quarter, it was roughly 4,400 admissions. So sequentially, we saw some improvement in there. Going forward, I would anticipate that our uninsured volume growth will track our uninsured ED volume growth. And right now, I believe kind of absent any change catalyst, such as a new state expanding or some other macro trends, I'd anticipate our uninsured volume trends to settle out in the high single digits. And that's what we have baked into our guidance going forward. Sam, any other mix comments?"

With respect to case mix, again, I'll refer you back to my comments. I mean, the company is very intentional about trying to drive more complex, high-acuity type services to our facilities. Our strategy, our core strategy within our individual markets is to be able to offer somewhere in the HCA system all services to a patient. So for example, if we need to transplant, we want to have capabilities at one particular facility where we can offer those kind of things. So over the last 4 or 5 years, we've added a significant number of services to our facilities and to our markets that have increased our case mix and increased the overall acuity and built out the capabilities of our provider system. This past year, we opened up 3 new burn centers, as an example. We've opened up probably 10 to 12 new trauma centers. We've expanded our cardiovascular services where we have now 14 to 16 TAVR programs, which is a very sophisticated procedure for valve surgery. So those kind of developments are going within the company as part of our core strategy to be able to provide all services, a comprehensive array of services, to our system and to any patient that hits the HCA network."

And in '13, we also jumped up but not nearly as much. This year, we jumped up from the third quarter to the fourth quarter on a per unit basis, but not nearly as much as the fourth quarter last year. So the comp was, I'll say, favorable, if you will, to some degree. We obviously have a very robust supply chain program. We did see some moderation, as Bill mentioned, in pharmaceutical cost. And I think that the net of all that yielded pretty much a supply cost metric about where we thought it was going to be inside of our own plan.

I mean, just over this past year, we acquired a physician network in San Jose which significantly solidified our position strategy in a very important and growing market to HCA. We bought a large urgent care center inside of Las Vegas, which significantly improved our access and physician relationships and so forth in that market, which is a very important market to HCA. We bought a rural hospital that was contiguous to Orlando and Jacksonville. We were able to rechannel referrals out of that hospital into HCA system, pick up incremental market share. So these complementary acquisitions. On top of that, I think we acquired 5 ambulatory surgery centers this past year and added it to our network within a couple of major markets. So these things are very, very strategic and create more durability, more competitiveness and allow us to grow organically in very high-growth markets. So those are conservative from a capital allocation standpoint, predictable from a return standpoint and provide a lot of synergies to the organization.

Then about $1 billion of our spend is what I would call routine kind of investments. So then you've got roughly $1 billion to $1.2 billion that's related to growth prospects, capacity constraints, new service line development, outpatient facilities and so forth. As I mentioned in my comments, the investments that we've been making are producing about 1,000 new beds over the course of 2016 and 2017. That's slightly up over the number of beds that we put into service in 2014 and '15 and slightly up over 2012 and 2013. We have a number of markets that are approaching capacity and they're very significant markets to HCA. And a lot of this capital is going specifically to these markets that are at a certain level of capacity: Inpatient capacity, outpatient capacity, primarily in our ERs or surgical capacity. And so it's very well diversified, both in service line capability and also within our markets. So it's being shared very broadly across the company. Again, we think this diversified approach to different kind of service allocations and market allocation creates a very conservative return profile for HCA. The more we can put it on an existing chassis where we have physicians, we have fixed cost, we have a reputation in the market, the easier it is to produce a return because we're able to leverage those existing capabilities. So that's our fundamental approach. We do have a few markets where we're adding new facilities like new hospitals, they're more low-startup hospitals that are very important to our geographical presence and also to network development, but those don't add a lot of volume but they do create new relationships. And over the long pull, we think they'll be very significant facilities to our markets."

And it is a conservative investment strategy versus an acquisition for the reasons Sam just noted. And just I guess to back up that, our performance, you look back 2 years ago, our return on invested capital was 14.1%, and that's an incredibly, I think, incredible number to start with. But based on the 12 months ended December 2015, our return on invested capital is 15.4%. So as we're investing more capital in our existing markets, we're seeing our return grow.

My thinking is for 2016 in particular, and I think that's a reasonable target for us. The thing about HCA is we compete in a very fragmented sort of environment where the same competitor doesn't really exist from one market to the other. So what we compete against in Miami is not necessarily the same system that we compete against in Dallas, nor is that the same system that we compete against in Salt Lake City or even San Jose. So that fragmentation allows us to, I think, have advantage in the market. And when we can deploy capital at a very unique way or effective way or create a service line capability or move some other initiative across the HCA markets, we're able to do that maybe without our competitors being able to see it like we are able to see it because of our multi-market perspective.

Thank you, Vic, and good morning to everyone joining us on the call or webcast. This morning, we issued our quarterly earnings release for the fourth quarter of 2015.

This morning, we issued our quarterly earnings release for the fourth quarter of 2015. The release is consistent with the preview of the fourth quarter we issued earlier this month. And I'll make a few comments on the quarter and our strategy, and then I'll turn the call over to Bill and Sam to provide more detail on the quarter, health reform and 2016 expectations. 
We were extremely pleased with the result of the fourth quarter. Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter totaled $2.131 billion; and for the year, $7.915 billion. It was a record quarter, a record earnings quarter for HCA, and also a record earnings year. The fourth quarter performance was the result of solid volume growth, improved payer mix and service mix and effective cost management.
We believe the company is well-positioned for continued success. There are many aspects of the company that contribute to our consistency of growth and financial performance. Our growth strategy built upon our investments in developing health systems in large, fast-growing urban markets has been delivering strong top line growth. 
To illustrate the consistency and effectiveness of our growth strategy, we have reported same facility admissions and adjusted admissions growth for 8 consecutive years, ER visit growth for 9 consecutive years and surgical growth for 7 consecutive quarters. We believe our strategies are well resourced, and we expect to see another year of volume growth in 2016.
The consistent execution of our growth strategy, consistent growth in adjusted EBITDA, which has grown from $5.9 billion in 2010 to $7.9 billion in 2015, has resulted in strong cash flows. Since our IPO in early 2011, we have maintained a well balanced, shareholder-friendly approach to capital allocation. For example, since the IPO in 2011 through the fourth quarter of 2015, we have generated $20.1 billion of cash flows from operating activities. Over the same period, we invested $9.7 billion in our markets through capital expenditures or about 48% of cash generated. And we returned cash to shareholders, either in special dividends or by share repurchase, in the amount of $9.3 billion or about 46% of cash generated. The company had approximately $2.6 billion remaining under its $3 billion share repurchase authorization at year end.
We generated $4.73 billion of cash flows from operating activities in 2015, up 6.4% over 2014. We continue to have a balanced approach to capital allocation in 2015, deploying approximately $2.4 billion in capital spending and approximately $2.4 billion in share repurchases. In 2015, we had repurchased approximately 32 million shares of our stock. 
Now in addition to our financial performance, I was pleased with our progress with respect to our clinical agenda. In 2015, 106 or 78% of our eligible hospitals were recognized as top performers by the Joint Commission compared to the approximately 31% of hospitals nationwide. The Joint Commission's top performer status is the highest recognition for achieving excellence in evidence-based care processes for certain medical conditions. 
In 2016, we will continue to leverage clinical technology, especially in concepts of big data, data analytics and clinical informatics to deliver safe, high-quality and compassionate care for our patients. We will also continue our focus on programmatic [ph] development of service lines directed at expanding our clinical depth and capabilities. We will remain committed to continuous improvement in the quality of care and service as we strategically position the company to deliver value for all of our stakeholders. 
I'll close my comments with my thoughts on our 2016 guidance that is included in our release this morning. With respect to adjusted EBITDA growth, our guidance yields a 3% growth rate at the low point of the range and just under 7% at the high end. Our guidance reflects continued solid volume growth, reasonable pricing and well-managed expense growth with a little less contribution from the reforms in the past 2 years. We transition into 2016 with momentum, and we believe the company is well positioned to achieve its goals for 2016. 
Now let me turn the call over to Bill to provide additional detail on the quarter, health reform and 2016 guidance."

I will cover some additional information relating to the fourth quarter results and review of our 2016 guidance. Then I'll turn over the call to Sam for an update on our operations. 
As Milton commented, we were extremely pleased with the quarter's results and the quarter finished a very strong 2015 for the company. Fourth quarter was coupled with a good payer mix and service mix and solid expense management, which combined to drive the quarter and the year's strong performance. 
During the quarter, adjusted EBITDA increased 8.9% to $2.131 billion from $1.956 billion last year. We reported an improvement of 50 basis points in adjusted EBITDA margin in the quarter to 20.8%. As a reminder, in  last year's fourth quarter, we recorded a $68 million increase to Medicaid revenues related to the Texas Medicaid Waiver Program, reversing the reduction we had made in the third quarter of last year. Adjusting for the impact of this item, as well as a decline of $27 million in EHR income and an increase of $24 million in share-based compensation, adjusted EBITDA grew 15.4% over the fourth quarter of last year. 
Now let me speak to volumes. In the fourth quarter, our same facility admissions increased 1.6% over the prior year and equivalent admissions increased 2.9%. Sam will provide more commentary on our volumes trends in a moment. 
During the fourth quarter, same facility Medicare admissions and equivalent admissions increased 0.6% and 1.8%, respectively. This included both traditional and Managed Medicare. Managed Medicare admissions increased 6.3% on a same facility basis and represent 32.8% of our total Medicare admissions. 
Same facility Medicaid admissions and equivalent admissions increased 3% and 4.8%, respectively, in the quarter, consistent with trends we experienced in the third quarter. 
Same facility self-pay and charity admission increased 8.6% in the quarter, representing 7.7% of our total admissions compared to 7.2% last year. 
Managed care and other, which includes exchange admissions, increased 0.6%, and equivalent admissions increased 1.9% on a same facility basis in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year. 
Same facility emergency room visits increased 3.6% in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year. And same facility self-pay and charity ER visits represented 19.6% of our total ER visits in the quarter, which is consistent with last year. 
Intensity of service or acuity continued to increase in the quarter, with our same facility case mix increasing 2.1% compared to the prior-year period. 
Same facility surgical volumes increased 1.9% in the quarter, with same facility inpatient surgeries increasing 1.5% and outpatient surgeries increasing 2.2% from the prior year. 
Same facility revenue per equivalent admission increased 2.6% in the quarter. Same facility managed care and other, including exchange revenue per equivalent admission increased 5.6% in the quarter, generally consistent with our third quarter results. 
Same facility managed care and other, including exchange case mix, increased 2.4% compared to the prior year.
Same facility charity care and uninsured discounts increased $494 million in the quarter compared to the prior year. Same facility charity care discounts totaled $958 million in the quarter or an increase of $46 million from the prior-year period, while same facility uninsured discounts totaled $2.873 billion, an increase of $448 million over the prior-year period.
Now turning to expenses. Expense management in the quarter was good as we were able to leverage strong volumes and higher intensity of service. We also saw improvement from our Q3 expense levels as a result of various management actions we began last quarter. Same facility operating expense per equivalent admission increased 1.2% compared to the last year's fourth quarter, and sequentially, operating expense per equivalent admissions declined 0.3% from the third quarter of 2015. 
Salaries and benefits as a percentage of revenue increased 50 basis points to 44.9% compared to 44.4% in last year's fourth quarter. Sequentially, salaries and benefits as a percentage of revenue improved 200 basis points from the 46.9% we reported in Q3 of 2015. 
Same facility supply expense per equivalent admission declined 2.1% for the fourth quarter compared to the prior-year period and improved 80 basis points as a percentage of revenue from last year's fourth quarter, reflecting continued success on several supply chain initiatives. 
Our pharmacy cost trends moderated slightly in the quarter. Our total pharmacy cost was up approximately 9% in Q4 compared to the 13% increase we reported in Q3 of 2015. 
Other operating expenses improved 50 basis points from last year's fourth quarter to 18.0% of revenues. 
We recognized $1 million in electronic health record income in the quarter compared to $28 million last year, and this was consistent with our expectations. 
As previously mentioned, our adjusted EBITDA margins for the quarter increased 50 basis points over the prior-year period. But adjusting for the $68 million Texas Waiver item in '14 and the changes in EHR income and share-based compensation, adjusted EBITDA margin increased 150 basis points for the quarter over the prior-year period.
Let me briefly touch on health reform activity in the quarter. In the fourth quarter of 2015, we saw 11,238 same facility exchange admissions as compared to the 7,700 we saw in the fourth quarter of last year and comparable to the 11,445 exchange admissions we reported in the third quarter of 2015. We saw just under 38,000 same facility exchange ER visits in the fourth quarter compared to 25,600 in the fourth quarter of '14 and the 40,200 we reported in the third quarter of 2015. 
When you roll all the components of health reform that we can track, we currently estimate health reform contributed just under 6% of adjusted EBITDA for the full year of 2015, and that was in line with our expectations. So all in all, a strong quarter has finished a very strong year for the company.
Let me touch briefly on cash flow. Our cash flow remains very strong. In the fourth quarter, cash flow from operations was $1.558 billion compared with the $1.627 billion last year, just primarily a result of changes in working capital offsetting the increase in net income. For the full year of 2015, cash flow from operations was $4.734 billion, up from $4.448 billion last year. And free cash flow for 2015 was just over $1.864 billion. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately $2.179 billion available under our revolving credit facilities.
So now let me move into a discussion about our 2016 guidance. Highlighted in our earnings release this morning, we estimate our 2016 consolidated revenues should range from $41.5 billion to $42.5 billion. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be between $8.15 billion and $8.45 billion. Within our revenue estimates, we estimate equivalent admission growth to range between 2.5% and 4% for the year and revenue per equivalent admission growth to range between 2% to 3% for 2016. 
We anticipate our Medicare revenues per equivalent admission to reflect a composite growth rate of approximately 1% to 2%, factoring in market basket changes and ACA reductions as well as some anticipated intensity increases. Medicaid revenues per equivalent admission are estimated to be mostly flat year-over-year, excluding any changes in the Texas waiver revenues. And managed and commercial revenues per equivalent admission are estimated to grow between 4% and 5%. 
We expect a continued stepdown of our EHR incentive income of about $40 million. EHR-related cost are no longer being considered incremental expenses, but do remain in the system to support EHR and other ongoing automation efforts. We also anticipate a growth in share-based compensation of approximately $40 million. So we anticipate operating expense per adjusted admission growth of approximately 2.5%.
Our guidance includes the estimated net impact of health reform. While we expect exchange volumes to continue to grow in the third year of health reform, isolating the net EBITDA impact of health reform from core operations is becoming more subjective and increasingly difficult. We will continue to report on exchange volumes which we can identify, but converting these variables to an EBITDA impact has increasing imprecision. We believe reform will continue to contribute to the growth of the company, and our reasonable estimate today is reform will continue contribute approximately 1% of growth for the company in 2016. 
Relative to other aspects of our guidance, we anticipate capital spending to increase to $2.7 billion in 2016, which is in line with our 3-year capital plan that we announced early in 2015. 
We estimate depreciation and amortization to be approximately $1.9 billion and interest expense to be approximately $1.75 billion. Our effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 38%. And lastly, our average diluted shares are projected to be approximately 404 million shares for the year, and earnings per diluted share guidance for 2016 is between $6 and $6.45. 
So that concludes my remarks, and I'll turn the call over to Sam for some additional comments."
261825,322783529,922563,"HCA Holdings, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 28, 2016",2016-01-28,"Earnings Calls","HCA Healthcare, Inc.","Executives","Good morning.

Again, this quarter, we had broad-based growth across our divisions and we had broad",809,"Good morning. As mentioned earlier, the fourth quarter was another solid quarter for volume growth across the company and capped off a very strong year of growth for HCA. Again, this quarter, we had broad-based growth across our divisions and we had broad-based growth across the various service lines that make up our business. 
To put a finer point on the consistency Milton highlighted, HCA has now grown its admissions and emergency room visits on a same facility basis in 18 out of the last 20 quarters. This consistency is not only seen in these growth metrics but also in many other areas of our business. 
For the fourth quarter, the company had very low flu volumes, which reduced our growth in admission by approximately 0.7% and also reduced our growth in emergency room visits almost 2%. 
10 of 14 divisions had growth in admissions and emergency room visits in the quarter. For the year, all divisions had growth in both of these categories. 13 of 14 divisions had growth in adjusted admissions for the quarter. For the year, all of divisions had growth in adjusted admissions. And within the divisions, 86% of all HCA domestic hospitals had growth in adjusted admissions. This broad-based performance reflects HCA's strong and diversified portfolio of networks in 42 domestic markets, most of which, we believe, still have good growth prospects. 
In addition to the strong portfolio performance, the company's growth across its diversified facilities and service lines was equally strong. On a same facility basis, inpatient surgeries grew by 1.5% in the quarter and 2.1% for the year. Surgical admits grew by 80 basis points to 28.4% of total admits in the quarter. And for the year, surgical admits were slightly up over the prior year at 27.5%. 
Outpatient surgeries grew by 2.2% in the quarter and 1.6% for the year. Both components of this service line, hospital-based and our freestanding Ambulatory Surgery Center division, showed solid growth. 
Behavioral health admissions grew by 7.9% in the quarter and 8.4% for the year. Rehab admissions grew by 6.4% in the quarter and 8.5% for the year. Deliveries were the only volume metric down for the quarter. It was down 1.8%. However, managed care deliveries were actually up. For the year, deliveries were up 0.8%. 
Average length of stay increased 1.1% in the quarter and 1.3% for the year. These increases are mostly a result of the company's growth agenda, which includes developing a more comprehensive and complex level of services across our provider networks. For example, trauma volumes across our growing network of trauma centers were up 27% for the year and cardiovascular surgery volumes were up over 6% for the year, which is the result of adding deeper, more complex capabilities to our existing programs. 
And finally, the company has been investing aggressively to expand its urgent care centers. These centers improve convenience for our patients and increase access to our networks. This past year, we had over 1 million urgent care visits, a 500% increase. Our urgent care centers, coupled with the 3.3% growth in the number of physicians who have joined our medical staff, are making it easier for our patients to use an HCA network and improving our overall outreach efforts. 
As we move into 2016, we think HCA is well positioned to succeed. We believe macros for our markets are still positive, and we believe the company is heading into the year with momentum. Demand growth in our market is strong. We estimate it at approximately 2% per year, driven primarily by population growth and positive economic trends. The pricing environment is stable, and we have good visibility into our contracts. The company is contracted for 85% of its commercial revenue in 2016, over 50% for 2017 and around 20% for 2018 at pricing terms that are consistent with the past few years. 
Market share is at an all-time high, and opportunities still exist to increase it as we execute our growth agenda and increase our capital spending. Over the next 2 years, we will add close to 1,000 inpatient beds and 400 ER beds to address capacity constraint and growth opportunities. 
The competitive landscape in HCA's markets is mostly unchanged. Complementary in-market acquisitions are available, especially in outpatient areas. We have next-generation growth opportunities for many facilities within our portfolio. This past year, 80% of our hospitals had earnings growth. And lastly, we have a solid handle on cost trends, which we believe should be manageable in 2016. 
In summary, we believe the company has the right strategy and the right approach to the market for sustained growth. We believe the company is resourcing its growth agenda appropriately, and we are improving our ability to execute even better by investing in systems and specialization across the company. 
With that, let me turn the call back to Vic."

And those markets are yielding, on a composite basis across the company, approximately 2% increase in demand growth just coming from population growth, as well as aging baby boomers, increasing employment and so forth. On top of that, the company has achieved anywhere between 25 to 40 basis points of market share gains over the past few years. And as we look forward, we see those basic components being similar to what I just laid out. And so next year's guidance includes about 2% to 2.5% demand growth at this particular point with our estimates and then roughly 25 to 30 basis points of market share gains. Our approach to gaining market share is clearly built around being the provider system of choice for our patients and for our physicians, and that involves 4 or 5 major dimensions that we invest in very, very aggressively, we monitor very, very closely. And those are centered around: Do we have the right network of outpatient facilities; and ease of access, if you will, into HCA's facilities; building out comprehensive service lines, I mentioned that in my comments; and then working with our physicians very, very effectively to enable them to do what they need to do for our patients. And we do that with one other dimension that we're investing in even more, and that's coordinating care across the HCA continuum and the HCA network, and that's yielding gains for us. Obviously, our capital spending is enhancing our growth, we believe, and putting us in a very strong competitive position within the markets. And then finally, I think the competitive advantage that HCA has globally across these markets is that we have an incredible amount of best practice and solutions that we can export from one market to another and put that to use in a very timely go to market quickly kind of way. And that gives us advantage, we believe, on all these dimensions and globally allows us to grow our business."

If you look at the fourth quarter and you make one adjustment that Bill mentioned in his comments about the $68 million of waiver revenue that was sort of misplaced in the third quarter to fourth quarter. That's probably not the right term, forgive me, Bill. But that reduced our SWB to basically flat with the fourth quarter of last year. So I was very pleased with that. What we saw year-over-year -- and I'll speak to sequential in a moment because I think the sequential performance is most important here. But year-over-year, we had about 1% improvement in productivity. We had a slowdown in the rate of growth in contract labor. It did grow, but it was slower than what it had grown in the previous 9 months of the year. And so those are some year-over-year kind of metrics. But what was really impressive and what I was really pleased with our teams, and as I mentioned in the third quarter, we started to see this in September, but sequentially, we improved our productivity from third quarter to fourth quarter about 1.7%. Now in the previous 2 years, we had improved our productivity from the third quarter to the fourth quarter in low tenths, like 0.1% in 1 year, 0.3% in the other. So very significant movement by our teams to make some adjustments in our productivity. Contract labor did slow down, actually reduced by 1% from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. So that was encouraging. And as we mentioned in the third quarter call, we did see some stabilization, but we actually saw a bit of improvement sequentially in the fourth quarter as compared to the third. I mean, contract labor still remains an opportunity for the company. Nursing contract labor is somewhere between 8.5% and 9%. That's stabilized a little bit but nonetheless an opportunity. As we look at what the company has been able to accomplish, I went back and studied 80% of the last 20 weeks, we've actually had a net gain in full-time RN positions across the company. And we've also dropped about 900 FTEs from orientation into supporting our patients. So I'm very pleased with the progress we're making in our hiring efforts. Our oneHR program is starting to get its sea legs, if you will, and really yield some benefit for the company. And as we finish our rollout in 2016, I'm eagerly awaiting improvements there. So as we think about wage rates for 2016, we are anticipating a little bit of acceleration but something that's very, very manageable, we believe, within our overall budget. And so that's sort of the story on our labor for the fourth quarter."

That dropped in the fourth quarter to just under 9%, 8 9% in the fourth quarter. As we mentioned in our calls in the past, there have been some noise when we do year-over-year comparisons mainly because of the first year of health reform and Medicaid conversions. We did, as you mentioned, identify some processing issues in the third quarter of Medicaid applications in Texas and Kansas. We did see some improvements there. Didn't necessarily have a material effect on us in the quarter. Just as a reference, uninsured admission growth of 8.9% represent roughly 2,800 admissions. And then the third quarter, it was roughly 4,400 admissions. So sequentially, we saw some improvement in there. Going forward, I would anticipate that our uninsured volume growth will track our uninsured ED volume growth. And right now, I believe kind of absent any change catalyst, such as a new state expanding or some other macro trends, I'd anticipate our uninsured volume trends to settle out in the high single digits.

The short answer on the exchange volume is no, it's not big enough in the overall scheme of our volume to drive the company's composite case mix. With respect to case mix, again, I'll refer you back to my comments. I mean, the company is very intentional about trying to drive more complex, high-acuity type services to our facilities. Our strategy, our core strategy within our individual markets is to be able to offer somewhere in the HCA system all services to a patient. So for example, if we need to transplant, we want to have capabilities at one particular facility where we can offer those kind of things. So over the last 4 or 5 years, we've added a significant number of services to our facilities and to our markets that have increased our case mix and increased the overall acuity and built out the capabilities of our provider system. This past year, we opened up 3 new burn centers, as an example. We've opened up probably 10 to 12 new trauma centers. We've expanded our cardiovascular services where we have now 14 to 16 TAVR programs, which is a very sophisticated procedure for valve surgery. So those kind of developments are going within the company as part of our core strategy to be able to provide all services, a comprehensive array of services, to our system and to any patient that hits the HCA network."

And in '13, we also jumped up but not nearly as much. This year, we jumped up from the third quarter to the fourth quarter on a per unit basis, but not nearly as much as the fourth quarter last year. So the comp was, I'll say, favorable, if you will, to some degree. We obviously have a very robust supply chain program. We did see some moderation, as Bill mentioned, in pharmaceutical cost.

In the fourth quarter, when I look at uncompensated care, we saw sequential improvement versus the third quarter. And when I look at year-over-year, that year-over-year growth in uncompensated care is tracking our high single-digit uninsured volume growth there.

Then about $1 billion of our spend is what I would call routine kind of investments. So then you've got roughly $1 billion to $1.2 billion that's related to growth prospects, capacity constraints, new service line development, outpatient facilities and so forth. As I mentioned in my comments, the investments that we've been making are producing about 1,000 new beds over the course of 2016 and 2017. That's slightly up over the number of beds that we put into service in 2014 and '15 and slightly up over 2012 and 2013. We have a number of markets that are approaching capacity and they're very significant markets to HCA. And a lot of this capital is going specifically to these markets that are at a certain level of capacity: Inpatient capacity, outpatient capacity, primarily in our ERs or surgical capacity. And so it's very well diversified, both in service line capability and also within our markets. So it's being shared very broadly across the company. Again, we think this diversified approach to different kind of service allocations and market allocation creates a very conservative return profile for HCA. The more we can put it on an existing chassis where we have physicians, we have fixed cost, we have a reputation in the market, the easier it is to produce a return because we're able to leverage those existing capabilities. So that's our fundamental approach. We do have a few markets where we're adding new facilities like new hospitals, they're more low-startup hospitals that are very important to our geographical presence and also to network development, but those don't add a lot of volume but they do create new relationships. And over the long pull, we think they'll be very significant facilities to our markets."

And it is a conservative investment strategy versus an acquisition for the reasons Sam just noted. And just I guess to back up that, our performance, you look back 2 years ago, our return on invested capital was 14.1%, and that's an incredibly, I think, incredible number to start with. But based on the 12 months ended December 2015, our return on invested capital is 15.4%. So as we're investing more capital in our existing markets, we're seeing our return grow.

My thinking is for 2016 in particular, and I think that's a reasonable target for us. The thing about HCA is we compete in a very fragmented sort of environment where the same competitor doesn't really exist from one market to the other. So what we compete against in Miami is not necessarily the same system that we compete against in Dallas, nor is that the same system that we compete against in Salt Lake City or even San Jose. So that fragmentation allows us to, I think, have advantage in the market. And when we can deploy capital at a very unique way or effective way or create a service line capability or move some other initiative across the HCA markets, we're able to do that maybe without our competitors being able to see it like we are able to see it because of our multi-market perspective.

This morning, we issued our quarterly earnings release for the fourth quarter of 2015. The release is consistent with the preview of the fourth quarter we issued earlier this month. And I'll make a few comments on the quarter and our strategy, and then I'll turn the call over to Bill and Sam to provide more detail on the quarter, health reform and 2016 expectations. 
We were extremely pleased with the result of the fourth quarter. Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter totaled $2.131 billion; and for the year, $7.915 billion. It was a record quarter, a record earnings quarter for HCA, and also a record earnings year. The fourth quarter performance was the result of solid volume growth, improved payer mix and service mix and effective cost management.
We believe the company is well-positioned for continued success. There are many aspects of the company that contribute to our consistency of growth and financial performance. Our growth strategy built upon our investments in developing health systems in large, fast-growing urban markets has been delivering strong top line growth. 
To illustrate the consistency and effectiveness of our growth strategy, we have reported same facility admissions and adjusted admissions growth for 8 consecutive years, ER visit growth for 9 consecutive years and surgical growth for 7 consecutive quarters. We believe our strategies are well resourced, and we expect to see another year of volume growth in 2016.
The consistent execution of our growth strategy, and consistent growth in adjusted EBITDA, which has grown from $5.9 billion in 2010 to $7.9 billion in 2015, has resulted in strong cash flows. Since our IPO in early 2011, we have maintained a well balanced, shareholder-friendly approach to capital allocation. For example, since the IPO in 2011 through the fourth quarter of 2015, we have generated $20.1 billion of cash flows from operating activities. Over the same period, we invested $9.7 billion in our markets through capital expenditures or about 48% of cash generated. And we returned cash to shareholders, either in special dividends or by share repurchase, in the amount of $9.3 billion or about 46% of cash generated. The company had approximately $2.6 billion remaining under its $3 billion share repurchase authorization at year end.
We generated $4.73 billion of cash flows from operating activities in 2015, up 6.4% over 2014. We continue to have a balanced approach to capital allocation in 2015, deploying approximately $2.4 billion in capital spending and approximately $2.4 billion in share repurchases. In 2015, we had repurchased approximately 32 million shares of our stock. 
Now in addition to our financial performance, I was pleased with our progress with respect to our clinical agenda. In 2015, 106 or 78% of our eligible hospitals were recognized as top performers by the Joint Commission compared to the approximately 31% of hospitals nationwide. The Joint Commission's top performer status is the highest recognition for achieving excellence in evidence-based care processes for certain medical conditions. 
In 2016, we will continue to leverage clinical technology, especially in concepts of big data, data analytics and clinical informatics to deliver safe, high-quality and compassionate care for our patients. We will also continue our focus on programmatic development of service lines directed at expanding our clinical depth and capabilities. We will remain committed to continuous improvement in the quality of care and service as we strategically position the company to deliver value for all of our stakeholders. 
I'll close my comments with my thoughts on our 2016 guidance that is included in our release this morning. With respect to adjusted EBITDA growth, our guidance yields a 3% growth rate at the low point of the range and just under 7% at the high end. Our guidance reflects continued solid volume growth, reasonable pricing and well-managed expense growth with a little less contribution from reforms in the past 2 years. We transition into 2016 with momentum, and we believe the company is well positioned to achieve its goals for 2016. 
Now let me turn the call over to Bill to provide additional detail on the quarter, health reform and 2016 guidance."

I will cover some additional information relating to the fourth quarter results and review of our 2016 guidance. Then I'll turn the call over to Sam for an update on our operations. 
As Milton commented, we were extremely pleased with the quarter's results and the quarter finished a very strong 2015 for the company. Fourth quarter was coupled with a good payer mix and service mix and solid expense management, which combined to drive the quarter and the year's strong performance. 
During the quarter, adjusted EBITDA increased 8.9% to $2.131 billion from $1.956 billion last year. We reported an improvement of 50 basis points in adjusted EBITDA margin in the quarter to 20.8%. As a reminder, in last year's fourth quarter, we recorded a $68 million increase to Medicaid revenues related to the Texas Medicaid Waiver Program, reversing the reduction we had made in the third quarter of last year. Adjusting for the impact of this item, as well as a decline of $27 million in EHR income and an increase of $24 million in share-based compensation, adjusted EBITDA grew 15.4% over the fourth quarter of last year. 
Now let me speak to volumes. In the fourth quarter, our same facility admissions increased 1.6% over the prior year and equivalent admissions increased 2.9%. Sam will provide more commentary on our volume trends in a moment. 
During the fourth quarter, same facility Medicare admissions and equivalent admissions increased 0.6% and 1.8%, respectively. This included both traditional and Managed Medicare. Managed Medicare admissions increased 6.3% on a same facility basis and represent 32.8% of our total Medicare admissions. 
Same facility Medicaid admissions and equivalent admissions increased 3% and 4.8%, respectively, in the quarter, consistent with trends we experienced in the third quarter. 
Same facility self-pay and charity admission increased 8.6% in the quarter, representing 7.7% of our total admissions compared to 7.2% last year. 
Managed care and other, which includes exchange admissions, increased 0.6%, and equivalent admissions increased 1.9% on a same facility basis in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year. 
Same facility emergency room visits increased 3.6% in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year. And same facility self-pay and charity ER visits represented 19.6% of our total ER visits in the quarter, which is consistent with last year. 
Intensity of service or acuity continued to increase in the quarter, with our same facility case mix increasing 2.1% compared to the prior-year period. 
Same facility surgical volumes increased 1.9% in the quarter, with same facility inpatient surgeries increasing 1.5% and outpatient surgeries increasing 2.2% from the prior year. 
Same facility revenue per equivalent admission increased 2.6% in the quarter. Same facility managed care and other, including exchange revenue per equivalent admission increased 5.6% in the quarter, generally consistent with our third quarter results. 
Same facility managed care and other, including exchange case mix, increased 2.4% compared to the prior year.
Same facility charity care and uninsured discounts increased $494 million in the quarter compared to the prior year. Same facility charity care discounts totaled $958 million in the quarter or an increase of $46 million from the prior-year period, while same facility uninsured discounts totaled $2.873 billion, an increase of $448 million over the prior-year period.
Now turning to expenses. Expense management in the quarter was good as we were able to leverage strong volumes and higher intensity of services. We also saw improvement from our Q3 expense levels as a result of various management actions we began last quarter. Same facility operating expense per equivalent admission increased 1.2% compared to the last year's fourth quarter, and sequentially, operating expense per equivalent admissions declined 0.3% from the third quarter of 2015. 
Salaries and benefits as a percentage of revenue increased 50 basis points to 44.9% compared to 44.4% in last year's fourth quarter. Sequentially, salaries and benefits as a percentage of revenue improved 200 basis points from the 46.9% we reported in Q3 of 2015. 
Same facility supply expense per equivalent admission declined 2.1% for the fourth quarter compared to the prior-year period and improved 80 basis points as a percentage of revenue from last year's fourth quarter, reflecting continued success on several supply chain initiatives. 
Our pharmacy cost trends moderated slightly in the quarter. Our total pharmacy cost was up approximately 9% in Q4 compared to the 13% increase we reported in Q3 of 2015. 
Other operating expenses improved 50 basis points from last year's fourth quarter to 18.0% of revenues. 
We recognized $1 million in electronic health record income in the quarter compared to $28 million last year, and this was consistent with our expectations. 
As previously mentioned, our adjusted EBITDA margins for the quarter increased 50 basis points over the prior-year period. But adjusting for the $68 million Texas Waiver item in '14 and the changes in EHR income and share-based compensation, adjusted EBITDA margin increased 150 basis points for the quarter over the prior-year period.
Let me briefly touch on health reform activity in the quarter. In the fourth quarter of 2015, we saw 11,238 same facility exchange admissions as compared to the 7,700 we saw in the fourth quarter of last year and comparable to the 11,445 exchange admissions we reported in the third quarter of 2015. We saw just under 38,000 same facility exchange ER visits in the fourth quarter compared to 25,600 in the fourth quarter of '14 and the 40,200 we reported in the third quarter of 2015. 
When we roll all the components of health reform that we can track, we currently estimate health reform contributed just under 6% of adjusted EBITDA for the full year of 2015, and that was in line with our expectations. So all in all, a strong quarter has finished a very strong year for the company.
Let me touch briefly on cash flow. Our cash flow remains very strong. In the fourth quarter, cash flow from operations was $1.558 billion compared with the $1.627 billion last year, just primarily a result of changes in working capital offsetting the increase in net income. For the full year of 2015, cash flow from operations was $4.734 billion, up from $4.448 billion last year. And free cash flow for 2015 was just over $1.864 billion. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately $2.179 billion available under our revolving credit facilities.
So now let me move into a discussion about our 2016 guidance. Highlighted in our earnings release this morning, we estimate our 2016 consolidated revenues should range from $41.5 billion to $42.5 billion. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be between $8.15 billion and $8.45 billion. Within our revenue estimates, we estimate the equivalent admission growth to range between 2.5% and 4% for the year and revenue per equivalent admission growth to range between 2% to 3% for 2016. 
We anticipate our Medicare revenues per equivalent admission to reflect a composite growth rate of approximately 1% to 2%, factoring in market basket changes and ACA reductions as well as some anticipated intensity increases. Medicaid revenues per equivalent admission are estimated to be mostly flat year-over-year, excluding any changes in the Texas Waiver revenues. And managed and commercial revenues per equivalent admission are estimated to grow between 4% and 5%. 
We expect a continued stepdown of our EHR incentive income of about $40 million. EHR-related costs are no longer being considered incremental expenses, but do remain in the system to support EHR and other ongoing automation efforts. We also anticipate a growth in share-based compensation of approximately $40 million. So we anticipate operating expense per adjusted admission growth of approximately 2.5%.
Our guidance includes the estimated net impact of health reform. While we expect exchange volumes to continue to grow in the third year of health reform, isolating the net EBITDA impact of health reform from core operations is becoming more subjective and increasingly difficult. We will continue to report on exchange volumes which we can identify, but converting these variables to an EBITDA impact has increasing imprecision. We believe reform will continue to contribute to the growth of the company, and our reasonable estimate today is reform will continue contribute approximately 1% of growth for the company in 2016. 
Relative to other aspects of our guidance, we anticipate capital spending to increase to $2.7 billion in 2016, which is in line with our 3-year capital plan that we announced early in 2015. 
We estimate depreciation and amortization to be approximately $1.9 billion and interest expense to be approximately $1.75 billion. Our effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 38%. And lastly, our average diluted shares are projected to be approximately 404 million shares for the year, and earnings per diluted share guidance for 2016 is between $6 and $6.45. 
So that concludes my remarks, and I'll turn the call over to Sam for some additional comments."

As mentioned earlier, the fourth quarter was another solid quarter for volume growth across the company and capped off a very strong year of growth for HCA. Again, this quarter, we had broad-based growth across our divisions and we had broad",809,"Good morning. As mentioned earlier, the fourth quarter was another solid quarter for volume growth across the company and capped off a very strong year of growth for HCA. Again, this quarter, we had broad-based growth across our divisions and we had broad-based growth across the various service lines that make up our business. 
To put a finer point on the consistency Milton highlighted, HCA has now grown its admissions and emergency room visits on a same facility basis in 18 out of the last 20 quarters. This consistency is not only seen in these growth metrics but also in many other areas of our business. 
For the fourth quarter, the company had very low flu volumes, which reduced our growth in admissions by approximately 0.7% and also reduced our growth in emergency room visits almost 2%. 
10 of 14 divisions had growth in admissions and emergency room visits in the quarter. For the year, all divisions had growth in both of these categories. 13 of 14 divisions had growth in adjusted admissions for the quarter. For the year, all divisions had growth in adjusted admissions. And within the divisions, 86% of all HCA domestic hospitals had growth in adjusted admissions. This broad-based performance reflects HCA's strong and diversified portfolio of networks in 42 domestic markets, most of which, we believe, still have good growth prospects. 
In addition to the strong portfolio performance, the company's growth across its diversified facilities and service lines was equally strong. On a same facility basis, inpatient surgeries grew by 1.5% in the quarter and 2.1% for the year. Surgical admits grew by 80 basis points to 28.4% of total admits in the quarter. And for the year, surgical admits were slightly up over the prior year at 27.5%. 
Outpatient surgeries grew by 2.2% in the quarter and 1.6% for the year. Both components of this service line, hospital-based and our freestanding Ambulatory Surgery Center division, showed solid growth. 
Behavioral health admissions grew by 7.9% in the quarter and 8.4% for the year. Rehab admissions grew by 6.4% in the quarter and 8.5% for the year. Deliveries were the only volume metric down for the quarter. It was down 1.8%. However, managed care deliveries were actually up. For the year, deliveries were up 0.8%. 
Average length of stay increased 1.1% in the quarter and 1.3% for the year. These increases are mostly a result of the company's growth agenda, which includes developing a more comprehensive and complex level of services across our provider networks. For example, trauma volumes across our growing network of trauma centers were up 27% for the year and cardiovascular surgery volumes were up over 6% for the year, which is the result of adding deeper, more complex capabilities to our existing programs. 
And finally, the company has been investing aggressively to expand its urgent care centers. These centers improve convenience for our patients and increase access to our networks. This past year, we had over 1 million urgent care visits, a 500% increase. Our urgent care centers, coupled with the 3.3% growth in the number of physicians who have joined our medical staff, are making it easier for our patients to use an HCA network and improving our overall outreach efforts. 
As we move into 2016, we think HCA is well positioned to succeed. We believe macros for our markets are still positive, and we believe the company is heading into the year with momentum. Demand growth in our market is strong. We estimate it at approximately 2% per year, driven primarily by population growth and positive economic trends. The pricing environment is stable, and we have good visibility into our contracts. The company is contracted for 85% of its commercial revenue in 2016, over 50% for 2017 and around 20% for 2018 at pricing terms that are consistent with the past few years. 
Market share is at an all-time high, and opportunities still exist to increase it as we execute our growth agenda and increase our capital spending. Over the next 2 years, we will add close to 1,000 inpatient beds and 400 ER beds to address capacity constraints and growth opportunities. 
The competitive landscape in HCA's markets is mostly unchanged. Complementary in-market acquisitions are available, especially in the outpatient areas. We have next-generation growth opportunities for many facilities within our portfolio. This past year, 80% of our hospitals had earnings growth. And lastly, we have a solid handle on cost trends, which we believe should be manageable in 2016. 
In summary, we believe the company has the right strategy and the right approach to the market for sustained growth. We believe the company is resourcing its growth agenda appropriately, and we are improving our ability to execute even better by investing in systems and specialization across the company. 
With that, let me turn the call back to Vic."

And those markets are yielding, on a composite basis across the company, approximately 2% increase in demand growth just coming from population growth, as well as aging baby boomers, increasing employment and so forth. On top of that, the company has achieved anywhere between 25 to 40 basis points of market share gains over the past few years. And as we look forward, we see those basic components being similar to what I just laid out. And so next year's guidance includes about 2% to 2.5% demand growth at this particular point with our estimates and then roughly 25 to 30 basis points of market share gains. Our approach to gaining market share is clearly built around being the provider system of choice for our patients and for our physicians, and that involves 4 or 5 major dimensions that we invest in very, very aggressively, we monitor very, very closely. And those are centered around: Do we have the right network of outpatient facilities; and ease of access, if you will, into HCA's facilities; building out comprehensive service lines, I mentioned that in my comments; and then working with our physicians very, very effectively to enable them to do what they need to do for our patients. And we do that with one other dimension that we're investing in even more, and that's coordinating care across the HCA continuum and the HCA network, and that's yielding gains for us. Obviously, our capital spending is enhancing our growth, we believe, and putting us in a very strong competitive position within the markets. And then finally, I think the competitive advantage that HCA has globally across these markets is that we have an incredible amount of best practice and solutions that we can export from one market to another and put that to use in a very timely go to market quickly kind of way. And that gives us advantage, we believe, on all these dimensions and globally allows us to grow our business."

If you look at the fourth quarter and you make one adjustment that Bill mentioned in his comments about the $68 million of Waiver revenue that was sort of misplaced from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. That's probably not the right term, forgive me, Bill. But that reduced our SWB to basically flat with the fourth quarter of last year. So I was very pleased with that. What we saw year-over-year -- and I'll speak to sequential in a moment because I think the sequential performance is most important here. But year-over-year, we had about 1% improvement in productivity. We had a slowdown in the rate of growth in contract labor. It did grow, but it was slower than what it had grown in the previous 9 months of the year. And so those are some year-over-year kind of metrics. But what was really impressive and what I was really pleased with our teams, and as I mentioned in the third quarter, we started to see this in September, but sequentially, we improved our productivity from third quarter to fourth quarter about 1.7%. Now in the previous 2 years, we had improved our productivity from the third quarter to the fourth quarter in low tenths, like 0.1% in 1 year, 0.3% in the other. So very significant movement by our teams to make some adjustments in our productivity. Contract labor did slow down, actually reduced by 1% from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. So that was encouraging. And as we mentioned in the third quarter call, we did see some stabilization, but we actually saw a bit of improvement sequentially in the fourth quarter as compared to the third. I mean, contract labor still remains an opportunity for the company. Nursing contract labor is somewhere between 8.5% and 9%. That's stabilized a little bit but nonetheless an opportunity. As we look at what the company has been able to accomplish, I went back and studied, 80% of the last 20 weeks, we've actually had a net gain in full-time RN positions across the company. And we've also dropped about 900 FTEs from orientation into supporting our patients. So I'm very pleased with the progress we're making in our hiring efforts. Our oneHR program is starting to get its sea legs, if you will, and really yield some benefit for the company. And as we finish our rollout in 2016, I'm eagerly awaiting improvements there. So as we think about wage rates for 2016, we are anticipating a little bit of acceleration but something that's very, very manageable, we believe, within our overall budget. And so that's sort of the story on our labor for the fourth quarter."

That dropped in the fourth quarter to just under 9%, 8.9% in the fourth quarter.

We did, as you mentioned, identify some processing issues in the third quarter of Medicaid applications in Texas and Kansas. We did see some improvements there. Didn't necessarily have a material effect on us in the quarter. Just as a reference that uninsured admission growth of 8.9% represent roughly 2,800 admissions. And then the third quarter, it was roughly 4,400 admissions. So sequentially, we saw some improvement in there. Going forward, I would anticipate that our uninsured volume growth will track our uninsured ED volume growth. And right now, I believe kind of absent any change catalyst, such as a new state expanding or some other macro trends, I'd anticipate our uninsured volume trends to settle out in the high single digits.

The short answer on the exchange volume is no, it's not big enough in the overall scheme of our volume to drive the company's composite case mix. With respect to case mix, again, I'll refer you back to my comments. I mean, the company is very intentional about trying to drive more complex, high-acuity type services to our facilities. Our strategy, our core strategy within our individual markets is to be able to offer somewhere in the HCA system all services to a patient. So for example, if we need to transplant, we want to have capabilities at one particular facility where we can offer those kind of things. So over the last 4 or 5 years, we've added a significant number of services to our facilities and to our markets that have increased our case mix and increased the overall acuity and built out the capabilities of our provider system. This past year, we opened up 3 new burn centers, as an example. We've opened up probably 10 to 12 new trauma centers. We've expanded our cardiovascular services where we have now 14 to 16 TAVR programs, which is a very sophisticated procedure for valve surgery. So those kind of developments are ongoing within the company as part of our core strategy to be able to provide all services, a comprehensive array of services, to our system and to any patient that hits the HCA network."

And in '13, we also jumped up but not nearly as much. This year, we jumped up from the third quarter to the fourth quarter on a per unit basis, but not nearly as much as the fourth quarter last year. So the comp was, I'll say, favorable, if you will, to some degree. We obviously have a very robust supply chain program. We did see some moderation, as Bill mentioned, in pharmaceutical cost. And I think that the net of all that yielded pretty much a supply cost metric about where we thought it was going to be inside of our own plan.

In the fourth quarter, when I look at uncompensated care, we saw sequential improvement versus the third quarter. And when I look at year-over-year, that year-over-year growth in uncompensated care is tracking our high single-digit uninsured volume growth there.

We bought a rural hospital that was contiguous to Orlando and Jacksonville. We were able to rechannel referrals out of that hospital into HCA system, pick up incremental market share. So these complementary acquisitions. On top of that, I think we acquired 5 ambulatory surgery centers this past year and added it to our network within a couple of major markets. So these things are very, very strategic and create more durability, more competitiveness and allow us to grow organically in very high-growth markets.

And I was wondering, as you saw in the third quarter the uptick in the bad debt, you talked about the Medicaid delays in processing, but a piece of it, I think, was exchange-related. And in the fourth quarter, these guys probably saw the deductibles run through. Did you have any idea of what their utilization patterns have been? And if they end up being delinquent between the fourth quarter and the first quarter, if your claims adjudication has already been able to identify that.

Then about $1 billion of our spend is what I would call routine kind of investments. So then you've got roughly $1 billion to $1.2 billion that's related to growth prospects, capacity constraints, new service line development, outpatient facilities and so forth. As I mentioned in my comments, the investments that we've been making are producing about 1,000 new beds over the course of 2016 and 2017. That's slightly up over the number of beds that we put into service in 2014 and '15 and slightly up over 2012 and 2013. We have a number of markets that are approaching capacity and they're very significant markets to HCA. And a lot of this capital is going specifically to these markets that are at a certain level of capacity: Inpatient capacity, outpatient capacity, primarily in our ERs or surgical capacity. And so it's very well diversified, both in service line capability and also within our markets. So it's being shared very broadly across the company. Again, we think this diversified approach to different kind of service allocations and market allocation creates a very conservative return profile for HCA. The more we can put it on an existing chassis where we have physicians, we have fixed cost, we have a reputation in the market, the easier it is to produce a return because we're able to leverage those existing capabilities. So that's our fundamental approach. We do have a few markets where we're adding new facilities like new hospitals, they're more low-startup hospitals that are very important to a geographical presence and also to network development, but those don't add a lot of volume but they do create new relationships. And over the long pull, we think they'll be very significant facilities to our markets."

And from that, we see opportunities, opportunities to invest, as Sam said, to expand services or to deal with capacity constraints that would otherwise exist. And it is a conservative investment strategy versus an acquisition for the reasons Sam just noted. And just I guess to back up that, our performance, you look back 2 years ago, our return on invested capital was 14.1%, and that's an incredibly, I think, incredible number to start with. But based on the 12 months ended December 2015, our return on invested capital is 15.4%. So as we're investing more capital in our existing markets, we're seeing our return grow. And so again, we like the strategy. That's why we expanded it to -- over the 3 years to $7.7 billion, up about $0.5 billion.

My thinking is for 2016 in particular, and I think that's a reasonable target for us. The thing about HCA is we compete in a very fragmented sort of environment where the same competitor doesn't really exist from one market to the other. So what we compete against in Miami is not necessarily the same system that we compete against in Dallas, nor is that the same system that we compete against in Salt Lake City or even San Jose. So that fragmentation allows us to, I think, have advantage in the market. And when we can deploy capital in a very unique way or effective way or create a service line capability or move some other initiative across to HCA's markets, we're able to do that maybe without our competitors being able to see it like we are able to see it because of our multi-market perspective.

Thank you, Vic, and good morning to everyone joining us on the call or webcast. This morning, we issued our quarterly earnings release for the fourth quarter of 2015.

This morning, we issued our quarterly earnings release for the fourth quarter of 2015. The release is consistent with the preview of the fourth quarter we issued earlier this month. And I'll make a few comments on the quarter and our strategy, and then I'll turn the call over to Bill and Sam to provide more detail on the quarter, health reform and 2016 expectations. 
We were extremely pleased with the result of the fourth quarter. Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter totaled $2.131 billion; and for the year, $7.915 billion. It was a record quarter, a record earnings quarter for HCA, and also a record earnings year. The fourth quarter performance was the result of solid volume growth, improved payer mix and service mix and effective cost management.
We believe the company is well positioned for continued success. There are many aspects of the company that contribute to our consistency of growth and financial performance. Our growth strategy built upon our investments in developing health systems in large, fast-growing urban markets has been delivering strong top line growth. 
To illustrate the consistency and effectiveness of our growth strategy, we have reported same facility admissions and adjusted admissions growth for 8 consecutive years, ER visit growth for 9 consecutive years and surgical growth for 7 consecutive quarters. We believe our strategies are well resourced, and we expect to see another year of volume growth in 2016.
The consistent execution of our growth strategy, consistent growth in adjusted EBITDA, which has grown from $5.9 billion in 2010 to $7.9 billion in 2015, has resulted in strong cash flows. Since our IPO in early 2011, we have maintained a well-balanced, shareholder-friendly approach to capital allocation. For example, since the IPO in 2011 through the fourth quarter of 2015, we have generated $20.1 billion of cash flows from operating activities. Over the same period, we invested $9.7 billion in our markets through capital expenditures or about 48% of cash generated. And we returned cash to shareholders, either in special dividends or by share repurchase, in the amount of $9.3 billion or about 46% of cash generated. The company had approximately $2.6 billion remaining under its $3 billion share repurchase authorization at year-end.
We generated $4.73 billion of cash flows from operating activities in 2015, up 6.4% over 2014. We continue to have a balanced approach to capital allocation in 2015, deploying approximately $2.4 billion in capital spending and approximately $2.4 billion in share repurchases. In 2015, we had repurchased approximately 32 million shares of our stock. 
Now in addition to our financial performance, I was pleased with our progress with respect to our clinical agenda. In 2015, 106 or 78% of our eligible hospitals were recognized as top performers by the Joint Commission compared to approximately 31% of hospitals nationwide. The Joint Commission's top performer status is the highest recognition for achieving excellence in evidence-based care processes for certain medical conditions. 
In 2016, we will continue to leverage clinical technology, especially in concepts of big data, data analytics and clinical informatics to deliver safe, high-quality and compassionate care for our patients. We will also continue our focus on global managed development of service lines directed at expanding our clinical depth and capabilities. We will remain committed to continuous improvement in the quality of care and service as we strategically position the company to deliver value for all of our stakeholders. 
I'll close my comments with my thoughts on our 2016 guidance that is included in our release this morning. With respect to adjusted EBITDA growth, our guidance yields a 3% growth rate at the low point of the range and just under 7% at the high end. Our guidance reflects continued solid volume growth, reasonable pricing and well-managed expense growth with a little less contribution from reforms in the past 2 years. We transition into 2016 with momentum, and we believe the company is well positioned to achieve its goals for 2016. 
Now let me turn the call over to Bill to provide additional detail on the quarter, health reform and 2016 guidance."

Thank you, Milton, and good morning, everyone. I will cover some additional information relating to the fourth quarter results and review of our 2016 guidance. Then I'll turn the call over to Sam for an update on our operations. As Milton comment",1482,"Great. Thank you, Milton, and good morning, everyone. I will cover some additional information relating to the fourth quarter results and review of our 2016 guidance. Then I'll turn the call over to Sam for an update on our operations. 
As Milton commented, we were extremely pleased with the quarter's results and the quarter finished a very strong 2015 for the company. Fourth quarter was coupled with a good payer mix and service mix and solid expense management, which combined to drive the quarter and the year's strong performance. 
During the quarter, adjusted EBITDA increased 8.9% to $2.131 billion from $1.956 billion last year. We reported an improvement of 50 basis points in adjusted EBITDA margin in the quarter to 20.8%. As a reminder, in  last year's fourth quarter, we recorded a $68 million increase to Medicaid revenues related to the Texas Medicaid Waiver Program, reversing the reduction we had made in the third quarter of last year. Adjusting for the impact of this item, as well as a decline of $27 million in EHR income and an increase of $24 million in share-based compensation, adjusted EBITDA grew 15.4% over the fourth quarter of last year. 
Now let me speak to volumes. In the fourth quarter, our same facility admissions increased 1.6% over the prior year and equivalent admissions increased 2.9%. Sam will provide more commentary on our volumes trends in a moment. 
During the fourth quarter, same facility Medicare admissions and equivalent admissions increased 0.6% and 1.8%, respectively. This included both traditional and Managed Medicare. Managed Medicare admissions increased 6.3% on a same facility basis and represent 32.8% of our total Medicare admissions. 
Same facility Medicaid admissions and equivalent admissions increased 3% and 4.8%, respectively, in the quarter, consistent with trends we experienced in the third quarter. 
Same facility self-pay and charity admission increased 8.6% in the quarter, representing 7.7% of our total admissions compared to 7.2% last year. 
Managed care and other, which includes exchange admissions, increased 0.6%, and equivalent admissions increased 1.9% on a same facility basis in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year. 
Same facility emergency room visits increased 3.6% in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year. And same facility self-pay and charity ER visits represented 19.6% of our total ER visits in the quarter, which is consistent with last year. 
Intensity of service or acuity continued to increase in the quarter, with our same facility case mix increasing 2.1% compared to the prior year period. 
Same facility surgical volumes increased 1.9% in the quarter, with same facility inpatient surgeries increasing 1.5% and outpatient surgeries increasing 2.2% from the prior year. 
Same facility revenue per equivalent admission increased 2.6% in the quarter. Same facility managed care and other, including exchange revenue per equivalent admission increased 5.6% in the quarter, generally consistent with our third quarter results. 
Same facility managed care and other, including exchange case mix, increased 2.4% compared to the prior year.
Same facility charity care and uninsured discounts increased $494 million in the quarter compared to the prior year. Same facility charity care discounts totaled $958 million in the quarter or an increase of $46 million from the prior year period, while same facility uninsured discounts totaled $2.873 billion, an increase of $448 million over the prior year period.
Now turning to expenses. Expense management in the quarter was good as we were able to leverage strong volumes and higher intensity of service. We also saw improvement from our Q3 expense levels as a result of various management actions we began last quarter. Same facility operating expense per equivalent admission increased 1.2% compared to the last year's fourth quarter, and sequentially, operating expense per equivalent admissions declined 0.3% from the third quarter of 2015. 
Salaries and benefits as a percentage of revenue increased 50 basis points to 44.9% compared to 44.4% in last year's fourth quarter. Sequentially, salaries and benefits as a percentage of revenue improved 200 basis points from the 46.9% we reported in Q3 of 2015. 
Same facility supply expense per equivalent admission declined 2.1% for the fourth quarter compared to the prior-year period and improved 80 basis points as a percentage of revenue from last year's fourth quarter, reflecting continued success on several supply chain initiatives. 
Our pharmacy cost trends moderated slightly in the quarter. Our total pharmacy cost was up approximately 9% in Q4 compared to the 13% increase we reported in Q3 of 2015. 
Other operating expenses improved 50 basis points from last year's fourth quarter to 18.0% of revenues. 
We recognized $1 million in electronic health record income in the quarter compared to $28 million last year, and this was consistent with our expectations. 
As previously mentioned, our adjusted EBITDA margins for the quarter increased 50 basis points over the prior year period. But adjusting for the $68 million Texas waiver item in '14 and the changes in EHR income and share-based compensation, adjusted EBITDA margin increased 150 basis points for the quarter over the prior-year period.
Let me briefly touch on health reform activity in the quarter. In the fourth quarter of 2015, we saw 11,238 same facility exchange admissions as compared to the 7,700 we saw in the fourth quarter of last year and comparable to the 11,445 exchange admissions we reported in the third quarter of 2015. We saw just under 38,000 same facility exchange ER visits in the fourth quarter compared to 25,600 in the fourth quarter of '14 and the 40,200 we reported in the third quarter of 2015. 
When we roll all the components of health reform that we can track, we currently estimate health reform contributed just under 6% of adjusted EBITDA for the full year of 2015, and that was in line with our expectations. So all in all, a strong quarter has finished a very strong year for the company.
Let me touch briefly on cash flow. Our cash flow remains very strong. In the fourth quarter, cash flow from operations was $1.558 billion compared with the $1.627 billion last year, just primarily a result of changes in working capital offsetting the increase in net income. For the full year of 2015, cash flow from operations was $4.734 billion, up from $4.448 billion last year. And free cash flow for 2015 was just over $1.864 billion. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately $2.179 billion available under our revolving credit facilities.
So now let me move into a discussion about our 2016 guidance. Highlighted in our earnings release this morning, we estimate our 2016 consolidated revenues should range from $41.5 billion to $42.5 billion. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be between $8.15 billion and $8.45 billion. Within our revenue estimates, we estimate equivalent admission growth to range between 2.5% and 4% for the year and revenue per equivalent admission growth to range between 2% to 3% for 2016. 
We anticipate our Medicare revenues per equivalent admission to reflect a composite growth rate of approximately 1% to 2%, factoring in market basket changes and ACA reductions as well as some anticipated intensity increases. Medicaid revenues per equivalent admission are estimated to be mostly flat year-over-year, excluding any changes in the Texas waiver revenues. And managed and commercial revenues per equivalent admission are estimated to grow between 4% and 5%. 
We expect a continued step-down of our EHR incentive income of about $40 million. EHR-related costs are no longer being considered incremental expenses, but do remain in the system to support EHR and other ongoing automation efforts. We also anticipate a growth in share-based compensation of approximately $40 million. So we anticipate operating expense per adjusted admission growth of approximately 2.5%.
Our guidance includes the estimated net impact of health reform. While we expect exchange volumes to continue to grow in the third year of health reform, isolating the net EBITDA impact of health reform from core operations is becoming more subjective and increasingly difficult. We will continue to report on exchange volumes which we can identify, but converting these variables to an EBITDA impact has increasing imprecision. We believe reform will continue to contribute to the growth of the company, and our reasonable estimate today is reform will contribute approximately 1% of growth for the company in 2016. 
Relative to other aspects of our guidance, we anticipate capital spending to increase to $2.7 billion in 2016, which is in line with our 3-year capital plan that we announced early in 2015. 
We estimate depreciation and amortization to be approximately $1.9 billion and interest expense to be approximately $1.75 billion. Our effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 38%. And lastly, our average diluted shares are projected to be approximately 404 million shares for the year, and earnings per diluted share guidance for 2016 is between $6 and $6.45. 
So that concludes my remarks, and I'll turn the call over to Sam for some additional comments."

As mentioned earlier, the fourth quarter was another solid quarter for volume growth across the company and capped off a very strong year of growth for HCA. Again, this quarter, we had broad-based growth across our divisions and we had broad",810,"Good morning. As mentioned earlier, the fourth quarter was another solid quarter for volume growth across the company and capped off a very strong year of growth for HCA. Again, this quarter, we had broad-based growth across our divisions and we had broad-based growth across the various service lines that make up our business. 
To put a finer point on the consistency Milton highlighted, HCA has now grown its admissions and emergency room visits on a same facility basis in 18 out of the last 20 quarters. This consistency is not only seen in these growth metrics but also in many other areas of our business. 
For the fourth quarter, the company had very low flu volumes, which reduced our growth in admission by approximately 0.7% and also reduced our growth in emergency room visits by almost 2%. 
10 of 14 divisions had growth in admissions and emergency room visits in the quarter. For the year, all divisions had growth in both of these categories. 13 of 14 divisions had growth in adjusted admissions for the quarter. For the year, all divisions had growth in adjusted admissions. And within the divisions, 86% of all HCA domestic hospitals had growth in adjusted admissions. This broad-based performance reflects HCA's strong and diversified portfolio of networks in 42 domestic markets, most of which, we believe, still have good growth prospects. 
In addition to the strong portfolio performance, the company's growth across its diversified facilities and service lines was equally strong. On a same facility basis, inpatient surgeries grew by 1.5% in the quarter and 2.1% for the year. Surgical admits grew by 80 basis points to 28.4% of total admits in the quarter. And for the year, surgical admits were slightly up over the prior year at 27.5%. 
Outpatient surgeries grew by 2.2% in the quarter and 1.6% for the year. Both components of this service line, hospital-based and our freestanding Ambulatory Surgery Center division, showed solid growth. 
Behavioral health admissions grew by 7.9% in the quarter and 8.4% for the year. Rehab admissions grew by 6.4% in the quarter and 8.5% for the year. Deliveries were the only volume metric down for the quarter. It was down 1.8%. However, managed care deliveries were actually up. For the year, deliveries were up 0.8%. 
Average length of stay increased 1.1% in the quarter and 1.3% for the year. These increases are mostly a result of the company's growth agenda, which includes developing a more comprehensive and complex level of services across our provider networks. For example, trauma volumes across our growing network of trauma centers were up 27% for the year and cardiovascular surgery volumes were up over 6% for the year, which is a result of adding deeper, more complex capabilities to our existing programs. 
And finally, the company has been investing aggressively to expand its urgent care centers. These centers improve convenience for our patients and increase access to our networks. This past year, we had over 1 million urgent care visits, a 500% increase. Our urgent care centers, coupled with the 3.3% growth in the number of physicians who have joined our medical staff, are making it easier for our patients to use an HCA network and improving our overall outreach efforts. 
As we move into 2016, we think HCA is well positioned to succeed. We believe macros for our markets are still positive, and we believe the company is heading into the year with momentum. Demand growth in our market is strong. We estimate it at approximately 2% per year, driven primarily by population growth and positive economic trends. The pricing environment is stable, and we have good visibility into our contracts. The company is contracted for 85% of its commercial revenue in 2016, over 50% for 2017 and around 20% for 2018 at pricing terms that are consistent with the past few years. 
Market share is at an all-time high, and opportunities still exist to increase it as we execute our growth agenda and increase our capital spending. Over the next 2 years, we will add close to 1,000 inpatient beds and 400 ER beds to address capacity constraint and growth opportunities. 
The competitive landscape in HCA's markets is mostly unchanged. Complementary in-market acquisitions are available, especially in the outpatient areas. We have next-generation growth opportunities for many facilities within our portfolio. This past year, 80% of our hospitals had earnings growth. And lastly, we have a solid handle on cost trends, which we believe should be manageable in 2016. 
In summary, we believe the company has the right strategy and the right approach to the market for sustained growth. We believe the company is resourcing its growth agenda appropriately, and we are improving our ability to execute even better by investing in systems and specialization across the company. 
With that, let me turn the call back to Vic."

And those markets are yielding, on a composite basis across the company, approximately 2% increase in demand growth just coming from population growth as well as aging baby boomers, increasing employment and so forth. On top of that, the company has achieved anywhere between 25 to 40 basis points of market share gains over the past few years. And as we look forward, we see those basic components being similar to what I just laid out. And so next year's guidance includes about 2% to 2.5% demand growth at this particular point with our estimates and then roughly 25 to 30 basis points of market share gains. Our approach to gaining market share is clearly built around being the provider system of choice for our patients and for our physicians, and that involves 4 or 5 major dimensions that we invest in very, very aggressively, we monitor very, very closely. And those are centered around: Do we have the right network of outpatient facilities; and ease of access, if you will, into HCA's facilities; building out comprehensive service lines, I mentioned that in my comments; and then working with our physicians very, very effectively to enable them to do what they need to do for our patients. And we do that with one other dimension that we're investing in even more, and that's coordinating care across the HCA continuum and the HCA network, and that's yielding gains for us. Obviously, our capital spending is enhancing our growth, we believe, and putting us in a very strong competitive position within the markets. And then finally, I think the competitive advantage that HCA has globally across these markets is that we have an incredible amount of best practice and solutions that we can export from one market to another and put that to use in a very timely go-to-market quickly kind of way. And that gives us advantage, we believe, on all these dimensions and globally allows us to grow our business."

If you look at the fourth quarter and you make one adjustment that Bill mentioned in his comments about the $68 million of waiver revenue that was sort of misplaced in the third quarter to fourth quarter, that's probably not the right term, forgive",451,"Okay. If you look at the fourth quarter and you make one adjustment that Bill mentioned in his comments about the $68 million of waiver revenue that was sort of misplaced in the third quarter to fourth quarter, that's probably not the right term, forgive me, Bill, but that reduced our SWB to basically flat with the fourth quarter of last year. So I was very pleased with that. What we saw year-over-year -- and I'll speak to sequential in a moment because I think the sequential performance is most important here. But year-over-year, we had about 1% improvement in productivity. We had a slowdown in the rate of growth in contract labor. It did grow, but it was slower than what it had grown in the previous 9 months of the year. And so those are some year-over-year kind of metrics. But what was really impressive and what I was really pleased with our teams, and as I mentioned in the third quarter, we started to see this in September, but sequentially, we improved our productivity from third quarter to fourth quarter about 1.7%. Now in the previous 2 years, we had improved our productivity from the third quarter to the fourth quarter in low tenths, like 0.1% in one year, 0.3% in the other. So very significant movement by our teams to make some adjustments in our productivity. Contract labor did slow down, actually reduced by 1% from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. So that was encouraging. And as we mentioned in the third quarter call, we did see some stabilization, but we actually saw a bit of improvement sequentially in the fourth quarter as compared to the third. I mean, contract labor still remains an opportunity for the company. Nursing contract labor is somewhere between 8.5% and 9%. That's stabilized a little bit but nonetheless an opportunity. As we look at what the company has been able to accomplish, I went back and studied 80% of the last 20 weeks, we've actually had a net gain in full-time RN positions across the company. And we've also dropped about 900 FTEs from orientation into supporting our patients. So I'm very pleased with the progress we're making in our hiring efforts. Our oneHR program is starting to get its sea legs, if you will, and really yield some benefit for the company. And as we finish our rollout in 2016, I'm eagerly awaiting improvements there. So as we think about wage rates for 2016, we are anticipating a little bit of acceleration but something that's very, very manageable, we believe, within our overall budget. And so that's sort of the story on our labor for the fourth quarter."

That dropped in the fourth quarter to just under 9%, 8.9% in the fourth quarter. As we mentioned in our calls in the past, there have been some noise when we do year-over-year comparisons mainly because of the first year of health reform and Medicaid conversions. We did, as you mentioned, identify some processing issues in the third quarter of Medicaid applications in Texas and Kansas. We did see some improvements there. Didn't necessarily have a material effect on us in the quarter. Just as a reference, uninsured admission growth of 8.9% represent roughly 2,800 admissions. And then the third quarter, it was roughly 4,400 admissions. So sequentially, we saw some improvement in there. Going forward, I would anticipate that our uninsured volume growth will track our uninsured ED volume growth. And right now, I believe, kind of absent any change catalyst such as a new state expanding or some other macro trends, I'd anticipate our uninsured volume trends to settle out in the high single digits.

So for example, if we need to transplant, we want to have capabilities at one particular facility where we can offer those kind of things. So over the last 4 or 5 years, we've added a significant number of services to our facilities and to our markets that have increased our case mix and increased the overall acuity and built out the capabilities of our provider system. This past year, we opened up 3 new burn centers, as an example. We've opened up probably 10 to 12 new trauma centers. We've expanded our cardiovascular services where we have now 14 to 16 TAVR programs, which is a very sophisticated procedure for valve surgery.

And in '13, we also jumped up but not nearly as much. This year, we jumped up from the third quarter to the fourth quarter on a per unit basis, but not nearly as much as the fourth quarter last year. So the comp was, I'll say, favorable, if you will, to some degree. We obviously have a very robust supply chain program. We did see some moderation, as Bill mentioned, in pharmaceutical cost. And I think that the net of all that yielded pretty much a supply cost metric about where we thought it was going to be inside of our own plan.

When you look at uncompensated care, anticipate that to grow, as a percentage of our gross revenue, consistent with what our uninsured growth is. In the fourth quarter, when I look at uncompensated care, we saw sequential improvement versus the third quarter. And when I look at year-over-year, that year-over-year growth in uncompensated care is tracking our high single-digit uninsured volume growth there.

So these complementary acquisitions. On top of that, I think we acquired 5 ambulatory surgery centers this past year and added it to our network within a couple of major markets.

It was 400 admissions for HCA in the third quarter. It was roughly the same in the fourth. That's on 460,000 admissions for the company. So yes, there is some activity in that area. But for HCA, it's immaterial for us, and it's contained within the overall aspect of our bad debt trends that I've talked about previously."

Then about $1 billion of our spend is what I would call routine kind of investments. So then you've got roughly $1 billion to $1.2 billion that's related to growth prospects, capacity constraints, new service line development, outpatient facilities and so forth. As I mentioned in my comments, the investments that we've been making are producing about 1,000 new beds over the course of 2016 and 2017. That's slightly up over the number of beds that we put into service in 2014 and '15 and slightly up over 2012 and 2013. We have a number of markets that are approaching capacity, and they're very significant markets to HCA. And a lot of this capital is going specifically to these markets that are at a certain level of capacity: inpatient capacity, outpatient capacity, primarily in our ERs or surgical capacity. And so it's very well diversified, both in service line capability and also within our markets. So it's being shared very broadly across the company. Again, we think this diversified approach to different kind of service allocations and market allocation creates a very conservative return profile for HCA. The more we can put it on an existing chassis where we have physicians, we have fixed costs, we have a reputation in the market, the easier it is to produce a return because we're able to leverage those existing capabilities. So that's our fundamental approach. We do have a few markets where we're adding new facilities like new hospitals. They're more low-startup hospitals that are very important to our geographical presence and also to network development, but those don't add a lot of volume but they do create new relationships. And over the long pull, we think they'll be very significant facilities to our markets."

And from that, we see opportunities, opportunities to invest, as Sam said, to expand services or to deal with capacity constraints that would otherwise exist. And it is a conservative investment strategy versus an acquisition for the reasons Sam just noted. And just I guess to back up that, our performance, you look back 2 years ago, our return on invested capital was 14.1%, and that's an incredibly -- I think incredible number to start with. But based on the 12 months ended December 2015, our return on invested capital is 15.4%. So as we're investing more capital in our existing markets, we're seeing our return grow. And so again, we like the strategy. That's why we expanded it to -- over the 3 years to $7.7 billion, up about $0.5 billion.

My thinking is, for 2016 in particular, I think that's a reasonable target for us. The thing about HCA is we compete in a very fragmented sort of environment where the same competitor doesn't really exist from one market to the other. So what we compete against in Miami is not necessarily the same system that we compete against in Dallas, nor is that the same system that we compete against in Salt Lake City or even San Jose. So that fragmentation allows us to, I think, have advantage in the market. And when we can deploy capital at a very unique way or effective way or create a service line capability or move some other initiative across to HCA's markets, we're able to do that maybe without our competitors being able to see it like we are able to see it because of our multi-market perspective. So from a market share standpoint, I think that's a pretty good metric for the company as far as the type of growth that we're thinking about. And I don't see any reason why that's not doable for the company in the near term."

Thank you, Vic, and good morning to everyone joining us on the call or webcast. This morning, we issued our quarterly earnings release for the fourth quarter of 2015.

This morning, we issued our quarterly earnings release for the fourth quarter of 2015. The release is consistent with the preview of the fourth quarter we issued earlier this month. And I'll make a few comments on the quarter and our strategy, and then I'll turn the call over to Bill and Sam to provide more detail on the quarter, health reform and 2016 expectations. 
We were extremely pleased with the result of the fourth quarter. Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter totaled $2.131 billion; and for the year, $7.915 billion. It was a record quarter, a record earnings quarter for HCA, and also a record earnings year. The fourth quarter performance was the result of solid volume growth, improved payer mix and service mix and effective cost management.
We believe the company is well positioned for continued success. There are many aspects of the company that contribute to our consistency of growth and financial performance. Our growth strategy built upon our investments in developing health systems in large, fast-growing urban markets has been delivering strong top line growth. 
To illustrate the consistency and effectiveness of our growth strategy, we have reported same facility admissions and adjusted admissions growth for 8 consecutive years, ER visit growth for 9 consecutive years and surgical growth for 7 consecutive quarters. We believe our strategies are well resourced, and we expect to see another year of volume growth in 2016.
The consistent execution of our growth strategy, consistent growth in adjusted EBITDA, which has grown from $5.9 billion in 2010 to $7.9 billion in 2015, has resulted in strong cash flows. Since our IPO in early 2011, we have maintained a well-balanced, shareholder-friendly approach to capital allocation. For example, since the IPO in 2011 through the fourth quarter of 2015, we have generated $20.1 billion of cash flows from operating activities. Over the same period, we invested $9.7 billion in our markets through capital expenditures or about 48% of cash generated. And we returned cash to shareholders, either in special dividends or by share repurchase, in the amount of $9.3 billion or about 46% of cash generated. The company had approximately $2.6 billion remaining under its $3 billion share repurchase authorization at year-end.
We generated $4.73 billion of cash flows from operating activities in 2015, up 6.4% over 2014. We continue to have a balanced approach to capital allocation in 2015, deploying approximately $2.4 billion in capital spending and approximately $2.4 billion in share repurchases. In 2015, we had repurchased approximately 32 million shares of our stock. 
Now in addition to our financial performance, I was pleased with our progress with respect to our clinical agenda. In 2015, 106 or 78% of our eligible hospitals were recognized as top performers by the Joint Commission compared to approximately 31% of hospitals nationwide. The Joint Commission's top performer status is the highest recognition for achieving excellence in evidence-based care processes for certain medical conditions. 
In 2016, we will continue to leverage clinical technology, especially in concepts of big data, data analytics and clinical informatics to deliver safe, high-quality and compassionate care for our patients. We will also continue our focus on global managed development of service lines directed at expanding our clinical depth and capabilities. We will remain committed to continuous improvement in the quality of care and service as we strategically position the company to deliver value for all of our stakeholders. 
I'll close my comments with my thoughts on our 2016 guidance that is included in our release this morning. With respect to adjusted EBITDA growth, our guidance yields a 3% growth rate at the low point of the range and just under 7% at the high end. Our guidance reflects continued solid volume growth, reasonable pricing and well-managed expense growth with a little less contribution from reforms in the past 2 years. We transition into 2016 with momentum, and we believe the company is well positioned to achieve its goals for 2016. 
Now let me turn the call over to Bill to provide additional detail on the quarter, health reform and 2016 guidance."

Thank you, Milton, and good morning, everyone. I will cover some additional information relating to the fourth quarter results and review of our 2016 guidance.

I will cover some additional information relating to the fourth quarter results and review of our 2016 guidance. Then I'll turn the call over to Sam for an update on our operations. 
As Milton commented, we were extremely pleased with the quarter's results and the quarter finished a very strong 2015 for the company. Fourth quarter was coupled with a good payer mix and service mix and solid expense management, which combined to drive the quarter and the year's strong performance. 
During the quarter, adjusted EBITDA increased 8.9% to $2.131 billion from $1.956 billion last year. We reported an improvement of 50 basis points in adjusted EBITDA margin in the quarter to 20.8%. As a reminder, in  last year's fourth quarter, we recorded a $68 million increase to Medicaid revenues related to the Texas Medicaid Waiver Program, reversing the reduction we had made in the third quarter of last year. Adjusting for the impact of this item, as well as a decline of $27 million in EHR income and an increase of $24 million in share-based compensation, adjusted EBITDA grew 15.4% over the fourth quarter of last year. 
Now let me speak to volumes. In the fourth quarter, our same facility admissions increased 1.6% over the prior year and equivalent admissions increased 2.9%. Sam will provide more commentary on our volumes trends in a moment. 
During the fourth quarter, same facility Medicare admissions and equivalent admissions increased 0.6% and 1.8%, respectively. This included both traditional and Managed Medicare. Managed Medicare admissions increased 6.3% on a same facility basis and represent 32.8% of our total Medicare admissions. 
Same facility Medicaid admissions and equivalent admissions increased 3% and 4.8%, respectively, in the quarter, consistent with trends we experienced in the third quarter. 
Same facility self-pay and charity admission increased 8.6% in the quarter, representing 7.7% of our total admissions compared to 7.2% last year. 
Managed care and other, which includes exchange admissions, increased 0.6%, and equivalent admissions increased 1.9% on a same facility basis in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year. 
Same facility emergency room visits increased 3.6% in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year. And same facility self-pay and charity ER visits represented 19.6% of our total ER visits in the quarter, which is consistent with last year. 
Intensity of service or acuity continued to increase in the quarter, with our same facility case mix increasing 2.1% compared to the prior year period. 
Same facility surgical volumes increased 1.9% in the quarter, with same facility inpatient surgeries increasing 1.5% and outpatient surgeries increasing 2.2% from the prior year. 
Same facility revenue per equivalent admission increased 2.6% in the quarter. Same facility managed care and other, including exchange revenue per equivalent admission increased 5.6% in the quarter, generally consistent with our third quarter results. 
Same facility managed care and other, including exchange case mix, increased 2.4% compared to the prior year.
Same facility charity care and uninsured discounts increased $494 million in the quarter compared to the prior year. Same facility charity care discounts totaled $958 million in the quarter or an increase of $46 million from the prior year period, while same facility uninsured discounts totaled $2.873 billion, an increase of $448 million over the prior year period.
Now turning to expenses. Expense management in the quarter was good as we were able to leverage strong volumes and higher intensity of service. We also saw improvement from our Q3 expense levels as a result of various management actions we began last quarter. Same facility operating expense per equivalent admission increased 1.2% compared to the last year's fourth quarter, and sequentially, operating expense per equivalent admissions declined 0.3% from the third quarter of 2015. 
Salaries and benefits as a percentage of revenue increased 50 basis points to 44.9% compared to 44.4% in last year's fourth quarter. Sequentially, salaries and benefits as a percentage of revenue improved 200 basis points from the 46.9% we reported in Q3 of 2015. 
Same facility supply expense per equivalent admission declined 2.1% for the fourth quarter compared to the prior-year period and improved 80 basis points as a percentage of revenue from last year's fourth quarter, reflecting continued success on several supply chain initiatives. 
Our pharmacy cost trends moderated slightly in the quarter. Our total pharmacy cost was up approximately 9% in Q4 compared to the 13% increase we reported in Q3 of 2015. 
Other operating expenses improved 50 basis points from last year's fourth quarter to 18.0% of revenues. 
We recognized $1 million in electronic health record income in the quarter compared to $28 million last year, and this was consistent with our expectations. 
As previously mentioned, our adjusted EBITDA margins for the quarter increased 50 basis points over the prior year period. But adjusting for the $68 million Texas waiver item in '14 and the changes in EHR income and share-based compensation, adjusted EBITDA margin increased 150 basis points for the quarter over the prior-year period.
Let me briefly touch on health reform activity in the quarter. In the fourth quarter of 2015, we saw 11,238 same facility exchange admissions as compared to the 7,700 we saw in the fourth quarter of last year and comparable to the 11,445 exchange admissions we reported in the third quarter of 2015. We saw just under 38,000 same facility exchange ER visits in the fourth quarter compared to 25,600 in the fourth quarter of '14 and the 40,200 we reported in the third quarter of 2015. 
When we roll all the components of health reform that we can track, we currently estimate health reform contributed just under 6% of adjusted EBITDA for the full year of 2015, and that was in line with our expectations. So all in all, a strong quarter has finished a very strong year for the company.
Let me touch briefly on cash flow. Our cash flow remains very strong. In the fourth quarter, cash flow from operations was $1.558 billion compared with the $1.627 billion last year, just primarily a result of changes in working capital offsetting the increase in net income. For the full year of 2015, cash flow from operations was $4.734 billion, up from $4.448 billion last year. And free cash flow for 2015 was just over $1.864 billion. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately $2.179 billion available under our revolving credit facilities.
So now let me move into a discussion about our 2016 guidance. Highlighted in our earnings release this morning, we estimate our 2016 consolidated revenues should range from $41.5 billion to $42.5 billion. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be between $8.15 billion and $8.45 billion. Within our revenue estimates, we estimate equivalent admission growth to range between 2.5% and 4% for the year and revenue per equivalent admission growth to range between 2% to 3% for 2016. 
We anticipate our Medicare revenues per equivalent admission to reflect a composite growth rate of approximately 1% to 2%, factoring in market basket changes and ACA reductions as well as some anticipated intensity increases. Medicaid revenues per equivalent admission are estimated to be mostly flat year-over-year, excluding any changes in the Texas waiver revenues. And managed and commercial revenues per equivalent admission are estimated to grow between 4% and 5%. 
We expect a continued step-down of our EHR incentive income of about $40 million. EHR-related costs are no longer being considered incremental expenses, but do remain in the system to support EHR and other ongoing automation efforts. We also anticipate a growth in share-based compensation of approximately $40 million. So we anticipate operating expense per adjusted admission growth of approximately 2.5%.
Our guidance includes the estimated net impact of health reform. While we expect exchange volumes to continue to grow in the third year of health reform, isolating the net EBITDA impact of health reform from core operations is becoming more subjective and increasingly difficult. We will continue to report on exchange volumes which we can identify, but converting these variables to an EBITDA impact has increasing imprecision. We believe reform will continue to contribute to the growth of the company, and our reasonable estimate today is reform will contribute approximately 1% of growth for the company in 2016. 
Relative to other aspects of our guidance, we anticipate capital spending to increase to $2.7 billion in 2016, which is in line with our 3-year capital plan that we announced early in 2015. 
We estimate depreciation and amortization to be approximately $1.9 billion and interest expense to be approximately $1.75 billion. Our effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 38%. And lastly, our average diluted shares are projected to be approximately 404 million shares for the year, and earnings per diluted share guidance for 2016 is between $6 and $6.45. 
So that concludes my remarks, and I'll turn the call over to Sam for some additional comments."
261825,322783529,959699,"HCA Holdings, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 28, 2016",2016-01-28,"Earnings Calls","HCA Healthcare, Inc.","Executives","Good morning. As mentioned earlier, the fourth quarter was another solid quarter for volume growth across the company and capped off a very strong year of growth for HCA. Again, this quarter, we had broad-based growth across our divisions and we had broad",810,"Good morning. As mentioned earlier, the fourth quarter was another solid quarter for volume growth across the company and capped off a very strong year of growth for HCA. Again, this quarter, we had broad-based growth across our divisions and we had broad-based growth across the various service lines that make up our business. 
To put a finer point on the consistency Milton highlighted, HCA has now grown its admissions and emergency room visits on a same facility basis in 18 out of the last 20 quarters. This consistency is not only seen in these growth metrics but also in many other areas of our business. 
For the fourth quarter, the company had very low flu volumes, which reduced our growth in admission by approximately 0.7% and also reduced our growth in emergency room visits by almost 2%. 
10 of 14 divisions had growth in admissions and emergency room visits in the quarter. For the year, all divisions had growth in both of these categories. 13 of 14 divisions had growth in adjusted admissions for the quarter. For the year, all divisions had growth in adjusted admissions. And within the divisions, 86% of all HCA domestic hospitals had growth in adjusted admissions. This broad-based performance reflects HCA's strong and diversified portfolio of networks in 42 domestic markets, most of which, we believe, still have good growth prospects. 
In addition to the strong portfolio performance, the company's growth across its diversified facilities and service lines was equally strong. On a same facility basis, inpatient surgeries grew by 1.5% in the quarter and 2.1% for the year. Surgical admits grew by 80 basis points to 28.4% of total admits in the quarter. And for the year, surgical admits were slightly up over the prior year at 27.5%. 
Outpatient surgeries grew by 2.2% in the quarter and 1.6% for the year. Both components of this service line, hospital-based and our freestanding Ambulatory Surgery Center division, showed solid growth. 
Behavioral health admissions grew by 7.9% in the quarter and 8.4% for the year. Rehab admissions grew by 6.4% in the quarter and 8.5% for the year. Deliveries were the only volume metric down for the quarter. It was down 1.8%. However, managed care deliveries were actually up. For the year, deliveries were up 0.8%. 
Average length of stay increased 1.1% in the quarter and 1.3% for the year. These increases are mostly a result of the company's growth agenda, which includes developing a more comprehensive and complex level of services across our provider networks. For example, trauma volumes across our growing network of trauma centers were up 27% for the year and cardiovascular surgery volumes were up over 6% for the year, which is a result of adding deeper, more complex capabilities to our existing programs. 
And finally, the company has been investing aggressively to expand its urgent care centers. These centers improve convenience for our patients and increase access to our networks. This past year, we had over 1 million urgent care visits, a 500% increase. Our urgent care centers, coupled with the 3.3% growth in the number of physicians who have joined our medical staff, are making it easier for our patients to use an HCA network and improving our overall outreach efforts. 
As we move into 2016, we think HCA is well positioned to succeed. We believe macros for our markets are still positive, and we believe the company is heading into the year with momentum. Demand growth in our market is strong. We estimate it at approximately 2% per year, driven primarily by population growth and positive economic trends. The pricing environment is stable, and we have good visibility into our contracts. The company is contracted for 85% of its commercial revenue in 2016, over 50% for 2017 and around 20% for 2018 at pricing terms that are consistent with the past few years. 
Market share is at an all-time high, and opportunities still exist to increase it as we execute our growth agenda and increase our capital spending. Over the next 2 years, we will add close to 1,000 inpatient beds and 400 ER beds to address capacity constraint and growth opportunities. 
The competitive landscape in HCA's markets is mostly unchanged. Complementary in-market acquisitions are available, especially in the outpatient areas. We have next-generation growth opportunities for many facilities within our portfolio. This past year, 80% of our hospitals had earnings growth. And lastly, we have a solid handle on cost trends, which we believe should be manageable in 2016. 
In summary, we believe the company has the right strategy and the right approach to the market for sustained growth. We believe the company is resourcing its growth agenda appropriately, and we are improving our ability to execute even better by investing in systems and specialization across the company. 
With that, let me turn the call back to Vic."

And those markets are yielding, on a composite basis across the company, approximately 2% increase in demand growth just coming from population growth as well as aging baby boomers, increasing employment and so forth. On top of that, the company has achieved anywhere between 25 to 40 basis points of market share gains over the past few years. And as we look forward, we see those basic components being similar to what I just laid out. And so next year's guidance includes about 2% to 2.5% demand growth at this particular point with our estimates and then roughly 25 to 30 basis points of market share gains. Our approach to gaining market share is clearly built around being the provider system of choice for our patients and for our physicians, and that involves 4 or 5 major dimensions that we invest in very, very aggressively, we monitor very, very closely. And those are centered around: Do we have the right network of outpatient facilities; and ease of access, if you will, into HCA's facilities; building out comprehensive service lines, I mentioned that in my comments; and then working with our physicians very, very effectively to enable them to do what they need to do for our patients. And we do that with one other dimension that we're investing in even more, and that's coordinating care across the HCA continuum and the HCA network, and that's yielding gains for us. Obviously, our capital spending is enhancing our growth, we believe, and putting us in a very strong competitive position within the markets. And then finally, I think the competitive advantage that HCA has globally across these markets is that we have an incredible amount of best practice and solutions that we can export from one market to another and put that to use in a very timely go-to-market quickly kind of way. And that gives us advantage, we believe, on all these dimensions and globally allows us to grow our business."

If you look at the fourth quarter and you make one adjustment that Bill mentioned in his comments about the $68 million of waiver revenue that was sort of misplaced in the third quarter to fourth quarter, that's probably not the right term, forgive",451,"Okay. If you look at the fourth quarter and you make one adjustment that Bill mentioned in his comments about the $68 million of waiver revenue that was sort of misplaced in the third quarter to fourth quarter, that's probably not the right term, forgive me, Bill, but that reduced our SWB to basically flat with the fourth quarter of last year. So I was very pleased with that. What we saw year-over-year -- and I'll speak to sequential in a moment because I think the sequential performance is most important here. But year-over-year, we had about 1% improvement in productivity. We had a slowdown in the rate of growth in contract labor. It did grow, but it was slower than what it had grown in the previous 9 months of the year. And so those are some year-over-year kind of metrics. But what was really impressive and what I was really pleased with our teams, and as I mentioned in the third quarter, we started to see this in September, but sequentially, we improved our productivity from third quarter to fourth quarter about 1.7%. Now in the previous 2 years, we had improved our productivity from the third quarter to the fourth quarter in low tenths, like 0.1% in one year, 0.3% in the other. So very significant movement by our teams to make some adjustments in our productivity. Contract labor did slow down, actually reduced by 1% from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. So that was encouraging. And as we mentioned in the third quarter call, we did see some stabilization, but we actually saw a bit of improvement sequentially in the fourth quarter as compared to the third. I mean, contract labor still remains an opportunity for the company. Nursing contract labor is somewhere between 8.5% and 9%. That's stabilized a little bit but nonetheless an opportunity. As we look at what the company has been able to accomplish, I went back and studied 80% of the last 20 weeks, we've actually had a net gain in full-time RN positions across the company. And we've also dropped about 900 FTEs from orientation into supporting our patients. So I'm very pleased with the progress we're making in our hiring efforts. Our oneHR program is starting to get its sea legs, if you will, and really yield some benefit for the company. And as we finish our rollout in 2016, I'm eagerly awaiting improvements there. So as we think about wage rates for 2016, we are anticipating a little bit of acceleration but something that's very, very manageable, we believe, within our overall budget. And so that's sort of the story on our labor for the fourth quarter."

So you're right, our uninsured admissions we called out in the third quarter. Recall, we saw over a 13% growth in uninsured admissions in the third quarter. That dropped in the fourth quarter to just under 9%, 8.9% in the fourth quarter. As we mentioned in our calls in the past, there have been some noise when we do year-over-year comparisons mainly because of the first year of health reform and Medicaid conversions. We did, as you mentioned, identify some processing issues in the third quarter of Medicaid applications in Texas and Kansas. We did see some improvements there. Didn't necessarily have a material effect on us in the quarter. Just as a reference, uninsured admission growth of 8.9% represent roughly 2,800 admissions. And then the third quarter, it was roughly 4,400 admissions. So sequentially, we saw some improvement in there. Going forward, I would anticipate that our uninsured volume growth will track our uninsured ED volume growth. And right now, I believe, kind of absent any change catalyst such as a new state expanding or some other macro trends, I'd anticipate our uninsured volume trends to settle out in the high single digits.

So for example, if we need to transplant, we want to have capabilities at one particular facility where we can offer those kind of things. So over the last 4 or 5 years, we've added a significant number of services to our facilities and to our markets that have increased our case mix and increased the overall acuity and built out the capabilities of our provider system. This past year, we opened up 3 new burn centers, as an example. We've opened up probably 10 to 12 new trauma centers. We've expanded our cardiovascular services where we have now 14 to 16 TAVR programs, which is a very sophisticated procedure for valve surgery.

As Milton said in our comments earlier, the midpoint of our guidance represents, on an as reported, about a 5% growth over our 2015 levels. When you adjust for the HITECH and share-based comp, the midpoint is roughly 6%, which is one of the higher levels that we've guided going forward. Yes, in the low end, that would change it from 3% to 4%, but it gets us in that range of kind of 4% to 6% when you factor those items. Again, Milton mentioned in his comments in response to an earlier question. So I think that from a guidance perspective compared to historically where we've guided, we feel very comfortable with where we stand right now."

And in '13, we also jumped up but not nearly as much. This year, we jumped up from the third quarter to the fourth quarter on a per unit basis, but not nearly as much as the fourth quarter last year. So the comp was, I'll say, favorable, if you will, to some degree. We obviously have a very robust supply chain program. We did see some moderation, as Bill mentioned, in pharmaceutical cost. And I think that the net of all that yielded pretty much a supply cost metric about where we thought it was going to be inside of our own plan.

As it relates to our networks, we do generate downstream referrals from our urgent care centers to both our physicians who are connected to HCA system as well as our emergency room and then on into the inpatient activity. The volume of downstream referrals is not nearly as large as our freestanding emergency room, which produce a larger downstream flow to our hospitals.

And that's why we give the charity and uninsured discount numbers in my commentary. When you look at uncompensated care, anticipate that to grow, as a percentage of our gross revenue, consistent with what our uninsured growth is. In the fourth quarter, when I look at uncompensated care, we saw sequential improvement versus the third quarter. And when I look at year-over-year, that year-over-year growth in uncompensated care is tracking our high single-digit uninsured volume growth there. So you are subject to some fluctuations in the bad debt line alone as we adjust our uninsured discount percentage. And so you look at uncompensated care in total.

So these complementary acquisitions. On top of that, I think we acquired 5 ambulatory surgery centers this past year and added it to our network within a couple of major markets.

And a lot of this capital is going specifically to these markets that are at a certain level of capacity: inpatient capacity, outpatient capacity, primarily in our ERs or surgical capacity. And so it's very well diversified, both in service line capability and also within our markets. So it's being shared very broadly across the company. Again, we think this diversified approach to different kind of service allocations and market allocation creates a very conservative return profile for HCA. The more we can put it on an existing chassis where we have physicians, we have fixed costs, we have a reputation in the market, the easier it is to produce a return because we're able to leverage those existing capabilities. So that's our fundamental approach. We do have a few markets where we're adding new facilities like new hospitals. They're more low-startup hospitals that are very important to our geographical presence and also to network development, but those don't add a lot of volume but they do create new relationships. And over the long pull, we think they'll be very significant facilities to our markets."

And Sam and I, along with our group presidents, of course, spend time out in the field within our hospitals. And from that, we see opportunities, opportunities to invest, as Sam said, to expand services or to deal with capacity constraints that would otherwise exist. And it is a conservative investment strategy versus an acquisition for the reasons Sam just noted. And just I guess to back up that, our performance, you look back 2 years ago, our return on invested capital was 14.1%, and that's an incredibly -- I think incredible number to start with. But based on the 12 months ended December 2015, our return on invested capital is 15.4%. So as we're investing more capital in our existing markets, we're seeing our return grow. And so again, we like the strategy. That's why we expanded it to -- over the 3 years to $7.7 billion, up about $0.5 billion. And again, it gives us confidence with our guidance to see these opportunities in these fast-growing, large markets."

My thinking is, for 2016 in particular, I think that's a reasonable target for us. The thing about HCA is we compete in a very fragmented sort of environment where the same competitor doesn't really exist from one market to the other. So what we compete against in Miami is not necessarily the same system that we compete against in Dallas, nor is that the same system that we compete against in Salt Lake City or even San Jose. So that fragmentation allows us to, I think, have advantage in the market. And when we can deploy capital at a very unique way or effective way or create a service line capability or move some other initiative across to HCA's markets, we're able to do that maybe without our competitors being able to see it like we are able to see it because of our multi-market perspective. So from a market share standpoint, I think that's a pretty good metric for the company as far as the type of growth that we're thinking about. And I don't see any reason why that's not doable for the company in the near term."

I'll take a few comments or make a few comments on the quarter and then I'll turn the call over to Bill and Sam to provide more details of the quarter's results. 
We are pleased with the results of the first quarter, which are in line with our internal expectations. Adjusted EBITDA of $2.003 billion for the first quarter increased 2.1% over the prior year. As expected, the first quarter of this year was a difficult comparison to the first quarter of 2015 when adjusted EBITDA grew 19.3% over the first quarter of 2014. 
Net income attributable to HCA Holdings, Inc. Increased 17.3% and earnings per share increased 24.3% for the quarter. As noted in our release this morning, net income, EPS and cash flows from operations were favorably impacted by accounting change we adopted related to share-based compensation, which lowered our tax rate for the quarter. 
Our 2016 guidance remains unchanged except for adjusted EPS, which has been increased by $0.20 per diluted share on both the low and the high end of the range. This is to reflect the tax benefit reported during the first quarter of 2016 related to the accounting change made in this first quarter. 
We have not attempted to estimate the impacts of this accounting change on future quarters of 2016 as the tax benefit depends upon the number of equity awards settled each period and the market value of our stock at the time we sell them. 
We continue to experience solid growth in inpatient and outpatient volumes as well as surgical and emerging [indiscernible]. We believe these results speak to the quality of our markets through the execution of our strategic agenda. Same facility admissions increased 1.6% while same facility improvement admissions increased 3.1%. Our growth drivers include capital improvements, urban matter developments within our service lines, end market access point development and strategic acquisitions. 
This year, we plan to invest $2.7 billion to expand our service capabilities and capacity in our markets. In 2016, approximately 350 new inpatient beds and 100 new ER beds will come online. With another 550 inpatient beds and 200 ER beds scheduled for completion in 2017, we continue to see solid growth from our investment in services aligned about the such as trauma, teleology and emergency services. Our strategy to expand our access points in our market including the height inpatient and outpatient services. The effective execution of our growth agenda is yielding market share gains, and Sam will provide additional details in a moment. 
With respect to supply expense, we continue to see solid execution of our initiatives to manage our [indiscernible]. We are pleased with the early results of the integration of Unit Health Care into the ultra purchasing group. Clearly, one of the highlights of the quarter is the strong growth in cash flows and operations, up 37.4% over last year's first quarter. The quarter reflects our balanced approach to capital allocation. 
During the quarter, we generated almost $1.4 billion in cash flows from operations and we deployed $509 million of capital expenditures and $621 million to repurchase 8.921 million share of our stock. And we had 1.983 billion remaining on our 3 billion share repurchase authorization at the end of the quarter. 
Finally, let me recognize Don, HCA's Senior Vice President, Controller, who retired at the end of April. We thank Don for his 17 years of service and his many contributions he's made to our company. I'd also like to welcome Chris Wyatt, who has succeeded Don as Senior Vice President and Controller. Chris most recently served as Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of HCA's Information Technology and Services Organization. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill."

As Milton indicated, we had a solid quarter that was driven good volume growth and our adjusted EBITDA results were in line with our expectations. Let me give you some more detail on our performance and the results for the quarter. 
As we reported, in the first quarter, our same facility admissions increased 1.6% over the prior year and same facility equivalent admissions increased 3.1%. Sam will provide more color on the drivers of this volume in a moment, but I'll give you some trend by peer class. 
During the first quarter, same facility Medicare admissions and equivalent admissions increased 0.8% and 2.1%, respectively. This includes both traditional and managed Medicare. Managed Medicare admissions increased 3.1% on a same facility basis and now represent 33% of our total Medicare admissions. Same facility Medicaid admissions and equivalent admissions increased 1.4% and 4.3%, respectively, in the quarter, in line with our reason trends. Same facility self-pay and charity admissions increased 10.6% in the quarter while equivalent admissions increased 9.4%. This represents 6.9% of our total admissions compared to 6.3% last year. 
There are a couple of points on our earnings shared volume I'd like to call out. First, our uninsured same facility admissions in our expansion states were flat year-over-year while our nonexpansion states grew just over 11%. Texas and Florida represent about 70% of our total uninsured admissions and represent 90% of the year-over-year growth. 
And to put this uninsured growth into perspective, the 10.6% growth we saw in the quarter equates to just over 3,000 admissions for the quarter compared to the 477,000 same facility admissions we have for the quarter. 
Managed care and other, which includes exchange admissions, increased 1.5% and equivalent admission increased 2.7% on a same facility basis in the first quarter compared to the prior year. Same facility emergency room visits increased 6.9% in the quarter compared to the prior year. Same facility self-paying charity ER visits represent 18.6% of our total ER business in the first quarter for about 2016 and 2015. 
Intensity of service or acuity increased in the quarter with same facility chase mix increasing 2.7% compared in the prior year period. Same facility surgeries increased 3.3% in the quarter with inpatient surgeries increasing 1.4% and outpatient surgeries increasing 4.4% from the prior year. Same facility revenue per equivalent admission increased 2.2% in the quarter. 
Our outpatient revenues in the first quarter continued to show very strong growth. Outpatient revenues in the quarter represented 38.9% of total revenues, up 120 basis points in prior year's first quarter. Same facility managed care and other revenue per equivalent admission increased 5.9% in the quarter. Same facility charity care and uninsured discounts increased $618 million in the quarter compared to the prior year. Same facility charity care discounts totaled $951 million in the quarter, an increase of $63 million from the prior year period, while same facility uninsured discounts totaled $3.076 billion, an increase of $555 million over the prior year periods. Now turning to expenses. 
Same facility operating expense per equivalent admission increased 2.8% compared to last year's first quarter. On a consolidated basis, salaries and benefits, as a percentage of revenue, was 45.8% compared with 45.5% in last year's first quarter and 45.7% from the full year of 2013. 
Salaries per equivalent admission increased 2.8% in the quarter on a same facility basis. Productivity, as measured by same facility main hours per adjusted admission, improved 0.5% and the same facility wage rates increased 2.5% in the quarter. Supply expense, as a percent of revenues, were 16.7% this quarter as compared to 16.9% in last year's first quarter on a consolidated basis. 
Same facility supply expense per equivalent admission increased 1.4% for the first quarter compared to the prior year period, reflecting continued success on several supply chain admissions. Other operating expenses increased 40 basis points from last year's first quarter to 18.1% of revenues and was consistent with the 18% we ran in Q4 of 2015 and 18.2% in Q3 of 2015. We recognize $4 million of electronic health record income in the quarter compared to $19 million last year consistent with our expectations. 
Let me briefly touch on cash flow. Note to mention, we had another extremely strong quarter with cash flow from operations just under $1.4 billion, about a $380 million improvement. Cash flow from operations were benefited by $74 million into the adoption of new accounting standards that I will discuss in a minute. 
Free cash flow increased $339 million or $4449 million in Q1 of '15 to $779 million in Q1 of 2016. At the end of the quarter, we had $2.9 billion available under our revolving credit facilities and debt-to-adjusted EBITDA was 3.84x at March 31, 2016 compared to 3.85x at the end of 2015. We touched briefly on health reform. 
Health reform activity continued to grow in the quarter. In the first quarter, we saw approximately 12,500 same facility exchange admissions as compared to the 9,860 we saw in the first quarter of last year or about a 27% increase. You may recall, we saw about 11,200 same facility exchange admissions in the fourth quarter of 2015, an 11% increase sequentially quarter-to-quarter. 
We believe this is largely due to the Midland room. For perspective, exchange admissions represent about 2.6% of total admissions for the company. We saw approximately 50,000 same facility exchange ER visits in the first quarter compared to the approximate 37,000 in first quarter of '15 and 38,000 in the fourth quarter of '15. 
Overall, our exchange and reform activity is in line with our expectations. Lastly, as mentioned in the release, the company did elect to early adopt a new accounting standard SAU 2016-09, which was issued in late March. The standard simplifies certain aspect of accounting per share-based payment transactions. 
In summary, the standard requires the excess tax benefits related to equity award settlements will be recorded as component to the provision for income taxes prospectively versus previously these amounts were recorded directly to [indiscernible]. 
In the quarter, we recorded a $74 million tax benefit or $0.18 per diluted share related to this adoption. Also, these tax benefits amounts were previously percent as cash flow from financing activities that are now affected us cash flow from operating activities. 
So that concludes my remarks. And I'll turn the call over to Sam for some additional comments."

As mentioned earlier, the first quarter was another solid quarter of volume growth for the company. The company continued to show broad-based growth across all markets and broad-based growth across the various service lines that make up our",614,"Good morning. As mentioned earlier, the first quarter was another solid quarter of volume growth for the company. The company continued to show broad-based growth across all markets and broad-based growth across the various service lines that make up our business. There were a number of factors that impacted our inpatient admissions and outpatient volumes this quarter. 
First, flow admissions were down by 40%, which affected our overall inpatient admission growth rate by 0.6%. And then, secondly, leap year positively affected our inpatient admissions by approximately 1%, but this calendar effect was partially offset by the Easter holiday, which were in March this year. 
We believe the net impact of all these factors had an immaterial effect on overall volumes. For our domestic operations, on a same facility basis, 11 of 14 divisions had growth in admissions, 14 of 14 divisions had growth in adjusted admission and 13 of 14 divisions had growth in emergency room business. The company had a total of 56 freestanding emergency rooms at the end of March. We had 44 last year at this time. Freestanding emergency room visits grew 31% and accounted for approximately 1/3 of our overall growth in visits. 
Hospital-based emergency room visits grew 5%. This broad-based performance reflects HCA's strong and diversified portfolio of provider networks in 42 domestic markets, most of which we believe still have good growth prospects. 
In addition to the strong portfolio performance, the company's growth across the diversified facility base and service line was equally strong. For domestic operation, on a same facility basis, inpatient surgeries grew by 1.8%, which increased surgical admits to 27.6% of total admits in the quarter, an increase of 100 basis points. 
Surgical volumes were particularly strong in cardiovascular, orthopedic and general surgery categories. Outpatient surgeries grew by 4.6%. Both components of this service line, hospital-based and our freestanding ambulatory division had equally strong growth. Also, same facility outpatient endoscopic in pain procedures grew by 1.6%. 
The company continues strategically to add freestanding ambulatory endoscopic and pain centers to its provider networks. As compared to the first quarter of last year, we have acquired or developed 9 new centers and closed or sold 4 for a net of 5 more, bringing our total to 131 centers. Including these new centers, the company's total outpatient surgery volumes grew 6.3% and outpatient endoscopic and pain procedures were up 6.7%. 
The real health admissions grew 2.7%. Rehab admissions grew 2.8%. Deliveries were flat in the quarter. However, managed delivery were up 4.4%. Neonatal admissions grew 4.7%. But our length of stay declined because of less acuity this quarter, which impacted our patient day growth in this service line. 
Overall, average length of stay increased 0.5%, which was driven mainly by the growth in our acuity or case mix index. We believe our efforts in developing a more comprehensive and complex level of services across our provider networks are driving this increase. Other volumes statistics for the quarter are as follows: Cardiology procedure volumes grew approximately 5%; trauma volumes grew 27%; observation business were up 13%; and finally, the company's urgent care business in total grew 22%. 
The company had 68 urgent care centers at the end of March this year, up from 50 last year. The inpatient market share data for the 12 months ended September 2015 shows that HCA continue to gain share and our composite share of 24.6%. So that is highest level in the past 5 years. We believe our comprehensive growth agenda, which is both well resourced and well-executed, provides further opportunities for the company to increase market share and drive revenue growth. 
With that, let me turn the call back over to Vic."

As we've said, I believe the uninsured volume will be driven by our emergency room volume. Our emergency room uninsured ED visits were up to 26,000 compared to our 3,000 or so uninsured growth. You see that's a 12% of net rate, which is pretty consistent with what we've historically seen. And then, as I mentioned in my comments, it's driven by Florida and Texas. Obviously, 2 nonexpansion states that we continue to see. So I had anticipated our uninsured trends to kind of settle out there on the that high single-digit level. I think it'll be really selling where our ED visits land. The EBITDA impact is really marginal as we've talked. The EBITDA impact is the marginal cost that we have for that. So I don't think that really contributed materially to the EBITDA issues for the quarter for the company."

And we call it our or our altars initiatives where we are very sensitive to position issues, patient issues, scheduling issues and so forth. We've been very aggressive with our equipment investment. And that has application across both the inpatient and outpatient. On the inpatient side, the inpatient surgeries tend to be more connected to our approach in driving more complex care, trauma care, burn care, deeper capabilities in orthopedics and neuro sciences. And so those are a little slower moving, I would say, in general. Although our inpatient surgery growth has been very steady over the last 3.5 years, where we've seen pretty consistent growth. I'm counting on the quarters as I look here, almost 11 straight quarters of inpatient surgical growth across HCA. On the outpatient side, we, again, are seeing demand growth in outpatient surgery. And we try to create 2 venues for patients and physicians to operate. 1 being freestanding ambulatory surgery centers where, again, we've added to our portfolio over the past few years and we have efforts to grow those particular centers. And then within our hospitals, when we had physicians who like to do inpatient cases, they also tend to want to do their outpatient cases on the same days. And so we're trying to accommodate them as well. But in total, our outpatient surgery have grown very consistently over the same 12, 13 quarters with a little bit of acceleration in this first quarter. And I can't really point to why it accelerated in the first quarter as compared to the trend. But our efforts are broad-based. We have a number of initiatives, including capital investments, that are intended to drive surgical activity across the 3 areas of our business: Inpatient, ambulatory surgery and then hospital-based outpatient."

Now in the first quarter, we have to pay more payroll taxes, more unemployment insurance and so forth. So our total spend was up about $122 million because of benefit cost, natural growth that occurs first quarter compared to the fourth quarter. Compared to last year, we did have a slight margin erosion. 2 factors drove that. Share-based comp being a piece of that and then a moderated growth in contract labor being the other piece. Contract labor for the company has run the same amount of dollars over the last 3 quarters now. So the first quarter did not see any growth in total spend compared to the fourth quarter, which was consistent with the third quarter. So we've seen some stabilization. We believe that our efforts around this particular area presents an opportunity for HCA in the future. If we can stand some of the nursing turnover that we have experienced and improved our retention efforts, and we have a number of initiatives to deal with that, we think we can drive some incremental improvements over time in this particular area. So all in all, the productivity and the results from the labor standpoint for HCA in the quarter, for well-managed, we believe, when you look at it come fourth quarter. With respect to the balance issue in Florida. We're not thinking that's going to great a lot of issues for us one way or the other. We believe for our patients, it's going to be beneficial and that it will eliminate, in many instances, potential surprise billings around certain hospital based physician providers. But for us and our approach to the market and our relationships with our physician contract companies, we're not anticipating any kind of impact from the balance billing legislation in Florida."

One of them is what we refer to as a pharmacy consolidation initiative that we have going on throughout the markets and HCA where we consolidate the pharmacy supply chain, as well as the pharmacy distribution chain and embed pharmacist in there to work with our clinicians on the floor to ensure that the prescriptions and the pharmacy utilization is optimized on there. In addition, it helps us with the procurement of pharmacy and looking at the surgeon inventory on there. So it's just one more initiative that we have going on. They're embedded in our operating rooms to help us manage our inventory supply chain within the operating rooms, as well as many other distribution efforts.

In some instances, we have struggled with psychiatrist in the supplier physician coverage. And that's be more the barrier to growth that natural capacity.

We did see a little bit of a trend change last year were actually trended down a bit in the first quarter. But in general, when I look back over 3, 4 years, it stayed about the same. And that's what we saw this year. The fourth quarter and the first quarter were almost identical. But when you look at it compared to the first quarter of last year, the execution of our service line initiatives, primarily trauma and then secondarily, graduate medical education is driving professional fee expense growth for the company. We saw some deterioration in margin primarily because of professional fee expense. And there were 3 things of that drove that. First, we did an acquisition of a physician network in Northern California last year where most of the cost of that particular acquisition are in other expenses, and that drove a piece of the margin erosion. The second piece and probably the more important piece and more connected to the company, strategy, is around trauma program development, where we have to invest in professional fee's to support our trauma programs. And again, we've added significant amount of trauma probably somewhere in their early stage start-up modes. So you see a little bit of a disproportion and load of other operating expenses as a result. And then the third piece was in our graduate medical education programs, where we have added graduate medical education program for residents and so forth at a number of our facilities, which require some level of professional fees for faculties ad such so that we can support those programs. All in all, we think there will be some growth in these numbers over the remaining portion of the year but not in any way their changes our trend and our expectation on the margin levels that bill laid out. If you look at some of our components, like our ER physician, call for ER visit or ER call pay per ER visit, those are generally aligned with what we expected, slightly up again because of these program changes. So that's the biggest driver of our other expenses on a year-over-year, but very consistent, like Bill said, with the fourth quarter and even the third quarter. So the run rate is really not that materially changed."

I think next year, at this time, we will probably be somewhere between, -- depending on how quickly we get these up, 10 to 12 more as well. So our pipeline on development of these freestanding emergency rooms is it's still fairly strong. We should be somewhere around 70, I think, in the next 12 to 18 months. The acuity level tends to be a bit lower than what you see in a hospital-based emergency room for a couple of reasons. One, obviously, trauma cases aren't going to a freestanding emergency room. Certain paying events are not going to freestanding emergency rooms lower stroke events. So we you have a natural tendency for the more acute patients, which are delivered by ambulance to go to a hospital be case because it's highly likely that they will be admitted. I think the freestanding emergency room places a very important part in our network development. It plays a very important part in our outreach to consumers to make it easy for them to access the system. I don't know that the ER, as a venue, if you will, is changing in any significant way. I do believe, though, that urgent care in emergency rooms over the past 3 to 5 years, and I think this will be the case going forward, is still a substitute for the shortages of primary care physicians that exist in a lot of markets. And so you see urgent care, freestanding emergency rooms and even hospital based emergency rooms providing the solution that patients are looking for when they can't get into physician clinic because of physician shortages or because of payer dynamics. So from that standpoint, that probably structurally stays in place. And we think it's part -- and part of the reason for the overall demand growth that we've seen over the past few years in emergency room visit volume and we think that will continue in the near term."

This morning, we issued our first quarter 2016 earnings release, highlighting the financial operational performance of the company. I'll take a few comments or make a few comments on the quarter, and then I'll turn the call over to Bill and Sam to provide more details on the quarter's results.
We are pleased with the results of the first quarter, which are in line with our internal expectations. Adjusted EBITDA of $2.003 billion for the first quarter increased 2.1% over the prior year. As expected, the first quarter of this year was a difficult comparison to the first quarter of 2015 when adjusted EBITDA grew 19.3% over the first quarter of 2014.
Net income attributable to HCA Holdings, Inc. Increased 17.3% and earnings per share increased 24.3% for the quarter. As noted in our release this morning, net income, EPS and cash flows from operations were favorably impacted by an accounting change we adopted related to share-based compensation, which lowered our tax rate for the quarter.
Our 2016 guidance remains unchanged except for adjusted EPS, which has been increased by $0.20 per diluted share on both the low and the high end of the range. This is to reflect the tax benefit reported during the first quarter of 2016 related to the accounting change made in this first quarter.
We have not attempted to estimate the impacts of this accounting change on future quarters of 2016 as the tax benefit depends upon the number of equity awards settled each period and the market value of our stock at the time we sell them.
We continue to experience solid growth in inpatient and outpatient volumes as well as surgical and emergency room visits. We believe these results speak to the quality of our markets and the execution of our strategic agenda. Same facility admissions increased 1.6% while same facility equivalent admissions increased 3.1%. Our growth drivers include capital improvements, programmatic developments within our service lines, end market access point development and strategic acquisitions.
This year, we plan to invest $2.7 billion to expand our service capabilities and capacity in our markets. In 2016, approximately 350 new inpatient beds and 100 new ER beds will come online. With another 550 inpatient beds and 200 ER beds scheduled for completion in 2017, we continue to see solid growth from our investments in the service line development such as trauma, cardiology and medical [ph] services. Our strategy to expand our access points in our market [indiscernible] inpatient and outpatient services. The effective execution of our growth agenda is yielding market share gains, and Sam will provide additional details in a moment.
With respect to supply expense, we continue to see solid execution of our initiatives to manage our supply costs. [ph] We are pleased with the early results of our integration of Tenet Healthcare into HealthTrust Purchasing Group. And clearly, one of the highlights of the quarter is the strong growth in cash flows and operations, up 37.4% over last year's first quarter. The quarter reflects our balanced approach to capital allocation.
During the quarter, we generated almost $1.4 billion in cash flows from operation and we deployed $509 million of capital expenditures and $621 million to repurchase 8.921 million share of our stock. And we had 1.983 billion remaining on our 3 billion share repurchase authorization at the end of the quarter.
Finally, let me recognize Don Stinnett, HCA's Senior Vice President and Controller, who retired at the end of April. We thank Don for his 17 years of service and his many contributions he's made to our company. I'd also like to welcome Chris Wyatt, who has succeeded Don as Senior Vice President and Controller. Chris most recently served as Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of HCA's Information Technology & Services organization.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill."

As Milton indicated, we had a solid quarter that was driven by good volume growth, and our adjusted EBITDA results were in line with our expectations. Let me give you some more detail on our performance and the results for the quarter.
As we reported, in the first quarter, our same facility admissions increased 1.6% over the prior year, and same facility equivalent admissions increased 3.1%. Sam will provide more color on the drivers of this volume in a moment, but I'll give you some trends by payer class.
During the first quarter, same facility Medicare admissions and equivalent admissions increased 0.8% and 2.1%, respectively. This includes both traditional and managed Medicare. Managed Medicare admissions increased 3.1% on a same facility basis and now represent 33% of our total Medicare admissions.
Same facility Medicaid admissions and equivalent admissions increased 1.4% and 4.3%, respectively, in the quarter, in line with our recent trends. Same facility self-pay and charity admissions increased 10.6% in the quarter while equivalent admissions increased 9.4%. This represents 6.9% of our total admissions compared to 6.3% last year.
There are a couple of points on our uninsured volume I'd like to call out. First, our uninsured same facility admissions in our expansion states were flat year-over-year while our nonexpansion states grew just over 11%. Texas and Florida represent about 70% of our total uninsured admissions and represent 90% of the year-over-year growth.
And to put this uninsured growth into perspective, the 10.6% growth we saw in the quarter equates to just over 3,000 admissions for the company compared to the 477,000 same facility admissions we have for the quarter.
Managed care and other, which includes exchange admissions, increased 1.5% and equivalent admission increased 2.7% on a same facility basis in the first quarter compared to the prior year. Same facility emergency room visits increased 6.9% in the quarter compared to the prior year. Same facility self-paying charity ER visits represent 18.6% of our total ER visits in the first quarter for both 2016 and 2015.
Intensity of service or acuity increased in the quarter with our same facility case mix increasing 2.7% compared in the prior year period. Same facility surgeries increased 3.3% in the quarter with inpatient surgeries increasing 1.4% and outpatient surgeries increasing 4.4% from the prior year. Same facility revenue per equivalent admission increased 2.2% in the quarter.
Our outpatient revenues in the first quarter continue to show very strong growth. Outpatient revenues in the quarter represented 38.9% of total revenues, up 120 basis points in prior year's first quarter. Same facility managed care and other revenue per equivalent admission increased 5.9% in the quarter.
Same facility charity care and uninsured discounts increased $618 million in the quarter compared to the prior year. Same facility charity care discounts totaled $951 million in the quarter, an increase of $63 million from the prior year period, while same facility uninsured discounts totaled $3.076 billion, an increase of $555 million over the prior year period.
Now turning to expenses. Same facility operating expense per equivalent admission increased 2.8% compared to last year's first quarter. On a consolidated basis, salaries and benefits as a percentage of revenue was 45.8% compared to 45.5% in last year's first quarter and 45.7% from the full year of 2013.
Salaries per equivalent admission increased 2.8% in the quarter on a same facility basis. Productivity, as measured by same facility man-hours per adjusted admission, improved 0.5% and same facility wage rates increased 2.5% in the quarter. Supply expense as a percent of revenues were 16.7% this quarter as compared to 16.9% in last year's first quarter on a consolidated basis.
Same facility supply expense per equivalent admission increased 1.4% for the first quarter compared to the prior year period, reflecting continued success on several supply chain admissions. Other operating expenses increased 40 basis points from last year's first quarter to 18.1% of revenues and was consistent with the 18% we ran in Q4 of 2015 and 18.2% in Q3 of 2015. We recognize $4 million of electronic health record income in the quarter compared to $19 million last year, consistent with our expectations.
Let me briefly touch on cash flow. As Milton mentioned, we had another extremely strong quarter with cash flow from operations just under $1.4 billion, about a $380 million improvement. Cash flow from operations was benefited by $74 million due to the adoption of new accounting standard that I will discuss in a minute.
Free cash flow increased $339 million from $440 million in Q1 of '15 to $779 million in Q1 of 2016. At the end of the quarter, we had $2.9 billion available under our revolving credit facilities, and debt-to-adjusted EBITDA was 3.84x at March 31, 2016, compared to 3.85x at the end of 2015.
We touch briefly on health reform. Health reform activity continued to grow in the quarter. In the first quarter, we saw approximately 12,500 same facility exchange admissions as compared to the 9,860 we saw in the first quarter of last year or about a 27% increase. You may recall, we saw about 11,200 same facility exchange admissions in the fourth quarter of 2015 or an 11% increase sequentially quarter-to-quarter. We believe this is largely due to the new enrollment.
For perspective, exchange admissions represent about 2.6% of total admissions for the company. We saw approximately 50,000 same facility exchange ER visits in the first quarter compared to the approximate 37,000 in first quarter of '15 and 38,000 in the fourth quarter of '15.
Overall, our exchange and reform activity is in line with our expectations. Lastly, as mentioned in the release, the company did elect to early adopt a new accounting standard FASB ASU 2016-09, which was issued in late March. The standard simplifies certain aspects of accounting for share-based payment transactions. In summary, the standard requires the excess tax benefits related to equity award settlements will be recorded as component to the provision for income taxes prospectively versus previously, these amounts were recorded directly to equity.
In the quarter, we recorded a $74 million tax benefit or $0.18 per diluted share related to this adoption. Also, these tax benefits amounts were previously presented as cash flow from financing activities that are now reflected as cash flows from operating activities.
So that concludes my remarks. And I'll turn the call over to Sam for some additional comments."

As mentioned earlier, the first quarter was another solid quarter of volume growth for the company. The company continue to show broad-based growth across our market and broad-based growth across the various service lines that make up our bu",614,"Good morning. As mentioned earlier, the first quarter was another solid quarter of volume growth for the company. The company continue to show broad-based growth across our market and broad-based growth across the various service lines that make up our business. There were a number of factors that impacted our inpatient admissions and outpatient volumes this quarter.
First, flu admissions were down by 40%, which affected our overall inpatient admission growth rate by 0.6%. And then, secondly, leap year positively affected our inpatient admissions by approximately 1%, but this calendar effect was partially offset by the Easter holiday, which were in March this year.
We believe the net impact of all these factors had an immaterial effect on overall volumes. For our domestic operations, on a same facility basis, 11 of 14 divisions had growth in admissions, 14 of 14 divisions had growth in adjusted admission and 13 of 14 divisions had growth in emergency room visits. The company had a total of 56 freestanding emergency rooms at the end of March. We had 44 last year at this time. Freestanding emergency room visits grew 31% and accounted for approximately 1/3 of our overall growth in visits. Hospital-based emergency room visits grew 5%. This broad-based performance reflects HCA's strong and diversified portfolio of provider networks in 42 domestic markets, most of which we believe still have good growth prospects. 
In addition to the strong portfolio performance, the company's growth across the diversified facility base and service line was equally strong. For domestic operations, on a same facility basis, inpatient surgeries grew by 1.8%, which increased surgical admits to 27.6% of total admit in the quarter, an increase of 100 basis points.
Surgical volumes were particularly strong in cardiovascular, orthopedic and general surgery categories. Outpatient surgeries grew by 4.6%. Both components of this service line, hospital-based and our freestanding ambulatory division had equally strong growth. Also, same facility outpatient endoscopic and pain procedures grew by 1.6%.
The company continues strategically to add freestanding ambulatory endoscopic and pain centers to its provider networks. As compared to the first quarter of last year, we have acquired or developed 9 new centers and closed or sold 4 for a net of 5 more, bringing our total to 131 centers. Including these new centers, the company's total outpatient surgery volumes grew 6.3% and outpatient endoscopic and pain procedures were up 6.7%.
Behavioral health admissions grew 2.7%. Rehab admissions grew 2.8%. Deliveries were flat in the quarter. However, managed deliveries were up 4.4%. Neonatal admissions grew 4.7%. But our length of stay declined because of less acuity this quarter, which impacted our patient day growth in this service line.
Overall, average length of stay increased 0.5%, which was driven mainly by the growth in our acuity or case mix index. We believe our efforts in developing a more comprehensive and complex level of services across our provider networks are driving this increase.
Other volume statistics for the quarter are as follows: Cardiology procedure volumes grew approximately 5%, trauma volumes grew 27%, observation visits were up 13% and finally, the company's urgent care business in total grew 22%. The company had 68 urgent care centers at the end of March this year, up from 50 last year.
The inpatient market share data for the 12 months ended September 2015 shows that HCA continued to gain share and our composite share of 24.6%. So that is the highest level in the past 5 years. We believe our comprehensive growth agenda, which is both well resourced and well executed, provides further opportunities for the company to increase market share and drive revenue growth.
With that, let me turn the call back to Vic."

And so while I hate to ask the question, I have to ask the question because I know it's on the minds of many. So the fundamental question is how worried should we be about the increment that we see in your bad debt ratio in this quarter? That's #1. Number two, can you give us an estimate of the impact of the treatment of these patients on the EBITDA performance and whether that might be a reflection of a difference between this year's in-line performance versus last year's strong outperformance? And third, can you give us a sense of whether or not or whether or not that increase that you experienced was anticipated by you or whether you're gaining market share and adding ERs may have led to a slightly higher-than-anticipated increase in uninsured services?"

When I look at the bad debts, and as you know, for HCA, I think we have to look at the total uncompensated care picture, which includes charity, as well as the uninsured discounts. When I look at our total uncompensated care trends, those trends are pretty consistent with our recent experience. When I look at it as a percent of adjusted revenue, it was 32% for the quarter, 32.6% in the first quarter, 33% is a little high in the third, 30.7% in the first and 29.6% in the first. So our trends are pretty consistent. And I would tell you, we're pretty much in line with what we had internally projected.
As we've said, I believe the uninsured volume will be driven by our emergency room volume. Our emergency room uninsured ED visits were up 26,000 compared to our 3,000 or so uninsured growth. You see that's 12% of net rate, which is pretty consistent with what we've historically seen. And then, as I mentioned in my comments, it's driven by Florida and Texas, obviously, 2 nonexpansion states that we continue to see. So I had anticipated our uninsured trends to kind of settle out around that high single-digit level. I think we'll be really settling where our ED visits land. And the EBITDA impact is really marginal as we've talked. It's -- the EBITDA impact is the marginal cost that we have for that. So I don't think that really contributed materially to the EBITDA issues for the quarter for the company."

We're about 70% contracted in 2017 and about 45% contracted for 2018.

We've been very aggressive with our equipment investment. And that has application across both the inpatient and outpatient. On the inpatient side, the inpatient surgeries tend to be more connected to our approach in driving more complex care, trauma care, burn care, deeper capabilities in orthopedics and neuro sciences. And so those are a little slower moving, I would say, in general. Although our inpatient surgery growth has been very steady over the last 3.5 years, where we've seen pretty consistent growth, I'm counting up the quarters as I look here, almost 11 straight quarters of inpatient surgical growth across HCA. On the outpatient side, we, again, are seeing demand growth in outpatient surgery. And we try to create 2 venues for patients and physicians to operate, one being freestanding ambulatory surgery centers where, again, we've added to our portfolio over the past few years and we have efforts to grow those particular centers. And then within our hospitals, when we have physicians who like to do inpatient cases, they also tend to want to do their outpatient cases on the same days. And so we're trying to accommodate them as well. But in total, our outpatient surgeries have grown very consistently over the same 12, 13 quarters with a little bit of acceleration in this first quarter. And I can't really point to why it accelerated in the first quarter as compared to the trend, but our efforts are broad-based. We have a number of initiatives, including capital investments, that are intended to drive surgical activity across the 3 areas of our business: Inpatient, ambulatory surgery and then hospital-based outpatient."

Now in the first quarter, we have to pay more payroll taxes, more unemployment insurance and so forth. So our total spend was up about $122 million because of benefit cost, natural growth that occurs first quarter compared to the fourth quarter. Compared to last year, we did have a slight margin erosion. 2 factors drove that, share-based comp being a piece of that and then a moderated growth in contract labor being the other piece. Contract labor for the company has run the same amount of dollars over the last 3 quarters now. So the first quarter did not see any growth in total spend compared to the fourth quarter, which was consistent with the third quarter. So we've seen some stabilization. We believe that our efforts around this particular area presents an opportunity for HCA in the future. If we can stem some of the nursing turnover that we have experienced and improve our retention efforts, and we have a number of initiatives to deal with that, we think we can drive some incremental improvements over time in this particular area. So all in all, the productivity and the results from a labor standpoint for HCA in the quarter were well managed, we believe, when you look at it compared to where we were in the fourth quarter. With respect to the balance billing issue in Florida, we're not thinking that's going to create a lot of issues for us one way or the other. We believe, for our patients, it's going to be beneficial and it will eliminate, in many instances, potential surprise billings around certain hospital-based physician providers. But for us and our approach to the market and our relationships with our physician contract companies, we're not anticipating any kind of impact from the balance billing legislation in Florida."

And we have some recent initiatives there that we still become very encouraged with. One of them is what we refer to as a pharmacy consolidation initiative that we have going on throughout the markets and HCA where we consolidate the pharmacy supply chain as well as the pharmacy distribution chain and embed pharmacists in there to work with our clinicians on the floor to ensure that the prescriptions and the pharmacy utilization is optimized on there. In addition, it helps us with the procurement of pharmacy and looking at the storage and inventory on there. So it's just one more initiative that we have going on. They're embedded in our operating rooms to help us manage our inventory supply chain within the operating rooms as well as many other distribution efforts.

We continue to invest in behavioral health capacity. And we have a lot of demand for that. We've recently approved some expansion of behavioral health capabilities in a number of markets to deal with that. In some instances, we have struggled with psychiatrists in the supply of physician coverage, and that's been more the barrier to growth that actual capacity. So behavioral health continues to be a very important component and service line for our market strategy as well as a complement to our emergency room service line strategy. On the rehab side, again, we did see a little bit of volume growth that was off trend. Rehab was more in the upper single digits as well. Again, no significant change across the company with respect to capital investment or focus on that particular service line. It was unusually soft in the first quarter. Again, a couple of hospitals explained some of that. We have seen in a few markets where we've had some bundled pilot that has had a marginal impact.

We did see a little bit of a trend change last year where it actually trended down a bit in the first quarter. But in general, when I look back over 3, 4 years, it stayed about the same. And that's what we saw this year. The fourth quarter and the first quarter were almost identical. But when you look at it compared to the first quarter of last year, the execution of our service line initiatives, primarily trauma and then secondarily, graduate medical education, is driving professional fee expense growth for the company. We saw some deterioration in margin primarily because of professional fee expense. And there were 3 things that drove that. First, we did an acquisition of a physician network in Northern California last year where most of the cost of that particular acquisition are in other expenses and that drove a piece of the margin erosion. The second piece and probably the more important piece and more connected to the company, strategy, is around trauma program development, where we have to invest in professional fees to support our trauma programs. And again, we've added significant amount of trauma programs, somewhere in their early stage, start-up modes, so you see a little bit of a disproportionate load of other operating expenses as a result. And then the third piece was in our graduate medical education programs where we have added graduate medical education programs for residents and so forth at a number of our facilities, which require some level of professional fees for faculties and such so that we can support those programs. All in all, we think there will be some growth in these numbers over the remaining portion of the year but not in any way where it changes our trend and our expectation on the margin levels that Bill laid out. If you look at some of our components, like our ER physician, call for ER visit or ER -- call pay per ER visit, those are generally aligned with what we expected, slightly up again because of these program changes.

I think next year, at this time, we will probably be somewhere between, depending on how quickly we get these up, 10 to 12 more as well. Our -- so our pipeline on development of these freestanding emergency rooms, it's still fairly strong. We should be somewhere around 70, I think, in the next 12 to 18 months. The acuity level tends to be a bit lower than what you see in a hospital-based emergency room for a couple of reasons. One, obviously, trauma cases aren't going to a freestanding emergency room. Certain chest pain events are not going to a freestanding emergency room nor are stroke events. So you have a natural tendency for the more acute patients, which are delivered by ambulance, to go to a hospital based because it's highly likely that they will be admitted. I think the freestanding emergency room plays a very important part in our network development. It plays a very important part in our outreach to consumers to make it easy for them to access the system. I don't know that the ER, as a venue, if you will, is changing in any significant way. I do believe, though, that urgent care in emergency rooms, over the past 3 to 5 years, and I think this will be the case going forward, is still a substitute for the shortages of primary care physicians that exist in a lot of markets. And so you see urgent care, freestanding emergency rooms and even hospital-based emergency rooms providing the solution that patients are looking for when they can't get into a physician clinic because of physician shortages or because of payer dynamics. So from that standpoint, that probably structurally stays in place. And we think it's part -- and part of the reason for the overall demand growth that we've seen over the past few years in emergency room visit volume, and we think that will continue in the near term."

This morning, we issued our first quarter 2016 earnings release, highlighting the financial operational performance of the company. I'll take a few comments -- or I'll make a few comments on the quarter and then I'll turn the call over to Bill and Sam to provide more details on the quarter's results.
We are pleased with the results of the first quarter, which are in line with our internal expectations. Adjusted EBITDA of $2.003 billion for the first quarter increased 2.1% over the prior year. As expected, the first quarter of this year was a difficult comparison to the first quarter of 2015 when adjusted EBITDA grew 19.3% over the first quarter of 2014.
Net income attributable to HCA Holdings, Inc. Increased 17.3% and earnings per share increased 24.3% for the quarter. As noted in our release this morning, net income, EPS and cash flows from operations were favorably impacted by an accounting change we adopted related to share-based compensation, which lowered our tax rate for the quarter.
Our 2016 guidance remains unchanged except for adjusted EPS, which has been increased by $0.20 per diluted share on both the low and the high end of the range. This is to reflect a tax benefit recorded during the first quarter of 2016 related to the accounting change made in this first quarter.
We have not attempted to estimate the impacts of this accounting change on future quarters of 2016 as the tax benefit depends upon the number of equity awards settled each period and the market value of our stock at the time of the settlement.
We continue to experience solid growth in inpatient and outpatient volumes as well as surgical and emergency room visits. We believe these results speak to the quality of our markets and the execution of our strategic agenda. Same facility admissions increased 1.6% while same facility equivalent admissions increased 3.1%. Our growth drivers include capital improvements, programmatic developments within our service lines, end market access point development and strategic acquisitions.
This year, we plan to invest $2.7 billion to expand our service capabilities and capacity in our markets. In 2016, approximately 350 new inpatient beds and 100 new ER beds will come online, with another 550 inpatient beds and 200 ER beds scheduled for completion in 2017. We continue to see solid growth from our investments in the service line development such as trauma, cardiology and women's services. Our strategy to expand our access points in our market [indiscernible] inpatient and outpatient services. The effective execution of our growth agenda is yielding market share gains, and Sam will provide additional details in a moment.
With respect to supply expense, we continue to see solid execution of our initiatives to manage our supply costs. We are pleased with the early results of our integration of Tenet Healthcare into HealthTrust Purchasing Group. And clearly, one of the highlights of the quarter is the strong growth in cash flows from operations, up 37.4% over last year's first quarter. The quarter reflects our balanced approach to capital allocation.
During the quarter, we generated almost $1.4 billion in cash flows from operations and we deployed $509 million for capital expenditures and $621 million to repurchase 8.921 million shares of our stock. And we had $1.983 billion remaining on our $3 billion share repurchase authorization at the end of the quarter.
Finally, let me recognize Don Stinnett, HCA's Senior Vice President and Controller, who retired at the end of April. We thank Don for his 17 years of service and his many contributions he's made to our company. I'd also like to welcome Chris Wyatt, who has succeeded Don as Senior Vice President and Controller. Chris most recently served as Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of HCA's Information Technology & Services organization.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill."

As Milton indicated, we had a solid quarter that was driven by good volume growth and our adjusted EBITDA results were in line with our expectations. Let me give you some more detail on our performance and the results for the quart",1066,"Good morning, everyone. As Milton indicated, we had a solid quarter that was driven by good volume growth and our adjusted EBITDA results were in line with our expectations. Let me give you some more detail on our performance and the results for the quarter.
As we reported, in the first quarter, our same facility admissions increased 1.6% over the prior year, and same facility equivalent admissions increased 3.1%. Sam will provide more color on the drivers of this volume in a moment, but I'll give you some trends by payer class.
During the first quarter, same facility Medicare admissions and equivalent admissions increased 0.8% and 2.1%, respectively. This includes both traditional and managed Medicare. Managed Medicare admissions increased 3.1% on a same facility basis and now represent 33% of our total Medicare admissions.
Same facility Medicaid admissions and equivalent admissions increased 1.4% and 4.3%, respectively, in the quarter, in line with our recent trends. Same facility self-pay and charity admissions increased 10.6% in the quarter while equivalent admissions increased 9.4%. These represent 6.9% of our total admissions compared to 6.3% last year.
There are a couple of points on our uninsured volume I'd like to call out. First, our uninsured same facility admissions in our expansion states were flat year-over-year while our non-expansion states grew just over 11%. Texas and Florida represent about 70% of our total uninsured admissions and represent 90% of the year-over-year growth.
And to put this uninsured growth into perspective, the 10.6% growth we saw in the quarter equates to just over 3,000 admissions for the company compared to the 477,000 same facility admissions we had for the quarter.
Managed care and other, which includes exchange admissions, increased 1.5% and equivalent admissions increased 2.7% on a same facility basis in the first quarter compared to the prior year. Same facility emergency room visits increased 6.9% in the quarter compared to the prior year. Same facility self-paying charity ER visits represent 18.6% of our total ER visits in the first quarter for both 2016 and 2015.
Intensity of service or acuity increased in the quarter with our same facility case mix increasing 2.7% compared to the prior year period. Same facility surgeries increased 3.3% in the quarter with inpatient surgeries increasing 1.4% and outpatient surgeries increasing 4.4% from the prior year. Same facility revenue per equivalent admission increased 2.2% in the quarter.
Our outpatient revenues in the first quarter continue to show very strong growth. Outpatient revenues in the quarter represented 38.9% of total revenues, up 120 basis points in prior year's first quarter. Same facility managed care and other revenue per equivalent admission increased 5.9% in the quarter.
Same facility charity care and uninsured discounts increased $618 million in the quarter compared to the prior year. Same facility charity care discounts totaled $951 million in the quarter, an increase of $63 million from the prior year period, while same facility uninsured discounts totaled $3.076 billion, an increase of $555 million over the prior year period.
Now turning to expenses. Same facility operating expense per equivalent admission increased 2.8% compared to last year's first quarter. On a consolidated basis, salaries and benefits as a percentage of revenue was 45.8% compared to 45.5% in last year's first quarter and 45.7% for the full year of 2013.
Salaries per equivalent admission increased 2.8% in the quarter on a same facility basis. Productivity, as measured by same facility man-hours per adjusted admission, improved 0.5% and same facility wage rates increased 2.5% in the quarter. Supply expense as a percent of revenues were 16.7% this quarter as compared to 16.9% in last year's first quarter on a consolidated basis.
Same facility supply expense per equivalent admission increased 1.4% for the first quarter compared to the prior year period, reflecting continued success on several supply chain admissions. Other operating expenses increased 40 basis points from last year's first quarter to 18.1% of revenues and was consistent with the 18% we ran in Q4 of 2015 and 18.2% in Q3 of 2015. We recognized $4 million of electronic health record income in the quarter compared to $19 million last year, consistent with our expectations.
Let me briefly touch on cash flow. As Milton mentioned, we had another extremely strong quarter with cash flow from operations just under $1.4 billion, about a $380 million improvement. Cash flow from operations was benefited by $74 million due to the adoption of new accounting standards that I will discuss in a minute.
Free cash flow increased $339 million from $440 million in Q1 of '15 to $779 million in Q1 of 2016. At the end of the quarter, we had $2.9 billion available under our revolving credit facilities, and debt-to-adjusted EBITDA was 3.84x at March 31, 2016, compared to 3.85x at the end of 2015.
We touch briefly on health reform. Health reform activity continued to grow in the quarter. In the first quarter, we saw approximately 12,500 same facility exchange admissions as compared to the 9,860 we saw in the first quarter of last year or about a 27% increase. You may recall, we saw about 11,200 same facility exchange admissions in the fourth quarter of 2015 for an 11% increase sequentially, quarter-to-quarter. We believe this is largely due to the new enrollment.
For perspective, exchange admissions represent about 2.6% of total admissions for the company. We saw approximately 50,000 same facility exchange ER visits in the first quarter compared to the approximate 37,000 in first quarter of '15 and 38,000 in the fourth quarter of '15.
Overall, our exchange and reform activity is in line with our expectations. Lastly, as mentioned in the release, the company did elect to early adopt a new accounting standard FASB ASU 2016-09, which was issued in late March. This standard simplifies certain aspects of accounting for share-based payment transactions. In summary, the standard requires that excess tax benefits related to equity award settlements be recorded as a component to the provision for income taxes, prospectively, versus previously, these amounts were recorded directly to equity.
In the quarter, we recorded a $74 million tax benefit or $0.18 per diluted share related to this adoption. Also, these tax benefits amounts were previously presented as cash flow from financing activities, but are now reflected as cash flows from operating activities.
So that concludes my remarks. And I'll turn the call over to Sam for some additional comments."

As mentioned earlier, the first quarter was another solid quarter of volume growth for the company. The company continued to show broad-based growth across our markets and broad-based growth across the various service lines that make up our business. There were a number of factors that impacted our inpatient admissions and outpatient volumes this quarter.
First, flu admissions were down by 40%, which affected our overall inpatient admission growth rate by 0.6%. And then, secondly, leap year positively affected our inpatient admissions by approximately 1%, but this calendar effect was partially offset by the Easter holiday, which were in March this year.
We believe the net impact of all these factors had an immaterial effect on overall volumes. For our domestic operations, on a same facility basis, 11 of 14 divisions had growth in admissions, 14 of 14 divisions had growth in adjusted admissions and 13 of 14 divisions had growth in emergency room visits. The company had a total of 56 freestanding emergency rooms at the end of March. We had 44 last year at this time. Freestanding emergency room visits grew 31% and accounted for approximately 1/3 of our overall growth in visits. Hospital-based emergency room visits grew 5%. This broad-based performance reflects HCA's strong and diversified portfolio of provider networks in 42 domestic markets, most of which we believe still have good growth prospects. 
In addition to the strong portfolio performance, the company's growth across its diversified facility base and service lines was equally strong. For domestic operations, on a same facility basis, inpatient surgeries grew by 1.8%, which increased surgical admits to 27.6% of total admits in the quarter, an increase of 100 basis points.
Surgical volumes were particularly strong in cardiovascular, orthopedic and general surgery categories. Outpatient surgeries grew by 4.6%. Both components of this service line, hospital-based and our freestanding ambulatory division, had equally strong growth. Also, same facility outpatient endoscopic and pain procedures grew by 1.6%.
The company continues strategically to add freestanding ambulatory endoscopic and pain centers to its provider networks. As compared to the first quarter of last year, we have acquired or developed 9 new centers and closed or sold 4 for a net of 5 more, bringing our total to 131 centers. Including these new centers, the company's total outpatient surgery volumes grew 6.3% and outpatient endoscopic and pain procedures were up 6.7%.
Behavioral health admissions grew 2.7%. Rehab admissions grew 2.8%. Deliveries were flat in the quarter. However, managed deliveries were up 4.4%. Neonatal admissions grew 4.7%. But our length of stay declined because of less acuity this quarter, which impacted our patient day growth in this service line.
Overall, average length of stay increased 0.5%, which was driven mainly by the growth in our acuity or case mix index. We believe our efforts in developing a more comprehensive and complex level of services across our provider networks are driving this increase.
Other volume statistics for the quarter are as follows: Cardiology procedure volumes grew approximately 5%, trauma volumes grew 27%, observation visits were up 13% and finally, the company's urgent care business in total grew 22%. The company had 68 urgent care centers at the end of March this year, up from 50 last year.
The inpatient market share data for the 12 months ended September 2015 shows that HCA continued to gain share and our composite share of 24.6% was at its highest level in the past 5 years. We believe our comprehensive growth agenda, which is both well resourced and well executed, provides further opportunities for the company to increase market share and drive revenue growth.
With that, let me turn the call back to Vic."

And so while I hate to ask the question, I have to ask the question because I know it's on the minds of many. So the fundamental question is how worried should we be about the increment that we see in your bad debt ratio in this quarter? That's #1. Number two, can you give us an estimate of the impact of the treatment of these patients on the EBITDA performance and whether that might be a reflection of a difference between this year's in-line performance versus last year's strong outperformance? And third, can you give us a sense of whether or not -- or whether or not that increase that you experienced was anticipated by you or whether your gaining market share and adding ERs may have led to a slightly higher-than-anticipated increase in uninsured services?"

When I look at the bad debts, and as you know, for HCA, I think we have to look at the total uncompensated care picture, which includes charity, as well as the uninsured discounts. When I look at our total uncompensated care trends, those trends are pretty consistent with our recent experience. When I look at it as a percent of adjusted revenue, it was 32% for the quarter, 32.6% in the fourth [ph] quarter, 33% was a little high in the third, 30.7% in the first [ph] and 29.6% in the first. So our trends are pretty consistent. And I would tell you, we're pretty much in line with what we had internally projected.
As we've said, I believe the uninsured volume will be driven by our emergency room volume. Our emergency room uninsured ED visits were up 26,000 compared to our 3,000 or so uninsured growth. You see that's 12% of net rate, which is pretty consistent with what we've historically seen. And then, as I mentioned in my comments, it's driven by Florida and Texas, obviously, 2 non-expansion states that we continue to see. So I had anticipated our uninsured trends to kind of settle out around that high single-digit level. I think it will be really settling where our ED visits land. And the EBITDA impact is really marginal as we've talked. It's -- the EBITDA impact is the marginal cost that we have for that. So I don't think that really contributed materially to the EBITDA issues for the quarter for the company."

The pricing environment is generally consistent across most of our markets with what we've seen over the past 24 to 36 months. There are some nuances from one market to the other with one contract or the other where we have to adjust the structural pieces of the contract. But again, those are more on the fringe than in the core aspects of the contract. For the company, we're largely contracted for all of 2016, as we indicated in our guidance. We're about 70% contracted in 2017 and about 45% contracted for 2018. And in general, the pricing escalation and the structural aspects of those contracts are pretty much consistent with what we've seen in the past 24 or 36 months. We don't believe that the consolidation across our 42 markets of the payers is going to have a global impact on HCA. We think if those particular mergers are consummated that in some markets it could have some nuanced impact. But again, we don't see as a material -- a change in what's going on in the marketplace."

We've been very aggressive with our equipment investments. And that has application across both the inpatient and outpatient. On the inpatient side, the inpatient surgeries tend to be more connected to our approach in driving more complex care, trauma care, burn care, deeper capabilities in orthopedics and neuro sciences. And so those are a little slower moving, I would say, in general. Although our inpatient surgery growth has been very steady over the last 3.5 years, where we've seen pretty consistent growth, I'm counting up the quarters as I look here, almost 11 straight quarters of inpatient surgical growth across HCA. On the outpatient side, we, again, are seeing demand growth in outpatient surgery. And we've tried to create 2 venues for patients and physicians to operate, one being freestanding ambulatory surgery centers where, again, we've added to our portfolio over the past few years and we have efforts to grow those particular centers. And then within our hospitals, when we have physicians who like to do inpatient cases, they also tend to want to do their outpatient cases on the same days. And so we're trying to accommodate them as well. But in total, our outpatient surgeries have grown very consistently over the same 12, 13 quarters with a little bit of acceleration in this first quarter. And I can't really point to why it accelerated in the first quarter as compared to the trend, but our efforts are broad-based. We have a number of initiatives, including capital investments, that are intended to drive surgical activity across the 3 areas of our business: Inpatient, ambulatory surgery and then hospital-based outpatient."

Now in the first quarter, we have to pay more payroll taxes, more unemployment insurance and so forth. So our total spend was up about $122 million because of benefit cost, natural growth that occurs first quarter compared to the fourth quarter. Compared to last year, we did have a slight margin erosion. 2 factors drove that, share-based comp being a piece of that and then a moderated growth in contract labor being the other piece. Contract labor for the company has run the same amount of dollars over the last 3 quarters now. So the first quarter did not see any growth in total spend compared to the fourth quarter, which was consistent with the third quarter. So we've seen some stabilization. We believe that our efforts around this particular area presents an opportunity for HCA in the future. If we can stem some of the nursing turnover that we have experienced and improve our retention efforts, and we have a number of initiatives to deal with that, we think we can drive some incremental improvements over time in this particular area. So all in all, the productivity and the results from a labor standpoint for HCA in the quarter were well managed, we believe, when you look at it compared to where we were in the fourth quarter.  With respect to the balanced billing issue in Florida, we're not thinking that's going to create a lot of issues for us one way or the other. We believe, for our patients, it's going to be beneficial and that it will eliminate, in many instances, potential surprise billings around certain hospital-based physician providers. But for us and our approach to the market and our relationships with our physician contract companies, we're not anticipating any kind of impact from the balanced billing legislation in Florida."

And we have some recent initiatives there that we still become very encouraged with. One of them is what we refer to as a pharmacy consolidation initiative that we have going on throughout the markets and HCA where we consolidate the pharmacy supply chain as well as the pharmacy distribution chain and embed pharmacists in there to work with our clinicians on the floor to ensure that the prescriptions and the pharmacy utilization is optimized on there. In addition, it helps us with the procurement of pharmacy and looking at the storage and inventory on there. So it's just one more initiative that we have going on. They're embedded in our operating rooms to help us manage our inventory supply chain within the operating rooms as well as many other distribution efforts.

We continue to invest in behavioral health capacity. And we have a lot of demand for that. We've recently approved some expansion of behavioral health capabilities in a number of markets to deal with that. In some instances, we have struggled with psychiatrists in the supply of physician coverage, and that's been more the barrier to growth than actual capacity. So behavioral health continues to be a very important component and service line for our market strategy as well as a complement to our emergency room service line strategy. On the rehab side, again, we did see a little bit of volume growth that was off trend. Rehab was more in the upper single digits as well. Again, no significant change across the company with respect to capital investment or focus on that particular service line. It was unusually soft in the first quarter. Again, a couple of hospitals explained some of that. We have seen in a few markets where we've had some bundled pilots that it's had a marginal impact. But all in all, that continues to be a very strong service line. We have investments going forward into that particular service line where we're adding capacity. And again, it complements very important service lines for HCA like neurosciences, trauma, and burn and service lines like that. So we see opportunities for growth in that one as well."

We did see a little bit of a trend change last year, where it actually trended down a bit in the first quarter. But in general, when I look back over 3, 4 years, it stays about the same. And that's what we saw this year. The fourth quarter and the first quarter were almost identical. But when you look at it compared to the first quarter of last year, the execution of our service line initiatives, primarily trauma and then, secondarily, graduate medical education is driving professional fee expense growth for the company. We saw some deterioration in margin primarily because of professional fee expense. And there were 3 things that drove that. First, we did an acquisition of a physician network in Northern California last year where most of the cost of that particular acquisition are in other expenses and that drove a piece of the margin erosion. The second piece and probably the more important piece and more connected to the company's strategy, is around trauma program development, where we have to invest in professional fees to support our trauma programs. And again, we've added significant amount of trauma programs. Some are in their early stage, start-up modes, so you see a little bit of a disproportionate load of other operating expenses as a result. And then the third piece was in our graduate medical education programs where we have added graduate medical education programs for residents and so forth at a number of our facilities, which require some level of professional fees for faculty and such, so that we can support those programs. All in all, we think there will be some growth in these numbers over the remaining portion of the year, but not in any way where it changes our trend and our expectation on the margin levels that Bill laid out. If you look at some of our components, like our ER physician-call for an ER visit or ER call-pay per ER visit, those are generally aligned with what we expected, slightly up again because of these program changes. So that's the biggest driver of our other expenses on a year-over-year, but it's very consistent, like Bill said, with the fourth quarter and even the third quarter. So the run rate is really not that materially changed."

I think next year, at this time, we will probably be somewhere between, depending on how quickly we get these up, 10 to 12 more as well. Our -- so our pipeline on development of these freestanding emergency rooms, it's still fairly strong. We should be somewhere around 70, I think, in the next 12 to 18 months. The acuity level tends to be a bit lower than what you see in a hospital-based emergency room for a couple of reasons. One, obviously, trauma cases aren't going to a freestanding emergency room. Certain chest pain events are not going to a freestanding emergency room, nor are stroke events. So you have a natural tendency for the more acute patients, which are delivered by ambulance, to go to a hospital-based because it's highly likely that they will be admitted. I think the freestanding emergency room plays a very important part in our network development. It plays a very important part in our outreach to consumers to make it easy for them to access the system. I don't know that the ER, as a venue, if you will, is changing in any significant way. I do believe, though, that urgent care in emergency rooms, over the past 3 to 5 years, and I think this will be the case going forward, is still a substitute for the shortages of primary care physicians that exist in a lot of markets. And so you see urgent care, freestanding emergency rooms and even hospital-based emergency rooms providing the solution that patients are looking for when they can't get into a physician clinic because of physician shortages or because of payer dynamics. So from that standpoint, that probably structurally stays in place. And we think it's part -- and part of the reason for the overall demand growth that we've seen over the past few years in emergency room visit volume, and we think that will continue in the near term."

I hope each of you had the opportunity to review the HCA second quarter results released this morning. I'll make a few comments on the quarter and our thoughts on 2016 guidance and then turn the call over to Bill and Sam to provide more detail on the quarter's results. 
Net income attributable to HCA Holdings increased 29.8% to $658 million or $1.65 per diluted share, a 39.8% increase, compared to $507 million or $1.18 in the prior year second quarter. As noted in our second quarter release, we recognized a $44 million tax benefit or $0.11 per diluted share related to the early adoption of the new accounting standard, which reduced our provision for income taxes. 
Adjusted EBITDA totaled $2.052 billion, an increase of 2.2% over the prior year. We experienced volume growth in both our admissions and emergency business, although a more modest growth rate as compared to recent quarters. 
Same facility admissions increased 0.6%, while same facility [indiscernible] admissions increased 1.6%. Same facility emergency [indiscernible] business increased 4.1% over last year's second quarter. 
Inpatient and outpatient surgery volumes reflects growth over the second quarter of last year. Total surgery cases grew 1.6% on a same-facility basis. Sam will provide additional comments on our volume trend in just a moment. 
Once again, we experienced strong growth and cash flows from operations, totaling $1.349 billion compared to $1.057 billion ending prior year second quarter, an increase of 28%. We deployed $663 million to capital expenditures and $1.237 billion to repurchase 15.506 million shares which included $750 million repurchased 9.361 million shares from KKR during the quarter. We have repurchased a total of 24.427 million shares in 2016 at an average price of $76.04. We had approximately $750 million remaining on our $3 billion authorization at June 30, 2016, and also during the quarter, we purchased 3 hospitals in the Dallas, Fort Worth and Austin, Texas markets, which we believe will broaden and strengthen our market growth in the future. 
We expect to see inpatient and outpatient services growth in our markets in the years ahead. We are committing capital to meet this increasing demand. For example, recently, we announced a $650 million capital commitment on our Miami Bay Palm Beach County facilities to expand and upgrade our patient service offerings. This includes the construction of a new facility on the Kansas Southeastern University in Dayton, Florida, along with several other expansion facility updates within the market. These investments will allow us to better serve our communities, respond to the growing demand for health care services and provide the highest level outpatient care experience. 
I want to take a minute to recognize the number of senior appointments we have been announced over the past quarter, all of whom have been promoted from the band HCA. [indiscernible] Due to retirements, we have named 3 Division Presidents, in addition we announce a new Senior Vice President of Employer and payer engagement. These are all seasoned professionals with many years of experience and they're discipline in HCA. They know our culture, they understand our business strategies, and I am extremely pleased that we have a deep bench to ensure strong continuity. So congratulations to all of them. 
Now moving to 2016 guidance. Primarily due to volume growth at the low end of our expectations during the first 6 months of 2016, we are revising our full year 2016 guidance expectations. As noted in this morning's earnings release, our revenue range is now estimated to be between $41 and $42 billion, adjusted EBITDA is now expected to range between $8.1 billion and $8.3 billion, and our adjusted EPS range is now estimated to be between $6.40 to $6.70 per diluted share, reflecting increased net income, share repurchase and the favorable impact of change in accounting statement Florida catchword for the first 6 months of 2016. Our balance for capital expenditures for 2016 remains around $2.7 billion. 
So with that, I'll turn the call over to Bill."

Same facility charity care and uninsured discounts increased $863 million in the quarter compared to the prior year. Same facility charity care discounts totaled $1.097 billion in the quarter, an increase of $207 million from the prior year period, while same facility uninsured discounts totaled $3.085 billion, an increase of $656 million over the prior year period. 
Our total uncompensated care trends, which include bad debts, charity and uninsured business combined had been consistent over the past 4 quarters. 
Now turning to expenses. Expense management in the quarter was good. Same facility operating expense per equivalent admission increased 2.4% compared to last year's second quarter. Our consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted per share-based comp and EHR incentive income was 20.5% for the quarter, compared to 20.7% in the second quarter of last year. Sequentially, it has increased 40 basis points from the first quarter of this year. 
Same facility salaries per equivalent admission increased 2.4% compared to last year's second quarter. Salaries and benefits as a percentage of revenue increased 10 basis points compared to the second quarter of 2015. Same facility supply expense per equivalent admission increased 0.9% to the second quarter compared to the prior year period reflecting growth in surgical volumes and the impact of this volume growth is offset by several supply chain initiative with the [indiscernible], and this helped leads the supply cost revenue to improve 20 basis points versus the prior year period. 
Other operating expenses as a percent of revenues increased 30 basis points from last year's second quarter to 18.0% of revenues, primarily reflecting an increase in our year-over-year professional fees that we discussed on our first quarter call. However, other operating expenses as a percentage of revenue has remained level through the past 4 quarters. 
We recognized $5 million electronic health record income in the quarter compared to $18 million in last year's second quarter, consistent with our expectations. 
Let me touch briefly on cash flow. We had another strong quarter with cash flows from operations totaling $1.349 billion. Year-to-date, cash flows from operations $2.748 billion or a 32.4% increase from prior-year. Cash flow from operations is benefited by $118 million on a year-to-date basis due to the adoption of the accounting policy around excess tax benefits related to the settlement of equity awards. 
At the end of the quarter, we had approximately $1.98 billion available under our revolving credit facilities. Debt to adjusted EBITDA was 3.93x at June 30 of 2016 in compared with 3.85x at December 31 of '15. 
I also want to highlight our earnings per share results. For the quarter, our diluted earnings per share before considering losses on retirement of debt, legal claim costs and gain on losses of sales of facilities increased to $1.66 per diluted share from $1.37 in the prior year period. When adjusted for the $0.11 benefit due to the adoption of the new accounting policy, represents at 13% growth over prior year in the quarter. These strong cash flow trends, balance sheet positions and EPS growth results highlight the strength of the company. 
Let me touch briefly on health care reform. Health reform activity continued to grow in the quarter. In the second quarter, we saw approximately 13,300 [ph] same facility exchange admissions as compared with the 11,600 we saw in the second quarter of last year or a 15% [ph] year-over-year growth. You may recall, we saw about 12,500 exchange admissions in the first quarter. 
We saw approximately 54,000 same facility exchange ER visits in the second quarter compared to just under 45,000 in the second quarter of 2015 and just under 50,000 in the first quarter of 2016. So overall, these reform trends are tracking in line with our expectations. 
So that concludes my remarks and I'll turn the call over to Sam for some additional comments."

Let me begin by giving you some of the quarterly volumes factored normally provide these call. Once again, the company continued to have broad-based growth across our markets and broad-based growth across service lines that make up our business. 
For our domestic operation, on a same facility basis, 10 of 14 divisions had growth in admissions, 11 of 14 divisions had growth in adjusted admissions and 12 of 14 divisions had growth in emergency room visits. We stated emergency visits grew 27% and accounted for approximately 50% of our overall ER growth. Hospital-based emergency room visits grew 2.2%. 
In addition to the strong portfolio performance, the company's growth across its diversified service line was also strong. For domestic operations on a same facility basis, inpatient surgeries grew 1.7%, which increased surgical admissions to 28.6% of total in the quarter, an increase of 130 basis points. Surgical volumes were particularly strong in cardiovascular, orthopedic and general surgery categories. 
Outpatient surgeries grew by 1.4%, both components of this service line, hospital-based and our freestanding ambulatory division had solid growth. Also, same facility outpatient endoscopic procedures grew 1.6%. [indiscernible] admissions grew 3.7%. We had admissions [indiscernible] 1.2%. Cardiology procedure volumes grew approximately 2%. Trauma volumes grew 14%. Observation visits were up 7.5%. And finally, the company's urgent care visit on a non-same facility basis grew 11%. 
2 related service lines experienced declines in the quarter. Deliveries were down 1.5% in the quarter, and neonatal admissions declined 2.6%. 
Overall, average length of stay increased 0.6%. This was driven mainly by the growth in our acuity or case mix index. 
We believe our efforts in developing a more comprehensive and complex level of services across our provider networks are driving this increase. 
I would also note that our inpatient market share for the year ended 2015 showed that HCA continued to gain share in total and across most of its market. As stated earlier, our volume growth, in particular inpatient admission, was at the lower end of our expectation. Most of this can be attributed to 3 areas, but before I explain them, it is important to note that the second quarter last year was very strong and [indiscernible] a difficult comparison with inpatient admissions up 4.1% and adjusted admissions up 4.9%. 
First, growth in emergency room visits in our hospital-based units slowed as compared to the past few years. As a result, downstream growth in inpatient admissions through the ER was not as strong as compared to recent quarters. We believe most of this softness can be explained by 3 factors:
First, a slowing in demand growth to more normal rate; second, new competition in several markets; and third, in a couple of our core markets, we experienced a change in certain Medicare Advantage pairs patients between inpatient admission and observation status. The company continues to execute a comprehensive agenda to grow our emergency room business, which we believe is a service line with a strong overall demand growth. 
Second, growth in our behavioral and rehab service lines with also recent trends. We believe this year is mostly result of capacity constraint calls like clinical staffing and our lack of bed interview of our behavioral unit. On the rehab side of our business, the issues are not as easily categorized. We have not opened as many units this year as compared to the past year and we have seen some modest impact in a few markets from the CMS normal payment initiative. We continue to invest and recruit talents for the service lines and we believe the have solid growth prospects in many of our markets. 
And finally, women's and children submissions were down as indicated previously. The primary reasons are, one, broad-based softness in delivery downstream decline in neonatal admissions, some competitive issues in a few markets and general declines in pediatric volumes due to milder respiratory season as compared to last year. These services continue to be an important part of our overall network strategy, and we believe the company is well positioned to compete effectively in these areas. 
All in all, the company continues to have solid top line growth and sustain market share gains. Our growth agenda is comprehensive, but it's well resourced for capital spending and marketing, and we continue to execute at a high level. We believe the company has solid growth prospects across a uniquely diversified portfolio of markets and service lines, and we believe our local provider well positioned to capitalize on it. 
With that, let me turn the call back to Vic."

I think I heard you say managed care admissions were down, so I'd like some explanation of that, where it happens and whether or not it's likely to be sustained. Third, we heard you on the other side, talk about the capacity constraint, and I'm wondering to what extent you're capacity constraints is limiting your near-term growth and what your plans are for investing beyond Florida what you have announced to offset that. And then fourth, you have the fact that you're investing in capacity. So there's a bit of a mixed message here, the way I'm seeing it that, yes, on the one hand you're pulling in guidance prudently, to request a little bit less strain, but still growth. On the other hand, I hear what you're saying about investing in capacity, so there might be a demand story here and a continued execution story. Bill, can you tell us what we should think about the near-term pushes and pulls versus the long-term growth expectations you have for volumes and how we should think about the company in that context."

But first of all, I think, you're right. What we're seeing is we're still seeing growth in longer term historical standards, I think very solid growth, and that's hopefully we're expressing that this morning. But by recent growth standards, we are seeing it slowing. We went through over the past 5 or 6 quarters, growth that was exceptional, and we saw demand in our markets growing. And we suspect as you know our market share data lags about 6 month, but we suspect we're going to see some slowing demand in many of our markets, and that's why we're seeing it show up in our numbers. That being said, we still have a great outlook and a very optimistic outlook for the long term in our markets. Our markets are growing in terms of population, and I think we'll continue to see demand in our markets. And so we're going to invest to meet that expected demand. And we have certain markets, I know Sam can give some color like on the South Florida markets where we announced the $650 million investment Why are we doing that, and Sam can describe that to you in just a minute.

There are pockets where we clearly know that it's difficult day in and day out to manage the capacity challenges and that could impact the squeeze out a few patients here or there. But in total, I don't think that was a material impact in the quarter. We had a very sophisticated approach to capital expenditures. We had capacity triggers. We have production triggers that we use in determining whether or not we should consider capital for a particular situation. And so that process continues. Nothing's changed. And we've monitored that in the context of macros within the market of strategic approach within the facility at a micro level. And all that we is into a capital decision. Capital takes a while to get into the marketplace on average, 18 to 30 months, depending on the project, because we're usually doing it for existing assets. So that is kind of hedge also I think i deploying capital across the company. But specifically, you get an example of it in Florida on what we've done there. A number of these projects that have been approved, we package them up because we thought it was a very sizable commitment in very effective message for constituents in that market. The Florida market is the largest health care demand market in HCA. Dallas is second, Houston is third. So Miami is a big market. We have the largest position in Miami with our market share globally. Our volumes over the past 5 years have grown significantly. Our census, our average daily census is up 25%. We have a number of our key institutions that are running 85% to 90% inpatient occupancies. Our emergency room visits over that time period have grown almost 250,000 visits or almost 50%. It's a large commercial market. So for us, and when you look at the macros in South Florida, we believe we capacity in play in order to sustain growth over time, and that's how we think about these investments. And this is just a very solid sort of microcosm, if you will, of a number of markets in a number of situations inside of HCA and how we approach it. So capital is a very important part of market share gains. It's a very important part of constituency satisfaction, especially our position, and then obviously our patients in that they have the kind of facility presentation and technology we needed. And it continues to play a big part in our overall efforts to grow market share and to pushing our company to be effective in delivering care and competitive in the marketplace."

I mean, the last 6 quarters had been incredibly strong for the commercial demand standpoint across all of our markets and then commercial volume inside of HCA. We knew that was going to taper. We just didn't know when exactly and how much, and I don't know that the second quarter's necessarily reflective of any near-term volume trend with respect to that. I mean, the second quarter last year was a very strong commercial volume growth if I remember quickly, Bill, and so that was part of the challenge here. We have a couple of markets where there's been some trend changes, the observation issue in the Florida market impacted our admissions statistics of that, and that's part of it. A couple of Texas markets had softened some, but not materially different than the company as a whole. In Las Vegas, 2 of our hospitals I mean, 2 of our competitors have now reentered a payer contract that previously they weren't in, so we lost the commercial business there. So there's all these little components that play into our number. But I think the demand will normalize in that trend we think in the short run to intermediate run on commercial ought to be somewhere between 1 and 2. We think overall demand is 2 to 2.5, potentially. But, yes, we are going to have to see some data in the first part of this year to fully validate those assumptions, but that's where we believe the trends are for the HCA markets."

It was more Medicare Advantage but a little bit on the commercial of it. We're not convinced yet that we're being equitably dealt with on some of those status. You're working with the payers to get a more clinically driven protocol around those and that we believe will normalize at some point. But nonetheless, that's out there as we issue and it has been an issue but a little more advance I think in the second quarter. So that's the payer side. On the payment issue, again, it's hard to have current -- this is a very sort of slow-moving data-driven process with the government. What I was speaking to in particular on our rehab business and only in a couple of markets have we seen the financial program, the final payment initiative pilot program had a modest impact on referrals into our rehab centers. There have been some components of our participation in those pilots where we're seeing some modest adjustments in post-acute care referral patterns. Again, it's sort of spotty across the different components of post-acute. On the CJR side, it's way too early to be able to understand what the implications are there. We're just starting to get in the game. And again, we've seen some modest changes in referral patterns, but not to the point for HCA, we believe that compromises the opportunity to develop rehab service lines and fully integrate that into other components of our business. So orthopedics, as an example, is not the only driver of rehab business for HCA [indiscernible] driver, life sciences is a driver, outreach is a driver. We have multiple drivers that deliver downstream we have business. And so from that standpoint, we've got a little bit of a drag with the bundled programs. We still have a lot of business opportunity on the other side that justifies our investments. We have admissions for HCA [indiscernible] 1% of our total so it doesn't really move the needle at all."

We had a second workshop for another 20 hospitals inside of HCA and we're optimistic that we'll start to see some leveraging of best practices and performance there that will, over time, I think help address some of these challenges. Our recruitment function inside of oneHR continues to improve and get more agile in responding to dynamics in the market. We do have pockets of challenges with wages that we have to step up and deal with. Some of those are being dealt with as we speak. Some of them have been dealt with over the past few quarters. And some of them will be dealt with in the future. Having said that, I don't think there's going to be a material change in our composite average hourly rate across the company. It could move a little bit from one quarter to the other, but largely, it's in the zone of where we anticipate it, and we believe it to be manageable."

We couldn't put our fingers around exactly why it was as high as it was.

Our growth is fairly broad-based across the different service lines in those centers and in our hospitals. We have a number of initiatives. Our OR choice initiative continues to yield value for it. It's a satisfy physician and it's helping our patient flow, patient satisfaction. Secondly, we are in an acquisition mode on ambulatory surgery centers and endoscopic centers and has added over the course of the last 12 to 18 months quite a few additional units. And when you look at our composite non same-store ambulatory surgery center growth in the second quarter, I want to say it's about 4.5%, which reflects some of the acquisitions that we've done.

And we do think that's an accomplishment given the continued intensity increases in volume growth we have seen over that time. Our supply chain team as well as our field operators have done an outstanding job from a variety of aspects around supply chain. First, relative to our GPO and contracting, we still have momentum in the marketplace with HealthTrust Purchasing Group, and they continue to have a lot of strong performance. And then our supply chain operations are really a key component of our supply chain story. We've spoken recently, one of our recent initiatives around pharmacy consolidation, where we can help control the pharmacy stand in utilization of inventory. That is paying great dividends as that initiative is rolling through the marketplace. So we've also got initiatives in the operating suites, as well as other initiatives around our performance improvement activities. So when you couple supply chain initiatives operationally with the contracting statuses we have going on, I think that's all leading to as being able to at least maintain our margins on a supply cost line and remain with stability. You do recall, last year, we did speak in the third quarter of some pharmacy cost elevation with our pharmacy cost for adjusted admission or adjusted patient day was elevated in the second and third quarter of last year mainly due to some high cost drugs that obviously have a lot of press around that. We've seen those supply cost trends moderate or the pharmacy cost trends moderate over the past couple of quarters and responds to some of just the pressure on those high cost drugs. So that is also benefiting our year-over-year kind of comparisons."

We are trying to work with our physicians to identify the best course of action for our patients, whether that's the type of post-acute, how we interact with them post discharge from the hospital and so forth. And it's very, very early in understanding how impactful those are. As we transition, I mean, we just got the regs on the cardiac thing, I mean, it's 700 plus pages of regs, I think, we haven't had a chance to study that yet. I think the one nuance for us was cardiology versus the orthopedic joins is we employ a large number of cardiologists across HCA and our ability to integrate with them may be a bit easier than it is in some respects with orthopedics, which we don't employ as much. So we'll have to wait and see how that plays out, that's still a proposed rule. We'll know in fact if it will go into effect and what the final rules will be on the cardiac side. But we are prepared. We've invested in infrastructure, corporate office and divisions, we've educated. We put policies and procedures in place on the CJR. It we'll hopefully see where it goes over the next 12 to 18 months."

Both components have about 50% to 55% of their volume being commercial patients. Our outpatient business is predominantly a commercial book of business. A number of our surgery centers have broader clinical capabilities and can provide the type of care that our hospital-based units, but others can't.

In many markets, we are adding service lines, I'll call it horizontally, where we're bringing on new capabilities in cardiovascular care, oncology, pediatrics, whatever. And then vertically, we are deepening those capabilities inside of existing service lines, all intended on being able to keep a patient somewhere into HCA systems if they need deeper care and more complex care. So we support that out of our clinical services group and out of our service line group up here in Nashville, where we can bring technology, we can bring best practices, we can bring a specialized talent to support that. So when I view the company's inpatient business, I anticipate it getting more acute and more complex over time. On the outpatient side, the company has had a very aggressive investment strategy over the last number of years. I think, Bill, our outpatient revenue is pushing 40% of our total. And so we balance out the $2.7 billion between inpatient capacity, outpatient, surgical capacity, imaging capacity, clinical capacity for urgent care and then also for emergency room, which is a big piece of our outpatient strategy as well. So all of those pieces and parts are connected to really a balanced approach to building out our networks and being attractive to our patients and our physicians."

I'll make a few comments on the quarter and our thoughts on 2016, guidance and then turn the call over to Bill and Sam to provide more detail on the quarter's results. 
Net income attributable to HCA Holdings increased 29.8% to $658 million or $1.65 per diluted share, a 39.8% increase, compared to $507 million or $1.18 in the prior year second quarter. As noted in our second quarter release, we recognized a $44 million tax benefit or $0.11 per diluted share related to the early adoption of the new accounting standard, which reduced our provision for income taxes. Adjusted EBITDA totaled $2.052 billion, an increase of 2.2% over the prior year. 
We experienced volume growth in both our admission and emergency room visits, although at a more modest growth rate as compared to recent quarters. Same facility admissions increased 0.6% while same facility equivalent admissions increased 1.6%. Same facility emergency room visits increased 4.1% over last year's second quarter. Inpatient and outpatient surgery volumes reflect solid growth over the second quarter of last year. Total surgery cases grew 1.6% on a same facility basis. Sam will provide additional comments on our volume trend in just a moment. 
Once again, we experienced strong growth in cash flows from operations totaling $1.349 billion compared to $1.057 billion itn prior year second quarter, an increase of 28%. We deployed $663 million to capital expenditures and $1.237 billion to repurchase 15.506 million shares, which included $750 million to repurchase 9.361 million shares from KKR during the quarter. We have repurchased a total of 24.427 million shares in 2016 at an average price of $76.04. We had approximately $750 million remaining on our $3 billion authorization at June 30, 2016.
And also during the quarter, we purchased 3 hospitals in the Dallas-Fort Worth and Austin, Texas markets, which we believe will broaden and strengthen our market growth into the future. We expect to see inpatient and outpatient services growth in our markets in the years ahead. We are committing capital to meet this increasing demand. For example, recently, we announced a $650 million capital commitment at our Miami-Dade, Palm Beach and St. Lucie County facilities to expand and upgrade our patient service offerings. This includes the construction of a new facility on the campus of Nova Southeastern University in Davie, Florida, along with several other expansion facility updates within the market. These investments will allow us to better serve our communities, respond to the growing demand for health care services and provide the highest level of patient care experience. 
I want to take a minute to recognize a number of senior appointments we've announced over the past quarter, all of whom have been promoted from within HCA. Due to retirements, we have named 3 new division presidents. In addition, we announced a new senior vice president of employer and payer engagement. These are all seasoned professionals with many years of experience in their discipline in HCA. They know our culture, they understand our business strategies, and I am extremely pleased that we have a deep bench to ensure strong continuity. So congratulations to all of them. 
Now moving to 2016 guidance. Primarily due to volume growth at the low end of our expectations during the first 6 months of 2016, we are revising our full year 2016 guidance expectations. As noted in this morning's earnings release, our revenue range is now estimated to be between $41 and $42 billion, adjusted EBITDA is now expected to range between $8.1 billion and $8.3 billion and our adjusted EPS range is now estimated between $6.40 to $6.70 per diluted share, reflecting increased net income, share repurchase and the favorable impact of change in accounting standard, which lowered our tax rate for the first 6 months of 2016. Our balance for capital expenditures for 2016 remains around $2.7 billion. 
So with that, I'll turn the call over to Bill."

And I will add to Milton's comments and provide more detail on our performance and our health reform trends in the quarter. As we reported, in the second quarter, our same facility admissions increased 0.6% over prior year and equivalent admissions increased 1.6%. 
Sam will provide more commentary on volume in a moment, but I'll give you some trends by payer class. During the second quarter, same facility Medicare admissions and equivalent admissions increased 1.2% and 2.1%, respectively. This includes both traditional and managed Medicare. Managed Medicare admissions increased 3.9% on a same facility basis and now represent 33.5% of our total Medicare admissions. Same facility Medicaid admissions and equivalent admissions increased 0.5% and 2.1%, respectively, in the quarter, which is fairly consistent with our recent trends. 
Same facility self-pay and charity admissions increased 5.7% in the quarter, and they represent 7.5% of total admissions compared to 7.1% in the second quarter of last year. Year-to-date, our same facility uninsured admissions are up 7.8% from the same period last year. 
Managed care and other, which include exchange, admissions declined 1.6%, and equivalent admissions declined 0.8% on the same facility basis in the second quarter compared with the prior year. On a year-to-date basis, same facility managed, other and exchange admissions are flat with prior year, and equivalent admissions are up 0.9%. Same facility emergency room business increased 4.1% in the quarter compared to the prior year, and our same facility self-pay and charity ER visits represent 19.4% of our total ER visits in the quarter compared to 19.3% last year. 
Intensity of services, or acuity, increased in the quarter with our same facility case mix increasing 3.9% compared to the prior year period. Same facility surgeries increased 1.6% in the quarter, the same facility inpatient surgeries increased 1.8% and outpatient surgeries increasing 1.5% in the prior year. Same facility revenue for equivalent admission increased 2.1%. 
Same facility managed care and other, including exchange revenue per equivalent admission, increased 5.8% in the quarter. Same facility charity care and uninsured discounts increased $863 million in the quarter compared to the prior year. Same facility charity care discounts totaled $1.097 billion in the quarter, an increase of $207 million from the prior year period, while same facility uninsured discounts totaled $3.085 billion, an increase of $656 million over the prior year period. Our total uncompensated care trends, which include bad debts, charity and uninsured business, combined, have been consistent over the past 4 quarters. 
Now turning to expenses. Expense management in the quarter was good. Same facility operating expense per equivalent admission increased 2.4% compared to last year's second quarter. Our consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted per share-based comp and EHR incentive income, is 20.5% for the quarter compared to 20.7% in the second quarter of last year. Sequentially, it has increased 40 basis points from the first quarter of this year. 
Same facility salaries per equivalent admission increased 2.4% compared to last year's second quarter. Salaries and benefits as a percentage of revenue increased 10 basis points compared to the second quarter of 2015. 
Same facility supply expense per equivalent admission increased 0.9% for the second quarter compared to the prior year period, reflecting growth in surgical volumes. And the impact of this volume growth is offset by several supply chain initiative that we have implemented, and this helped leads the supply cost revenue to improve 20 basis points versus the prior year period. 
Other operating expenses as a percent of revenues increased 30 basis points from last year's second quarter to 18.0% of revenues, primarily reflecting an increase in our year-over-year professional fee that we discussed on our first quarter call. However, other operating expenses as a percentage of revenue has remained level through the past 4 quarters. We recognized $5 million electronic health record income in the quarter compared to $18 million in last year's second quarter, consistent with our expectations. 
Let me touch briefly on cash flows. We had another strong quarter with cash flows from operations totaling $1.349 billion. Year-to-date, cash flows from operations, $2.748 billion or a 32.4% increase from prior year. Cash flow from operations is benefited by $118 million on a year-to-date basis due to the adoption of the accounting policy around excess tax benefits related to the settlement of equity awards. 
At the end of the quarter, we had approximately $1.98 billion available under our revolving credit facilities. Debt to adjusted EBITDA was 3.93x at June 30, 2016, compared with 3.85x at December 31, '15. 
I also want to highlight our earnings per share results. For the quarter, our diluted earnings per share before considering losses on retirement of debt, legal claim costs and gain on losses of sales of facilities increased to $1.66 per diluted share from $1.37 in the prior year period. When adjusted for the $0.11 benefit due to the adopting of the new accounting policy, represents a 13% growth over prior year in the quarter. These strong cash flow trends, balance sheet position and EPS growth results highlight an important strength of the company. 
Let me touch briefly on health care reform. Health reform activity continued to grow in the quarter. In the second quarter, we saw approximately 13,300 same facility exchange admissions as compared with the 11,600 we saw in the second quarter of last year or a 15% year-over-year growth. You may recall, we saw about 12,500 exchange admissions in the first quarter. We saw approximately 54,000 same facility exchange ER visits in the second quarter compared to just under 45,000 in the second quarter of 2015 and just under 50,000 in the first quarter of 2016. So overall, these reform trends are tracking in line with our expectations. 
So that concludes my remarks, and I'll turn the call over to Sam for some additional comments."

Let me begin by giving you some of the quarterly volumes that I normally provide on each call. Once again, the company continued to have broad-based growth across our markets and broad-based growth across various service lines that make up our business. 
For our domestic operation, on a same facility basis, 10 of 14 divisions had growth in admissions, 11 of 14 divisions had growth in adjusted admissions and 12 of 14 divisions had growth in emergency room visits. Freestanding emergency room visits grew 27% and accounted for approximately 50% of our overall ER growth. Hospital-based emergency room visits grew 2.2%. 
In addition to the strong portfolio performance, the company's growth across its diversified service lines was also strong. For domestic operations, on a same facility basis, inpatient surgeries grew 1.7%, which increased surgical admissions to 28.6% of total in the quarter, an increase of 130 basis points. Surgical volumes were particularly strong in cardiovascular, orthopedics and general surgery categories. Outpatient surgeries grew by 1.4%. Both components of this service line, hospital-based and our freestanding ambulatory division, had solid growth. Also, same facility outpatient endoscopic procedures grew 1.6%. 
Behavioral health admissions grew 3.7%. Rehab admissions grew 1.2%. Cardiology procedure volumes grew approximately 2%. Trauma volumes grew 14%. Observation visits were up 7.5%, and finally, the company's urgent care visit on a non-same facility basis grew 11%. Two related service lines experienced declines in the quarter. Deliveries were down 1.5% in the quarter, and neonatal admissions declined 2.6%. Overall, average length of stay increased 0.6%. This was driven mainly by the growth in our acuity or case mix index. We believe our efforts in developing a more comprehensive and complex level of services across our provider networks are driving this increase. 
I would also note that our inpatient market share for the year ended 2015 showed that HCA continued to gain share in total and across most of its market. As stated earlier, our volume growth, in particular, inpatient admission, was at the lower end of our expectations. Most of this can be attributed to 3 areas. But before I explain them, it is important to note that the second quarter last year was very strong and presented a difficult comparison with inpatient admissions up 4.1% and adjusted admissions up 4.9%. 
First, growth in emergency room visits in our hospital-based units slowed as compared to the past few years. As a result, downstream growth in inpatient admission through the ER was not as strong as compared to recent quarters. We believe most of this softness can be explained by 3 factors: first, a slowing in demand growth to more normal rates; second, new competition in several markets; and third, in a couple of our Florida markets, we experienced a change in how certain Medicare Advantage payer classified their patients between inpatient admission and observation status. The company continues to execute a comprehensive agenda to grow our emergency room business, which we believe is a service line with strong overall demand growth. 
Second, growth in our behavioral and rehab service lines was also recent trends [ph]. We believe this issue is mostly a result of capacity constraint caused by clinical staffing and a lack of bed at a few of our behavioral units. On the rehab side of our business, the issues are not as easily categorized. We have not opened as many units this year as compared to past year, and we have seen some modest impact in a few markets from the CMS bundled payment initiative. We continue to invest in and recruit talents for these service lines, and we believe they have solid growth prospects in many of our markets. 
And finally, women's and children submissions were down as I indicated previously. The primary reasons are, one, broad-based softness in delivery [indiscernible] downstream decline in neonatal admissions, some competitive issues in a few markets and general declines in pediatric volume due to a milder respiratory season as compared to last year. These services continue to be an important part of our overall network strategy, and we believe the company is well positioned to compete effectively in these areas. 
All in all, the company continues to have solid top line growth and sustain market share gains. Our growth agenda is comprehensive. It is well resourced for capital spending and marketing, and we continue to execute at a high level. We believe the company has solid growth prospects across a uniquely diversified portfolio of markets and service lines, and we believe our local provider system are well positioned to capitalize on them. 
With that, let me turn the call back to Vic."

If I could just recap and then ask the question. First, I think what we're seeing here is still growth across the broad range of types of admissions and payer types, but softer than you had expected. I think I heard you say managed care admissions were down. So I'd like some explanation of that, where it happens and whether or not it's likely to be sustained. Third, we heard you, on the other side of this, talk about the capacity constraint, and I'm wondering to what extent your capacity constraint is limiting your near-term growth and what your plans are for investing to -- beyond Florida, what you've announced, to offset that. And then fourth, you have this fact that you are investing in capacity. So there's a bit of a mixed message here, the way I'm seeing it, that, yes, on the one hand, you're pulling in guidance prudently to reflect a little bit less strength, but still growth. On the other hand, I hear what you're saying about investing at capacity. So it sounds that there might be a demand story here and a continued execution story. Bill, can you tell us what we should think about the near-term pushes and pulls versus the long-term growth expectations you have for volumes and how we should think about the company in that context?"

What we're seeing is we were still seeing growth in longer-term historical standards, I think very solid growth, and that's -- hopefully, we're expressing that this morning. But by recent growth standards, we're seeing it slowing. We went through, over the past 5 or 6 quarters, growth that was exceptional, and we saw demand in our markets growing. And we suspect -- although, as you know, our market share data lags about 6 months, but we suspect we're going to see some slowing demand in many of our markets, and that's why we're seeing it show up in our numbers. That being said, we still have a great outlook and a very optimistic outlook for the long term in our markets. Our markets are growing in terms of population, and I think we'll continue to see demand in our markets. And so we're going to invest to meet that expected demand. And we have certain markets, I know Sam can give some color like on the South Florida markets, where we announced the $650 million investment, why we're doing that. And Sam can describe that to you just -- in just a minute.

There are pockets where we clearly know that it's difficult day in and day out to manage the capacity challenges, and that could, in fact, squeeze out a few patients here or there. But in total, I don't think that was a material impact in the quarter. We have a very sophisticated approach to capital expenditures. We have capacity triggers. We have production triggers that we use in determining whether or not we should consider capital for a particular situation. And so that process continues. Nothing's changed. And we monitor that in the context of macros within the market, of strategic approach within the facility at micro level, and all of that leads into a capital decision. Capital takes a while to get into the marketplace. On average, it's 18 to 30 months, depending on the project, because we're usually doing it to existing assets. So that timing gives us a bit of a hedge, also, I think, in deploying capital across the company. But it's -- specifically, you get the example of East Florida and what we've done there. And a number of these projects that were -- have been approved, we packaged them up because we thought it was a very sizable commitment and a very effective message for constituents in that market. But -- the South Florida market is the largest health care demand market in HCA. Dallas is second. Houston is third. So Miami is a big market. We have the largest position in Miami with our market share globally. Our volumes, over the past 5 years, have grown significantly. Our census, our average daily census is up 25%. We have a number of our key institutions that are running 85% to 90% inpatient occupancy. Our emergency room visits over that time period have grown almost 250,000 visits or almost 50%. It's a large commercial market. So for us -- and when you look at the macros in South Florida, we believe we have to get capacity in play in order to sustain growth over time, and that's how we think about these investments. And this is just a very solid sort of microcosm, if you will, of a number of markets in a number of situations inside of HCA and how we approach it. So capital is a very important part of market share gains. It's very important part of constituency satisfaction, especially our position, and then obviously our patients in that they have the kind of facility presentation and technology they needed. And it continues to play a big part in our overall efforts to grow market share and position our company to be effective in delivering care and competitive in the marketplace."

So let's just say it's modestly down. That's a little bit below where we expect it this year. I mean, the last 6 quarters have been incredibly strong, from a commercial demand standpoint, across all of our markets and then commercial volume inside of HCA. We knew that was going to taper. We just didn't know when exactly and how much. And I don't know that the second quarter is necessarily reflective of any near-term volume trend with respect to that. I mean, the second quarter last year was a very strong commercial volume growth, if I remember correctly, Bill, and so that was part of the challenge here. We have a couple of markets where there's been some trend changes. The observation issue in the Florida market impacted our admission statistics a bit and that's part of it. A couple of Texas markets have softened some, but not materially different than the company as a whole. In Las Vegas, 2 of our hospitals I mean, 2 of our competitors have now reentered a payer contract that previously they weren't in, so we lost a bit of commercial business there. So there's all these little components that play into our number. But I think the demand will normalize, and that trend, we think, in the short run to intermediate run on commercial ought to be somewhere between 1 and 2. We think overall demand is 2 to 2.5, potentially. But again, we're going to have to see some data in the first part of this year to fully validate those assumptions, but that's where we believe the trends are for the HCA markets."

As far as the components of that, we are -- I'm not seeing any substantial changes in structure or provisions inside of those agreements. On the observation status issue, it was more Medicare Advantage issue than it was a non-Medicare issue, a little bit on the commercial, but not as much. It was more Medicare Advantage, but a little bit on the commercial because of that. We're not convinced yet that we're being equitably dealt with on some of those status, and you're working with the payers to get a more clinically driven protocol around those. And that, we believe, will normalize at some point. But nonetheless, that's out there as an issue, and it has been an issue, but it was a little more advance, I think, in the second quarter. So that's the payer side. On the bundled payment issue, again, it's hard to have current data. This is a very sort of slow-moving data-driven process with the government. What I was speaking to was, in particular, on our rehab business, and only in a couple of markets have we seen the BPCI program, the bundled payment initiative pilot program, have a modest impact on referrals into our rehab centers. There have been some components of our participation in those pilots where we're seeing some modest adjustments in post-acute care referral patterns. Again, it's sort of spotty across the different components of post-acute. On the CJR side, it's way too early to be able to understand what the implications are there. We're just starting to get in the game. And again, we've seen some modest changes in referral patterns, but not to the point where, for HCA, we believe that compromises the opportunity to develop rehab service lines and fully integrate that into other components of our business. So orthopedics, as an example, is not the only driver of rehab business for HCA. Trauma is a driver. Real sciences are a driver. Outreach into the rural market is a driver. So we have multiple drivers that deliver downstream rehab have business. And so from that standpoint, you got a little bit of a drag with the bundled programs. We still have a lot of business opportunity on the other side that justifies our investments. Rehab admissions for HCA are 1% of our total, so it doesn't really move the needle at all."

We couldn't put our fingers around exactly why it was as high as it was. But the second quarter was more on our historical trend, and it was very balanced between our hospital-based unit and our freestanding ambulatory surgery centers. Our growth is fairly broad-based across the different service lines in those centers and in our hospitals. We have a number of initiatives. Our OR choice initiative continues to yield value for it. And it's a satisfier for our physicians, and it's helping our patient flow, patient satisfaction. Secondly, we are in an acquisition mode on ambulatory surgery centers and endoscopic centers and have added, over the course of the last 12 to 18 months, quite a few additional units. And when you look at our composite non-same-store's ambulatory surgery center growth in the second quarter, I want to say it's about 4.5%, which reflects some of the acquisitions that we've done. And we believe them to be very strategic to position alignment, greater outreach into commercial segments and just advancing our larger network of offerings across HCA's markets.

When I look at it here for the past 4 quarters, we're pretty consistent, 16.7% in Q2, 16.7% to Q1, 16.4% in Q4",342,"Let me take the first shot.

When I look at it here for the past 4 quarters, we're pretty consistent, 16.7% in Q2, 16.7% to Q1, 16.4% in Q4, 16.7% in Q3. So it's very stable. And we do think that's an accomplishment, given the continued intensity increases in volume growth that we've seen over that time. Our supply chain team as well as our field operators have done an outstanding job from a variety of aspects around supply chain. First, relative to our GPO and contracting, we still have momentum in the marketplace with HealthTrust Purchasing Group, and they continue to have a lot of strong performance. And then our supply chain operations are really a key component of our supply chain story. We've spoken recently of one of our recent initiatives around pharmacy consolidation, where we can help control the pharmacy stand in utilization of inventory. That is paying great dividends as that initiative is rolling through the marketplace. So we've also got initiatives in the operating suites as well as other initiatives around our performance improvement activities. So when you couple supply chain initiatives operationally with the contracting statuses we have going on, I think that's all leading to us being able to at least maintain our margins on a supply cost line and remain with stability. You do recall, last year, we did speak in the third quarter of some pharmacy cost elevation with our pharmacy cost for adjusted admission or adjusted patient day was elevated in the second and third quarter of last year, mainly due to some high-cost drugs that obviously had a lot of press around that. We've seen those supply cost trends moderate over the -- or the pharmacy cost trends moderate over the past couple of quarters in response to some of just the public pressure on those high-cost drugs. So that is also benefiting our year-over-year kind of comparison."

I mean, the ASCs are a bit less priced, lower-priced in our hospitals, and that's because of some of the infrastructure requirements that it takes to operate a hospital-based unit. Capital requirements are different and so forth. Both components have about 50% to 55% of their volume being commercial patients. So outpatient business is predominantly a commercial book of business. A number of our surgery centers have broader clinical capabilities and can provide the type of care that our hospital-based units, but others can't. They don't have the nursing. They don't have the backup. The physicians aren't comfortable operating on certain type of patients and so forth. So there's all these nuances that go into it. Ambulatory surgery centers have been in our markets for a decade, and this dynamic has always existed. And so we've got the right balanced approach, we believe, inside of HCA to be able to respond to physician needs, patient needs, payer needs with our network, and we continue to add to both."

In many markets, we are adding service lines, I'll call it, horizontally. We're bringing on new capabilities in cardiovascular care, oncology, pediatrics, whatever. And then vertically, we're deepening those capabilities inside of existing service lines, all intended on being able to keep a patient somewhere in the HCA system if they need deeper care and more complex care. So we support that out of our Clinical Services Group and out of our service line group up here in Nashville, where we can bring technology, we can bring best practices, we can bring a specialized talent to support that. So when I view the company's inpatient business, I anticipate it getting more acute and more complex over time. On the outpatient side, the company has had a very aggressive investment strategy over the last number of years. I think, Bill, our outpatient revenue is pushing 40% of our total. And so we balance out the $2.7 billion between inpatient capacity, outpatient, surgical capacity, imaging capacity, clinical capacity for urgent care and then also for emergency room, which is a big piece of our outpatient strategy as well. So all of those pieces and parts are connected to, really, a balanced approach to building out our networks and being attractive to our patients and our physicians."

This is an area where I want to see HCA's lead, and I'm very excited about the early returns on what we're seeing. Again, we've invested in the clinical data warehouse. You think about what's happened over the last several years with electronic health record and investments that HCA and other providers have made and moving now to a digital medical record, because that was step one. Now we have all this clinical information on this digital format, what do we do with it? And there's a lot we can do with it. I'm going to ask that Dr. Perlin to touch on a couple. But some things that we're doing around substance care and, really, drop in mortality rates in our hospitals shown substances is -- in saving lives, is really happening every -- it's happening today in our facilities. And so there's examples of like that. So it's -- again, we're investing in -- not only in terms of the technical side of that, but we're investing in the human resource side of that with hiring very talented data scientists to help us take advantage of this. And then you think you move on from the structured data that we have to the unstructured data, and that's the length of processing, and where we can move the needle there is, again, something for the future that I'm very excited about.

In that process, it also allows us to drive our processes more efficiently, especially in terms of labor, especially in terms of the resources used to provide care, the supplies.

I hope each of you had the opportunity to review HCA second quarter results released this morning. I'll make a few comments on the quarter and our thoughts on 2016, guidance and then turn the call over to Bill and Sam to provide more detail on the quarter's results. 
Net income attributable to HCA Holdings increased 29.8% to $658 million or $1.65 per diluted share, a 39.8% increase, compared to $507 million or $1.18 in the prior year second quarter. As noted in our second quarter release, we recognized a $44 million tax benefit or $0.11 per diluted share related to the early adoption of the new accounting standard, which reduced our provision for income taxes. Adjusted EBITDA totaled $2.052 billion, an increase of 2.2% over the prior year. 
We experienced volume growth in both our admissions and emergency room visits, although at a more modest growth rate as compared to recent quarters. Same facility admissions increased 0.6% while same facility equivalent admissions increased 1.6%. Same facility emergency room visits increased 4.1% over last year's second quarter. Inpatient and outpatient surgery volumes reflect solid growth over the second quarter of last year. Total surgery cases grew 1.6% on a same facility basis. Sam will provide additional comments on our volume trends in just a moment. 
Once again, we experienced strong growth in cash flows from operations totaling $1.349 billion compared to $1.057 billion in the prior year second quarter, an increase of 28%. We deployed $663 million to capital expenditures and $1.237 billion to repurchase 15.506 million shares, which included $750 million to repurchase 9.361 million shares from KKR during the quarter. We have repurchased a total of 24.427 million shares in 2016 at an average price of $76.04. We had approximately $750 million remaining on our $3 billion authorization at June 30, 2016.
And also during the quarter, we purchased 3 hospitals in the Dallas-Fort Worth and Austin, Texas markets, which we believe will broaden and strengthen our market growth into the future. We expect to see inpatient and outpatient services growth in our markets in the years ahead. We are committing capital to meet this increasing demand. For example, recently, we announced a $650 million capital commitment at our Miami-Dade, Palm Beach and St. Lucie County facilities to expand and upgrade our patient service offerings. This includes the construction of a new facility on the campus of Nova Southeastern University in Davie, Florida, along with several other expansion facility updates within the market. These investments will allow us to better serve our communities, respond to the growing demand for health care services and provide the highest level of patient care experience. 
I want to take a minute to recognize a number of senior appointments we've announced over the past quarter, all of whom have been promoted from within HCA. Due to retirements, we have named 3 new division presidents. In addition, we announced a new senior vice president of employer and payer engagement. These are all seasoned professionals with many years of experience in their discipline in HCA. They know our culture, they understand our business strategies, and I am extremely pleased that we have a deep bench to ensure strong continuity. So congratulations to all of them. 
Now moving to 2016 guidance. Primarily due to volume growth at the low end of our expectations during the first 6 months of 2016, we are revising our full year 2016 guidance expectations. As noted in this morning's earnings release, our revenue range is now estimated to be between $41 and $42 billion, adjusted EBITDA is now expected to range between $8.1 billion and $8.3 billion and our adjusted EPS range is now estimated between $6.40 to $6.70 per diluted share, reflecting increased net income, share repurchase and the favorable impact of change in accounting standard, which lowered our tax rate for the first 6 months of 2016. Our balance for capital expenditures for 2016 remains around $2.7 billion. 
So with that, I'll turn the call over to Bill."

And I will add to Milton's comments and provide more detail on our performance and our health reform trends in the quarter. As we reported, in the second quarter, our same facility admissions increased 0.6% over prior year and equivalent admissions increased 1.6%. 
Sam will provide more commentary on volume in a moment, but I'll give you some trends by payer class. During the second quarter, same facility Medicare admissions and equivalent admissions increased 1.2% and 2.1%, respectively. This includes both traditional and managed Medicare. Managed Medicare admissions increased 3.9% on a same facility basis and now represent 33.5% of our total Medicare admissions. Same facility Medicaid admissions and equivalent admissions increased 0.5% and 2.1%, respectively, in the quarter, which is fairly consistent with our recent trends. 
Same facility self-pay and charity admissions increased 5.7% in the quarter, and they represent 7.5% of total admissions compared to 7.1% in the second quarter of last year. Year-to-date, our same facility uninsured admissions are up 7.8% from the same period last year. 
Managed care and other, which include exchange, admissions declined 1.6%, and equivalent admissions declined 0.8% on the same facility basis in the second quarter compared with the prior year. On a year-to-date basis, same facility managed, other and exchange admissions are flat with prior year, and equivalent admissions are up 0.9%. Same facility emergency room business increased 4.1% in the quarter compared to the prior year, and our same facility self-pay and charity ER visits represent 19.4% of our total ER visits in the quarter compared to 19.3% last year. 
Intensity of services, or acuity, increased in the quarter with our same facility case mix increasing 3.9% compared to the prior year period. Same facility surgeries increased 1.6% in the quarter, the same facility inpatient surgeries increased 1.8% and outpatient surgeries increasing 1.5% in the prior year. Same facility revenue for equivalent admission increased 2.1%. 
Same facility managed care and other, including exchange revenue per equivalent admission, increased 5.8% in the quarter. Same facility charity care and uninsured discounts increased $863 million in the quarter compared to the prior year. Same facility charity care discounts totaled $1.097 billion in the quarter, an increase of $207 million from the prior year period, while same facility uninsured discounts totaled $3.085 billion, an increase of $656 million over the prior year period. Our total uncompensated care trends, which include bad debts, charity and uninsured business, combined, have been consistent over the past 4 quarters. 
Now turning to expenses. Expense management in the quarter was good. Same facility operating expense per equivalent admission increased 2.4% compared to last year's second quarter. Our consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted per share-based comp and EHR incentive income, is 20.5% for the quarter compared to 20.7% in the second quarter of last year. Sequentially, it has increased 40 basis points from the first quarter of this year. 
Same facility salaries per equivalent admission increased 2.4% compared to last year's second quarter. Salaries and benefits as a percentage of revenue increased 10 basis points compared to the second quarter of 2015. 
Same facility supply expense per equivalent admission increased 0.9% for the second quarter compared to the prior year period, reflecting growth in surgical volumes. And the impact of this volume growth was offset by several supply chain initiative that we have implemented, and this helped leads the supply cost revenue to improve 20 basis points versus the prior year period. 
Other operating expenses as a percent of revenues increased 30 basis points from last year's second quarter to 18.0% of revenues, primarily reflecting an increase in our year-over-year professional fee that we discussed on our first quarter call. However, other operating expenses as a percentage of revenue has remained level through the past 4 quarters. We recognized $5 million electronic health record income in the quarter compared to $18 million in last year's second quarter, consistent with our expectations. 
Let me touch briefly on cash flows. We had another strong quarter with cash flows from operations totaling $1.349 billion. Year-to-date, cash flows from operations, $2.748 billion or a 32.4% increase from prior year. Cash flow from operations is benefited by $118 million on a year-to-date basis due to the adoption of the accounting policy around excess tax benefits related to the settlement of equity awards. 
At the end of the quarter, we had approximately $1.98 billion available under our revolving credit facilities. Debt to adjusted EBITDA was 3.93x at June 30, 2016, compared with 3.85x at December 31, '15. 
I also want to highlight our earnings per share results. For the quarter, our diluted earnings per share before considering losses on retirement of debt, legal claim costs and gain on losses of sales of facilities increased to $1.66 per diluted share from $1.37 in the prior year period. When adjusted for the $0.11 benefit due to the adopting of the new accounting policy, represents a 13% growth over prior year in the quarter. These strong cash flow trends, balance sheet position and EPS growth results highlight an important strength of the company. 
Let me touch briefly on health care reform. Health reform activity continued to grow in the quarter. In the second quarter, we saw approximately 13,300 same facility exchange admissions as compared with the 11,600 we saw in the second quarter of last year or a 15% year-over-year growth. You may recall, we saw about 12,500 exchange admissions in the first quarter. We saw approximately 54,000 same facility exchange ER visits in the second quarter compared to just under 45,000 in the second quarter of 2015 and just under 50,000 in the first quarter of 2016. So overall, these reform trends are tracking in line with our expectations. 
So that concludes my remarks, and I'll turn the call over to Sam for some additional comments."

Let me begin by giving you some of the quarterly volumes that I normally provide on each call. Once again, the company continued to have broad-based growth across our markets and broad-based growth across various service lines that make up our business. 
For our domestic operations, on a same facility basis, 10 of 14 divisions had growth in admissions, 11 of 14 divisions had growth in adjusted admissions and 12 of 14 divisions had growth in emergency room visits. Freestanding emergency room visits grew 27% and accounted for approximately 50% of our overall ER growth. Hospital-based emergency room visits grew 2.2%. 
In addition to the strong portfolio performance, the company's growth across its diversified service lines was also strong. For domestic operations, on a same facility basis, inpatient surgeries grew 1.7%, which increased surgical admissions to 28.6% of total in the quarter, an increase of 130 basis points. Surgical volumes were particularly strong in cardiovascular, orthopedics and general surgery categories. Outpatient surgeries grew by 1.4%. Both components of this service line, hospital-based and our freestanding ambulatory division, had solid growth. Also, same facility outpatient endoscopic procedures grew 1.6%. 
Behavioral health admissions grew 3.7%. Rehab admissions grew 1.2%. Cardiology procedure volumes grew approximately 2%. Trauma volumes grew 14%. Observation visits were up 7.5%, and finally, the company's urgent care visit on a non-same facility basis grew 11%. Two related service lines experienced declines in the quarter. Deliveries were down 1.5% in the quarter, and neonatal admissions declined 2.6%. Overall, average length of stay increased 0.6%. This was driven mainly by the growth in our acuity or case mix index. We believe our efforts in developing a more comprehensive and complex level of services across our provider networks are driving this increase. 
I would also note that our inpatient market share for the year ended 2015 showed that HCA continued to gain share in total and across most of its market. As stated earlier, our volume growth, in particular, inpatient admissions, was at the lower end of our expectations. Most of this can be attributed to 3 areas. But before I explain them, it is important to note that the second quarter last year was very strong and presented a difficult comparison with inpatient admissions up 4.1% and adjusted admissions up 4.9%. 
First, growth in emergency room visits in our hospital-based units slowed as compared to the past few years. As a result, downstream growth in inpatient admission through the ER was not as strong as compared to recent quarters. We believe most of this softness can be explained by 3 factors: first, a slowing in demand growth to more normal rates; second, new competition in several markets; and third, in a couple of our Florida markets, we experienced a change in how certain Medicare Advantage payer classified their patients between inpatient admission and observation status. The company continues to execute a comprehensive agenda to grow our emergency room business, which we believe is a service line with strong overall demand growth. 
Second, growth in our behavioral and rehab service lines was also recent trends [ph]. We believe this issue is mostly a result of capacity constraints caused by clinical staffing and a lack of beds at a few of our behavioral units. On the rehab side of our business, the issues are not as easily categorized. We have not opened as many units this year as compared to past years, and we have seen some modest impact in a few markets from the CMS bundled payment initiative. We continue to invest in and recruit talents for these service lines, and we believe they have solid growth prospects in many of our markets. 
And finally, women's and children submissions were down as I indicated previously. The primary reasons are, one, broad-based softness in delivery with further downstream decline in neonatal admissions, some competitive issues in a few markets and general declines in pediatric volume due to a milder respiratory season as compared to last year. These services continue to be an important part of our overall network strategy, and we believe the company is well positioned to compete effectively in these areas. 
All-in-all, the company continues to have solid top line growth and sustain market share gains. Our growth agenda is comprehensive. It is well resourced for capital spending and marketing, and we continue to execute at a high level. We believe the company has solid growth prospects across a uniquely diversified portfolio of markets and service lines, and we believe our local provider system are well positioned to capitalize on them.

If I could just recap and then ask the question. First, I think what we're seeing here is still growth across a broad range of types of admissions and payer types, but softer than you had expected. I think I heard you say managed care admissions were down. So I'd like some explanation of that, where it happens and whether or not it's likely to be sustained. Third, we heard you, on the other side of this, talk about the capacity constraints, and I'm wondering to what extent your capacity constraints is limiting your near-term growth and what your plans are for investing to -- beyond Florida, what you've announced, to offset that. And then fourth, you have this fact that you are investing in capacity. So there's a bit of a mixed message here, the way I'm seeing it, that, yes, on the one hand, you're pulling in guidance prudently to reflect a little bit less strength, but still growth. On the other hand, I hear what you're saying about investing at capacity. So it sounds that there might be a demand story here and a continued execution story. Bill, can you tell us what we should think about the near-term pushes and pulls versus the long-term growth expectations you have for volumes and how we should think about the company in that context?"

What we're seeing is we were still seeing growth in longer-term historical standards, I think very solid growth, and that's -- hopefully, we're expressing that this morning. But by recent growth standards, we're seeing it slowing. We went through, over the past 5 or 6 quarters, growth that was exceptional, and we saw demand in our markets growing. And we suspect -- although, as you know, our market share data lags about 6 months, but we suspect we're going to see some slowing demand in many of our markets, and that's why we're seeing it show up in our numbers. That being said, we still have a great outlook and a very optimistic outlook for the long term in our markets. Our markets are growing in terms of population, and I think we'll continue to see demand in our markets. And so we're going to invest to meet that expected demand. And we have certain markets, I know Sam can give some color like on the South Florida markets, where we announced the $650 million investment, why we're doing that. And Sam can describe that to you just -- in just a minute. But we still think our markets -- we're well positioned in our markets, and we're going to invest to make sure we stay well positioned in these excellent markets in which we operate.

There are pockets where we clearly know that it's difficult day in and day out to manage the capacity challenges, and that could, in fact, squeeze out a few patients here or there. But in total, I don't think that was a material impact in the quarter. We have a very sophisticated approach to capital expenditures. We have capacity triggers. We have production triggers that we use in determining whether or not we should consider capital for a particular situation. And so that process continues. Nothing's changed. And we monitor that in the context of macros within the market, of strategic approach within the facility at a micro level, and all of that leads into a capital decision. Capital takes a while to get into the marketplace. On average, it's 18 to 30 months, depending on the project, because we're usually doing it to existing assets. So that timing gives us a bit of a hedge, also, I think, in deploying capital across the company. But it's -- specifically, you gave the example of East Florida and what we've done there. And a number of these projects that were -- have been approved, we packaged them up because we thought it was a very sizable commitment and a very effective message for constituents in that market. But -- the South Florida market is the largest health care demand market in HCA. Dallas is second. Houston is third. So Miami is a big market. We have the largest position in Miami with our market share globally. Our volumes, over the past 5 years, have grown significantly. Our census, our average daily census is up 25%. We have a number of our key institutions that are running 85% to 90% inpatient occupancy. Our emergency room visits over that time period have grown almost 250,000 visits or almost 50%. It's a large commercial market. So for us -- and when you look at the macros in South Florida, we believe we have to get capacity in play in order to sustain growth over time, and that's how we think about these investments. And this is just a very solid sort of microcosm, if you will, of a number of markets in a number of situations inside of HCA and how we approach it. So capital is a very important part of market share gains. It's very important part of constituency satisfaction, especially our position, and then obviously our patients in that they have the kind of facility presentation and technology they needed. And it continues to play a big part in our overall efforts to grow market share and position our company to be effective in delivering care and competitive in the marketplace."

So let's just say it's modestly down. That's a little bit below where we expected this year. I mean, the last 6 quarters have been incredibly strong, from a commercial demand standpoint, across all of our markets and then commercial volume inside of HCA. We knew that was going to taper. We just didn't know when exactly and how much. And I don't know that the second quarter is necessarily reflective of any near-term volume trend with respect to that. I mean, the second quarter last year was a very strong commercial volume growth, if I remember correctly, Bill, and so that was part of the challenge here. We have a couple of markets where there's been some trend changes. The observation issue in the Florida market impacted our admission statistics a bit and that's part of it. A couple of Texas markets have softened some, but not materially different than the company as a whole. In Las Vegas, 2 of our hospitals I mean, 2 of our competitors have now reentered a payer contract that previously they weren't in, so we lost a bit of commercial business there. So there's all these little components that play into our number. But I think the demand will normalize, and that trend, we think, in the short run to intermediate run on commercial ought to be somewhere between 1 and 2. We think overall demand is 2 to 2.5, potentially. But again, we're going to have to see some data in the first part of this year to fully validate those assumptions, but that's where we believe the trends are for the HCA markets."

Again, that's consistent recent past year terms. We're about 50% contracted on '18 similarly. As far as the components of that, we are -- I'm not seeing any substantial changes in structure or provisions inside of those agreements. On the observation status issue, it was more a Medicare Advantage issue than it was a non-Medicare issue, a little bit on the commercial, but not as much. It was more Medicare Advantage, but a little bit on the commercial because of that. We're not convinced yet that we're being equitably dealt with on some of those status, and you're working with the payers to get a more clinically driven protocol around those. And that, we believe, will normalize at some point. But nonetheless, that's out there as an issue, and it has been an issue, but it was a little more advanced, I think, in the second quarter. So that's the payer side. On the bundled payment issue, again, it's hard to have current data. This is a very sort of slow-moving data-driven process with the government. What I was speaking to was, in particular, on our rehab business, and only in a couple of markets have we seen the BPCI program, the bundled payment initiative pilot program, have a modest impact on referrals into our rehab centers. There have been some components of our participation in those pilots where we're seeing some modest adjustments in post-acute care referral patterns. Again, it's sort of spotty across the different components of post-acute. On the CJR side, it's way too early to be able to understand what the implications are there. We're just starting to get in the game. And again, we've seen some modest changes in referral patterns, but not to the point where, for HCA, we believe that compromises the opportunity to develop rehab service lines and fully integrate that into other components of our business. So orthopedics, as an example, is not the only driver of rehab business for HCA. Trauma is a driver. Real sciences are a driver. Outreach into the rural markets is a driver. So we have multiple drivers that deliver downstream rehab business. And so from that standpoint, you got a little bit of a drag with these bundled programs. But we still have a lot of business opportunity on the other side that justifies our investments. Rehab admissions for HCA are 1% of our total, so it doesn't really move the needle at all."

However, contract labor for the company has stabilized over the last 4 quarters and, actually, on a per unit basis, in the second quarter, was below the first quarter when we look at contract labor per adjusted patient day. RN retention is a big focus inside of our company right now. We have opportunities to enhance RN retention, and we're seeing early signs of improvement at a number of hospitals that we're focused on. We had a second workshop with other 20 hospitals inside of HCA, and we're optimistic that we'll start to see some leveraging of best practices and performance there that will, over time, I think, help address some of these challenges.

We couldn't put our fingers around exactly why it was as high as it was. But the second quarter was more on our historical trend, and it was very balanced between our hospital-based unit and our freestanding ambulatory surgery centers. Our growth is fairly broad-based across the different service lines in those centers and in our hospitals. We have a number of initiatives. Our OR choice initiative continues to yield value for it. And it's a satisfier for our physicians, and it's helping our patient flow, patient satisfaction. Secondly, we are in an acquisition mode on ambulatory surgery centers and endoscopic centers and have added, over the course of the last 12 to 18 months, quite a few additional units. And when you look at our composite non-same-store's ambulatory surgery center growth in the second quarter, I want to say it's about 4.5%, which reflects some of the acquisitions that we've done. And we believe them to be very strategic to physician alignment, greater outreach into commercial segments and just advancing our larger network of offerings across HCA's markets. So we're very pleased with the result in the second quarter and believe we still have opportunities to grow our outpatient surgery volumes with our different initiatives."

And we do think that's an accomplishment, given the continued intensity increases in volume growth that we've seen over that time. Our supply chain team as well as our field operators have done an outstanding job from a variety of aspects around supply chain. First, relative to our GPO and contracting, we still have momentum in the marketplace with HealthTrust Purchasing Group, and they continue to have a lot of strong performance. And then our supply chain operations are really a key component of our supply chain story. We've spoken recently of one of our recent initiatives around pharmacy consolidation, where we can help control the pharmacy stand in utilization of inventory. That is paying great dividends as that initiative is rolling through the marketplace. So we've also got initiatives in the operating suites as well as other initiatives around our performance improvement activities. So when you couple supply chain initiatives operationally with the contracting statuses we have going on, I think that's all leading to us being able to at least maintain our margins on a supply cost line and remain with stability. You do recall, last year, we did speak in the third quarter of some pharmacy cost elevation with our pharmacy cost for adjusted admission or adjusted patient day was elevated in the second and third quarter of last year, mainly due to some high-cost drugs that obviously had a lot of press around that. We've seen those supply cost trends moderate over the -- or the pharmacy cost trends moderate over the past couple of quarters in response to some of just the public pressure on those high-cost drugs. So that is also benefiting our year-over-year kind of comparison."

Fundamentally, the company has a strategy to enhance the clinical complexion of our facilities, and by that, I mean advance into deeper capabilities. In many markets, we are adding service lines, I'll call it, horizontally. We're bringing on new capabilities in cardiovascular care, oncology, pediatrics, whatever. And then vertically, we're deepening those capabilities inside of existing service lines, all intended on being able to keep a patient somewhere in the HCA system if they need deeper care and more complex care. So we support that out of our Clinical Services Group and out of our service line group up here in Nashville, where we can bring technology, we can bring best practices, we can bring a specialized talent to support that. So when I view the company's inpatient business, I anticipate it getting more acute and more complex over time. On the outpatient side, the company has had a very aggressive investment strategy over the last number of years. I think, Bill, our outpatient revenue is pushing 40% of our total. And so we balance out the $2.7 billion between inpatient capacity, outpatient surgical capacity, imaging capacity, clinical capacity for urgent care and then also for emergency room, which is a big piece of our outpatient strategy as well. So all of those pieces and parts are connected to, really, a balanced approach to building out our networks and being attractive to our patients and our physicians."

This is an area where I want to see HCA lead, and I'm very excited about the early returns on what we're seeing. Again, we've invested in the clinical data warehouse. You think about what's happened over the last several years with electronic health record and investments that HCA and other providers have made and moving now to a digital medical record, because that was step one. Now we have all this clinical information on this digital format, what do we do with it? And there's a lot we can do with it. I'm going to ask that Dr. Perlin to touch on a couple. But some things that we're doing around substance care and, really, drop in mortality rates in our hospitals shown substances is -- in saving lives, is really happening every -- it's happening today in our facilities. And so there's examples of like that. So it's -- again, we're investing in -- not only in terms of the technical side of that, but we're investing in the human resource side of that with hiring very talented data scientists to help us take advantage of this. And then you think you move on from the structured data that we have to the unstructured data, and that's the length of processing, and where we can move the needle there is, again, something for the future that I'm very excited about.

As Milton mentioned, it's really the gateway to improving the care for patients in real time in terms of substance, the ability to protect and even predict substance, #11 caused of death in the country ,#9 in hospitals, #3 in all ICUs and really allows us to do what Milton says, save lives. In that process, it also allows us to drive our processes more efficiently, especially in terms of labor, especially in terms of the resources used to provide care, the supplies. In [indiscernible] MDs and care teams would be bold and answer questions and drive our clinical integration forward in a science-driven fashion, as similar to [indiscernible], which is really a requisite for maximizing margin.

Numerous risks, uncertainties and other factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those that might be expressed today.

The company undertakes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information or future events.

I hope each of you had the opportunity to review HCA second quarter results released this morning. I'll make a few comments on the quarter and our thoughts on 2016, guidance and then turn the call over to Bill and Sam to provide more detail on the quarter's results. 
Net income attributable to HCA Holdings increased 29.8% to $658 million or $1.65 per diluted share, a 39.8% increase, compared to $507 million or $1.18 in the prior year second quarter. As noted in our second quarter release, we recognized a $44 million tax benefit or $0.11 per diluted share related to the early adoption of the new accounting standard, which reduced our provision for income taxes. Adjusted EBITDA totaled $2.052 billion, an increase of 2.2% over the prior year. 
We experienced volume growth in both our admissions and emergency room visits, although at a more modest growth rate as compared to recent quarters. Same facility admissions increased 0.6% while same facility equivalent admissions increased 1.6%. Same facility emergency room visits increased 4.1% over last year's second quarter. Inpatient and outpatient surgery volumes reflect solid growth over the second quarter of last year. Total surgery cases grew 1.6% on a same facility basis. Sam will provide additional comments on our volume trends in just a moment. 
Once again, we experienced strong growth in cash flows from operations totaling $1.349 billion compared to $1.057 billion in the prior year second quarter, an increase of 28%. We deployed $663 million to capital expenditures and $1.237 billion to repurchase 15.506 million shares, which included $750 million to repurchase 9.361 million shares from KKR during the quarter. We have repurchased a total of 24.427 million shares in 2016 at an average price of $76.04. We had approximately $750 million remaining on our $3 billion authorization at June 30, 2016.
And also during the quarter, we purchased 3 hospitals in the Dallas-Fort Worth and Austin, Texas markets, which we believe will broaden and strengthen our market growth into the future. We expect to see inpatient and outpatient services growth in our markets in the years ahead. We are committing capital to meet this increasing demand. For example, recently, we announced a $650 million capital commitment at our Miami-Dade, Palm Beach and St. Lucie County facilities to expand and upgrade our patient service offerings. This includes the construction of a new facility on the campus of Nova Southeastern University in Davie, Florida, along with several other expansion facility updates within the market. These investments will allow us to better serve our communities, respond to the growing demand for health care services and provide the highest level of patient care experience. 
I want to take a minute to recognize a number of senior appointments we've announced over the past quarter, all of whom have been promoted from within HCA. Due to retirements, we have named 3 new division presidents. In addition, we announced a new senior vice president of employer and payer engagement. These are all seasoned professionals with many years of experience in their discipline in HCA. They know our culture, they understand our business strategies, and I am extremely pleased that we have a deep bench to ensure strong continuity. So congratulations to all of them. 
Now moving to 2016 guidance. Primarily due to volume growth at the low end of our expectations during the first 6 months of 2016, we are revising our full year 2016 guidance expectations. As noted in this morning's earnings release, our revenue range is now estimated to be between $41 and $42 billion, adjusted EBITDA is now expected to range between $8.1 billion and $8.3 billion and our adjusted EPS range is now estimated between $6.40 to $6.70 per diluted share, reflecting increased net income, share repurchase and the favorable impact of change in accounting standard, which lowered our tax rate for the first 6 months of 2016. Our balance for capital expenditures for 2016 remains around $2.7 billion. 
So with that, I'll turn the call over to Bill."

And I will add to Milton's comments and provide more detail on our performance and our health reform trends in the quarter. As we reported, in the second quarter, our same facility admissions increased 0.6% over prior year and equivalent admissions increased 1.6%. 
Sam will provide more commentary on volume in a moment, but I'll give you some trends by payer class. During the second quarter, same facility Medicare admissions and equivalent admissions increased 1.2% and 2.1%, respectively. This includes both traditional and managed Medicare. Managed Medicare admissions increased 3.9% on a same facility basis and now represent 33.5% of our total Medicare admissions. Same facility Medicaid admissions and equivalent admissions increased 0.5% and 2.1%, respectively, in the quarter, which is fairly consistent with our recent trends. 
Same facility self-pay and charity admissions increased 5.7% in the quarter, and they represent 7.5% of total admissions compared to 7.1% in the second quarter of last year. Year-to-date, our same facility uninsured admissions are up 7.8% from the same period last year. 
Managed care and other, which include exchange, admissions declined 1.6%, and equivalent admissions declined 0.8% on the same facility basis in the second quarter compared with the prior year. On a year-to-date basis, same facility managed, other and exchange admissions are flat with prior year, and equivalent admissions are up 0.9%. Same facility emergency room business increased 4.1% in the quarter compared to the prior year, and our same facility self-pay and charity ER visits represent 19.4% of our total ER visits in the quarter compared to 19.3% last year. 
Intensity of services, or acuity, increased in the quarter with our same facility case mix increasing 3.9% compared to the prior year period. Same facility surgeries increased 1.6% in the quarter, the same facility inpatient surgeries increased 1.8% and outpatient surgeries increasing 1.5% in the prior year. Same facility revenue for equivalent admission increased 2.1%. 
Same facility managed care and other, including exchange revenue per equivalent admission, increased 5.8% in the quarter. Same facility charity care and uninsured discounts increased $863 million in the quarter compared to the prior year. Same facility charity care discounts totaled $1.097 billion in the quarter, an increase of $207 million from the prior year period, while same facility uninsured discounts totaled $3.085 billion, an increase of $656 million over the prior year period. Our total uncompensated care trends, which include bad debts, charity and uninsured business, combined, have been consistent over the past 4 quarters. 
Now turning to expenses. Expense management in the quarter was good. Same facility operating expense per equivalent admission increased 2.4% compared to last year's second quarter. Our consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted per share-based comp and EHR incentive income, is 20.5% for the quarter compared to 20.7% in the second quarter of last year. Sequentially, it has increased 40 basis points from the first quarter of this year. 
Same facility salaries per equivalent admission increased 2.4% compared to last year's second quarter. Salaries and benefits as a percentage of revenue increased 10 basis points compared to the second quarter of 2015. 
Same facility supply expense per equivalent admission increased 0.9% for the second quarter compared to the prior year period, reflecting growth in surgical volumes. And the impact of this volume growth was offset by several supply chain initiative that we have implemented, and this helped leads the supply cost revenue to improve 20 basis points versus the prior year period. 
Other operating expenses as a percent of revenues increased 30 basis points from last year's second quarter to 18.0% of revenues, primarily reflecting an increase in our year-over-year professional fee that we discussed on our first quarter call. However, other operating expenses as a percentage of revenue has remained level through the past 4 quarters. We recognized $5 million electronic health record income in the quarter compared to $18 million in last year's second quarter, consistent with our expectations. 
Let me touch briefly on cash flows. We had another strong quarter with cash flows from operations totaling $1.349 billion. Year-to-date, cash flows from operations, $2.748 billion or a 32.4% increase from prior year. Cash flow from operations is benefited by $118 million on a year-to-date basis due to the adoption of the accounting policy around excess tax benefits related to the settlement of equity awards. 
At the end of the quarter, we had approximately $1.98 billion available under our revolving credit facilities. Debt to adjusted EBITDA was 3.93x at June 30, 2016, compared with 3.85x at December 31, '15. 
I also want to highlight our earnings per share results. For the quarter, our diluted earnings per share before considering losses on retirement of debt, legal claim costs and gain on losses of sales of facilities increased to $1.66 per diluted share from $1.37 in the prior year period. When adjusted for the $0.11 benefit due to the adopting of the new accounting policy, represents a 13% growth over prior year in the quarter. These strong cash flow trends, balance sheet position and EPS growth results highlight an important strength of the company. 
Let me touch briefly on health care reform. Health reform activity continued to grow in the quarter. In the second quarter, we saw approximately 13,300 same facility exchange admissions as compared with the 11,600 we saw in the second quarter of last year or a 15% year-over-year growth. You may recall, we saw about 12,500 exchange admissions in the first quarter. We saw approximately 54,000 same facility exchange ER visits in the second quarter compared to just under 45,000 in the second quarter of 2015 and just under 50,000 in the first quarter of 2016. So overall, these reform trends are tracking in line with our expectations. 
So that concludes my remarks, and I'll turn the call over to Sam for some additional comments."

Let me begin by giving you some of the quarterly volumes that I normally provide on each call. Once again, the company continued to have broad-based growth across our markets and broad-based growth across various service lines that make up our business. 
For our domestic operations, on a same facility basis, 10 of 14 divisions had growth in admissions, 11 of 14 divisions had growth in adjusted admissions and 12 of 14 divisions had growth in emergency room visits. Freestanding emergency room visits grew 27% and accounted for approximately 50% of our overall ER growth. Hospital-based emergency room visits grew 2.2%. 
In addition to the strong portfolio performance, the company's growth across its diversified service lines was also strong. For domestic operations, on a same facility basis, inpatient surgeries grew 1.7%, which increased surgical admissions to 28.6% of total in the quarter, an increase of 130 basis points. Surgical volumes were particularly strong in cardiovascular, orthopedics and general surgery categories. Outpatient surgeries grew by 1.4%. Both components of this service line, hospital-based and our freestanding ambulatory division, had solid growth. Also, same facility outpatient endoscopic procedures grew 1.6%. 
Behavioral health admissions grew 3.7%. Rehab admissions grew 1.2%. Cardiology procedure volumes grew approximately 2%. Trauma volumes grew 14%. Observation visits were up 7.5%, and finally, the company's urgent care visit on a non-same facility basis grew 11%. Two related service lines experienced declines in the quarter. Deliveries were down 1.5% in the quarter, and neonatal admissions declined 2.6%. Overall, average length of stay increased 0.6%. This was driven mainly by the growth in our acuity or case mix index. We believe our efforts in developing a more comprehensive and complex level of services across our provider networks are driving this increase. 
I would also note that our inpatient market share for the year ended 2015 showed that HCA continued to gain share in total and across most of its market. As stated earlier, our volume growth, in particular, inpatient admissions, was at the lower end of our expectations. Most of this can be attributed to 3 areas. But before I explain them, it is important to note that the second quarter last year was very strong and presented a difficult comparison with inpatient admissions up 4.1% and adjusted admissions up 4.9%. 
First, growth in emergency room visits in our hospital-based units slowed as compared to the past few years. As a result, downstream growth in inpatient admission through the ER was not as strong as compared to recent quarters. We believe most of this softness can be explained by 3 factors: first, a slowing in demand growth to more normal rates; second, new competition in several markets; and third, in a couple of our Florida markets, we experienced a change in how certain Medicare Advantage payer classified their patients between inpatient admission and observation status. The company continues to execute a comprehensive agenda to grow our emergency room business, which we believe is a service line with strong overall demand growth. 
Second, growth in our behavioral and rehab service lines was also recent trends [ph]. We believe this issue is mostly a result of capacity constraints caused by clinical staffing and a lack of beds at a few of our behavioral units. On the rehab side of our business, the issues are not as easily categorized. We have not opened as many units this year as compared to past years, and we have seen some modest impact in a few markets from the CMS bundled payment initiative. We continue to invest in and recruit talents for these service lines, and we believe they have solid growth prospects in many of our markets. 
And finally, women's and children submissions were down as I indicated previously. The primary reasons are, one, broad-based softness in delivery with further downstream decline in neonatal admissions, some competitive issues in a few markets and general declines in pediatric volume due to a milder respiratory season as compared to last year. These services continue to be an important part of our overall network strategy, and we believe the company is well positioned to compete effectively in these areas. 
All-in-all, the company continues to have solid top line growth and sustain market share gains. Our growth agenda is comprehensive. It is well resourced for capital spending and marketing, and we continue to execute at a high level. We believe the company has solid growth prospects across a uniquely diversified portfolio of markets and service lines, and we believe our local provider system are well positioned to capitalize on them. 
With that, let me turn the call back to Vic."

If I could just recap and then ask the question. First, I think what we're seeing here is still growth across a broad range of types of admissions and payer types, but softer than you had expected. I think I heard you say managed care admissions were down. So I'd like some explanation of that, where it happens and whether or not it's likely to be sustained. Third, we heard you, on the other side of this, talk about the capacity constraints, and I'm wondering to what extent your capacity constraints is limiting your near-term growth and what your plans are for investing to -- beyond Florida, what you've announced, to offset that. And then fourth, you have this fact that you are investing in capacity. So there's a bit of a mixed message here, the way I'm seeing it, that, yes, on the one hand, you're pulling in guidance prudently to reflect a little bit less strength, but still growth. On the other hand, I hear what you're saying about investing at capacity. So it sounds that there might be a demand story here and a continued execution story. Bill, can you tell us what we should think about the near-term pushes and pulls versus the long-term growth expectations you have for volumes and how we should think about the company in that context?"

What we're seeing is we were still seeing growth in longer-term historical standards, I think very solid growth, and that's -- hopefully, we're expressing that this morning. But by recent growth standards, we're seeing it slowing. We went through, over the past 5 or 6 quarters, growth that was exceptional, and we saw demand in our markets growing. And we suspect -- although, as you know, our market share data lags about 6 months, but we suspect we're going to see some slowing demand in many of our markets, and that's why we're seeing it show up in our numbers. That being said, we still have a great outlook and a very optimistic outlook for the long term in our markets. Our markets are growing in terms of population, and I think we'll continue to see demand in our markets. And so we're going to invest to meet that expected demand. And we have certain markets, I know Sam can give some color like on the South Florida markets, where we announced the $650 million investment, why we're doing that. And Sam can describe that to you just -- in just a minute. But we still think our markets -- we're well positioned in our markets, and we're going to invest to make sure we stay well positioned in these excellent markets in which we operate.

There are pockets where we clearly know that it's difficult day in and day out to manage the capacity challenges, and that could, in fact, squeeze out a few patients here or there. But in total, I don't think that was a material impact in the quarter. We have a very sophisticated approach to capital expenditures. We have capacity triggers. We have production triggers that we use in determining whether or not we should consider capital for a particular situation. And so that process continues. Nothing's changed. And we monitor that in the context of macros within the market, of strategic approach within the facility at a micro level, and all of that leads into a capital decision. Capital takes a while to get into the marketplace. On average, it's 18 to 30 months, depending on the project, because we're usually doing it to existing assets. So that timing gives us a bit of a hedge, also, I think, in deploying capital across the company. But it's -- specifically, you gave the example of East Florida and what we've done there. And a number of these projects that were -- have been approved, we packaged them up because we thought it was a very sizable commitment and a very effective message for constituents in that market. But -- the South Florida market is the largest health care demand market in HCA. Dallas is second. Houston is third. So Miami is a big market. We have the largest position in Miami with our market share globally. Our volumes, over the past 5 years, have grown significantly. Our census, our average daily census is up 25%. We have a number of our key institutions that are running 85% to 90% inpatient occupancy. Our emergency room visits over that time period have grown almost 250,000 visits or almost 50%. It's a large commercial market. So for us -- and when you look at the macros in South Florida, we believe we have to get capacity in play in order to sustain growth over time, and that's how we think about these investments. And this is just a very solid sort of microcosm, if you will, of a number of markets in a number of situations inside of HCA and how we approach it. So capital is a very important part of market share gains. It's very important part of constituency satisfaction, especially our position, and then obviously our patients in that they have the kind of facility presentation and technology they needed. And it continues to play a big part in our overall efforts to grow market share and position our company to be effective in delivering care and competitive in the marketplace."

So let's just say it's modestly down. That's a little bit below where we expected this year. I mean, the last 6 quarters have been incredibly strong, from a commercial demand standpoint, across all of our markets and then commercial volume inside of HCA. We knew that was going to taper. We just didn't know when exactly and how much. And I don't know that the second quarter is necessarily reflective of any near-term volume trend with respect to that. I mean, the second quarter last year was a very strong commercial volume growth, if I remember correctly, Bill, and so that was part of the challenge here. We have a couple of markets where there's been some trend changes. The observation issue in the Florida market impacted our admission statistics a bit and that's part of it. A couple of Texas markets have softened some, but not materially different than the company as a whole. In Las Vegas, 2 of our hospitals I mean, 2 of our competitors have now reentered a payer contract that previously they weren't in, so we lost a bit of commercial business there. So there's all these little components that play into our number. But I think the demand will normalize, and that trend, we think, in the short run to intermediate run on commercial ought to be somewhere between 1 and 2. We think overall demand is 2 to 2.5, potentially. But again, we're going to have to see some data in the first part of this year to fully validate those assumptions, but that's where we believe the trends are for the HCA markets."

Again, that's consistent recent past year terms. We're about 50% contracted on '18 similarly. As far as the components of that, we are -- I'm not seeing any substantial changes in structure or provisions inside of those agreements. On the observation status issue, it was more a Medicare Advantage issue than it was a non-Medicare issue, a little bit on the commercial, but not as much. It was more Medicare Advantage, but a little bit on the commercial because of that. We're not convinced yet that we're being equitably dealt with on some of those status, and you're working with the payers to get a more clinically driven protocol around those. And that, we believe, will normalize at some point. But nonetheless, that's out there as an issue, and it has been an issue, but it was a little more advanced, I think, in the second quarter. So that's the payer side. On the bundled payment issue, again, it's hard to have current data. This is a very sort of slow-moving data-driven process with the government. What I was speaking to was, in particular, on our rehab business, and only in a couple of markets have we seen the BPCI program, the bundled payment initiative pilot program, have a modest impact on referrals into our rehab centers. There have been some components of our participation in those pilots where we're seeing some modest adjustments in post-acute care referral patterns. Again, it's sort of spotty across the different components of post-acute. On the CJR side, it's way too early to be able to understand what the implications are there. We're just starting to get in the game. And again, we've seen some modest changes in referral patterns, but not to the point where, for HCA, we believe that compromises the opportunity to develop rehab service lines and fully integrate that into other components of our business. So orthopedics, as an example, is not the only driver of rehab business for HCA. Trauma is a driver. Real sciences are a driver. Outreach into the rural markets is a driver. So we have multiple drivers that deliver downstream rehab business. And so from that standpoint, you got a little bit of a drag with these bundled programs. But we still have a lot of business opportunity on the other side that justifies our investments. Rehab admissions for HCA are 1% of our total, so it doesn't really move the needle at all."

However, contract labor for the company has stabilized over the last 4 quarters and, actually, on a per unit basis, in the second quarter, was below the first quarter when we look at contract labor per adjusted patient day. RN retention is a big focus inside of our company right now. We have opportunities to enhance RN retention, and we're seeing early signs of improvement at a number of hospitals that we're focused on. We had a second workshop with other 20 hospitals inside of HCA, and we're optimistic that we'll start to see some leveraging of best practices and performance there that will, over time, I think, help address some of these challenges.

So we're very pleased with the result in the second quarter and believe we still have opportunities to grow our outpatient surgery volumes with our different initiatives."

And we do think that's an accomplishment, given the continued intensity increases in volume growth that we've seen over that time. Our supply chain team as well as our field operators have done an outstanding job from a variety of aspects around supply chain. First, relative to our GPO and contracting, we still have momentum in the marketplace with HealthTrust Purchasing Group, and they continue to have a lot of strong performance. And then our supply chain operations are really a key component of our supply chain story. We've spoken recently of one of our recent initiatives around pharmacy consolidation, where we can help control the pharmacy stand in utilization of inventory. That is paying great dividends as that initiative is rolling through the marketplace. So we've also got initiatives in the operating suites as well as other initiatives around our performance improvement activities. So when you couple supply chain initiatives operationally with the contracting statuses we have going on, I think that's all leading to us being able to at least maintain our margins on a supply cost line and remain with stability. You do recall, last year, we did speak in the third quarter of some pharmacy cost elevation with our pharmacy cost for adjusted admission or adjusted patient day was elevated in the second and third quarter of last year, mainly due to some high-cost drugs that obviously had a lot of press around that. We've seen those supply cost trends moderate over the -- or the pharmacy cost trends moderate over the past couple of quarters in response to some of just the public pressure on those high-cost drugs. So that is also benefiting our year-over-year kind of comparison."

And we're investing and we have invested heavily on this because we see it, as I'll call it, a game changer for health care. This is an area where I want to see HCA lead, and I'm very excited about the early returns on what we're seeing. Again, we've invested in the clinical data warehouse. You think about what's happened over the last several years with electronic health record and investments that HCA and other providers have made and moving now to a digital medical record, because that was step one. Now we have all this clinical information on this digital format, what do we do with it? And there's a lot we can do with it. I'm going to ask that Dr. Perlin to touch on a couple. But some things that we're doing around substance care and, really, drop in mortality rates in our hospitals shown substances is -- in saving lives, is really happening every -- it's happening today in our facilities. And so there's examples of like that. So it's -- again, we're investing in -- not only in terms of the technical side of that, but we're investing in the human resource side of that with hiring very talented data scientists to help us take advantage of this. And then you think you move on from the structured data that we have to the unstructured data, and that's the length of processing, and where we can move the needle there is, again, something for the future that I'm very excited about. So Dr. Perlin's here. Jon, why don't you go a little more detail on that area?"

In essence, really, we're at the point where we can begin to realize what we consider the digital dividend, how meaningful it is. I mean, as [indiscernible] say, it's always been very operations constraint-driven in its management business decisions. Every aspect of our clinical care can be captured, and we can understand that to drive better clinical and operational business decisions. As Milton mentioned, it's really the gateway to improving the care for patients in real time in terms of substance, the ability to protect and even predict substance, #11 cause of death in the country ,#9 in hospitals, #3 in all ICUs and really allows us to do what Milton says, save lives. In that process, it also allows us to drive our processes more efficiently, especially in terms of labor, especially in terms of the resources used to provide care, the supplies. In [indiscernible] MDs and care teams would be bold and answer questions and drive our clinical integration forward in a science-driven fashion, as similar to [indiscernible], which is really a requisite for maximizing margin. Now the current reimbursement don't -- really, it's the predicate for success in bundles in the future. It's finally the doorway to really personalize [indiscernible] in precision medicine.

Numerous risks, uncertainties and other factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those that might be expressed today. Many of these factors are listed in today's press release and in our various SEC filings. 
Several other factors that will determine the company's future results are beyond the ability of the company to control or predict. In light of the significant uncertainties inherent in any forward-looking statements, you should not replace undue reliance on these statements. The company undertakes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information or future events. 
On this morning's call, we may reference measures, such as adjusted EBITDA and net income attributable to HCA Holdings, Inc., excluding losses or gains or on sales of facilities, losses on retirement of debt and legal claims, which are non-GAAP financial measures. A table providing supplemental information on adjusted EBITDA and reconciling to net income attributable to HCA Holdings, Inc. to adjusted EBITDA is included in the company's third quarter earnings release.

I trust most of you had the opportunity to review our third quarter results released this morning. I'll make a couple of comments on the quarter, touch on a couple of other topics, then turn the call over to Bill and Sam to provide more detail on our third quarter results. 
I'm very pleased with our overall performance and execution in the quarter. We continued to use our free cash flow to invest in our market to support future growth, and we returned cash to shareholders through share repurchase. 
Let me touch on the results for the quarter at a high level. The company experienced a solid quarter, with revenues for the third quarter totaling $10.27 billion, a 4.2% increase in the prior year, driven by 1.5% equivalent admission increase and a 2.7% net revenue per equivalent admission increase in the fourth quarter. 
Net income attributable to HCA Holdings totaled $618 million, an increase of 37.7%, while earnings per diluted share totaled $1.59 per diluted share or $1.61 per diluted share before gains on the sale of facilities, losses on retirement of debt and legal claim cost. 
Earnings per diluted share for HCA Holdings record gains or losses on sales, losses on retirement of debt and legal claims costs increased 37.6% compared to the prior year. As noted in our release this morning, the company also recognized a reduction in the its provision for income taxes due to the adoption of a new accounting policy on equity award settlements of $11 million or $0.03 per diluted share and $51 million or $0.13 per diluted share from the completion of IRS review of the company's 2011 and 2012 federal income tax returns. 
Adjusted EBITDA totaled $1.957 billion in the third quarter compared to $1.815 billion last year, an increase of 7.8% over the prior year period. 
We had another solid quarter for cash flows from operations resulting in $1.206 billion compared to $1.101 billion in last year's third quarter, a 9.5% increase. We deployed $712 million for capital expenditures and $355 million to repurchase 4.637 million shares. We have repurchased a total of 29.064 million shares in 2016 at an average cost of $76.16 per share. And we had $309 million remaining on our $3 billion authorization at September 30, 2016. We expect to complete the remaining authorization by the end of the year. 
Let me provide an update on recent Hurricane Matthew on our Florida and South Carolina facilities. We experienced some minor disruption leading up to and during the storm. However, we came through the event without any major issues. I commend our entire team for their preparation and planning in anticipation of the hurricane, which minimized any disruption of service to our patients. 
And yesterday, we announced an agreement with the University Hospital Authority and Trust for the early termination of HCA's lease of the Children's Hospital at Oklahoma University Medical Center and also the termination of our joint operating agreement. In addition to the termination, HCA will transfer ownership of its hospital operations in Oklahoma, which includes 2 other hospitals, the University Hospital Authority and Trust. Under the agreement, HCA will receive $750 million in consideration, and the transaction is expected to be completed in the first half of 2017. 
So with that, let me turn the call over to Bill and Sam for additional details in the quarter."

I will add to Milton's comments and provide more detail on our performance and results for the third quarter. As we reported, in the third quarter, our same facility admissions increased 0.7% over the prior year, and equivalent admissions increased 1.3%. Year to date, equivalent admissions were up 2% over the prior year. Sam will provide more comments around volume in a moment and views and trends by payer class. 
During the third quarter, same facility Medicare admissions and equivalent admissions increased 1.8% and 2.5%, respectively. This includes both traditional and managed Medicare. Managed Medicare admissions increased 3.4% on a same facility basis and represents 33.5% of our total Medicare admissions. On a year-to-date basis, Medicare equivalent admissions are up 2.2% over the prior year. 
Same facility Medicaid admissions and equivalent admissions increased 2.3% and 3.4%, respectively, in the quarter, fairly consistent with our recent trends and our year-to-date growth of equivalent admissions of 3.2%. 
Same facility self-pay and charity admissions increased 0.7% in the quarter. They represent 8% of our total admissions, which was unchanged from last year's third quarter. Year-to-date, our same facility uninsured admissions are up 5.2% from the same period last year. 
Managed care and other, including exchange admissions, declined 1.8% and equivalent admissions declined 1.4% on a same facility basis in the third quarter. However, on a year-to-date basis, same facility managed, other and exchange equivalent admissions remain slightly up. 
Same facility emergency room visits increased 2.7% in the quarter compared to the prior year. Same facility self-pay and charity ER visits represent 20.1% of our total ER visits in the quarter compared to 20.5% last year. On a year-to-date basis, same facility emergency room visits have increased 4.6%. 
Intensity of service or acuity increased in the quarter with our same facility case mix increasing 4.7% compared to the prior year period. Same facility revenue per equivalent admission increased 2.7%. Managed care and other, including exchange revenue per equivalent admission, is turning consistent with prior periods. When adjusted for certain items, it grew approximately 6.5% in the quarter and 6.7% year-to-date. 
Same facility charity care and uninsured discounts increased $639 million in the quarter compared to the prior year. Same facility charity care discounts totaled $1.042 billion in the quarter, an increase of $118 million from the prior year period, while same facility uninsured discounts totaled $3.295 billion, an increase of $521 million over the prior year period. 
Now turning to expenses. Expense management in the quarter was very good and led to a 70 basis point margin expansion as compared to the prior year. Same facility operating expense per equivalent admission increased 1.9% compared to last year's third quarter. Our consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin was 19.1% for the quarter as compared to 18.4% in the third quarter of last year. 
Same facility salaries per equivalent admission increased 1.4% compared to last year's third quarter. Salaries and benefits as a percent of revenues decreased 80 basis points compared to the third quarter of 2015. Same facility supply expense per equivalent admission increased 1.5% for the third quarter compared to the prior year. And supply cost as a percent of revenue improved 20 basis points versus prior year. 
Other operating expenses as a percent of revenues increased 30 basis points from last year's third quarter to 18.5% of revenue, primarily reflecting an increase in year-over-year professional fees that we discussed on our last 2 calls. 
Let me touch briefly on cash flow. We had another strong quarter with cash flows from operations just over $1.2 billion. Year-to-date, cash flows from operations were $3.954 billion, which is a $778 million increase or a 24.5% growth from prior year. Cash flow from operations is benefited by $129 million on a year-to-date basis due to the adoption of the accounting policy around the excess tax benefit related to the settlement of equity awards. 
At the end of the quarter, we had approximately $2.050 billion available under our revolving credit facilities. Debt to adjusted EBITDA was 3.86x at September 30, 2016 compared to 3.85x at December 31, '15. 
I also want to highlight our earnings per share results. For the quarter, our diluted earnings per share, excluding losses on retirement of debt, legal claim cost and gains or losses on sales of facilities, increased 37.6% to $1.61 per diluted share from $1.17 in the prior year period. As indicated in our release, EPS for the quarter does include a $0.03 benefit due to adopting the new accounting policy and a $0.13 benefit from the IRS exempt settlement. These strong cash flows, balance sheet position and EPS growth results highlight an important strength of the company. 
Let me touch briefly on health reform. Health reform activity continued to grow over the prior year in the quarter. In the third quarter, we saw approximately 13,000 same facility exchange admissions as compared to approximately 11,500 in the third quarter of last year or a 13% year-over-year growth. You may recall, we saw about 13,300 exchange admissions in the second quarter. We saw 49,000 same facility exchange ER visits in the third quarter compared to 40,700 in the third quarter of '15 and 54,000 in the second quarter of 2016. So overall, these reform trends are tracking in line with our expectations and have been very stable over the past several quarters. 
So that concludes my remarks, and I'll turn the call over to Sam for some additional comments."

Let me begin by giving you some of the quarterly volume stats that I normally provide on these calls. Once again, the company continued to have broad-based growth across our markets and wide-ranging growth across the various facilities and s",742,"Good morning. Let me begin by giving you some of the quarterly volume stats that I normally provide on these calls. Once again, the company continued to have broad-based growth across our markets and wide-ranging growth across the various facilities and service lines that make up our business. 
For our domestic operations, on a same facility basis, 10 of 14 divisions had growth in admissions, 10 of 14 divisions had growth in adjusted admissions and 12 of 14 divisions had growth in emergency room visits. Freestanding emergency room visits grew 12.5% and accounted for approximately 40% of our overall ER growth. Hospital-based emergency room visits grew 1.8%. 
In addition to the solid portfolio performance across our 42 markets, the company's growth across its diversified service lines was also strong. For domestic operations, on a same facility basis, inpatient surgeries grew 0.9%, which increased surgical admissions to 28.6% of total admissions in the quarter, an increase of 100 basis points as compared to last year. Surgical volumes were particularly strong again this quarter in cardiovascular, orthopedics and general surgery categories. Outpatient surgeries were slightly down in the quarter by 0.3%. Hospital-based outpatient surgical volumes declined 0.9%, while volumes increased 0.4% in our freestanding ambulatory surgery divisions. This softness was felt across multiple service lines and across many markets, and we were not able to identify any particular issue that drove the softness. 
Behavioral health admissions grew 1.5%. The issue with physician staffing shortages that we discussed last quarter was still the primary driver of the slower growth in this service line. 3 of our largest behavioral hospital units have staffing challenges. And without them, the company's admits [ph] in this service line would have been up 4.5%. 
Rehab admissions grew 4.3%, which was an acceleration of the growth rate as compared to the first half of the year. 
Deliveries were down 0.9% in the quarter. Again, this decline was concentrated in Medicaid deliveries. Neonatal admissions increased 1.5%, which is an improvement over the growth rate in the first half of the year. Cardiology procedure volumes grew approximately 4%. Trauma volumes grew almost 15%. Observation visits were up 5%. And finally, the company's urgent care visits, in total, grew 11.7%. The company currently has 71 centers. At this time last year, we had 50 centers. 
All in all, we had another good quarter of volume growth. However, the overall growth rate was not as high as we had planned. It is important to note that the third quarter last year was also a relatively strong volume quarter and presented a difficult comparison with inpatient admits up 2.9% and adjusted admissions up 3.6%. 
We believe this deceleration in the growth rate was primarily attributable to the following 2 reasons.  First, overall demand growth in inpatient services has moderated. When we study market data from the fourth quarter of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016, inpatient demand in our markets grew 1.7% for this 6-month period. This rate was down from the previous 5 quarters' average growth of approximately 3.5%, but is generally consistent with our longer-term view of inpatient demand growth, which is approximately 2% annually in HCA markets. 
Before I get into the details on the second reason, I want to indicate that the company grew its market share, albeit at a slower pace, for the 12 months ended March 31, 2016. 55% of our markets gained share during this period as compared to 68% of our markets in 2014. 
The second reason can be explained by growing competition in certain areas of our business. In particular, a growing supply of freestanding emergency rooms by independent companies and health systems in various Texas and Colorado markets has had an impact on emergency room visits and some downstream admissions. Also, in a couple of our Florida markets, we continue to be challenged with Medicare advantage health plan that classified emergency room patients as observation patients instead of inpatient admissions. 
Overall, we believe HCA has a comprehensive growth agenda and our execution remains strong. We continue to invest significantly in our growth agenda with increasing capital spending, coordinated marketing strategy and multiple human resource programs, including medical staff development. 
In sum, we believe the company has solid growth prospects across its uniquely diversified portfolio of markets and service lines, and we believe our local provider systems are well positioned to capitalize on these opportunities. 
With that, let me to turn the call back to Vic."

I think, Sheryl -- I mean, we had a relationship that dates back in 1998 with, I'll say, the University of Oklahoma. It's a more complicated structure than that because of how the state had to do a transaction with us. But we've had this relationship since 1998. And when the hospitals came together, there were a lot of challenges both for HCA and the University Hospital. When you look at where we are today, which is almost 20 years past, this has been a remarkable success from, I think, everybody's standpoint in a very innovative public-private partnership. And so there's been a lot of investment, a lot of new programs, market share gains and so forth that really benefited the system. The way the deal was structured, it was structured as a lease. And we were in a situation, as was the hospital there, where we needed additional capital. And unfortunately, the other side was not in a position to extend the lease in any significant way that allowed us to get comfortable in making the kind of investment that needed to be made. So it was felt by both parties that it was better to go ahead and start the unwind [ph] now so it could be orderly for both sides of the equation, and that's where we wound up announcing this transaction yesterday. It was a complicated deal to get into and a complicated deal to get out because it was very intricately structured. So that does allow us, in the context of what we needed to make as an investment there, coupled with the type of lease that we had, to look at repositioning the capital to be at source for whatever we wanted to do, whether it was more capital expenditures or other components of our capital allocation strategy. And so it does fit into that. And I think that's part of what we considered as we went through our negotiations and our strategic analysis of this particular market."

In addition to that, we compare historically to a longer view to see what the patterns have been in our market on a historical basis, and we try to merge those 2 views into our company thinking and company view right now. And that's where we get to the 2% demand on the inpatient side. We think outpatient demand has a little bit more growth than that. So that process is consistent, and that's where we have landed on our view. There's nothing to suggest the 1 quarter in this particular year that, that particular view is off. And so we're relatively confident today. We haven't finished our analysis for all of 2017 and on that anything materially has changed. I think one thing that's positive in the overall demand is that commercial demand continues to be reasonably solid inside of HCA's markets in these 2 periods that I discussed in total. And so that's an encouraging metric that suggests our portfolio of market still has reasonable growth on the commercial side. Obviously, there's puts and takes to that. But that particular metric, I think, gives us some confidence as well that our markets are still relatively healthy and present a reasonable opportunity for growth for the company."

And in that particular strategy, we feel pretty good about how we place those. We see the urgent care as an additional lap around, if you will, our freestanding emergency room strategy, where there are certain components of certain markets where urgent care is the best answer because of either competitive hospital systems or other freestanding emergency room, and it provides a component that wraps around our freestanding emergency room or hospital emergency room strategy. So there's a blend of what the right facility is for the right situation. There's population, there's traffic, there's location of other hospitals in other freestanding emergency rooms. And we go through this process of mapping out the market and determining what exactly is the right fit and how we go about building this network further. In some respects, we try to build an urgent care strategy around our emergency room strategy, which is built around our hospital strategy. So it's almost a concentric circle of facilities that create a fairly broad HCA network in these large markets, allowing our patients to enter the system in different forms or different fashions and also creating relatively favorable price points, if you will, for our payers where they can direct, if they feel they need to direct, but keep them in the HCA system. So it's hard to give you specifics because we have to look at the individual markets, but those are some of the general approaches that we take."

I also believe it's important to know, we've shared this in various investor meetings during the course of the year, but we got data that suggests there's almost 4 million people in our markets that are eligible for subsidies that have yet to participate. And so we're somewhat optimistic that some of those remaining eligible people may find their ways in enrollment. In terms of plan exiting, most of our major markets, if not all of our major markets, there's another plan offering to catch those lives.

I mean, everybody understands the implication of the commercial book. And so there's significant competition in that particular area. But what HCA is doing structurally to compete in those environments is similar to what we just talked about, how we create outreach into these commercial segments, through outpatient facility, through freestanding emergency room, through growth in our outpatient surgical platforms, where we can start to develop relationships with our patients in a way that allow them to be connected and loyal to the HCA system. Additionally, with our position strategies, we are very targeted and working with our physicians who have commercial books of business to expand their capabilities, allowing us to reach further into those particular arenas and hopefully drive downstream businesses. And then finally working with our health plan to come up with ways to help them grow in a way that benefits our system. So I think our overall approach is built around the basics of our growth architecture, including where we deploy capital expenditures. We focus our capital on those facilities that have great opportunities in commercial market, or an outpatient facilities in commercial market. So that's a part of our screening, if you will, for deploying capital, because the return prospects are greater in those particular scenarios. But our competitors do that, too. So it's a very competitive landscape and there are movements in and out periodically from who's gaining and who's losing in those environments. But we're very comfortable with the approach and how we have deployed it. We think there are new opportunities with customer relationship management through digital technologies, patient navigation and other ways to differentiate HCA further, and we are continuing to invest in those initiatives as well. And we think we've got opportunities to respond to this dynamic i n this market as we move further -- move [indiscernible] sorry."

And we've estimated over time that there may be 50 basis points of add-on, if you will, to the adjusted admissions factor. So it puts you in that 2.5% growth as maybe a demand growth for adjusted admissions. Obviously, the emergency room is the big piece of that, outpatient surgery is the second largest piece of that component. And then it drops off from there where it's not a segment. It is those 2 when you start looking at the outpatient market. With respect to our market share trends, historically you're correct. We've tended to average 25 to 40 basis points per year of company-wide market share growth. That has slowed a little bit because we've seen more suppliers in certain components of our businesses, as I indicated in my commentary. And then we've seen other components of our strategy, if you will, replicated. So we have to up their game, and that's what we're doing. Our teams are challenged with coming up with innovative ways to deal with the competitive dynamic that are taking place within our markets. Again, we're leveraging great idea from one market to the other to help the company stay ahead of our competition where we can. And we think some of our outreach efforts, our urgent care strategy and our very effective physician development strategies will continue to help the company stay competitive and hopefully put ourselves in a position to sustain our market share gains as we move forward. It's really difficult for me to say exactly how 1 year, the next year is going to play out, because I don't have visibility into exactly what our competitors are going to do. But largely, our competitive landscape is not significantly different than what it was in the previous year. So I think there could be some incremental movements from 1 market to the other, and we just need to be prepared to deal with that, and I think we are.

The number of patients in our hospitals in both those divisions were off when I bundle the 2. But when it comes to admissions statistics, then it obviously looks like those 2 divisions had challenges, but when we get underneath that, we don't see that to be a significant issue. When you look at Texas, compared to Florida, the state of Florida is a little bit more in a growth mode as far as the overall market, slightly up. But Texas continues to be a very good market for us with respect to overall growth of our markets and so forth. We have had a little bit of challenge in a couple of Western markets because of some dynamics with some of our competitors that got back into health plan when previously awarded certain health plans so we think some of our physicians go back to our competitors. But all in all, 10 out of 14 is very good. Just on the admission side, to give you some perspective, the 4 that were down, 1 of them down 0.5%; 1 was down 1%, this is admission; 1 was down 1.5%; and 1 was down 3%. The 1 that was down 3% had the most Medicare advantage issues. On an adjusted admission basis, one of them was down 0.2%. One of them, 0.4%. And one of was down 1.3% and 1%. So we're talking almost 14 out of 14. And when we normalize for some of these things, it would have been a little different number. So that's part of how we're looking at it, Frank, and we don't see anything unique in any 1 particular market that's really compromising the company in any significant way."

And we'll have substantial free cash flow next year. And as we think about capital allocation, think about our cash flow from operations, the [indiscernible] somewhere around $5.3 billion to $5.5 billion this year. As we think about that, that cash and the allocation for capital, first thing we do is reinvest back in our existing markets. And this year, that would probably be about 2.7. I would expect next year will be in December amount maybe up a little bit but around that same number. So that leaves us substantial free cash flow that obviously we could use for acquisitions. We have -- we always have a pipeline, we're looking for opportunities, most recently those acquisition opportunities had been tuck-in acquisitions complementary to our existing markets or outpatient acquisitions like [indiscernible] Care that Sam's talked about. So we'll quite continue to see those opportunities in the next year and we'll be obviously well positioned to take advantage of them as they come to us. Larger acquisitions, they're always a possibility. We remain optimistic, we'll have some good opportunities. But as you know, from recent years, those are hard to predict when they will happen. But again, we remain with the balance sheet and the financial capabilities to take advantage of those if they present. And we'll always be looking out for those opportunities. And that raises then returning cash to shareholders. And I don't think [indiscernible]  I think if you look at HCA, we have a very diversified approach to our capital allocation, I think we'll continue to have a diversified approach to capital allocation. And we will be looking at deploying additional cash to shareholders in 2017. We will be reviewing the possibility of a dividend. We'll have to think that through. If we decide to do it, we'll probably talk about that in our next call. But we'll continue I think to be a repurchaser of our stock. We've been very pleased with investing our free cash flow back in our company stock. We think we've been doing that for a number of years as we've been public. Again, and it's been I think a great return of investment for our shareholders.

One, we have to work with the payers to come up with the process that doesn't put us in a situation where we're disputing each other classification patients, and we're doing that, we're having active dialogue with the payers now on the concerns that we have. We're listening to their issues and see if we can find a resolution there. The second thing we can do when we disagree, we dispute, we go through a dispute resolution process to try to resolve it. That's obviously a little bit more of a protracted process. And then the third thing that we do if we can't reach a resolution on either one of those steps is we work with our medical staff to establish what we believe to be appropriate clinical protocol and require that those protocols be processed, if you will, appropriately by physicians who are making those decisions. We have done that in some instances, and that's allowed us to get through this particular situation. The economics are not significantly different between observation and inpatient in some payer contracts. But others, it can be. And that's where we have to be, again, very appropriate in how we respond to it. But those are some of the approaches, and we continue to work through those in this particular situation that we have primarily in Florida."

But what we have done structurally is evolve our approach to interacting with our physicians in providing them most in our facilities, creating efficient and frankly capable institutions and really showing our physicians that we can grow the practices for them in a way that reach their objective. And I think that's sort of the HCA way, if you will, around our physician approach. We have evolved, as I indicated, over the 5 years, and we believe it makes sense in a lot of our markets to advance medical education training. And we have added graduate medical education program across the company over the last year, and we will continue to invest in additional graduate medical education program. That is providing opportunity for us to respond to market needs where there are physician shortages. It's also creating opportunities for us to improve our operations within our facility. And then finally, it's addressing potential strategic issues and allowing us to generate physicians who can support our service line development overall growth agenda. So we're very excited about where we are graduate medical education program. We have consolidated that division into our physician services group under Mike Cuffe, who has deep experiences with that.

I trust most of you had the opportunity to review our third quarter results released this morning. I'll make a couple of comments on the quarter, touch on a couple of other topics, then turn the call over to Bill and Sam to provide more detail on our third quarter results. 
I'm very pleased with our overall performance and execution in the quarter. We continued to use our free cash flow to invest in our market to support future growth, and we returned cash to shareholders through share repurchase. 
Let me touch on the results for the quarter at a high level. The company experienced a solid quarter, with revenues for the third quarter totaling $10.27 billion, a 4.2% increase in the prior year, driven by 1.5% equivalent admission increase and a 2.7% net revenue per equivalent admission increase in the fourth quarter. 
Net income attributable to HCA Holdings totaled $618 million, an increase of 37.7%, while earnings per diluted share totaled $1.59 per diluted share or $1.61 per diluted share before gains on the sale of facilities, losses on retirement of debt and legal claim cost. 
Earnings per diluted share for HCA Holdings record gains or losses on sales, losses on retirement of debt and legal claims costs increased 37.6% compared to the prior year. As noted in our release this morning, the company also recognized a reduction in the its provision for income taxes due to the adoption of a new accounting policy on equity award settlements of $11 million or $0.03 per diluted share and $51 million or $0.13 per diluted share from the completion of IRS review of the company's 2011 and 2012 federal income tax returns. 
Adjusted EBITDA totaled $1.957 billion in the third quarter compared to $1.815 billion last year, an increase of 7.8% over the prior year period. 
We had another solid quarter for cash flows from operations resulting in $1.206 billion compared to $1.101 billion in last year's third quarter, a 9.5% increase. We deployed $712 million for capital expenditures and $355 million to repurchase 4.637 million shares. We have repurchased a total of 29.064 million shares in 2016 at an average cost of $76.16 per share. And we had $309 million remaining on our $3 billion authorization at September 30, 2016. We expect to complete the remaining authorization by the end of the year. 
Let me provide an update on recent Hurricane Matthew on our Florida and South Carolina facilities. We experienced some minor disruption leading up to and during the storm. However, we came through the event without any major issues. I commend our entire team for their preparation and planning in anticipation of the hurricane, which minimized any disruption of service to our patients. 
And yesterday, we announced an agreement with the University Hospital Authority and Trust for the early termination of HCA's lease of the Children's Hospital at Oklahoma University Medical Center and also the termination of our joint operating agreement. In addition to the termination, HCA will transfer ownership of its hospital operations in Oklahoma, which includes 2 other hospitals, the University Hospital Authority and Trust. Under the agreement, HCA will receive $750 million in consideration, and the transaction is expected to be completed in the first half of 2017. 
So with that, let me turn the call over to Bill and Sam for additional details in the quarter."

I will add to Milton's comments and provide more detail on our performance and results for the third quarter. As we reported, in the third quarter, our same facility admissions increased 0.7% over the prior year, and equivalent admissions increased 1.3%. Year to date, equivalent admissions were up 2% over the prior year. Sam will provide more comments around volume in a moment and views and trends by payer class. 
During the third quarter, same facility Medicare admissions and equivalent admissions increased 1.8% and 2.5%, respectively. This includes both traditional and managed Medicare. Managed Medicare admissions increased 3.4% on a same facility basis and represents 33.5% of our total Medicare admissions. On a year-to-date basis, Medicare equivalent admissions are up 2.2% over the prior year. 
Same facility Medicaid admissions and equivalent admissions increased 2.3% and 3.4%, respectively, in the quarter, fairly consistent with our recent trends and our year-to-date growth of equivalent admissions of 3.2%. 
Same facility self-pay and charity admissions increased 0.7% in the quarter. They represent 8% of our total admissions, which was unchanged from last year's third quarter. Year-to-date, our same facility uninsured admissions are up 5.2% from the same period last year. 
Managed care and other, including exchange admissions, declined 1.8% and equivalent admissions declined 1.4% on a same facility basis in the third quarter. However, on a year-to-date basis, same facility managed, other and exchange equivalent admissions remain slightly up. 
Same facility emergency room visits increased 2.7% in the quarter compared to the prior year. Same facility self-pay and charity ER visits represent 20.1% of our total ER visits in the quarter compared to 20.5% last year. On a year-to-date basis, same facility emergency room visits have increased 4.6%. 
Intensity of service or acuity increased in the quarter with our same facility case mix increasing 4.7% compared to the prior year period. Same facility revenue per equivalent admission increased 2.7%. Managed care and other, including exchange revenue per equivalent admission, is turning consistent with prior periods. When adjusted for certain items, it grew approximately 6.5% in the quarter and 6.7% year-to-date. 
Same facility charity care and uninsured discounts increased $639 million in the quarter compared to the prior year. Same facility charity care discounts totaled $1.042 billion in the quarter, an increase of $118 million from the prior year period, while same facility uninsured discounts totaled $3.295 billion, an increase of $521 million over the prior year period. 
Now turning to expenses. Expense management in the quarter was very good and led to a 70 basis point margin expansion as compared to the prior year. Same facility operating expense per equivalent admission increased 1.9% compared to last year's third quarter. Our consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin was 19.1% for the quarter as compared to 18.4% in the third quarter of last year. 
Same facility salaries per equivalent admission increased 1.4% compared to last year's third quarter. Salaries and benefits as a percent of revenues decreased 80 basis points compared to the third quarter of 2015. Same facility supply expense per equivalent admission increased 1.5% for the third quarter compared to the prior year. And supply cost as a percent of revenue improved 20 basis points versus prior year. 
Other operating expenses as a percent of revenues increased 30 basis points from last year's third quarter to 18.5% of revenue, primarily reflecting an increase in year-over-year professional fees that we discussed on our last 2 calls. 
Let me touch briefly on cash flow. We had another strong quarter with cash flows from operations just over $1.2 billion. Year-to-date, cash flows from operations were $3.954 billion, which is a $778 million increase or a 24.5% growth from prior year. Cash flow from operations is benefited by $129 million on a year-to-date basis due to the adoption of the accounting policy around the excess tax benefit related to the settlement of equity awards. 
At the end of the quarter, we had approximately $2.050 billion available under our revolving credit facilities. Debt to adjusted EBITDA was 3.86x at September 30, 2016 compared to 3.85x at December 31, '15. 
I also want to highlight our earnings per share results. For the quarter, our diluted earnings per share, excluding losses on retirement of debt, legal claim cost and gains or losses on sales of facilities, increased 37.6% to $1.61 per diluted share from $1.17 in the prior year period. As indicated in our release, EPS for the quarter does include a $0.03 benefit due to adopting the new accounting policy and a $0.13 benefit from the IRS exempt settlement. These strong cash flows, balance sheet position and EPS growth results highlight an important strength of the company. 
Let me touch briefly on health reform. Health reform activity continued to grow over the prior year in the quarter. In the third quarter, we saw approximately 13,000 same facility exchange admissions as compared to approximately 11,500 in the third quarter of last year or a 13% year-over-year growth. You may recall, we saw about 13,300 exchange admissions in the second quarter. We saw 49,000 same facility exchange ER visits in the third quarter compared to 40,700 in the third quarter of '15 and 54,000 in the second quarter of 2016. So overall, these reform trends are tracking in line with our expectations and have been very stable over the past several quarters. 
So that concludes my remarks, and I'll turn the call over to Sam for some additional comments."

Let me begin by giving you some of the quarterly volume stats that I normally provide on these calls. Once again, the company continued to have broad-based growth across our markets and wide-ranging growth across the various facilities and s",741,"Good morning. Let me begin by giving you some of the quarterly volume stats that I normally provide on these calls. Once again, the company continued to have broad-based growth across our markets and wide-ranging growth across the various facilities and service lines that make up our business. 
For our domestic operations, on a same facility basis, 10 of 14 divisions had growth in admissions, 10 of 14 divisions had growth in adjusted admissions and 12 of 14 divisions had growth in emergency room visits. Freestanding emergency room visits grew 12.5% and accounted for approximately 40% of our overall ER growth. Hospital-based emergency room visits grew 1.8%. 
In addition to the solid portfolio performance across our 42 markets, the company's growth across its diversified service lines was also strong. For domestic operations, on a same facility basis, inpatient surgeries grew 0.9%, which increased surgical admissions to 28.6% of total admissions in the quarter, an increase of 100 basis points as compared to last year. Surgical volumes were particularly strong again this quarter in cardiovascular, orthopedics and general surgery categories. Outpatient surgeries were slightly down in the quarter by 0.3%. Hospital-based outpatient surgical volumes declined 0.9%, while volumes increased 0.4% in our freestanding ambulatory surgery divisions. This softness was felt across multiple service lines and across many markets, and we were not able to identify any particular issue that drove the softness. 
Behavioral health admissions grew 1.5%. The issue with physician staffing shortages that we discussed last quarter was still the primary driver of the slower growth in this service line. 3 of our largest behavioral hospital units have staffing challenges. And without them, the company's admits in this service line would have been up 4.5%. 
Rehab admissions grew 4.3%, which was an acceleration of the growth rate as compared to the first half of the year. 
Deliveries were down 0.9% in the quarter. Again, this decline was concentrated in Medicaid deliveries. Neonatal admissions increased 1.5%, which is an improvement over the growth rate in the first half of the year. Cardiology procedure volumes grew approximately 4%. Trauma volumes grew almost 15%. Observation visits were up 5%. And finally, the company's urgent care visits, in total, grew 11.7%. The company currently has 71 centers. At this time last year, we had 50 centers. 
All in all, we had another good quarter of volume growth. However, the overall growth rate was not as high as we had planned. It is important to note that the third quarter last year was also a relatively strong volume quarter and presented a difficult comparison with inpatient admits up 2.9% and adjusted admissions up 3.6%. 
We believe this deceleration in the growth rate was primarily attributable to the following 2 reasons.  First, overall demand growth in inpatient services has moderated. When we study market data from the fourth quarter of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016, inpatient demand in our markets grew 1.7% for this 6-month period. This rate was down from the previous 5 quarters' average growth of approximately 3.5%, but is generally consistent with our longer-term view of inpatient demand growth, which is approximately 2% annually in HCA markets. 
Before I get into the details on the second reason, I want to indicate that the company grew its market share, albeit at a slower pace, for the 12 months ended March 31, 2016. 55% of our markets gained share during this period as compared to 68% of our markets in 2014. 
The second reason can be explained by growing competition in certain areas of our business. In particular, a growing supply of freestanding emergency rooms by independent companies and health systems in various Texas and Colorado markets has had an impact on emergency room visits and some downstream admissions. Also, in a couple of our Florida markets, we continue to be challenged with Medicare advantage health plan that classified emergency room patients as observation patients instead of inpatient admissions. 
Overall, we believe HCA has a comprehensive growth agenda and our execution remains strong. We continue to invest significantly in our growth agenda with increasing capital spending, coordinated marketing strategy and multiple human resource programs, including medical staff development. 
In sum, we believe the company has solid growth prospects across its uniquely diversified portfolio of markets and service lines, and we believe our local provider systems are well positioned to capitalize on these opportunities. 
With that, let me to turn the call back to Vic."

From that perspective, I think both have maybe forgot to put it in that perspective.

I think, Sheryl -- I mean, we had a relationship that dates back in 1998 with, I'll say, the University of Oklahoma. It's a more complicated structure than that because of how the state had to do a transaction with us. But we've had this relationship since 1998. And when the hospitals came together, there were a lot of challenges both for HCA and the University Hospital. When you look at where we are today, which is almost 20 years past, this has been a remarkable success from, I think, everybody's standpoint in a very innovative public-private partnership. And so there's been a lot of investment, a lot of new programs, market share gains and so forth that really benefited the system. The way the deal was structured, it was structured as a lease. And we were in a situation, as was the hospital there, where we needed additional capital. And unfortunately, the other side was not in a position to extend the lease in any significant way that allowed us to get comfortable in making the kind of investment that needed to be made. So it was felt by both parties that it was better to go ahead and start the unwind now so it could be orderly for both sides of the equation, and that's where we wound up announcing this transaction yesterday. It was a complicated deal to get into and a complicated deal to get out because it was very intricately structured. So that does allow us, in the context of what we needed to make as an investment there, coupled with the type of lease that we had, to look at repositioning the capital to be at source for whatever we wanted to do, whether it was more capital expenditures or other components of our capital allocation strategy. And so it does fit into that. And I think that's part of what we considered as we went through our negotiations and our strategic analysis of this particular market."

In addition to that, we compare historically to a longer view to see what the patterns have been in our market on a historical basis, and we try to merge those 2 views into our company thinking and company view right now. And that's where we get to the 2% demand on the inpatient side. We think outpatient demand has a little bit more growth than that. So that process is consistent, and that's where we have landed on our view. There's nothing to suggest the 1 quarter in this particular year that, that particular view is off. And so we're relatively confident today. We haven't finished our analysis for all of 2017 and on that anything materially has changed. I think one thing that's positive in the overall demand is that commercial demand continues to be reasonably solid inside of HCA's markets in these 2 periods that I discussed in total. And so that's an encouraging metric that suggests our portfolio of market still has reasonable growth on the commercial side. Obviously, there's puts and takes to that. But that particular metric, I think, gives us some confidence as well that our markets are still relatively healthy and present a reasonable opportunity for growth for the company."

And in that particular strategy, we feel pretty good about how we place those. We see the urgent care as an additional lap around, if you will, our freestanding emergency room strategy, where there are certain components of certain markets where urgent care is the best answer because of either competitive hospital systems or other freestanding emergency room, and it provides a component that wraps around our freestanding emergency room or hospital emergency room strategy. So there's a blend of what the right facility is for the right situation. There's population, there's traffic, there's location of other hospitals in other freestanding emergency rooms. And we go through this process of mapping out the market and determining what exactly is the right fit and how we go about building this network further. In some respects, we try to build an urgent care strategy around our emergency room strategy, which is built around our hospital strategy. So it's almost a concentric circle of facilities that create a fairly broad HCA network in these large markets, allowing our patients to enter the system in different forms or different fashions and also creating relatively favorable price points, if you will, for our payers where they can direct, if they feel they need to direct, but keep them in the HCA system.

There's clearly a lot of discussion around that plan participation and premium adjustments and what that might do to in enrollment. It is early for us to kind of give estimates for '17, but we were encouraged by recent reports that they're expecting some increase in the exchange enrollment. We'll have to see where that enrollment is coming for -- coming from for next year, refine our estimates. I also believe it's important to know, we've shared this in various investor meetings during the course of the year, but we got data that suggests there's almost 4 million people in our markets that are eligible for subsidies that have yet to participate. And so we're somewhat optimistic that some of those remaining eligible people may find their ways in enrollment. In terms of plan exiting, most of our major markets, if not all of our major markets, there's another plan offering to catch those lives. So again, I think we're optimistic that health reform continue to contribute to the company."

I mean, everybody understands the implication of the commercial book. And so there's significant competition in that particular area. But what HCA is doing structurally to compete in those environments is similar to what we just talked about, how we create outreach into these commercial segments, through outpatient facility, through freestanding emergency room, through growth in our outpatient surgical platforms, where we can start to develop relationships with our patients in a way that allow them to be connected and loyal to the HCA system. Additionally, with our position strategies, we are very targeted and working with our physicians who have commercial books of business to expand their capabilities, allowing us to reach further into those particular arenas and hopefully drive downstream businesses. And then finally, working with our health plan to come up with ways to help them grow in a way that benefits our system. So I think our overall approach is built around the basics of our growth architecture, including where we deploy capital expenditures. We focus our capital on those facilities that have great opportunities in commercial market, or an outpatient facilities in commercial market. So that's a part of our screening, if you will, for deploying capital, because the return prospects are greater in those particular scenarios. But our competitors do that, too. So it's a very competitive landscape, and there's movement in and out periodically from who's gaining and who's losing in those environments. But we're very comfortable with the approach and how we have deployed it. We think there are new opportunities with customer relationship management through digital technologies, patient navigation and other ways to differentiate HCA further. And we're continuing to invest in those initiatives as well. And we think we've got opportunities to respond to this dynamic in this market as we move further -- move forward rather, sorry."

And we've estimated over time that there may be 50 basis points of add-on, if you will, to the adjusted admissions factor. So it puts you in that 2.5% zone as maybe a demand growth for adjusted admissions. Obviously, the emergency room is a big piece of that. Outpatient surgery is the second largest piece of that component. And then it drops off from there where it's not a segment and at those 2 when you start looking at the outpatient market. With respect to our market share trends, historically you're correct. We've tended to average 25 to 40 basis points per year of company-wide market share growth. That has slowed a little bit because we've seen more suppliers in certain components of our business, as I indicated in my commentary. And then we've seen other components of our strategy, if you will, replicated. So we have to up our game, and that's what we're doing. Our teams are challenged with coming up with innovative ways to deal with the competitive dynamic that are taking place within our markets. Again, we're leveraging great ideas from one market to the other to help the company stay ahead of our competition where we can. And we think some of our outreach efforts, our urgent care strategy and our very effective physician development strategies will continue to help the company stay competitive and hopefully, put ourselves in a position to sustain our market share gains as we move forward. It's really difficult for me to say exactly how 1 year, the next year is going to play out, because I don't have visibility into exactly what our competitors are going to do. But largely, our competitive landscape is not significantly different than what it was in the previous year. So I think there could be some incremental movements from one market to the other, and we just need to be prepared to deal with that, and I think we are.

The number of patients in our hospitals in both those divisions were off when I bundle the 2. But when it comes to admissions statistics, then it obviously looks like those 2 divisions had challenges, but when we get underneath that, we don't see that to be a significant issue. When you look at Texas, compared to Florida, the state of Florida is a little bit more in a growth mode as far as the overall market, slightly up. But Texas continues to be a very good market for us with respect to overall growth of our markets and so forth. We have had a little bit of challenge in a couple of Western markets because of some dynamics with some of our competitors that got back into health plan when previously they weren't in certain health plans, so we think some of our physicians go back to our competitors. But all in all, a 10 out of 14 is very good. And just on the admission side, to give you some perspective, the 4 that were down, 1 of them was down 0.5%; 1 was down 1%, this is admission; 1 was down 1.5%; and 1 was down 3%. The 1 that was down 3% had the most Medicare Advantage issues. On an adjusted admission basis, 1 of them was down 0.2%; 1 was down, 0.4%; and 1 was down 1.3% and 1%. So we're talking almost 14 out of 14. And when we normalize for some of these things, it would have been a little different number.

Well, at that time of the year, we're working on our plans, and as mentioned in my comments, we'll finish our current $3 billion share repurchase authorization by the end of this year. And we'll have substantial free cash flow next year. And as we think about capital allocation, think about our cash flow from operations of probably somewhere around $5.3 billion to $5.5 billion this year, as we think about that cash and the allocation of the capital, first thing we do is reinvest back in our existing markets. And this year, that would probably be about $2.7 billion. I would expect next year would be a similar amount, maybe up a little bit but around that same number. So that leaves us substantial free cash flow that obviously would be used for acquisitions. We have -- we always have a pipeline. We're looking for opportunities. Most recently, those acquisition opportunities had been tuck-in acquisitions complementary to our existing markets or outpatient acquisitions like urgent care that Sam's talked about. So -- and we'll quite continue to see those opportunities in the next year, and we'll be obviously well positioned to take advantage of them as they come to us. Larger acquisitions, they're always a possibility. We remain optimistic. We'll have some good opportunities. But as you know, from recent years, those are hard to predict when they will happen. But again, we remain with the balance sheet and the financial capabilities to take advantage of those if they present. And we'll always be looking out for those opportunities. And that raises then returning cash to shareholders. And I don't think it need to be mutually exclusive. I think if you look at HCA, we have a very diversified approach to our capital allocation, I think we'll continue to have a diversified approach to capital allocation. And we will be looking at deploying additional cash to shareholders in 2017. We will be reviewing the possibility of a dividend. We'll have to think that through. We'll -- if we decide to do it, we'll probably talk about that in our next call. But we'll continue, I think, to be a repurchaser of our stock. We've been very pleased with investing our free cash flow back in our company stock. We think we've been doing that for a number of years since we've been public again.

But we have seen situations like this before in other markets in Texas. And I think you have to deal with it on really 3 ways. One, we have to work with the payers to come up with the process that doesn't put us in a situation where we're disputing each other's classification of patients, and we're doing that. We're having active dialogue with the payers now on the concerns that we have. We're listening to their issues and seeing if we can find a resolution there. The second thing we can do when we disagree, we dispute, we go through a dispute resolution process to try to resolve it. That's obviously a little bit more of a protracted process. And then the third thing that we do if we can't reach a resolution on either one of those steps is we work with our medical staff to establish what we believe to be appropriate clinical protocol and require that those protocols be processed, if you will, appropriately by physicians who are making those decisions. We have done that in some instances, and that's allowed us to get through this particular situation. The economics are not significantly different between observation and inpatient in some payer contracts, but others, it can be. And that's where we have to be, again, very appropriate in how we respond to it. But those are some of the approaches, and we continue to work through those in this particular situation that we have, primarily in Florida."

Of those 38,000, about 4,000 plus are employed by the company, a split between primary care and special in that particular category. But what we have done structurally is evolve our approach to interacting with our physicians in providing invoice in our facilities, creating efficient and frankly, capable institutions and really showing our physicians that we can grow the practices for them in a way that reach their objective. And I think that's sort of the HCA way, if you will, around our physician approach. We have evolved, as I indicated, over the 5 years, and we believe it makes sense in a lot of our markets to advance medical education training. And we have added Graduate Medical Education program across the company over the last year, and we will continue to invest in additional Graduate Medical Education programs. That is providing opportunity for us to respond to market needs where there are physician shortages. It's also creating opportunities for us to improve our operations within our facilities. And then finally, it's addressing potential strategic issues and allowing us to generate physicians who can support our service line development and overall growth agenda. So we're very excited about where we are with our Graduate Medical Education program. We have consolidated that division into our physician services group under Mike Cuffe, who has deep experiences with that. And he and his team are working to bring about best practices to create academic curriculum that can be scaled across the organization. And we think it's going to be a unique model that makes for a very competitive and responsive Graduate Medical Education solution for many individuals who want to go down this path."

Bundle payment has been initiated. We participate on that, but it's not yet really a material factor that alters kind of the revenue profile for HCA at this stage, but I think we'll continue to see more of that going forward. And on bad debts, our uncompensated care trends have also remained very stable.

And so right now, we're near 20, and we're running at the low end of our revenue expectation, which is in that, say, in that 4% to 6% range. So I'm very, very pleased with the team's execution in terms of this quarter to have EBITDA growth just under 8% of -- just over 4% net revenue growth is a real, I mean, complement to the execution. I want to give compliment to the team. And I think as we go forward, that's kind of the outlook we have. We think in this sort of inflationary environment that we're in, if we can grow revenue toward the low end of our expectation, our goal is to maintain margins. If we can move to the high end, we think there could be some opportunity for margin growth. From time to time, we're making investments for the future. We're investing in programs like trauma. We're investing in physician programs, as Sam touched on. And a lot of investments have burned to the P&L, and not just on the balance sheet. And so we'll make -- we have been making investments during the run rate, and we're going to continue to make those because they really are -- really, it's our future. It's going to allow us to continue to grow. So from time to time, we may move around a little bit with that. But I feel like, as an objective and a long-term outlook, I think our margins are at a very good level.

I'm very pleased with our overall performance and execution in the quarter. We continued to use our free cash flow to invest in our markets to support future growth, and we returned cash to shareholders through share repurchase. 
Let me touch on the results for the quarter at a high level. The company experienced a solid quarter, with revenues for the third quarter totaling $10.27 billion, a 4.2% increase in the prior year, driven by 1.5% equivalent admission increase and a 2.7% net revenue per equivalent admission increase in the quarter. 
Net income attributable to HCA Holdings totaled $618 million, an increase of 37.7%, while earnings per diluted share totaled $1.59 per diluted share or $1.61 per diluted share before gains on the sale of facilities, losses on retirement of debt and legal claim cost. 
Earnings per diluted share for HCA Holdings per core gains or losses on sales, losses on retirement of debt and legal claims costs increased 37.6% compared to the prior year. As noted in our release this morning, the company also recognized reductions in the its provision for income taxes due to the adoption of a new accounting policy on equity award settlements of $11 million or $0.03 per diluted share and $51 million or $0.13 per diluted share from the completion of IRS review of the company's 2011 and 2012 federal income tax returns. 
Adjusted EBITDA totaled $1.957 billion in the third quarter compared to $1.815 billion last year, an increase of 7.8% over the prior year period. 
We had another solid quarter for cash flows from operations resulting in $1.206 billion compared to $1.101 billion in last year's third quarter, a 9.5% increase. We deployed $712 million for capital expenditures and $355 million to repurchase 4.637 million shares. We have repurchased a total of 29.064 million shares in 2016 at an average cost of $76.16 per share. And we had $309 million remaining on our $3 billion authorization at September 30, 2016. We expect to complete the remaining authorization by the end of the year. 
Let me provide an update on recent Hurricane Matthew on our Florida and South Carolina facilities. We experienced some minor disruption leading up to and during the storm. However, we came through the event without any major issues. I commend our entire team for their preparation and planning in anticipation of the hurricane, which minimized any disruption of service to our patients. 
And yesterday, we announced an agreement with the University Hospital Authority and Trust for the early termination of HCA's lease of the Children's Hospital at Oklahoma University Medical Center and also the termination of a joint operating agreement. In addition to the termination, HCA will transfer ownership of its hospital operations in Oklahoma, which includes 2 other hospitals, the University Hospital Authority and Trust. Under the agreement, HCA will receive $750 million in consideration, and the transaction is expected to be completed in the first half of 2017. 
So with that, let me turn the call over to Bill and Sam for additional details in the quarter."

I will add to Milton's comments and provide more detail on our performance and results for the third quarter. As we reported, in the third quarter, our same facility admissions increased 0.7% over the prior year, and equivalent admissions increased 1.3%. Year to date, equivalent admissions were up 2% over the prior year. Sam will provide more comments around volume in a moment and our views and trends by payer class. 
During the third quarter, same facility Medicare admissions and equivalent admissions increased 1.8% and 2.5%, respectively. This includes both traditional and managed Medicare. Managed Medicare admissions increased 3.4% on a same facility basis and represents 33.5% of our total Medicare admissions. On a year-to-date basis, Medicare equivalent admissions are up 2.2% over the prior year. 
Same facility Medicaid admissions and equivalent admissions increased 2.3% and 3.4%, respectively, in the quarter, fairly consistent with our recent trends and our year-to-date growth of equivalent admissions of 3.2%. 
Same facility self-pay and charity admissions increased 0.7% in the quarter. These represent 8% of our total admissions, which was unchanged from last year's third quarter. Year-to-date, our same facility uninsured admissions are up 5.2% from the same period last year. 
Managed care and other, including exchange admissions, declined 1.8% and equivalent admissions declined 1.4% on a same facility basis in the third quarter. However, on a year-to-date basis, same facility managed, other and exchange equivalent admissions remain slightly up. 
Same facility emergency room visits increased 2.7% in the quarter compared to the prior year. Same facility self-pay and charity ER visits represent 20.1% of our total ER visits in the quarter compared to 20.5% last year. On a year-to-date basis, same facility emergency room visits have increased 4.6%. 
Intensity of service or acuity increased in the quarter with our same facility case mix increasing 4.7% compared to the prior year period. Same facility revenue per equivalent admission increased 2.7%. Managed care and other, including exchange revenue per equivalent admission, is turning consistent with prior periods. When adjusted for certain items, it grew approximately 6.5% in the quarter and 6.7% year-to-date. 
Same facility charity care and uninsured discounts increased $639 million in the quarter compared to the prior year. Same facility charity care discounts totaled $1.042 billion in the quarter, an increase of $118 million from the prior year period, while same facility uninsured discounts totaled $3.295 billion, an increase of $521 million over the prior year period. 
Now turning to expenses. Expense management in the quarter was very good and led to a 70-basis-point margin expansion as compared to the prior year. Same facility operating expense per equivalent admission increased 1.9% compared to last year's third quarter. Our consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin was 19.1% for the quarter as compared to 18.4% in the third quarter of last year. 
Same facility salaries per equivalent admission increased 1.4% compared to last year's third quarter. Salaries and benefits as a percent of revenues decreased 80 basis points compared to the third quarter of 2015. Same facility supply expense per equivalent admission increased 1.5% for the third quarter compared to the prior year. And supply cost as a percent of revenue improved 20 basis points versus prior year. 
Other operating expenses as a percent of revenues increased 30 basis points from last year's third quarter to 18.5% of revenue, primarily reflecting an increase in year-over-year professional fees that we discussed on our last 2 calls. 
Let me touch briefly on cash flow. We had another strong quarter with cash flows from operations just over $1.2 billion. Year-to-date, cash flows from operations were $3.954 billion, which is a $778 million increase or a 24.5% growth from prior year. Cash flow from operations is benefited by $129 million on a year-to-date basis due to the adoption of the accounting policy around the excess tax benefit related to the settlement of equity awards. 
At the end of the quarter, we had approximately $2.050 billion available under our revolving credit facilities. Debt to adjusted EBITDA was 3.86x at September 30, 2016 compared to 3.85x at December 31, '15. 
I also want to highlight our earnings per share results. For the quarter, our diluted earnings per share, excluding losses on retirement of debt, legal claim cost and gains or losses on sales of facilities, increased 37.6% to $1.61 per diluted share from $1.17 in the prior year period. As indicated in our release, EPS for the quarter does include a $0.03 benefit due to adopting the new accounting policy and a $0.13 benefit from the IRS exam settlement. The strong cash flows, balance sheet position and EPS growth results highlight an important strength of the company. 
Let me touch briefly on health reform. Health reform activity continued to grow over the prior year in the quarter. In the third quarter, we saw approximately 13,000 same facility exchange admissions as compared to approximately 11,500 in the third quarter of last year or a 13% year-over-year growth. You may recall, we saw about 13,300 exchange admissions in the second quarter. We saw 49,000 same facility exchange ER visits in the third quarter compared to 40,700 in the third quarter of '15 and 54,000 in the second quarter of 2016. So overall, these reform trends are tracking in line with our expectations and have been very stable over the past several quarters. 
So that concludes my remarks, and I'll turn the call over to Sam for some additional comments."

Let me begin by giving you some of the quarterly volume stats that I normally provide on these calls. Once again, the company continued to have broad-based growth across our markets and wide-ranging growth across the various facilities and s",741,"Good morning. Let me begin by giving you some of the quarterly volume stats that I normally provide on these calls. Once again, the company continued to have broad-based growth across our markets and wide-ranging growth across the various facilities and service lines that make up our business. 
For our domestic operations, on a same facility basis, 10 of 14 divisions had growth in admissions, 10 of 14 divisions had growth in adjusted admissions and 12 of 14 divisions had growth in emergency room visits. Freestanding emergency room visits grew 12.5% and accounted for approximately 40% of our overall ER growth. Hospital-based emergency room visits grew 1.8%. 
In addition to the solid portfolio performance across our 42 markets, the company's growth across its diversified service lines was also strong. For domestic operations, on a same facility basis, inpatient surgeries grew 0.9%, which increased surgical admissions to 28.6% of total admissions in the quarter, an increase of 100 basis points as compared to last year. Surgical volumes were particularly strong again this quarter in cardiovascular, orthopedics and general surgery categories. Outpatient surgeries were slightly down in the quarter by 0.3%. Hospital-based outpatient surgical volumes declined 0.9%, while volumes increased 0.4% in our freestanding ambulatory surgery division. This softness was felt across multiple service lines and across many markets, and we were not able to identify any particular issue that drove the softness. 
Behavioral health admissions grew 1.5%. The issue with physician staffing shortages that we discussed last quarter was still the primary driver of the slower growth in this service line. 3 of our largest behavioral hospital units had staffing challenges. And without them, the company's admits in this service line would have been up 4.5%. 
Rehab admissions grew 4.3%, which was an acceleration of the growth rate as compared to the first half of the year. 
Deliveries were down 0.9% in the quarter. Again, this decline was concentrated in Medicaid deliveries. Neonatal admissions increased 1.5%, which is an improvement over the growth rate in the first half of the year. Cardiology procedure volumes grew approximately 4%. Trauma volumes grew almost 15%. Observation visits were up 5%. And finally, the company's urgent care visits, in total, grew 11.7%. The company currently has 71 centers. At this time last year, we had 50 centers. 
All in all, we had another good quarter of volume growth. However, the overall growth rate was not as high as we had planned. It is important to note that the third quarter last year was also a relatively strong volume quarter and presented a difficult comparison with inpatient admits up 2.9% and adjusted admissions up 3.6%. 
We believe this deceleration in the growth rate was primarily attributable to the following 2 reasons.  First, overall demand growth in inpatient services has moderated. When we study market data from the fourth quarter of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016, inpatient demand in our markets grew 1.7% for this 6-month period. This rate was down from the previous 5 quarters' average growth of approximately 3.5%, but is generally consistent with our longer-term view of inpatient demand growth, which is approximately 2% annually in HCA markets. 
Before I get into the details on the second reason, I want to indicate that the company grew its market share, albeit at a slower pace, for the 12 months ended March 31, 2016. 55% of our markets gained share during this period as compared to 68% of our markets in 2014. 
The second reason can be explained by growing competition in certain areas of our business. In particular, a growing supply of freestanding emergency rooms by independent companies and health systems in various Texas and Colorado markets has had an impact on emergency room visits and some downstream admissions. Also, in a couple of our Florida markets, we continue to be challenged with Medicare advantage health plan that classified emergency room patients as observation patients instead of inpatient admissions. 
Overall, we believe HCA has a comprehensive growth agenda and our execution remains strong. We continue to invest significantly in our growth agenda with increasing capital spending, coordinated marketing strategies and multiple human resource programs, including medical staff development. 
In sum, we believe the company has solid growth prospects across its uniquely diversified portfolio of markets and service lines, and we believe our local provider systems are well positioned to capitalize on these opportunities. 
With that, let me to turn the call back to Vic."

From that perspective, I think both have maybe forgot to put it in that perspective.

Let me -- Oklahoma City, let me just give a little background and then I'll relate it to your question. I think, Sheryl -- I mean, we had a relationship that dates back in 1998 with, I'll say, the University of Oklahoma. It's a more complicated structure than that because of how the state had to do a transaction with us. But we've had this relationship since 1998. And when the hospitals came together, there were a lot of challenges both for HCA and the University Hospitals. When you look at where we are today, which is almost 20 years past, this has been a remarkable success from, I think, everybody's standpoint in a very innovative public-private partnership. And so there's been a lot of investment, a lot of new programs, market share gains and so forth that really benefited the system. The way the deal was structured, it was structured as a lease. And we were in a situation, as was the hospital there, where we needed additional capital. And unfortunately, the other side was not in a position to extend the lease in any significant way that allowed us to get comfortable in making the kind of investment that needed to be made. So it was felt by both parties that it was better to go ahead and start the unwind now so it could be orderly for both sides of the equation, and that's where we wound up announcing this transaction yesterday. It was a complicated deal to get into and a complicated deal to get out because it was very intricately structured. So that does allow us, in the context of what we needed to make as an investment there, coupled with the type of lease that we had, to look at repositioning the capital to be at source for whatever we wanted to do, whether it was more capital expenditures or other components of our capital allocation strategy. And so it does fit into that. And I think that's part of what we considered as we went through our negotiations and our strategic analysis of this particular market."

In addition to that, we compare historically to a longer view to see what the patterns have been in our market on a historical basis, and we try to merge those 2 views into our company thinking and company view right now. And that's where we get to the 2% demand on the inpatient side. We think outpatient demand has a little bit more growth than that. So that process is consistent, and that's where we have landed on our view. There's nothing to suggest the 1 quarter in this particular year that, that particular view is off. And so we're relatively confident today. We haven't finished our analysis for all of 2017 and on that anything materially has changed. I think one thing that's positive in the overall demand is that commercial demand continues to be reasonably solid inside of HCA's markets in these 2 periods that I discussed in total. And so that's an encouraging metric that suggests our portfolio of market still has reasonable growth on the commercial side. Obviously, there's puts and takes to that. But that particular metric, I think, gives us some confidence as well that our markets are still relatively healthy and present a reasonable opportunity for growth for the company."

And in that particular strategy, we feel pretty good about how we place those. We see the urgent care as an additional wrap around, if you will, our freestanding emergency room strategy, where there are certain components of certain markets where urgent care is the best answer because of either competitive hospital systems or other freestanding emergency room, and it provides a component that wraps around our freestanding emergency room or hospital emergency room strategy. So there's a blend of what the right facility is for the right situation. There's population, there's traffic, there's location of other hospitals in other freestanding emergency rooms. And we go through this process of mapping out the market and determining what exactly is the right fit and how we go about building this network further. In some respects, we try to build an urgent care strategy around our emergency room strategy, which is built around our hospital strategy. So it's almost a concentric circle of facilities that create a fairly broad HCA network in these large markets, allowing our patients to enter the system in different forms or different fashions and also creating relatively favorable price points, if you will, for our payers where they can direct as they feel they need to direct, but keep them in the HCA system. So it's hard to give you a specific because we have to look at the individual markets, but those are some of the general approaches that we take."

I also believe it's important to know, we've shared this in various investor meetings during the course of the year, but we got data that suggests there's almost 4 million people in our markets that are eligible for subsidies that have yet to participate. And so we're somewhat optimistic that some of those remaining eligible people may find their ways in enrollment. In terms of plan exiting, most of our major markets, if not all of our major markets, there's another plan offering to catch those lives.

I mean, everybody understands the implication of the commercial book. And so there's significant competition in that particular area. But what HCA is doing structurally to compete in those environments is similar to what we just talked about, how we do create outreach into these commercial segments, through outpatient facility, through freestanding emergency room, through growth in our outpatient surgical platforms, where we can start to develop relationships with our patients in a way that allow them to be connected and loyal to the HCA system. Additionally, with our position strategies, we are very targeted and working with our physicians who have commercial books of business to expand their capabilities, allowing us to reach further into those particular arenas and hopefully drive downstream businesses. And then finally, working with our health plan to come up with ways to help them grow in a way that benefits our system. So I think our overall approach is built around the basics of our growth architecture, including where we deploy capital expenditures. We're focusing our capital on those facilities that have great opportunities in commercial market, or in outpatient facilities in commercial market. So that's a part of our screening, if you will, for deploying capital, because the return prospects are greater in those particular scenarios. But our competitors do that, too. So it's a very competitive landscape, and there's movement in and out periodically from who's gaining and who's losing in those environments. But we're very comfortable with the approach and how we have deployed it. We think there are new opportunities with customer relationship management through digital technologies, patient navigation and other ways to differentiate HCA further. And we're continuing to invest in those initiatives as well. And we think we've got opportunities to respond to this dynamic in this market as we move further -- move forward rather, sorry."

And we've estimated over time that there may be 50 basis points of add-on, if you will, to the adjusted admissions factor. So it puts you in that 2.5% zone as maybe a demand growth for adjusted admissions. Obviously, the emergency room is a big piece of that. Outpatient surgery is the second largest piece of that component. And then it drops off from there where it's not a segment that at those 2 when you start looking at the outpatient market. With respect to our market share trends, historically you're correct. We've tended to average 25 to 40 basis points per year of company-wide market share growth. That has slowed a little bit because we've seen more suppliers in certain components of our business, as I indicated in my commentary. And then we've seen other components of our strategy, if you will, replicated. So we're having to up our game, and that's what we're doing. Our teams are challenged with coming up with innovative ways to deal with the competitive dynamic that are taking place within our markets. Again, we're leveraging great ideas from one market to the other to help the company stay ahead of our competition where we can. And we think some of our outreach efforts, our urgent care strategy and our very effective physician development strategies will continue to help the company stay competitive and hopefully, put ourselves in a position to sustain our market share gains as we move forward. It's really difficult for me to say exactly how 1 year, the next year is going to play out, because I don't have visibility into exactly what our competitors are going to do. But largely, our competitive landscape is not significantly different than what it was in the previous year. So I think there could be some incremental movements from one market to the other, and we just need to be prepared to deal with that, and I think we are. And we're doing everything we possibly can to sustain that kind of performance."

The number of patients in our hospitals in both those divisions were up when I bundle the 2. But when it comes to admissions statistics, then it obviously looks like those 2 divisions had challenges, but when we get underneath that, we don't see that to be a significant issue. When you look at Texas, compared to Florida, the state of Florida is a little bit more in a growth mode as far as the overall market, slightly up. But Texas continues to be a very good market for us with respect to overall growth of our markets and so forth. We have had a little bit of challenge in a couple of Western markets because of some dynamics with some of our competitors that got back into health plan when previously they weren't in certain health plans, so we think some of our physicians go back to our competitors. But all in all, a 10 out of 14 is very good. And just on the admission side, to give you some perspective, the 4 that were down, 1 of them was down 0.5%; 1 was down 1%, this is admission; 1 was down 1.5%; and 1 was down 3%. The 1 that was down 3% had the most Medicare Advantage issues. On an adjusted admission basis, 1 of them was down 0.2%; 1 was down 0.4%; and 1 was down 1.3% and 1%. So we're talking almost 14 out of 14. And when we normalize for some of these things, it would have been a little different number.

Well, at that time of the year, we're working on our plans, and as mentioned in my comments, we'll finish our current $3 billion share repurchase authorization by the end of this year. And we'll have substantial free cash flow next year. And as we think about capital allocation, think about our cash flow from operations, it'll probably be somewhere around $5.3 billion to $5.5 billion this year, as we think about that cash and the allocation of the capital, first thing we do is reinvest back in our existing markets. And this year, that would probably be about $2.7 billion. I would expect next year would be a similar amount, maybe up a little bit but around that same number. So that leaves us substantial free cash flow that obviously would be used for acquisitions. We have -- we always have a pipeline. We're looking for opportunities. Most recently, those acquisition opportunities have been tuck-in acquisitions complementary to our existing markets or outpatient acquisitions like urgent care that Sam's talked about. So -- and we'll quite continue to see those opportunities in the next year, and we'll be obviously well positioned to take advantage of them as they come to us. Larger acquisitions, they're always a possibility. We remain optimistic. We'll have some good opportunities. But as you know, from recent years, those are hard to predict when they will happen. But again, we remain with the balance sheet and the financial capabilities to take advantage of those if they present. And we'll always be looking out for those opportunities. And that raises then returning cash to shareholders. And I don't think they need to be mutually exclusive. I think if you look at HCA, we've had a very diversified approach to our capital allocation, I think we'll continue to have a diversified approach to capital allocation. And we will be looking at deploying additional cash to shareholders in 2017. We will be reviewing the possibility of a dividend. We'll have to think that through. We'll -- if we decide to do it, we'll probably talk about that in our next call. But we'll continue, I think, to be a repurchaser of our stock. We've been very pleased with investing our free cash flow back in our company stock. We think we've been doing that for a number of years since we've been public again. And it's been I think a great return on investment for our shareholders.

We're having active dialogue with the payers now on the concerns that we have. We're listening to their issues and seeing if we can find a resolution there. The second thing we can do when we disagree, we dispute, we go through a dispute resolution process to try to resolve it. That's obviously a little bit more of a protracted process. And then the third thing that we do if we can't reach a resolution on either one of those steps is we work with our medical staff to establish what we believe to be appropriate clinical protocol and require that those protocols be processed, if you will, appropriately by physicians who are making those decisions. We have done that in some instances, and that's allowed us to get through this particular situation. The economics are not significantly different between observation and inpatient in some payer contracts, but others, it can be. And that's where we have to be, again, very appropriate in how we respond to it.

But what we have done structurally is evolve our approach to interacting with our physicians in providing invoice in our facilities, creating efficient and frankly, capable institutions and really showing our physicians that we can grow the practices for them in a way that meets their objective. And I think that's sort of the HCA way, if you will, around our physician approach.

So as Milton mentioned, we got pretty good visibility into our contract in physician for next year, couple that with our program investments. I think that's a good, stable range for HCA. Bundle payment has been initiated. We participate on that, but it's not yet really a material factor that alters kind of the revenue profile for HCA at this stage, but I think we'll continue to see more of that going forward. And on bad debts, our uncompensated care trends have also remained very stable. If you look at our uninsured volume trends for this quarter, 5% on a year-to-date basis, which is lower really where we anticipated them falling out at in the high single digits. So I really characterize that overall environment for HCA as very stable."

It's somewhere around high-teen level, close to 19 or above 20. And so right now, we're near 20, and we're running at the low end of our revenue expectation, which is in that, say, in that 4% to 6% range. So I'm very, very pleased with the team's execution in terms of this quarter to have EBITDA growth just under 8% of -- just over 4% net revenue growth is a real, I mean, complement to the execution. I want to give that compliment to the team. And I think as we go forward, that's kind of the outlook we have. We think in this sort of inflationary environment that we're in, if we can grow revenue toward the low end of our expectation, our goal is to maintain margins. If we can move to the high end, we think there could be some opportunity for margin growth. From time to time, we're making investments for the future. We're investing in programs like trauma. We're investing in physician programs, as Sam touched on. And a lot of investments haven't burned to the P&L, and not just on the balance sheet. And so we'll make -- we have been making those investments during the run rate, and we're going to continue to make those because they really are -- really, it's our future. It's going to allow us to continue to grow. So from time to time, we may move around a little bit with that. But I feel like, as an objective and a long-term outlook, I think our margins are at a very good level. But I think if we can grow our revenue to high end, there's still some opportunity, I think, for margin growth."

And that's not really gaining ground significantly on the larger commercial book. With respect to the company taking risk and so forth, we do have some elements of risk-taking. It's predominantly on a physician practice side and not on the hospital side of the business. So it's a very small piece of the company's overall revenue, but more inside of our physician component than it is inside of our hospital component.

I trust most of you have had the opportunity to review our third quarter results released this morning. I'll make a couple of comments on the quarter, touch on a couple of other topics, then turn the call over to Bill and Sam to provide more detail on our third quarter results. 
I'm very pleased with our overall performance and execution in the quarter. We continued to use our free cash flow to invest in our markets to support future growth, and we returned cash to shareholders through share repurchase. 
Let me touch on the results for the quarter at a high level. The company experienced a solid quarter, with revenues for the third quarter totaling $10.27 billion, a 4.2% increase in the prior year, driven by 1.5% equivalent admission increase and a 2.7% net revenue per equivalent admission increase in the quarter. 
Net income attributable to HCA Holdings totaled $618 million, an increase of 37.7%, while earnings per diluted share totaled $1.59 per diluted share or $1.61 per diluted share before gains on the sale of facilities, losses on retirement of debt and legal claim cost. 
Earnings per diluted share for HCA Holdings per core gains or losses on sales, losses on retirement of debt and legal claims costs increased 37.6% compared to the prior year. As noted in our release this morning, the company also recognized reductions in the its provision for income taxes due to the adoption of a new accounting policy on equity award settlements of $11 million or $0.03 per diluted share and $51 million or $0.13 per diluted share from the completion of IRS review of the company's 2011 and 2012 federal income tax returns. 
Adjusted EBITDA totaled $1.957 billion in the third quarter compared to $1.815 billion last year, an increase of 7.8% over the prior year period. 
We had another solid quarter for cash flows from operations resulting in $1.206 billion compared to $1.101 billion in last year's third quarter, a 9.5% increase. We deployed $712 million for capital expenditures and $355 million to repurchase 4.637 million shares. We have repurchased a total of 29.064 million shares in 2016 at an average cost of $76.16 per share. And we had $309 million remaining on our $3 billion authorization at September 30, 2016. We expect to complete the remaining authorization by the end of the year. 
Let me provide an update on recent Hurricane Matthew on our Florida and South Carolina facilities. We experienced some minor disruption leading up to and during the storm. However, we came through the event without any major issues. I commend our entire team for their preparation and planning in anticipation of the hurricane, which minimized any disruption of service to our patients. 
And yesterday, we announced an agreement with the University Hospital Authority and Trust for the early termination of HCA's lease of the Children's Hospital at Oklahoma University Medical Center and also the termination of a joint operating agreement. In addition to the termination, HCA will transfer ownership of its hospital operations in Oklahoma, which includes 2 other hospitals, the University Hospital Authority and Trust. Under the agreement, HCA will receive $750 million in consideration, and the transaction is expected to be completed in the first half of 2017. 
So with that, let me turn the call over to Bill and Sam for additional details in the quarter."

I will add to Milton's comments and provide more detail on our performance and results for the third quarter. As we reported, in the third quarter, our same facility admissions increased 0.7% over the prior year, and equivalent admissions increased 1.3%. Year to date, equivalent admissions were up 2% over the prior year. Sam will provide more comments around volume in a moment and our views and trends by payer class. 
During the third quarter, same facility Medicare admissions and equivalent admissions increased 1.8% and 2.5%, respectively. This includes both traditional and managed Medicare. Managed Medicare admissions increased 3.4% on a same facility basis and represents 33.5% of our total Medicare admissions. On a year-to-date basis, Medicare equivalent admissions are up 2.2% over the prior year. 
Same facility Medicaid admissions and equivalent admissions increased 2.3% and 3.4%, respectively, in the quarter, fairly consistent with our recent trends and our year-to-date growth of equivalent admissions of 3.2%. 
Same facility self-pay and charity admissions increased 0.7% in the quarter. These represent 8% of our total admissions, which was unchanged from last year's third quarter. Year-to-date, our same facility uninsured admissions are up 5.2% from the same period last year. 
Managed care and other, including exchange admissions, declined 1.8% and equivalent admissions declined 1.4% on a same facility basis in the third quarter. However, on a year-to-date basis, same facility managed, other and exchange equivalent admissions remain slightly up. 
Same facility emergency room visits increased 2.7% in the quarter compared to the prior year. Same facility self-pay and charity ER visits represent 20.1% of our total ER visits in the quarter compared to 20.5% last year. On a year-to-date basis, same facility emergency room visits have increased 4.6%. 
Intensity of service or acuity increased in the quarter with our same facility case mix increasing 4.7% compared to the prior year period. Same facility revenue per equivalent admission increased 2.7%. Managed care and other, including exchange revenue per equivalent admission, is turning consistent with prior periods. When adjusted for certain items, it grew approximately 6.5% in the quarter and 6.7% year-to-date. 
Same facility charity care and uninsured discounts increased $639 million in the quarter compared to the prior year. Same facility charity care discounts totaled $1.042 billion in the quarter, an increase of $118 million from the prior year period, while same facility uninsured discounts totaled $3.295 billion, an increase of $521 million over the prior year period. 
Now turning to expenses. Expense management in the quarter was very good and led to a 70-basis-point margin expansion as compared to the prior year. Same facility operating expense per equivalent admission increased 1.9% compared to last year's third quarter. Our consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin was 19.1% for the quarter as compared to 18.4% in the third quarter of last year. 
Same facility salaries per equivalent admission increased 1.4% compared to last year's third quarter. Salaries and benefits as a percent of revenues decreased 80 basis points compared to the third quarter of 2015. Same facility supply expense per equivalent admission increased 1.5% for the third quarter compared to the prior year. And supply cost as a percent of revenue improved 20 basis points versus prior year. 
Other operating expenses as a percent of revenues increased 30 basis points from last year's third quarter to 18.5% of revenue, primarily reflecting an increase in year-over-year professional fees that we discussed on our last 2 calls. 
Let me touch briefly on cash flow. We had another strong quarter with cash flows from operations just over $1.2 billion. Year-to-date, cash flows from operations were $3.954 billion, which is a $778 million increase or a 24.5% growth from prior year. Cash flow from operations is benefited by $129 million on a year-to-date basis due to the adoption of the accounting policy around the excess tax benefit related to the settlement of equity awards. 
At the end of the quarter, we had approximately $2.050 billion available under our revolving credit facilities. Debt to adjusted EBITDA was 3.86x at September 30, 2016 compared to 3.85x at December 31, '15. 
I also want to highlight our earnings per share results. For the quarter, our diluted earnings per share, excluding losses on retirement of debt, legal claim cost and gains or losses on sales of facilities, increased 37.6% to $1.61 per diluted share from $1.17 in the prior year period. As indicated in our release, EPS for the quarter does include a $0.03 benefit due to adopting the new accounting policy and a $0.13 benefit from the IRS exam settlement. The strong cash flows, balance sheet position and EPS growth results highlight an important strength of the company. 
Let me touch briefly on health reform. Health reform activity continued to grow over the prior year in the quarter. In the third quarter, we saw approximately 13,000 same facility exchange admissions as compared to approximately 11,500 in the third quarter of last year or a 13% year-over-year growth. You may recall, we saw about 13,300 exchange admissions in the second quarter. We saw 49,000 same facility exchange ER visits in the third quarter compared to 40,700 in the third quarter of '15 and 54,000 in the second quarter of 2016. So overall, these reform trends are tracking in line with our expectations and have been very stable over the past several quarters. 
So that concludes my remarks, and I'll turn the call over to Sam for some additional comments."

Let me begin by giving you some of the quarterly volume stats that I normally provide on these calls.

Let me begin by giving you some of the quarterly volume stats that I normally provide on these calls. Once again, the company continued to have broad-based growth across our markets and wide-ranging growth across the various facilities and service lines that make up our business. 
For our domestic operations, on a same facility basis, 10 of 14 divisions had growth in admissions, 10 of 14 divisions had growth in adjusted admissions and 12 of 14 divisions had growth in emergency room visits. Freestanding emergency room visits grew 12.5% and accounted for approximately 40% of our overall ER growth. Hospital-based emergency room visits grew 1.8%. 
In addition to the solid portfolio performance across our 42 markets, the company's growth across its diversified service lines was also strong. For domestic operations, on a same facility basis, inpatient surgeries grew 0.9%, which increased surgical admissions to 28.6% of total admissions in the quarter, an increase of 100 basis points as compared to last year. Surgical volumes were particularly strong again this quarter in cardiovascular, orthopedics and general surgery categories. Outpatient surgeries were slightly down in the quarter by 0.3%. Hospital-based outpatient surgical volumes declined 0.9%, while volumes increased 0.4% in our freestanding ambulatory surgery division. This softness was felt across multiple service lines and across many markets, and we were not able to identify any particular issue that drove the softness. 
Behavioral health admissions grew 1.5%. The issue with physician staffing shortages that we discussed last quarter was still the primary driver of the slower growth in this service line. 3 of our largest behavioral hospital units had staffing challenges. And without them, the company's admits in this service line would have been up 4.5%. 
Rehab admissions grew 4.3%, which was an acceleration of the growth rate as compared to the first half of the year. 
Deliveries were down 0.9% in the quarter. Again, this decline was concentrated in Medicaid deliveries. Neonatal admissions increased 1.5%, which is an improvement over the growth rate in the first half of the year. Cardiology procedure volumes grew approximately 4%. Trauma volumes grew almost 15%. Observation visits were up 5%. And finally, the company's urgent care visits, in total, grew 11.7%. The company currently has 71 centers. At this time last year, we had 50 centers. 
All in all, we had another good quarter of volume growth. However, the overall growth rate was not as high as we had planned. It is important to note that the third quarter last year was also a relatively strong volume quarter and presented a difficult comparison with inpatient admits up 2.9% and adjusted admissions up 3.6%. 
We believe this deceleration in the growth rate was primarily attributable to the following 2 reasons.  First, overall demand growth in inpatient services has moderated. When we study market data from the fourth quarter of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016, inpatient demand in our markets grew 1.7% for this 6-month period. This rate was down from the previous 5 quarters' average growth of approximately 3.5%, but is generally consistent with our longer-term view of inpatient demand growth, which is approximately 2% annually in HCA markets. 
Before I get into the details on the second reason, I want to indicate that the company grew its market share, albeit at a slower pace, for the 12 months ended March 31, 2016. 55% of our markets gained share during this period as compared to 68% of our markets in 2014. 
The second reason can be explained by growing competition in certain areas of our business. In particular, a growing supply of freestanding emergency rooms by independent companies and health systems in various Texas and Colorado markets has had an impact on emergency room visits and some downstream admissions. Also, in a couple of our Florida markets, we continue to be challenged with Medicare advantage health plan that classified emergency room patients as observation patients instead of inpatient admissions. 
Overall, we believe HCA has a comprehensive growth agenda and our execution remains strong. We continue to invest significantly in our growth agenda with increasing capital spending, coordinated marketing strategies and multiple human resource programs, including medical staff development. 
In sum, we believe the company has solid growth prospects across its uniquely diversified portfolio of markets and service lines, and we believe our local provider systems are well positioned to capitalize on these opportunities. 
With that, let me to turn the call back to Vic."

Let me -- Oklahoma City, let me just give a little background and then I'll relate it to your question. I think, Sheryl -- I mean, we had a relationship that dates back in 1998 with, I'll say, the University of Oklahoma. It's a more complicated structure than that because of how the state had to do a transaction with us. But we've had this relationship since 1998. And when the hospitals came together, there were a lot of challenges both for HCA and the University Hospitals. When you look at where we are today, which is almost 20 years past, this has been a remarkable success from, I think, everybody's standpoint in a very innovative public-private partnership. And so there's been a lot of investment, a lot of new programs, market share gains and so forth that really benefited the system. The way the deal was structured, it was structured as a lease. And we were in a situation, as was the hospital there, where we needed additional capital. And unfortunately, the other side was not in a position to extend the lease in any significant way that allowed us to get comfortable in making the kind of investment that needed to be made. So it was felt by both parties that it was better to go ahead and start the unwind now so it could be orderly for both sides of the equation, and that's where we wound up announcing this transaction yesterday. It was a complicated deal to get into and a complicated deal to get out because it was very intricately structured. So that does allow us, in the context of what we needed to make as an investment there, coupled with the type of lease that we had, to look at repositioning the capital to be at source for whatever we wanted to do, whether it was more capital expenditures or other components of our capital allocation strategy. And so it does fit into that. And I think that's part of what we considered as we went through our negotiations and our strategic analysis of this particular market."

And that's where we get to the 2% demand on the inpatient side. We think outpatient demand has a little bit more growth than that. So that process is consistent, and that's where we have landed on our view. There's nothing to suggest the 1 quarter in this particular year that, that particular view is off. And so we're relatively confident today. We haven't finished our analysis for all of 2017 and on that anything materially has changed. I think one thing that's positive in the overall demand is that commercial demand continues to be reasonably solid inside of HCA's markets in these 2 periods that I discussed in total. And so that's an encouraging metric that suggests our portfolio of market still has reasonable growth on the commercial side. Obviously, there's puts and takes to that.

And in that particular strategy, we feel pretty good about how we place those. We see the urgent care as an additional wrap around, if you will, our freestanding emergency room strategy, where there are certain components of certain markets where urgent care is the best answer because of either competitive hospital systems or other freestanding emergency room, and it provides a component that wraps around our freestanding emergency room or hospital emergency room strategy. So there's a blend of what the right facility is for the right situation. There's population, there's traffic, there's location of other hospitals in other freestanding emergency rooms. And we go through this process of mapping out the market and determining what exactly is the right fit and how we go about building this network further. In some respects, we try to build an urgent care strategy around our emergency room strategy, which is built around our hospital strategy. So it's almost a concentric circle of facilities that create a fairly broad HCA network in these large markets, allowing our patients to enter the system in different forms or different fashions and also creating relatively favorable price points, if you will, for our payers where they can direct as they feel they need to direct, but keep them in the HCA system. So it's hard to give you a specific because we have to look at the individual markets, but those are some of the general approaches that we take."

I also believe it's important to know, we've shared this in various investor meetings during the course of the year, but we got data that suggests there's almost 4 million people in our markets that are eligible for subsidies that have yet to participate. And so we're somewhat optimistic that some of those remaining eligible people may find their ways in enrollment. In terms of plan exiting, most of our major markets, if not all of our major markets, there's another plan offering to catch those lives.

I mean, everybody understands the implication of the commercial book. And so there's significant competition in that particular area. But what HCA is doing structurally to compete in those environments is similar to what we just talked about, how we do create outreach into these commercial segments, through outpatient facility, through freestanding emergency room, through growth in our outpatient surgical platforms, where we can start to develop relationships with our patients in a way that allow them to be connected and loyal to the HCA system. Additionally, with our position strategies, we are very targeted and working with our physicians who have commercial books of business to expand their capabilities, allowing us to reach further into those particular arenas and hopefully drive downstream businesses. And then finally, working with our health plan to come up with ways to help them grow in a way that benefits our system. So I think our overall approach is built around the basics of our growth architecture, including where we deploy capital expenditures. We're focusing our capital on those facilities that have great opportunities in commercial market, or in outpatient facilities in commercial market. So that's a part of our screening, if you will, for deploying capital, because the return prospects are greater in those particular scenarios. But our competitors do that, too. So it's a very competitive landscape, and there's movement in and out periodically from who's gaining and who's losing in those environments. But we're very comfortable with the approach and how we have deployed it. We think there are new opportunities with customer relationship management through digital technologies, patient navigation and other ways to differentiate HCA further. And we're continuing to invest in those initiatives as well. And we think we've got opportunities to respond to this dynamic in this market as we move further -- move forward rather, sorry."

And we've estimated over time that there may be 50 basis points of add-on, if you will, to the adjusted admissions factor. So it puts you in that 2.5% zone as maybe a demand growth for adjusted admissions. Obviously, the emergency room is a big piece of that. Outpatient surgery is the second largest piece of that component. And then it drops off from there where it's not a segment that at those 2 when you start looking at the outpatient market. With respect to our market share trends, historically you're correct. We've tended to average 25 to 40 basis points per year of company-wide market share growth. That has slowed a little bit because we've seen more suppliers in certain components of our business, as I indicated in my commentary. And then we've seen other components of our strategy, if you will, replicated. So we're having to up our game, and that's what we're doing. Our teams are challenged with coming up with innovative ways to deal with the competitive dynamic that are taking place within our markets. Again, we're leveraging great ideas from one market to the other to help the company stay ahead of our competition where we can. And we think some of our outreach efforts, our urgent care strategy and our very effective physician development strategies will continue to help the company stay competitive and hopefully, put ourselves in a position to sustain our market share gains as we move forward. It's really difficult for me to say exactly how 1 year, the next year is going to play out, because I don't have visibility into exactly what our competitors are going to do. But largely, our competitive landscape is not significantly different than what it was in the previous year. So I think there could be some incremental movements from one market to the other, and we just need to be prepared to deal with that, and I think we are. And we're doing everything we possibly can to sustain that kind of performance."

The number of patients in our hospitals in both those divisions were up when I bundle the 2. But when it comes to admissions statistics, then it obviously looks like those 2 divisions had challenges, but when we get underneath that, we don't see that to be a significant issue. When you look at Texas, compared to Florida, the state of Florida is a little bit more in a growth mode as far as the overall market, slightly up. But Texas continues to be a very good market for us with respect to overall growth of our markets and so forth. We have had a little bit of challenge in a couple of Western markets because of some dynamics with some of our competitors that got back into health plan when previously they weren't in certain health plans, so we think some of our physicians go back to our competitors. But all in all, a 10 out of 14 is very good. And just on the admission side, to give you some perspective, the 4 that were down, 1 of them was down 0.5%; 1 was down 1%, this is admission; 1 was down 1.5%; and 1 was down 3%. The 1 that was down 3% had the most Medicare Advantage issues. On an adjusted admission basis, 1 of them was down 0.2%; 1 was down 0.4%; and 1 was down 1.3% and 1%. So we're talking almost 14 out of 14. And when we normalize for some of these things, it would have been a little different number. So that's part of how we're looking at it, Frank, and we don't see anything unique in any 1 particular market that's really compromising the company in any significant way."

Well, at that time of the year, we're working on our plans, and as mentioned in my comments, we'll finish our current $3 billion share repurchase authorization by the end of this year. And we'll have substantial free cash flow next year. And as we think about capital allocation, think about our cash flow from operations, it'll probably be somewhere around $5.3 billion to $5.5 billion this year, as we think about that cash and the allocation of the capital, first thing we do is reinvest back in our existing markets. And this year, that would probably be about $2.7 billion. I would expect next year would be a similar amount, maybe up a little bit but around that same number. So that leaves us substantial free cash flow that obviously would be used for acquisitions. We have -- we always have a pipeline. We're looking for opportunities. Most recently, those acquisition opportunities have been tuck-in acquisitions complementary to our existing markets or outpatient acquisitions like urgent care that Sam's talked about. So -- and we'll quite continue to see those opportunities in the next year, and we'll be obviously well positioned to take advantage of them as they come to us. Larger acquisitions, they're always a possibility. We remain optimistic. We'll have some good opportunities. But as you know, from recent years, those are hard to predict when they will happen. But again, we remain with the balance sheet and the financial capabilities to take advantage of those if they present. And we'll always be looking out for those opportunities. And that raises then returning cash to shareholders. And I don't think they need to be mutually exclusive. I think if you look at HCA, we've had a very diversified approach to our capital allocation, I think we'll continue to have a diversified approach to capital allocation. And we will be looking at deploying additional cash to shareholders in 2017. We will be reviewing the possibility of a dividend. We'll have to think that through. We'll -- if we decide to do it, we'll probably talk about that in our next call. But we'll continue, I think, to be a repurchaser of our stock. We've been very pleased with investing our free cash flow back in our company stock. We think we've been doing that for a number of years since we've been public again. And it's been I think a great return on investment for our shareholders. So that's how we think about it, and we'll have more details on exactly what we'll do in '17 when we have our fourth quarter call and release our 2017 guidance."

One, we have to work with the payers to come up with the process that doesn't put us in a situation where we're disputing each other's classification of patients, and we're doing that. We're having active dialogue with the payers now on the concerns that we have. We're listening to their issues and seeing if we can find a resolution there. The second thing we can do when we disagree, we dispute, we go through a dispute resolution process to try to resolve it. That's obviously a little bit more of a protracted process. And then the third thing that we do if we can't reach a resolution on either one of those steps is we work with our medical staff to establish what we believe to be appropriate clinical protocol and require that those protocols be processed, if you will, appropriately by physicians who are making those decisions. We have done that in some instances, and that's allowed us to get through this particular situation. The economics are not significantly different between observation and inpatient in some payer contracts, but others, it can be. And that's where we have to be, again, very appropriate in how we respond to it. But those are some of the approaches, and we continue to work through those in this particular situation that we have, primarily in Florida."

But what we have done structurally is evolve our approach to interacting with our physicians in providing invoice in our facilities, creating efficient and frankly, capable institutions and really showing our physicians that we can grow the practices for them in a way that meets their objective. And I think that's sort of the HCA way, if you will, around our physician approach. We have evolved, as I indicated, over the 5 years, and we believe it makes sense in a lot of our markets to advance medical education training. And we have added Graduate Medical Education programs across the company over the last year, and we will continue to invest in additional Graduate Medical Education programs. That is providing opportunity for us to respond to market needs where there are physician shortages. It's also creating opportunities for us to improve our operations within our facilities. And then finally, it's addressing potential strategic issues and allowing us to generate physicians who can support our service line development and our overall growth agenda. So we're very excited about where we are with our Graduate Medical Education program.

If we can move to the high end, we think there could be some opportunity for margin growth. From time to time, we're making investments for the future. We're investing in programs like trauma.
