Today, I'll share an overview of our Q4 and overall 2015 performance. Then as we committed to on our last earnings call, Ken and I will discuss our plan for a more focused Yahoo in 2016 and beyond, with details on how we plan to concentrate our efforts, improve execution and further engage our users and advertisers. 
Let's begin with Q4 highlights. I'm pleased to report that our Q4 performance exceeded guidance across GAAP revenue, revenue ex-TAC, adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP operating income. In Q4, we delivered $1,273,000,000 of GAAP revenue, which was 6% above our guidance range. In terms of revenue ex-TAC, we delivered just over $1 billion of revenue in the quarter, approximately 4% above our guidance range. And we delivered $215 million of adjusted EBITDA, 7% above our guidance range. 
These results were enabled by Gemini Native, our Gemini native product, which continued to exceed expectations, and by strength in programmatic ads, which showed solid demand in Q4. I'd like to recognize our global sales team. They've worked tirelessly to deliver great return on investment to our clients and in turn to deliver these results.
Looking at 2015 in total, our GAAP revenue was just under $5 billion, up 8% year-over-year. I continue to be pleased to see top line GAAP revenue growth at this stage of our transformation. Our Display GAAP growth this year was propelled largely by growth in native and video with the addition of BrightRoll, offset by the drag of legacy Display. 
Search GAAP grew year-over-year as well with the addition of our Mozilla partnership. On an ex-TAC basis, revenue was $4,091,000,000, down 7% year-over-year, driven by partner payments. Overall, while we grew GAAP revenue, we did not grow ex-TAC revenue as we planned.
I now want to talk a bit about where we are in our turnaround. Yahoo today is a far stronger, more modern company than the one I joined 3.5 years ago. We've tripled our mobile audience to more than 600 million monthly users, improved many partnerships, streamlined our data centers, hired incredible technical talent and invested wisely to meet future needs. 
At the same time, we shifted resources towards growth-oriented businesses and markets by closing 22 offices and sunsetting more than 120 products and features. As a result, in 2015 alone, about 1/3 of our revenue was completely new revenue, with over $1.6 billion attributable to Mavens, mobile, video, native and social. I'd like to talk about the balance of new revenue versus legacy for a moment as well as some of the strategic decisions we've made.
In a turnaround, you must literally turn around declining revenue and get it to grow. There are 2 ways to do that: by returning current business lines to growth or by adding new business lines that grow. When I arrived at Yahoo, I reviewed all the lines of business. Each one was in decline and had been for years. Worse, we depended heavily upon banner ads and desktop users, both of which were declining in line with industry trends. 
That was the bad news. It meant we were sitting on about [ph] $5 billion of deteriorating revenue with essentially no clear path to growth. We needed to turn that around, that declining revenue with new businesses, not existing ones. And we needed something that was going to be big enough and grow fast enough to matter to a $5 billion business. 
The next decision you have to make in a turnaround is you completely cut deteriorating revenue lines so you can show significant growth faster or you try and stem the decline so you have the stability but know that the headwinds will last longer as legacy revenue continues to deteriorate. We chose the latter. Given the size of our revenue and user base, we really didn't have a choice. 
So to picture the turnaround, we knew we had a large but declining base of revenue. We know it would be irresponsible to walk away from large streams of revenue and profits prematurely. And we knew we had to invent new businesses that were extremely fast-growing and large enough to be material. 
Basically, our turnaround would look as shown here. were meant that we've had some amount of time where revenue was flat to down. However, during that period, the makeup of the revenue change dramatically. As an analogy, it could be described as a tectonic shift where the plates shift beneath your feet in terms of revenue composition but you stay at roughly the same elevation in terms of total revenue. However, once the new businesses become large enough, you'll see -- begin to see the revenue from those new businesses overpower the legacy from the old and show growth.
Let's look at this as how this has actually played out for Yahoo. In our case, the legacy revenue as banner ads, and to some extent, desktop search. We have quantified the headwinds as at times more than $100 million per quarter, in other words, close to $0.5 billion per year. The new businesses are our Mavens, and as noted earlier, they generated more than $1.6 billion in GAAP revenue last year. This is essentially from 0. 
Mavens, as a revenue source, didn't exist at all in 2011 and was nascent in 2012. As you look at our actuals combined with our projected outlook, it follows this pattern. That said, if you look at our Mavens businesses alone, it looks like this. You can see how impressive the growth is. It's an incredibly fast growing line of business, growing at 45% in 2015 year-over-year. 
Now let's turn to the strategic plan to support our forward projections. Today, we are announcing a strong set of actions that bring Yahoo into the future. We'll be doubling down in areas and markets of greatest strength so we can grow faster. 
Our plan covers 4 core areas: the first is to play to our strengths, to grow user engagement, particularly on mobile. We'll channel all of our efforts towards the products and markets that matter most to engage users, distinguish us competitively and drive growth. This focus will allow us to escalate the pace of innovation to make our best products even better faster.
Second, we will continue to drive Mavens revenue growth by investing in mobile, video, native and social through initiatives that improve advertiser satisfaction and sales. At the same time, we will continue to stabilize and slow declines in our legacy revenue. 
Third, we will simplify the business to improve execution. Through product sunsets and divestitures, we will continue to prune our portfolio so that our priorities and value are clear to users, advertisers, partners and shareholders. 
And finally, as a result of these changes, we must efficiently align our resources to our priorities and size the business accordingly. We believe these changes will improve our course and influence a positive trajectory on our earnings.
Let's go into more depth on each of these. Our vision for Yahoo isn't changing and is rooted in our beginnings as Dave and Jerry's guide to the World Wide Web. To consumers, we want to be known for discovery. We are guide to digital information discovery. We inform, connect and entertain them with our search communications and digital content products. 
Search communications and digital content form a 3-legged stool for Yahoo. Search is obviously essential to discovery, and the lucrative nature of Search makes it very important to our overall business. Communications drives frequency. Our most engaged and most frequent visitors have Yahoo Mail. 
Communications is easily the biggest driver of engagement on our network. And finally, digital content is our differentiation. People come to Yahoo because of our distinct voice through original content, aggregation and personalization. 
The analogy of the 3-legged stool holds true because if you remove any 1 of the 3 legs, the system and the business works less well. Remove Search and you lose a key element of discovery and also a really lucrative piece of the business. Remove Mail and you lose engagement and the frequency of use. Remove digital content and you remove our differentiation, the reason people turn to us over other mail and search providers. Together, the 3 of them form a true digital network and make Yahoo, Yahoo. 
On the B2B side, we're also an advertising-driven business, dedicated to helping our clients build and grow their businesses through precise targeting and superior return on investment. In 2016, Yahoo's portfolio will intensely focus on the products that drive the most substantial portion of our users, revenue and market opportunity. 
Yahoo is all about discovery. We'll be focused on 3 global platforms: Search, Mail and Tumblr, and 4 core verticals: News, Sports, Finance and Lifestyle in our priority markets, those markets being U.S., Canada, U.K., Germany, Hong Kong and Taiwan. To prioritize these markets, we're shifting our focus away from local products for most of Europe and Latin America, and going forward, Yahoo will be defined by 2 core advertiser offerings: Gemini and BrightRoll. 
Gemini combines Search and native ads for superior results while BrightRoll is being expended to offer programmatic buying and selling for video, display and native advertising. Our total user population exceeds 1 billion monthly users. While we have one of the largest audiences on the web, 2016 is about growing how much each user uses Yahoo. In other words, engagement. And we want that engagement to grow, particularly on mobile. We must create more useful, relevant products to grow our page views, drive more logged-in users and grow our daily active users or DAUs. 
Our product strategies are designed to foster growth in these areas. Let's start with the first leg of the stool, Search. Search is key to Yahoo's user proposition of discovery. As the mobile search market continues to expand and as user behavior shifts more towards contextual search queries, we see mobile search as the biggest opportunity. 
As a result, we're shifting our focus toward forward-leaning mobile search investments and thinking through how Search should change. In Q4, we launched an initial update to our Yahoo Search application, the beginning of a complete re-imagination of mobile search. Given our strategic relationships with carriers and OEMs and the wealth of data within Yahoo Mail that can help us personalize our results better, we're positioned to succeed here. Overall, while this shift has and will continue to require great prioritization internally, we believe the mobile search opportunity will help drive sustainable, long-term growth and differentiation.
Turning to communications. Mail is a substantial driver of engagement across our entire product portfolio. In 2016, we're investing resources in speed, stability and features that can drive growth on our branded products. We'll continue to launch features that differentiate Yahoo Mail for consumers and improve their ability to share, search and connect. We want Yahoo Mail to be the absolute best place to send and receive your e-mail. 
In Q4, we launched the ability for users to integrate their AOL, Outlook and Gmail account, and we've already seen millions of new accounts connected. And with the Q4 launch of our redesigned Messenger product now integrated into Yahoo Mail, we're deepening engagement even further. Users are responding very positively. We've achieved an impressive 4.5-star rating on both the App Store and Google play. And we've reached record DAUs across our Mobile -- our Mail applications in Q4.
Finally, looking at digital content. There are really 2 areas: Tumblr and our verticals, that Yahoo has always been strong in: News, Sports, Finance and Lifestyles. These are areas in which we're already strong and where we will invest for engagement growth. By engaging users as both consumers and creators of content, they are more likely to remain on our network. 
With more than half of Tumblr users now on mobile, we're developing features to accelerate the mobile experience, including new mobile creation tools, in-stream recommendations and push notifications. The number of mobile follows has more than doubled since last year when we considered to be -- which we consider to be a strong indicator of user retention and engagement. 
We're also seeing incredible new traction in user-to-user engagement with the launch of Tumblr messaging in Q4. It now sees millions of messages sent each day. By focusing on areas where Yahoo is strong and differentiated, we can propel our execution to a new level. Focusing on just 4 areas: News, Sports, Finance and Lifestyles, we cannot only provide great content but also great tools and services in these areas. 
Tools, like Finance Portfolios or Yahoo's Fantasy Sports fuel our engagement and help us develop a deeper interaction with the user and keep them coming back. Just last week, we launched exciting changes to both the Yahoo App and yahoo.com, making it even easier than ever to -- for users to find, consume and engage around news, content and videos tailored to their interests. 
Also in 2016, we'll be rolling out new features across our Sports and Finance apps that make engaging with sports scores, players and stocks much more compelling. We'll also further integrate Polyvore into the Lifestyle vertical to bring the other incredible content with actionable, shoppable utilities. 
With these 7 products, Yahoo will better guide discovery for consumers going forward. Search, Mail and Tumblr will serve as global platforms to our worldwide audience. And our core verticals of News, Sports, Finance and Lifestyles will be more focused in our priority growth markets. Together, these products will play to our strength and deliver a deeply integrated and differentiated experience across Yahoo's entire network.
Revenue growth remains the most important indicator of progress in our transformation. Over the past few years, we've experienced strong headwinds from legacy Display as the industry shifts away from ad formats such as banner ads. In addition, the recurring non-advertising-based TIPLA royalty revenue for Alibaba has now expired. As these revenue streams come to a close, we expect absolute revenue to face pressure. We will achieve a baseline more reflective of a stronger performance and growth potential of our core products. 
As we seek to drive long-term sustainable revenue growth, our plan involves continued investment in Mavens to counterbalance legacy declines, with a particular emphasis on Mobile. With Mavens revenue at over $1.6 billion for the year, mobile is the largest contributor, adding over $1 billion or nearly 1/4 of our traffic-driven revenue. 
On video, we delivered $375 million of GAAP revenue in 2015, up 64% year-over-year. Our native ad business continues to grow sharply, with native Display totaling [ph] over $0.5 billion of GAAP revenue for the year. And social continues to be a long-term strategic play for us. We're pleased to see mobile DAUs on Tumblr up 34% year-over-year. At the same time, we're continuing to thoughtfully monetize Tumblr's growing audience. 
Looking ahead, we continue to bolster our Mavens investments and expect to grow double digits this year, reaching at least $1.8 billion in Mavens GAAP revenue in 2016. Underpinning that continued growth will be the M in Mavens, Mobile, especially with the mobile industry ad spend estimated to nearly double by 2018, with a sharper focus on growing DAUs across our 7 consumer products. 
We expect engagement growth, combined with improved monetization, will ultimately drive long-term sustainable revenue growth. In addition to the monetization of our own products, we're syndicating our Mobile tools with our Mobile developer suite, which continues to see great traction. Buoyed by our acquisition of Fleury, we now serve nearly 1/4 of 1 million developers, reaching nearly 800,000 apps across more than 2 billion devices with 10 billion sessions every day. 
These staggering numbers also mean real revenue. Yahoo App Publishing, which allows developers to monetize their apps, now contributes roughly half of our Gemini native revenue. Advertisers are increasingly embracing programmatic technology for its optimal performance, pricing and control. In line with this trend, our global sales team has been training and scaling from traditional premium-focused sales to performance and programmatic offerings. 
As part of this plan, we are streamlining our sales support and operations teams and simplifying our international organization to focus on fewer ad products. By refining our go-to-market strategy and reducing the number of client touch points, we expect to improve customer satisfaction. We have seen the benefits of this in Q4 with better-than-expected results. In all, these efforts are expected to drive sustainable growth going forward.
All sound strategies clarify what a company will and will not do. Yahoo cannot win the hearts and minds of users and advertisers with a complex fragmented portfolio of products and assets, especially if some no longer meet our aggressive growth goals or distract from growth products. A simplified Yahoo will yield better focus, execution and ultimately increase shareholder value. 
Since 2012, we've invested in a series of bets across different product areas in markets. In an industry fueled by innovation, continued experimentation is critical for growth. While some investments have become essential to Yahoo's transformation, others have not. We've taken an honest look at those bets and have chosen to re-prioritize many resources towards more proven areas of growth. 
To that end, in Q4, we closed Yahoo Screen and shifted away from original scripted content. In 2016, some of our digital magazines will have their content consolidated under 1 of our 4 core verticals while others will be shut down. We also exit legacy products, including Yahoo Games and smart TV. While we'll continue to support a handful of higher-margin higher engagement legacy products like Flickr, Answers and Groups, we will do so with a more efficient model that require significantly lower investment.
In addition to our clarified product portfolio, we've begun to explore divesting nonstrategic assets of value. As an example, these efforts include the responsible monetization of nonstrategic patents, the sale of valuable real estate and other noncore nonstrategic assets. In total, we estimate that these efforts could generate significant cash in excess of $1 billion. 
In sum, we believe a simplified Yahoo will increase shareholder value over the long term. Having fewer products also means we can improve those products faster and increase profitability and focus. With this plan, we will also execute on additional efforts to save money and operate more effectively and efficiently. 
Our new vision for the company requires each and every employee to work on areas that play to our strength and drive the company forward. We've already made significant strides in managing headcount and achieving quality and stability with fewer employees. Our workforce is 34% smaller today than it was in 2012 after reducing headcount from around 17,000 total employees, roughly 14,200 employees and 2,800 contractors to 10,400 employees and 860 contractors at the end of 2015. Throughout this time, we've also closed 22 offices. We value everyone who's dedicated themselves to Yahoo and made contributions here. The changes in our footprint to date have not been easy but they've been necessary to position the company for a stronger future.
To that end, as we've already shared with our employees, we plan to reduce our workforce by roughly 15%. In addition, we will be exiting 5 of our offices: Dubai, Mexico City, Buenos Aires, Madrid and Milan. A majority of this change will take place in Q1. But by the end of 2016, we anticipate we will have approximately 9,000 employees and less than 1,000 contractors. This represents a workforce that's roughly 42% smaller than it was in 2012 and will contribute to a total realized savings in short-term operating expense of approximately $400 million annually. This decision is not one we've taken lightly, and we will make every effort to treat affected employees with thoughtfulness, transparency and compassion. 
On the issue of cost, I want to take a moment to discuss some blatant falsehoods that have been circulating in the press about the company's spending. I find these untruths to be upsetting and I'm sure our investors have as well. And while we do not have time on today's call to address all of the inaccurate information, I want to touch on a few. 
For example, there have been reports of a $7 million holiday party and a $450 million spend on food over the past few years of the company. Both numbers are exaggerated by more than a factor of 3. Our holiday parties globally cost approximately $150 per invited attendee. Our food program is extremely well run, and all of our employee perks are standard for our industry in line with other companies in our area and generally run less expensively here than elsewhere. 
There's been discussion of millions of dollars spent on free smartphones. The notion of free implies that these were given to employees. These phones remain property of the company, much like the chairs and computers we issued to employees. 
Further, as is obvious from this call, mobile is a huge part of our strategy. We could not have built a billion-dollar mobile advertising business, one of the largest in the world. And for people building it did not use of the tools, platforms and products we expect our users to use. There are many more examples of untruths and mischaracterizations. We can't touch on all of them. However, please know that we are very thoughtful about how we spend company resources and we will continue to be.
We strongly believe that our strategic plan will create the best version of Yahoo for our users, advertisers, employees and shareholders. As we implement these changes, 2016 will very much be a transition year, with revenues and earnings expected to decline, returning to modest but accelerating growth in 2017 and 2018. 
In sum, we expect our 2016 strategic plan to deliver the following value: better user and advertiser product quality with growth and daily active users across our 3 global platforms, including Search, Mail and Tumblr and 4 core vertical utilities, News, Sports, Finance and Lifestyle in our priority markets; continuing Mavens growth well on track to exceed $1.8 billion in 2016; GAAP revenue impact of product and regional exits of approximately $100 million; improved profitability with an adjusted EBITDA run rate of more than $1 billion by the second half of 2016; an annual operating expense reduction of over $400 million by the end of 2016; and overall simplification of Yahoo's business through nonstrategic asset divestitures, generating in excess of $1 billion [ph] in cash. 
Before moving on from the plan, I want to say that I've never believed more in this company, in the people, in the products and in the inherent value of what we do. To be clear, this is a strong plan and a bold plan and one we are embarking on with the full support of the board. 
We are very proud of the new billion-dollar Mavens business, $1.6 billion in GAAP revenue to be exact that we have built from essentially 0 in just 3 years. Today's announcements build from that achievement and will dramatically brighten our future and improve our competitiveness and attractiveness to users, advertisers and partners. This plan sets out to make Yahoo the very best version of itself, and I'm confident in the company's ability to successfully execute it.
Turning now to capital allocation. We understand the importance of potential value maximization that could be realized by separating our Alibaba stake from our operating business. For this reason, the board and management are aligned for exploring additional strategic alternatives in parallel to the execution of our plan is in the best interest of our shareholders. 
Per our announcements in December, we have been focused on and evaluating our reverse spin transaction, whereby Yahoo's operating business and equity holdings in Yahoo Japan will be separated into a new operating entity. In addition to continuing the work on the reverse spin, the board will also engage with other qualified strategic proposals. Both the board and management feel pursuing these strategic alternatives in parallel is complementary to executing the plan. We are dedicated to being good stewards of capital and delivering shareholder value. 
With that, thank you for your contained confidence in Yahoo, and I'll now turn it over to Ken to talk a bit more about Q4 and our 2016 plan."

In short, we're encouraged that our fourth quarter results exceeded expectations in many of our core metrics. We had good overall revenue growth in 2015, up 8% over 2014, including significant contribution from Mavens revenue, which as Marissa say, grew to over $1.6 billion. 
Additionally, we have made progress in multiple initiatives to strengthen the business and drive efficiencies. I will provide greater detail around our strategic plan and our long-term financial model so you'll be able to see where our business is going, how we plan to deliver value to our shareholders. Lastly, I will discuss our outlook for the coming quarter and full year as we position Yahoo for sustainable and profitable growth.
First, some facts about our performance on progress on multiple fronts. Q4 GAAP revenue was $1.273 billion and revenue ex-TAC was $1.002 billion [ph] both above our guidance range as we saw better-than-expected performance on our native and programmatic Display businesses. For the full year 2015, GAAP revenue grew 8% year-over-year to $4.968 billion as we increased partnership revenue and executed on our Mavens investments. This helped to offset headwinds from the legacy businesses and the loss of TIPLA amortization. Revenue ex-TAC was $4.091 billion and Mavens delivered $1.660 billion GAAP revenue for the full year, growing by 45% over 2014 and now representing 36% of traffic-driven revenue versus 28% in the prior year.
Our Q4 revenue performance led to a better-than-expected adjusted EBITDA of $215 million as our business transition is leading to greater efficiencies. As a result of these efforts, our full-time employee base declined by approximately 300 [ph] in the quarter, ending at 10,400 and reflect a year-over-year reduction of 2,100 or 17% even though we continue substantially invest in the growth businesses. 
Non-GAAP EPS was $0.13 for Q4 and $0.59 for the full year. Ending diluted share count for the period was 952 million. [indiscernible] announcement today, we are further reshaping the company and expect to realize cost efficiencies that will be reflected in our financial results throughout the next year and beyond. 
Our new drivers of growth strength and building on a number of investments and acquisitions that have helped us to drive the growth trajectory of the new Yahoo, our Mavens strategy. Some have worked well and some have yet to but I expect to bear fruit. We continue to objectively and clinically evaluate how we will invest in these and other investments in this rapidly evolving technology landscape. 
Today, we are going to be providing additional detail related to our plan to further reshape the company, realize cost efficiencies and grow the business based on our core strengths. As we go through our fourth quarter full year 2015 results in greater detail, as seen on Slides 11 and 12, I will focus the discussion around non-GAAP results, which excludes stock-based compensation, restructuring charges and other expenses and charges and the related tax impacts from all of these items. 
Non-GAAP results also exclude a noncash goodwill impairment of $4.5 billion as a result of our annual goodwill impairment task performed as of October 31. I will provide more detail around this later in the call. You can find complete reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP results in our earnings slides at our Investor Relations website. 
In Q4, GAAP revenue was $1.273 billion, up 2% year-over-year or 4%, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Full year 2015 GAAP revenue was $4.968 billion, up 8% year-over-year. Search GAAP revenue grew 16% year-over-year while Display grew 11%. Traffic acquisition costs were $271 million, up $197 million compared to the prior year, primarily due to our Mizuho partnership, Gemini Search and growth in our Display networks, including video.
Revenue ex-TAC was $1.002 billion for Q4, and as I noted, $4.091 billion for the year. And taking a closer look at Search, GAAP Search revenue was $522 million in Q4, up 12% year-over-year. Search revenue ex-TAC declined 8% year-over-year due to click-driven revenue decline of 7% and increasing tax payments. 
Our global Paid Clicks declined 10% year-over-year in Q4 as we did see declines in Affiliate Yahoo traffic offset by growth from partners like Mizuho and Oracle. The key drivers of decline in volume decline in U.S. across the Affiliates and Yahoo Search investment into Gemini. PPC grew 3% mainly due to mix shift toward higher monetizing regions. We continue to make good progress on our internal Search efforts in Gemini and see consistent PPCs across our platforms. Our overall investment in Gemini was similar to Q3 and in line with our plans. We expect that our first vertical will start to reach their RPM targets in first quarter, and we expect to reach overall breakeven in second half of 2016.
Now moving to Display. We saw continuation of growth trends from the prior 2 quarters. GAAP Display revenue was $601 million, up 13% year-over-year as a result of our growing native and video businesses. Display ads sold grew 8% year-over-year, driven primarily by a continued native growth internationally and through our network of mobile apps. 
PPA increased 6% year-over-year, driven by the growth of our video formats and marketplaces. We also saw encouraging increases in our premium programmatic segments, helping to reduce the drag from the legacy formats. Display revenue ex-TAC grew 2% year-over-year, up 5%, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. 
Let me now provide the details in our Mavens investment businesses. Our Mavens GAAP revenue grew 26% [ph] year-over-year in Q4. Mavens now contributes 39% to our traffic-driven revenue, which is up 33% [ph] in the prior year. 
Video experienced another good and solid quarter of year-over-year growth, with many exciting highlights such as a successful global stream of the NFL game. An advertiser can now buy a native video ads formats in our BrightRoll platform. 
Mobile GAAP revenue grew 15% [ph] year-over-year, and we continue to see our native ads build scale through syndication partners such as [indiscernible]. This offset also some deceleration mobile search volumes. Our native Display revenue across all devices reached approximately $160 million a quarter, driven by volume growth internationally and through syndication. 
For our Tumblr, our priority remains through user growth and have been pleased with the progress made in engagement, with over 8% of daily users are Mobile. In 2015, we experienced a slower rate in monetization than we initially expected. And coupled with the sales realignment, the business did not deliver the $100 million revenue goal for the year.
Moving forward for the team has a solid plan in place, and we continue to believe that Tumblr's compelling content and attractive demographics will be a significant long-term driver of our overall Mavens and company growth. 
For revenue detail by region, please refer to Slide 10. Trends are consistent with the prior quarters. 
Now let me move to expenses. Non-GAAP total operating expense was $940 million for the quarter, which is up 2% versus prior year. Depreciation and amortization remains consistent with the past several quarters at approximately $150 million. Our non-GAAP cash expenses in the fourth quarter came in at $788 million, which was up 2% year-over-year. 
Excluding the $35 million patent sales in prior year, we saw a decline of approximately 2% year-over-year as we continued to carefully drive operating efficiencies for the company. Sequentially from Q3, we did see one-off increases in non-headcount-related costs relating to the quarter, which included NFL content cost, some additional legal costs and accruals for Accounts Receivable reserves. 
EBITDA was $215 million in Q4 with a margin of 21% based on revenue ex-TAC. Adjusted EBITDA for the full year was $952 million as we made investments in TAC to support our growth and partnership initiatives across search, communications and digital content. Non-GAAP operating income was $63 million and full year non-GAAP operating income was $342 million.
Now let me turn quickly to the balance sheet. I'd first like to cover our goodwill impairment charge. We test goodwill annually level during the first step, we determined the estimate fair value of reporting unit using income and market approaches by looking at future cash flows and current market comparables. As a result, we concluded the carrying value of several reporting units exceed their respective estimate fair values, resulting from a combination of factors, including a decrease in market capitalization in the fourth quarter and lower projected cash flows from the 2016 planning process as well as the overall decreases in public market valuations for technology companies. 
Our second step was performed to measure the impairment. This resulted in impairment charges for the following important units: $3.7 billion for U.S. and Canada, $530 million for Europe, $230 million for Tumblr and $8 million for Latin America. Goodwill impairment testing  is done in aggregate basis by reporting unit. As such, $2 billion of goodwill originated from acquisitions prior to 2007, $1.3 billion from acquisition from 2008 to 2011 and $1.2 billion from acquisitions since 2012.
Looking through -- looking back to the balance sheet, Alibaba investment was $31 billion on the balance sheet [indiscernible] Alibaba share price at the end of Q4 as this is mark-to-market. At the end of Q4, we had a $6.8 billion in cash and marketable securities, up $5.5 billion, net of convertible and other debt. 
Free cash flow for the quarter was $32 million, including CapEx, which included CapEx spending of $126 million related to our products and Mail, Search and Mavens investments. Free cash flow for the full year, adjusted for the settlement of $3.3 billion in tax related to the Alibaba IPO in Q1, was approximately $270 million. 
Let me now move the discussion to financial details about our strategic plan that incorporates our views for full year 2016 and a longer-term financial model. Earlier, Marissa outlined our strategy going forward. We anticipate this strategy will result in a business that delivers sustainable long-term revenue growth, enhanced profitability in excess of 25% EBITDA margins and significant free cash flow generation. 
To get to that point, our strategic plan includes specific changes to our product portfolio and geographic footprint. Our decisions to exit our deemphasize certain areas of our business will have a near-term revenue impact but are necessary in creating an improved company with a foundation of future growth and profitability. 
We will narrow our focus on key priorities of Mavens and mobile search monetization as we allocate resources and align efforts to 2016. To illustrate some of the changes for the year in detail, let me walk through a revenue bridge for how we think about full year targets. 
When starting with 2015 GAAP revenue, we factored in revenue changes arising from the loss of TIPLA amortization of approximately $200 million; strategic exit impact of approximately $100 million because we have a plan of consolidating our Digital Magazines and rightsizing our operational footprint; approximately $200 million decline from the platform shift Search business reflect volume trends we've experienced on desktop shifting our resources towards the 4 leaning areas of mobile search; the ongoing headwinds from our legacy Display listing of fees businesses will be a drag in the business of approximately $175 million. 
We expect our initiatives in Mavens areas across mobile, search, native social and video will continue to drive growth in the aggregate of approximately $200 million. All these factors result in a full year 2016 GAAP revenue expectation of $4.4 billion to $4.6 billion. 
As we realign the business, we will also invest in our core areas of search, communications and digital content to drive our long-term engagement and revenue growth. The combination of exits [indiscernible] and investments should allow us to operate a headcount of approximately 9,000 by the end of 2016 or nearly 15% below today's level. To do this, we will be driving business transformation, changing our approach to doing things in a few select areas. 
For example, increasing our sales efficiency by getting the right balance direct selling cost and sales support costs, rationalizing our regional approach in footprint, clarifying where we offer the full breadth of our global products. And G&A we have made progress over the last year, we still have an opportunity to rightsize the best-in-class benchmarks. And in technology we will cost core technology platforms with the products and businesses we are focusing on going forward. This will result in savings of $400 million approximately in 2016, with a focus on expenses that can reduce in the short term rather than fixed cost facilities, day sales and content expense that will take additional time to address. With those actions, we aim to achieve a non-GAAP cash expense run rate of $2.4 billion to $2.6 billion after 2016. 
While revenues will decline initially, EBITDA margin will improve as we move both variable and fixed costs as the year progresses. We expect full year adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $700 million to $800 million for 2016, exiting the year, however, with the second half annualized run rate of approximately $1 billion. As we think about longer-term targets, we plan to drive toward sustainable market growth rates with an EBITDA margin in excess of 25%.
In going through many of these changes in this transition year, we will be a more financially fit company with improving margins and growth over time. Regarding our separation with Alibaba, we continue to work through the business regulatory issues necessary to effectuate our reverse spinoff as well as other strategic options. 
The board and management team working with our advisors are committed to ensuring a separation of the Alibaba assets as and thoughtfully as possible. We are fully aligned with our shareholders in our desire to maximize value for this investment. 
Spinoffs involve separation of operating business are met the processes and there are a number of steps in consideration. As you can see on Slide 9 of the earnings deck, these include: separation planning, SEC matters such as filings, audit financials and review, convertible note consideration, compliance with our agreements regarding Yahoo Japan; a likely stockholder vote and other key steps as negotiation of third-party consents. 
Yahoo would be separated global operating business Japanese joint venture Yahoo Japan from the remaining entity, which we retain the Alibaba stake. The reverse spin raises a number of issues not raised forward spin we last year, some of which are not within our control. We estimate it will take 9 to 12 months to complete regarding future -- further shareholder value creation, where is the mention we have identified opportunities across real estate, patents, and other noncore assets. 
We will continue to execute at all types of value creation programs, providing additional capital. And during our tenure, we have repurchased over $9 billion and reduced diluted share count by over 20%. With the remaining authorization of $2.7 billion for share repurchases, we will be prudent around timing of returning capital or excess cash. Over time, we will have a balanced approach in returning cash to shareholders.
In summary, this strategy and financial plan builds on a track record we have in creating new streams of revenue while continuing to drive efficiencies in the business and manage platforms shifts. To for the next phase in transformation. 
Now let me cover our guidance for the upcoming quarter, which reflect many of the plan drivers I have previously discussed. For GAAP revenue we have now annualized the Mozilla partnership and BrightRoll acquisition. Investments in excess will have minimal revenue impact in Q1. TIPLA will continue to be a year-over-year headwind of approximately $69 million. 
For TAC, growth will moderate now that we have annualized Mozilla and BrightRoll. We expect growth driven by Gemini platform across Search and native advertiser. For Q1 guidance, we expect the following: GAAP revenue in the range of $1.05 billion to $1.09 billion; TAC of approximately $230 million; revenue ex-TAC in the range of $820 million to $860 million; adjusted EBITDA in the range of $100 million to $120 million; and non-GAAP operating income in the range of negative $50 million to negative $30 million. 
For the full year guidance, we expect the following: GAAP revenue in the range of $4.4 billion to $4.6 billion; TAC of approximately $1 billion; revenue ex-TAC in the range of $3.4 billion to $3.6 billion; and adjusted EBITDA in the range of $700 million to $800 million; and non-GAAP operating income in the range of $150 million to $250 million.
In closing, this guidance and our long-term targets reflect a more focused strategy for the company and actions we're taking to improve performance in 2016 and beyond. With that, Marissa and I would like to take your questions."

It's a complicated one because there's mobile search as it exists today, and then there's what mobile search might become in the future. One of the things that we are seeing is that PPCs on Mobile are under more pressure than they are in desktop. And the is because, for example, e-commerce transactions, et cetera, are more difficult from the mobile web on a smartphone. That said, we do see benefits and opportunities to do new kinds of advertising. For example, app marketing, et cetera in our -- in the mobile web offering or even more, so we would love to see Search evolve into a more app-oriented format, where either from within the Flurry software development kit or through standalone applications, we're able to drive are really rich at based experience for Search. And Search in that context probably be as much differently than web search does. Web search will always be really useful. But that said, you need in your when you're on the go under time pressure, you need to actually be searching a lot more personal information. You also need to have better -- a better understanding of what apps people have on their phone, et cetera. So, for example, I may want -- if I'm and say in downtown San Francisco 6:00 Saturday night, it's useful and you say okay use Yelp , use OpenTable to actually book a reservation and being able to know what applications you have in your phone deeply into them really provide great -- a great guidance. This is really where Yahoo's mission are on being the guide comes into play is something that's quite different, and it will monetize differently the user actually different. And we really think that mobile search needs a much deeper we imagination. So I would say a lot of the trends have been discussed were brought are true in terms of Mobile web-based Search. That said, we do think that app-based search some of the personal assistant work that's happening across the industry really takes mobile search and a new direction, and we think those are imaginations are only going to become more intense."

In general, we have been experiencing as we talked about rather intense legacy drag from our premium decline. That said, what we're seeing is in the premium ad dollars are shifting both into programmatic with the same ad formats but also in they're shifting into new ad formats. Largely the new ad formats are divided into our Mavens revenue. There are some historical ad formats that are staying in our legacy numbers. And so one of the things are seeing happening is there's a lot of Price-per-Ad pressure in the near term in terms of the immediate years following. As that premium shift to programmatic that mix shift continues to happen. That said, once that stabilizes, we do think we'll start to see price appreciation in programmatic selling of older style ad formats. And so that's one of the things that cause that to avoid back up. And in terms of Mavens as we projected, we anticipate will be at least $1.8 billion in 2016. We are really happy with the strong growth we've seen in Mobile and particularly in native. The fact that Gemini had more than $0.5 billion of GAAP revenue this past year is just terrific. It's a product that was invented in the middle of 2013. We're really excited about that. But overall as we looked at our strategic plan, one of the things that we did was we took a tighter view on revenue to basically help us really seek the types of efficiencies on cost that we ultimately would see. And so basically tied revenue number to really drive a larger of cost efficiencies across the business. But we feel confident that given the industry trends and our own product momentum here that this is a reasonable number."

One is in terms of cost, we are going to take -- we already talked about the actions on headcount. It'll take us a little bit of time to effectuate those. We do expect that to be fully effective for the second half of the year. So a lot of the cost that will go down includes workforce-related expenses. So that's a good part of it. There are facilities actions we're going to take as Marissa noted some of the facilities in that we are eliminating. So that also will be costs that we'll take out. We'll be taking out some content cost. Particularly we're looking at contest that don't make sense for where we are what regions were in, and so forth so there's a number of things we're going to do to take out costs. Certainly, the variable cost more quickly take out the fixed cost by nature a bit fixed but even there, we are going to do some work, particularly on the facilities come in my area. So -- and there's a lot of workforce-related cost like [indiscernible] whatever that will also come down with the headcount. So a lot of those costs as we take actions this quarter on those, and then they get effectuated, that's how we see second half. The other thing that helps us on the EBITDA for the second half is clearly, we expect revenue to grow in Q4. So we do expect normal seasonal pattern in Q4 revenue. So some of the better EBITDA is both from the reduced cost base by $100 million a quarter roughly as we go forward here. And once we get it all done, and 2 is then the higher revenue. I would say down the road, we continue -- we will continue to look at some of the fixed cost where we can be more effective in our data centers, other facilities consolidations we can do and so forth. May be areas of content or to ship arrangements that we can also reduce so there's a number of things that we look forward to as we go past '16 to '17. The thing is frankly, we've used a lot of objective data benchmarking and so forth to really drive us to be much more efficient and effective."

But we do feel confident in the $1.8 billion number. Still good solid growth and hopefully with good execution we can possibly better that number Ken."

With most of those applications being either in #1 or #2 in their both in terms of usage and ratings and other things. And so it is something that we think is really important to focus on in terms of digital content it helps us ultimately really differentiate, and they are very valuable businesses in this space where Yahoo can make a name for itself.

Today, I'll share an overview of our Q4 and overall 2015 performance. Then as we committed to on our last earnings call, Ken and I will discuss our plan for a more focused Yahoo in 2016 and beyond, with details on how we plan to concentrate our efforts, improve execution and further engage our users and advertisers.
Let's begin with Q4 highlights. I'm pleased to report that our Q4 performance exceeded guidance across GAAP revenue, revenue ex-TAC, adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP operating income. In Q4, we delivered $1,273,000,000 of GAAP revenue, which was 6% above our guidance range. In terms of revenue ex-TAC, we delivered just over $1 billion of revenue in the quarter, approximately 4% above our guidance range. And we delivered $215 million of adjusted EBITDA, 7% above our guidance range.
These results were enabled by Gemini native, our Gemini native product, which continued to exceed expectations, and by strength in programmatic ads, which showed solid demand in Q4. I'd like to recognize our global sales team. They've worked tirelessly to deliver great return on investment to our clients and in turn to deliver these results.
Looking at 2015 in total. Our GAAP revenue was just under $5 billion, up 8% year-over-year. I continue to be pleased to see top line GAAP revenue growth at this stage of our transformation. Our Display GAAP growth this year was propelled largely by growth in native and video with the addition of BrightRoll, offset by the drag of legacy Display.
Search GAAP grew year-over-year as well with the addition of our Mozilla partnership. On an ex-TAC basis, revenue was $4,091,000,000, down 7% year-over-year, driven by partner payments. Overall, while we grew GAAP revenue, we did not grow ex-TAC revenue as we planned.
I now want to talk a bit about where we are in our turnaround. Yahoo today is a far stronger, more modern company than the one I joined 3.5 years ago. We've tripled our mobile audience to more than 600 million monthly users, improved many partnerships, streamlined our data centers, hired incredible technical talent and invested wisely to meet future needs.
At the same time, we shifted resources towards growth-oriented businesses and markets by closing 22 offices and sunsetting more than 120 products and features. As a result, in 2015 alone, about 1/3 of our revenue was completely new revenue, with over $1.6 billion attributable to Mavens, mobile, video, native and social. I'd like to talk about the balance of new revenue versus legacy for a moment as well as some of the strategic decisions we've made.
In a turnaround, you must literally turn around declining revenue and get it to grow. There are 2 ways to do that: by returning current business lines to growth or by adding new business lines that grow. When I arrived at Yahoo, I reviewed all the lines of business. Each one was in decline and had been for years. Worse, we depended heavily upon banner ads and desktop users, both of which were declining in line with industry trends.
That was the bad news. It meant we were sitting on about $5 billion of deteriorating revenue with essentially no clear path to growth. We needed to turn that around, that declining revenue, with new businesses, not existing ones. And we needed something that was going to be big enough and grow fast enough to matter to a $5 billion business.
The next decision you have to make in a turnaround is you completely cut deteriorating revenue lines so you can show significant growth faster or you try and stem the decline so you have the stability but know that the headwinds will last longer as legacy revenue continues to deteriorate. We chose the latter. Given the size of our revenue and user base, we really didn't have a choice.
So to picture the turnaround, we knew we had a large but declining base of revenue. We know it would be irresponsible to walk away from large streams of revenue and profits prematurely. And we knew we had to invent new businesses that were extremely fast-growing and large enough to be material.
Basically, our turnaround would look as shown here. This would have meant that we would have had some amount of time where revenue was flat to down. However, during that period, the makeup of the revenue would change dramatically. As an analogy, it could be described as a tectonic shift where the plates shift beneath your feet in terms of revenue composition but you stay at roughly the same elevation in terms of total revenue. However, once the new businesses become large enough, you'll see -- begin to see the revenue from those new businesses overpower the legacy from the old and show growth.
Let's look at this as how this has actually played out for Yahoo. In our case, the legacy revenue is banner ads, and to some extent, desktop search. We have quantified the headwinds as at times more than $100 million per quarter, in other words, close to $0.5 billion per year. The new businesses are our Mavens, and as noted earlier, they generated more than $1.6 billion in GAAP revenue last year. This is essentially from 0.
Mavens, as a revenue source, didn't exist at all in 2011 and was nascent in 2012. As you look at our actuals combined with our projected outlook, it follows this pattern. That said, if you look at our Mavens businesses alone, it looks like this. You can see how impressive the growth is. It's an incredibly fast-growing line of business, growing at 45% in 2015 year-over-year.
Now let's turn to the strategic plan to support our forward projections. Today, we are announcing a strong set of actions that bring Yahoo into the future. We'll be doubling down in areas and markets of greatest strength so we can grow faster.
Our plan covers 4 core areas. The first is to play to our strengths, to grow user engagement, particularly on mobile. We'll channel all of our efforts towards the products and markets that matter most to engage users, distinguish us competitively and drive growth. This focus will allow us to escalate the pace of innovation to make our best products even better faster.
Second, we will continue to drive Mavens revenue growth by investing in mobile, video, native and social through initiatives that improve advertiser satisfaction and sales. At the same time, we will continue to stabilize and slow declines in our legacy revenue.
Third, we will simplify the business to improve execution. Through product sunsets and divestitures, we will continue to prune our portfolio so that our priorities and value are clear to users, advertisers, partners and shareholders.
And finally, as a result of these changes, we must efficiently align our resources to our priorities and size the business accordingly. We believe these changes will improve our course and influence a positive trajectory on our earnings.
Let's go into more depth on each of these. Our vision for Yahoo isn't changing and is rooted in our beginnings as Dave and Jerry's Guide to the World Wide Web. To consumers, we want to be known for discovery. We are guide to digital information discovery. We inform, connect and entertain them with our search communications and digital content products.
Search communications and digital content form a 3-legged stool for Yahoo. Search is obviously essential to discovery, and the lucrative nature of Search makes it very important to our overall business. Communications drives frequency. Our most engaged and most frequent visitors have Yahoo Mail. Communications is easily the biggest driver of engagement on our network. And finally, digital content is our differentiation. People come to Yahoo because of our distinct voice through original content, aggregation and personalization.
The analogy of the 3-legged stool holds true because if you remove any 1 of the 3 legs, the system and the business works less well. Remove Search and you lose a key element of discovery and also a really lucrative piece of the business. Remove Mail and you lose engagement and the frequency of use. Remove digital content and you remove our differentiation, the reason people turn to us over other mail and search providers. Together, the 3 of them form a true digital network and make Yahoo, Yahoo.
On the B2B side, we're also an advertising-driven business, dedicated to helping our clients build and grow their businesses through precise targeting and superior return on investment. In 2016, Yahoo's portfolio will intensely focus on the products that drive the most substantial portion of our users, revenue and market opportunity.
Yahoo is all about discovery. We'll be focused on 3 global platforms, Search, Mail and Tumblr; and 4 core verticals, News, Sports, Finance and Lifestyle in our priority markets, those markets being U.S., Canada, U.K., Germany, Hong Kong and Taiwan. To prioritize these markets, we're shifting our focus away from providing local products for most of Europe and Latin America, and going forward, Yahoo will be defined by 2 core advertiser offerings: Gemini and BrightRoll. Gemini combines Search and native ads for superior results while BrightRoll is being expanded to offer programmatic buying and selling for video, display and native advertising.
Our total user population exceeds 1 billion monthly users. While we have one of the largest audiences on the web, 2016 is about growing how much each user uses Yahoo, in other words, engagement. And we want that engagement to grow, particularly on mobile. We must create more useful, relevant products to grow our page views, drive more logged-in users and grow our daily active users or DAUs.
Our product strategies are designed to foster growth in these areas. Let's start with the first leg of the stool, Search. Search is key to Yahoo's user proposition of discovery. As the mobile search market continues to expand and as user behavior shifts more towards contextual search queries, we see mobile search as the biggest opportunity.
As a result, we're shifting our focus toward forward-leaning mobile search investments and thinking through how Search should change. In Q4, we launched an initial update to our Yahoo Search application, the beginning of a complete re-imagination of mobile search. Given our strategic relationships with carriers and OEMs and the wealth of data within Yahoo Mail that can help us personalize our results better, we're positioned to succeed here. Overall, while this shift has and will continue to require great prioritization internally, we believe that the mobile search opportunity will help drive sustainable, long-term growth and differentiation.
Turning to communications. Mail is a substantial driver of engagement across our entire product portfolio. In 2016, we're investing resources in speed, stability and features that can drive growth on our branded products. We'll continue to launch features that differentiate Yahoo Mail for consumers and improve their ability to share, search and connect. We want Yahoo Mail to be the absolute best place to send and receive your e-mail.
In Q4, we launched the ability for users to integrate their AOL, Outlook and Gmail account, and we've already seen millions of new accounts connected. And with the Q4 launch of our redesigned Messenger product now integrated into Yahoo Mail, we're deepening engagement even further. Users are responding very positively. We've achieved an impressive 4.5-star rating on both the App Store and Google Play. And we've reached record DAUs across our Mobile -- our Mail applications in Q4.
Finally, looking at digital content. There are really 2 areas, Tumblr and our verticals, that Yahoo has always been strong in: News, Sports, Finance and Lifestyles. These are areas in which we're already strong and where we will invest for engagement growth. By engaging users as both consumers and creators of content, they are more likely to remain on our network.
With more than half of Tumblr users now on mobile, we're developing features to accelerate the mobile experience, including new mobile creation tools, in-stream recommendations and push notifications. The number of mobile follows has more than doubled since last year when we considered -- when we considered to be a strong -- which we consider to be a strong indicator of user retention and engagement.
We're also seeing incredible new traction in user-to-user engagement with the launch of Tumblr Messaging in Q4. That now sees millions of messages sent each day. By focusing on areas where Yahoo is strong and differentiated, we can propel our execution to a new level. Focusing on just 4 areas, News, Sports, Finance and Lifestyles, we cannot only provide great content but also great tools and services in these areas.
Tools, like Finance portfolios or Yahoo's Fantasy Sports, fuel our engagement and help us develop a deeper interaction with the user and keep them coming back. Just last week, we launched exciting changes to both the Yahoo App and yahoo.com, making it even easier than ever to -- for users to find, consume and engage around news, content and videos tailored to their interests.
Also in 2016, we'll be rolling out new features across our Sports and Finance apps that make engaging with sports scores, players and stocks much more compelling. We'll also further integrate Polyvore into the Lifestyle vertical to bring the other incredible content with actionable, shoppable utilities.
With these 7 products, Yahoo will better guide discovery for consumers going forward. Search, Mail and Tumblr will serve as global platforms to our worldwide audience. And our core verticals of News, Sports, Finance and Lifestyle will be more focused in our priority growth markets. Together, these products will play to our strength and deliver a deeply integrated and differentiated experience across Yahoo's entire network.
Revenue growth remains the most important indicator of progress in our transformation. Over the past few years, we've experienced strong headwinds from legacy Display as the industry shifts away from ad formats such as banner ads. In addition, the recurring non-advertising-based TIPLA royalty revenue for Alibaba has now expired. As these revenue streams come to a close, we expect absolute revenue to face pressure. But we will achieve a baseline more reflective of a strong performance and growth potential of our core products.
As we seek to drive long-term sustainable revenue growth, our plan involves continued investment in Mavens to counterbalance legacy declines with a particular emphasis on mobile. With Mavens revenue at over $1.6 billion for the year, mobile is the largest contributor, adding over $1 billion or nearly 1/4 of our traffic-driven revenue.
On video, we delivered $375 million of GAAP revenue in 2015, up 64% year-over-year. Our native ad business continues to grow sharply, with native Display totaling over $0.5 billion of GAAP revenue for the year. And social continues to be a long-term strategic play for us. We're pleased to see mobile DAUs on Tumblr up 34% year-over-year. At the same time, we're continuing to thoughtfully monetize Tumblr's growing audience.
Looking ahead, we continue to bolster our Mavens investments and expect to grow double digits this year, reaching at least $1.8 billion in Mavens GAAP revenue in 2016. Underpinning that continued growth will be the M in Mavens, Mobile, especially with the mobile industry ad spend estimated to nearly double by 2018, with a sharper focus on growing DAUs across our 7 consumer products.
We expect engagement growth, combined with improved monetization, will ultimately drive long-term sustainable revenue growth. In addition to the monetization of our own products, we're syndicating our excellent mobile tools with our mobile developer suite, which continues to see great traction. Buoyed by our acquisition of Flurry, we now serve nearly 1/4 of 1 million developers, reaching nearly 800,000 apps across more than 2 billion devices with 10 billion sessions every day.
These staggering numbers also mean real revenue. Yahoo App Publishing, which allows developers to monetize their apps, now contributes roughly half of our Gemini native revenue. Advertisers are increasingly embracing programmatic technology for its optimal performance, pricing and control. In line with this trend, our global sales team has been training and scaling from traditional premium-focused sales to performance and programmatic offerings.
As part of this plan, we are streamlining our sales support and operations teams and simplifying our international organization to focus on fewer ad products. By refining our go-to-market strategy and reducing the number of client touch points, we expect to improve customer satisfaction. We have seen the benefits of this in Q4 with better-than-expected results. In all, these efforts are expected to drive sustainable growth going forward.
All sound strategies clarify what a company will and will not do. Yahoo cannot win the hearts and minds of users and advertisers with a complex fragmented portfolio of products and assets, especially if some no longer meet our aggressive growth goals or distract from growth products. A simplified Yahoo will yield better focus, execution and ultimately increase shareholder value.
Since 2012, we've invested in a series of bets across different product areas and markets. In an industry fueled by innovation, continued experimentation is critical for growth. While some investments have become essential to Yahoo's transformation, others have not. We've taken an honest look at those bets and have chosen to re-prioritize many resources towards more proven areas of growth.
To that end, in Q4, we closed Yahoo Screen and shifted away from original scripted content. In 2016, some of our digital magazines will have their content consolidated under 1 of our 4 core verticals while others will be shut down. We also exit legacy products, including Yahoo Games and Smart TV. While we will continue to support a handful of higher-margin, higher engagement legacy products like Flickr, Answers and Groups, we will do so with a more efficient model that require significantly lower investment.
In addition to our clarified product portfolio, we've begun to explore divesting nonstrategic assets of value. As an example, these efforts include the responsible monetization of nonstrategic patents, the sale of valuable real estate and other noncore, nonstrategic assets. In total, we estimate that these efforts could generate significant cash in excess of $1 billion.
In sum, we believe a simplified Yahoo will increase shareholder value over the long term. Having fewer products also means we can improve those products faster and increase profitability and focus. With this plan, we will also execute on additional efforts to save money and operate more effectively and efficiently.
Our new vision for the company requires each and every employee to work on areas that play to our strength and drive the company forward. We've already made significant strides in managing headcount and achieving quality and stability with fewer employees. Our workforce is 34% smaller today than it was in 2012 after reducing headcount from around 17,000 total employees, roughly 14,200 employees and 2,800 contractors, to 10,400 employees and 860 contractors at the end of 2015. Throughout this time, we've also closed 22 offices. We value everyone who's dedicated themselves to Yahoo and made contributions here. The changes in our employee footprint to date have not been easy, but they've been necessary to position the company for a stronger future.
To that end, as we've already shared with our employees, we plan to reduce our workforce by roughly 15%. In addition, we will be exiting 5 of our offices: Dubai, Mexico City, Buenos Aires, Madrid and Milan. A majority of these changes will take place in Q1. But by the end of 2016, we anticipate we will have approximately 9,000 employees and less than 1,000 contractors. This represents a workforce that is roughly 42% smaller than it was in 2012 and will contribute to a total realized savings in short-term operating expense of approximately $400 million annually. This decision is not one we've taken lightly, and we will make every effort to treat affected employees with thoughtfulness, transparency and compassion.
On the issue of cost, I want to take a moment to discuss some blatant falsehoods that have been circulating in the press about the company's spending. I find these untruths to be upsetting and I'm sure our investors have as well. And while we do not have time on today's call to address all of the inaccurate information, I want to touch on a few.
For example, there have been reports of a $7 million holiday party and a $450 million spend on food over the past few years of the company. Both numbers are exaggerated by more than a factor of 3. Our holiday parties globally cost approximately $150 per invited attendee. Our food program is extremely well run, and all of our employee perks are standard for our industry, in line with other companies in our area and generally run less expensively here than elsewhere.
There has been a discussion of millions of dollars spent on free smartphones. The notion of free implies that these were given to employees. These phones remain property of the company, much like the desk chairs and computers we issued to employees.
Further, as is obvious from this call, mobile is a huge part of our strategy. We could not have built a billion-dollar mobile advertising business, one of the largest in the world, if the people building it did not use the tools, platforms and products we expect our users to use. There are many more examples of untruths and mischaracterizations. We can't touch on all of them. However, please know that we are very thoughtful about how we spend company resources and we will continue to be.
We strongly believe that our strategic plan will create the best version of Yahoo for our users, advertisers, employees and shareholders. As we implement these changes, 2016 will very much be a transition year, with revenues and earnings expected to decline, returning to modest but accelerating growth in 2017 and 2018.
In sum, we expect our 2016 strategic plan to deliver the following value: better user and advertiser product quality with growth in daily active users across our 3 global platforms, including Search, Mail and Tumblr and 4 core vertical utilities, News, Sports, Finance and Lifestyle in our priority markets; continuing Mavens growth while on track to exceed $1.8 billion in 2016; GAAP revenue impact of product and regional exits of approximately $100 million; improved profitability with an adjusted EBITDA run rate of more than $1 billion by the second half of 2016; an annual operating expense reduction of over $400 million by the end of 2016; and overall simplification of Yahoo's business through nonstrategic asset divestitures, generating in excess of $1 billion in cash.
Before moving on from the plan, I want to say that I've never believed more in this company, in the people, in the products and in the inherent value of what we do. To be clear, this is a strong plan and a bold plan and one we are embarking on with the full support of the board.
We are very proud of the new billion-dollar Mavens business, $1.6 billion in GAAP revenue to be exact that we have built from essentially 0 in just 3 years. Today's announcements build from that achievement and will dramatically brighten our future and improve our competitiveness and attractiveness to users, advertisers and partners. This plan sets out to make Yahoo the very best version of itself, and I'm confident in the company's ability to successfully execute it.
Turning now to capital allocation. We understand the importance of potential value maximization that could be realized by separating our Alibaba stake from our operating business. For this reason, the board and management are aligned that exploring additional strategic alternatives in parallel to the execution of our plan is in the best interest of our shareholders.
Per our announcements in December, we have been focused on and evaluating our reverse spin transaction whereby Yahoo's operating business and equity holdings in Yahoo Japan will be separated into a new operating entity. In addition to continuing the work on the reverse spin, the board will also engage with other qualified strategic proposals. Both the board and management feel pursuing these strategic alternatives in parallel is complementary to executing the plan. We are dedicated to being good stewards of capital and delivering shareholder value.
With that, thank you for your contained confidence in Yahoo, and I'll now turn it over to Ken to talk a bit more about Q4 and our 2016 plan."

Today, I will review our Q4 and full year 2015 financial results. In short, we're encouraged that our fourth quarter results exceeded expectations in many of our core metrics. We had good ove",2847,"Thanks, Marissa, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. Today, I will review our Q4 and full year 2015 financial results. In short, we're encouraged that our fourth quarter results exceeded expectations in many of our core metrics. We had good overall revenue growth in 2015, up 8% over 2014, including significant contribution from Mavens revenue, which as Marissa said, grew to over $1.6 billion.
Additionally, we have made progress in multiple initiatives to strengthen the business and drive efficiencies. I will provide greater detail around our strategic plan and our long-term financial model so you'll be able to see where our business is going and how we plan to deliver value to our shareholders. Lastly, I will discuss our outlook for the coming quarter and full year as we position Yahoo for sustainable and profitable growth.
First, some facts about our performance and progress on multiple fronts. Q4 GAAP revenue was $1.273 billion and revenue ex-TAC was $1.002 billion, both above our guidance range as we saw better-than-expected performance on our native and programmatic Display businesses. For the full year 2015, GAAP revenue grew 8% year-over-year to $4.968 billion as we increased partnership revenue and executed on our Mavens investments. This helped to offset headwinds from the legacy businesses and the loss of TIPLA amortization. Revenue ex-TAC was $4.091 billion and Mavens delivered $1.660 billion GAAP revenue for the full year, growing by 45% over 2014 and now representing 36% of traffic-driven revenue versus 28% in the prior year.
Our Q4 revenue performance led to a better-than-expected adjusted EBITDA of $215 million as our business transition is leading to greater efficiencies. As a result of these efforts, our full-time employee base declined by approximately 300 in the quarter, ending at 10,400 and reflected a year-over-year reduction of 2,100 or 17% even though we continue substantially invest in the growth businesses.
Non-GAAP EPS was $0.13 for Q4 and $0.59 for the full year. Ending diluted share count for the period was 952 million. With the strategic plan announcement today, we are further reshaping the company and expect to realize cost efficiencies that will be reflected in our financial results throughout the next year and beyond.
Our new drivers of growth are strengthening and building on a number of investments and acquisitions that have helped us to drive the growth trajectory of the new Yahoo, our Mavens strategy. Some have worked well and some have yet to but are expected to bear fruit. We continue to objectively and clinically evaluate how we will invest in these and other investments in this rapidly evolving technology landscape.
Today, we are going to be providing additional detail related to our plan to further reshape the company, realize cost efficiencies and grow the business based on our core strengths. As we go through our fourth quarter full year 2015 results in greater detail, as seen on Slides 11 and 12, I will focus the discussion around non-GAAP results, which excludes stock-based compensation, restructuring charges and other expenses and charges and the related tax impacts from all of these items.
Non-GAAP results also exclude a noncash goodwill impairment of $4.5 billion as a result of our annual goodwill impairment test performed as of October 31. I will provide more detail around this later in the call. You can find complete reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP results in our earnings slides at our Investor Relations website.
In Q4, GAAP revenue was $1.273 billion, up 2% year-over-year or 4% excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Full year 2015 GAAP revenue was $4.968 billion, up 8% year-over-year. Search GAAP revenue grew 16% year-over-year while Display grew 11%. Traffic acquisition costs were $271 million, up $197 million compared to the prior year, primarily due to our Mozilla partnership, Gemini search and growth in our Display networks, including video.
Revenue ex-TAC was $1.002 billion for Q4, and as I noted, $4.091 billion for the year. And taking a closer look at Search, GAAP Search revenue was $522 million in Q4, up 12% year-over-year. Search revenue ex-TAC declined 8% year-over-year due to click-driven revenue decline of 7% and increasing TAC payments.
Our global Paid Clicks declined 10% year-over-year in Q4 as we did see declines in Affiliate Yahoo traffic offset by growth from strategic partners like Mozilla and Oracle. The key drivers of the decline were volume decline in the U.S. across the Affiliates and Yahoo Search and investment into Gemini. PPC grew 3% mainly due to mix shift toward higher monetizing regions. We continue to make good progress on our internal Search efforts in Gemini and see consistent PPCs across our platforms. Our overall investment in Gemini was similar to Q3 and in line with our plans. We expect that our first vertical will start to reach their RPM targets in first quarter, and we expect to reach overall breakeven in second half of 2016.
Now moving to Display. We saw continuation of growth trends from the prior 2 quarters. GAAP Display revenue was $601 million, up 13% year-over-year as a result of our growing native and video businesses. Display ads sold grew 8% year-over-year, driven primarily by a continued native growth internationally and through our network of mobile apps.
PPA increased 6% year-over-year, driven by the growth of our video formats and marketplaces. We also saw encouraging increases in our premium programmatic segments, helping to reduce the drag from the legacy formats. Display revenue ex-TAC grew 2% year-over-year, up 5% excluding the impact of foreign exchange.
Let me now provide the details in our Mavens investment businesses. Our Mavens GAAP revenue grew 26% year-over-year in Q4. Mavens now contributes 39% to our traffic-driven revenue, which is up 33% in the prior year.
Video experienced another good and solid quarter of year-over-year growth, with many exciting highlights such as a successful global stream of the NFL game. Advertisers can now buy our fast-growing native video ad formats on our BrightRoll platform.
Mobile GAAP revenue grew 15% year-over-year, and we continue to see our native ads build scale through syndication partners such as Bleacher Report and Cheetah. This will offset some deceleration in mobile search volumes. Our native Display revenue across all devices reached approximately $160 million a quarter, driven by volume growth internationally and through syndication.
For our Tumblr, our priority remains user growth, and we have been pleased with the progress made in engagement, with over 80% of daily users on Mobile. In 2015, we experienced a slower rate in monetization than we initially expected. And coupled with the sales realignment, the business did not deliver the $100 million revenue goal for the year.
Moving forward, the team has a solid plan in place, and we continue to believe that Tumblr's compelling content and attractive demographics will be a significant long-term driver of our overall Mavens and company growth.
For revenue detail by region, please refer to Slide 10. Trends are consistent with the prior quarters.
Now let me move to expenses. Non-GAAP total operating expenses were $940 million for the quarter, which is up 2% versus the prior year. Depreciation and amortization remains consistent with the past several quarters at approximately $150 million. Our non-GAAP cash expenses in the fourth quarter came in at $788 million, which was up 2% year-over-year.
Excluding the $35 million benefit from patent sales in the prior year, we saw a decline of approximately 2% year-over-year as we continued to carefully drive operating efficiencies for the company. Sequentially from Q3, we did see one-off increases in non-headcount-related costs relating to the quarter, which included NFL content cost, some additional legal costs and accruals for Accounts Receivable reserves. 
EBITDA was $215 million in Q4 with a margin of 21% based on revenue ex-TAC. Adjusted EBITDA for the full year was $952 million as we made investments in TAC to support our growth and partnership initiatives across search, communications and digital content. Non-GAAP operating income was $63 million and full year non-GAAP operating income was $342 million.
Now let me turn quickly to the balance sheet. I'd first like to cover our goodwill impairment charge. We test goodwill annually at the reporting unit level. During the first step, we determined the estimate fair value of each reporting unit using income and market approaches by looking at future cash flows and current market comparables. As a result, we concluded the carrying value of several reporting units exceed their respective estimate fair values, resulting from a combination of factors, including a sustained decrease in our market capitalization in the fourth quarter and lower projected cash flows from the 2016 planning process as well as the overall decreases in public market valuations for technology companies.
Our second step was performed to measure the impairment. This resulted in impairment charges for the following reported units: $3.7 billion for U.S. and Canada, $530 million for Europe, $230 million for Tumblr and $8 million for Latin America. Goodwill impairment testing is done in aggregate basis by reporting unit. As such, $2 billion of goodwill originated from acquisitions prior to 2007, $1.3 billion from acquisition from 2008 to 2011 and $1.2 billion from acquisitions since 2012.
Looking through -- looking back to the balance sheet. Our Alibaba investment was $31 billion on the balance sheet, affected [ph] the Alibaba share price at the end of Q4 as this was mark-to-market. At the end of Q4, we had a $6.8 billion in cash and marketable securities, up $5.5 billion net of convertible and other debt.
Free cash flow for the quarter was $32 million, including CapEx, which included CapEx spending of $126 million related to our products in Mail, Search and Mavens investments. Free cash flow for the full year adjusted for the settlement of $3.3 billion in tax related to the Alibaba IPO in Q1 was approximately $270 million.
Let me now move the discussion to financial details about our strategic plan that incorporates our views for full year 2016 and our longer-term financial model. Earlier, Marissa outlined our strategy going forward. We anticipate this strategy will result in a business that delivers sustainable long-term revenue growth, enhanced profitability in excess of 25% EBITDA margins and significant free cash flow generation.
To get to that point, our strategic plan includes specific changes to our product portfolio and geographic footprint. Our decisions to exit or deemphasize certain areas of our business will have a near-term revenue impact, but are necessary in creating an improved company with a foundation of future growth and profitability.
We will narrow our focus on key priorities of Mavens and mobile search monetization as we allocate resources and align efforts to 2016. To illustrate some of the changes for the year in detail, let me walk through a revenue bridge for how we think about full year targets.
When starting with 2015 GAAP revenue, we factored in revenue changes arising from the loss of TIPLA amortization of approximately $200 million; strategic exit impact of approximately $100 million as we enable [ph] our plan of consolidating our digital magazines and rightsizing our operational footprint; approximately $200 million decline from the platform shift to our Search business, reflecting the volume trends we experienced in our desktop and shifting our resources towards the 4 leading areas of mobile search; the ongoing headwinds from our legacy Display and listing of fees businesses will be a drag in the business of approximately $175 million. We expect our initiatives in Mavens areas across mobile search, native, social and video will continue to drive growth in the aggregate of approximately $200 million. All of these factors result in a full year 2016 GAAP revenue expectation of $4.4 billion to $4.6 billion.
As we realign the business, we will also invest in our core areas of search, communications and digital content to drive our long-term engagement and revenue growth. The combination of our exits, efficiency programs and investments should allow us to operate a headcount of approximately 9,000 by the end of 2016 or nearly 15% below today's level. To do this, we will be driving business transformation, changing our approach to doing things in a few select areas.
For example, increasing our sales efficiency by getting the right balance between direct selling cost and sales support cost, rationalizing our regional approach and footprint, clarifying where we offer the full breadth of our global products. In G&A, though we have made progress over the last year, we still have an opportunity to rightsize the best-in-class benchmarks. And in technology, we will more tightly align cost of core technology platforms with the products and businesses we are focusing on going forward.
This will result in savings of $400 million approximately in 2016 with a focus on expenses that can reduce in the short term rather than fixed costs as [ph] facilities, days sales and content expense that would take additional time to address. With those actions, we aim to achieve a non-GAAP cash expense run rate of $2.4 billion to $2.6 billion after 2016.
While revenues will decline initially, EBITDA margin will improve as we move both variable and fixed costs as the year progresses. We expect full year adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $700 million to $800 million for 2016, exiting the year, however, with a second half annualized run rate of approximately $1 billion. As we think about longer-term targets, we plan to drive towards sustainable market growth rates with an EBITDA margin in excess of 25%.
In going through many of these changes in this transition year, we will be a more financially fit company with improving margins and growth over time. Regarding our separation with Alibaba, we continue to work through the business and regulatory issues necessary to effectuate a reverse spinoff as well as other strategic options. The board and management team working with our advisers are committed to ensuring a separation of the Alibaba assets as expeditiously and thoughtfully as possible. We are fully aligned with our shareholders in our desire to maximize value for this investment.
Spinoffs that involve the separation of operating business are inherently complex and lengthy processes, and there are a number of steps and considerations. As you can see on Slide 9 of the earnings deck, these include: separation planning; SEC matters, such as filings, audited financials and review; convertible note consideration; compliance with our agreements regarding Yahoo Japan; a likely stockholder vote; and other key steps as negotiation of third-party consents.
Yahoo would be separating its global operating business as Japanese joint venture Yahoo Japan from the remaining entity, which we retain the Alibaba stake. The reverse spin raises a number of issues not raised in the forward spin we pursued last year, some of which are not within our control. We estimate it will take 9 to 12 months to complete. Regarding future -- further shareholder value creation, Marissa mentioned that we have identified opportunities across real estate, patents and other noncore assets. We will continue to execute at all types of value creation programs, providing additional capital. And during our 10 year [ph], we have repurchased over $9 billion and reduced diluted share count by over 20%. With the remaining authorization of $2.7 billion for share repurchases, we will be prudent around timing of returning capital to excess cash. Over time, we will have a balanced approach in returning cash to shareholders.
In summary, this strategy and financial plan builds on the track record we have in creating new streams of revenue while continuing to drive efficiencies in the business and manage platform shifts to set us up for the next phase in transformation.
Now let me cover our guidance for the upcoming quarter, which will reflect many of the planned drivers I have previously discussed. For GAAP revenue, we have now annualized the Mozilla partnership and BrightRoll acquisition. Investments in exits will have minimal revenue impact in Q1. TIPLA will continue to be a year-over-year headwind of approximately $69 million. For TAC, growth will moderate now that we have annualized Mozilla and BrightRoll. We expect growth driven by our Gemini platform across search and native advertising.
For Q1 guidance, we expect the following: GAAP revenue in the range of $1.05 billion to $1.09 billion, TAC of approximately $230 million, revenue ex-TAC in the range of $820 million to $860 million, adjusted EBITDA in the range of $100 million to $120 million and non-GAAP operating income in the range of negative $50 million to negative $30 million. For the full year guidance, we expect the following: GAAP revenue in the range of $4.4 billion to $4.6 billion, TAC of approximately $1 billion, revenue ex-TAC in the range of $3.4 billion to $3.6 billion, adjusted EBITDA in the range of $700 million to $800 million and non-GAAP operating income in the range of $150 million to $250 million.
In closing, this guidance and our long-term targets reflect a more focused strategy for the company and actions we're taking to improve performance in 2016 and beyond.
With that, Marissa and I would like to take your questions. Shibani?"

It's a complicated one because there's mobile search as it exists today, and then there's what mobile search might become in the future. One of the things that we are seeing is that PPCs on mobile are under more pressure than they are in desktop. And the large part of that is because, for example, e-commerce transactions, et cetera, are more difficult from the mobile web on a smartphone. That said, we do see benefits and opportunities to do new kinds of advertising, for example, app marketing, et cetera, in our -- in the context of our mobile web offering. But even more so, we would love to see search evolve into a more app-oriented format where either from within the Flurry software development kit or through stand-alone applications, we're able to drive a really rich app-based experience for search. And search in that context probably behaves much differently than web search does. Web search will always be really useful. But that said, when you need in your phone, when you're on the go, under time pressure, you need to actually be searching over a lot more personal information. You also need to have better -- a better understanding of what apps people have on their phone, et cetera. So for example, I may want -- if I'm somewhere, say, in downtown San Francisco as early as [ph] 6:00 on a Saturday night, it's useful -- so you'll say, okay, use Yelp , use OpenTable, to actually book a reservation. And being able to know what applications you have in your phone, deep link to them and really provide great -- a great guidance, this is really where Yahoo's mission around being the guide comes into play, is something that's quite different. And it will monetize differently. The user action will be different, and we really think that mobile search needs a much deeper reimagination. So I would say that a lot of the trends that have been discussed more broadly are true in terms of mobile web-based search. That said, we do think that app-based search and the personal assistant work that's happening across the industry really takes mobile search in a new direction, and we think those reimaginations are only going to become more intense."

In general, we have been experiencing, as we talked about, rather intense legacy drag from our premium decline. That said, what we're seeing is the premium ad dollars are shifting both into programmatic with the same ad formats, but also they're shifting into new ad formats. Largely, the new ad formats are customized into our Mavens revenue. There are some historical ad formats that are staying in our legacy numbers. And so one of the things you see happening is there's a lot of Price-per-Ad pressure in the near term in terms of the immediate years following. As that premium shift to programmatic, that mix shift continues to happen. That said, once that stabilizes, we do think we'll start to see price appreciation in programmatic selling of older-style ad formats. And so that's one of the things that causes that to buoy back up. And in terms of Mavens, as we projected, we anticipate it will be at least $1.8 billion in 2016. We're really happy with the strong growth we've seen in mobile and particularly in native. The fact that Gemini had more than $0.5 billion in GAAP revenue this past year is just terrific. It's a product that was invented in the middle of 2013. We're really excited about that. But overall as we looked at our strategic plan, one of the things that we did was we took a tighter view on revenue to basically help us really seek the types of efficiencies on cost that we ultimately would seek. And so we basically work with the tight revenue number to really drive a larger set of cost efficiencies across the business. But we feel confident that given the industry trends and our own product momentum here that this is a reasonable number."

One is in terms of cost, we're going to take -- we already talked about the actions on headcount. It'll take us a little bit time to effectuate those. We do expect that to be fully effective for the second half of the year. So a lot of the cost that will go down includes workforce-related expenses, so that's a good part of it. There are facilities actions we're going to take, as Marissa noted, some of the facilities that we are eliminating. So that also will be cost that we'll take out. We'll be taking out some content cost. Particularly, we're looking at content cost that don't make sense for where we are, what regions were in and so forth. So there's a number of things we're going to do to take out cost. Certainly, the variable costs are more quickly to take out. The fixed costs, by nature, are a bit fixed. But even there, we're going to do some work particularly on the facilities things that come in my area. So -- and then there's a lot of workforce-related costs, like T&E, whatever, that will also come down with the headcount. So a lot of those costs -- as we take actions this quarter on those and then they get effectuated, that's how we see second half. The other thing that helps us on the EBITDA for the second half is clearly we expect revenue to grow in Q4. So we do expect a normal seasonal pattern in Q4 revenue. So some of the better EBITDA is both from the reduced the cost base by $100 million a quarter roughly as we go forward here and once we get it all done, and 2 is then the higher revenue. I would say down the road, we continue -- we will continue to look at some of the fixed cost, where we can be more effective in our data centers, other facilities consolidations we can do and so forth. There may be areas in content partnership arrangements that we can also reduce. So there's a number of things that we look forward to as we go past '16 to '17. And the thing is, frankly, we've used a lot of objective data benchmarking and so forth to really drive us -- ourselves to be much more efficient and effective."

And it's not surprising that the strategy for maximizing our value is also going to be complex. Yes, we need to execute on our strategic plan. We need to create the very best version of Yahoo that we can create. We also see a lot of possible value in a spinoff transaction and the reverse spinoff being likely the most viable there. And then finally, as we announced today, we would like to take a look at alternative strategic opportunities. And so we need to look at all 3 of those. It is going to be very busy. But to put things in perspective, for the majority of people here at Yahoo, we really need to be focused on executing the plan because executing the plan well creates value in all possible scenarios and really increases our shareholder value. And that's what the majority of people here will be working on. There is a smaller group, much the same group that worked on the forward spin last year, that will be dedicating time to the reverse spin. There's many of the same complexities. There's a few new complexities, and they'll be dedicating their time there. And reviewing strategic alternatives, as well it should be, will be a board-led process. And so various heads [ph] in our board will be dedicating their time there. I will have to spend time on each of the 3 things. But again, my view is the highest priority for me personally is working on the strategic plan and making sure that we really execute to the best of our abilities inside the company because that's what unlocks the most shareholder value."

Obviously, the web is really large and in that sense [ph], is nearly infinite. And so calling all information that's around the web that's publicly available, that's privately available is something that's really challenging and very capital intensive. In mobile search, it's much more about your personal information: how can we make you more efficient, more effective, know where you might want to be going, how to get you there most efficiently, what apps can help you accomplish the ask that you ultimately want to accomplish. The search space is basically a bit [ph] smaller the required disk space, the computation space is smaller and we just think it really comes down to -- there's a lot about being able to do those basics in search well. But then it's really around user interaction, user expectations and how do we build the best possible application to really meet those needs. But I think the overall cost profile will be somewhat different, and I do think this is an area that's really deeply in need of reimagination. I think when you look at how smartphones have transformed so many different industries and different types of activities that we all do, when you look at search and mail, it's very clear that there's going to be a lot more evolution to come. And that's something that we're really excited to participate in, and we have a long heritage in search. We have a lot of people here who have great ideas about what they'd like to do."

It really set records in a number of different ways in terms of a live event, live sporting event. It was just one of the biggest audiences ever assembled for something like that, and it's because the NFL brought us such great content. But I was also really proud of how our team executed technically. We had, I believe, a 0.6% rebuffering rate, which is unheard of across the industry. We're running an incredibly high definition on all platforms. It was really, really magnificent to see how the technical piece of this performed. I think it really shows how strong our streaming technology can be and where streaming ultimately can go. It also -- we also, I think, really showed and one of the things we really learned was the value of our network and the value of our large audience. The fact that on a Sunday morning, frankly quite early in a lot of places where they like to watch NFL, we were able to assemble such a large audience by basically putting the game in places where people who were coming to Yahoo properties might see it and might go on to view it. That was something that worked incredibly well, and it shows that Yahoo, having that large audience, what it can really do in terms of disturbing great content and helping our users really get that same content. And then finally, I was really very impressed with our sales team. We had more than 30 different brands participating in approximately 70 spots overall in the game. The commercials were all terrific, and I was just really happy with the execution of those advertisements for our advertisers, and our advertisers were really excited about it as well to participate in that type of opportunity. So it's terrific to be involved in. I think we learned a lot technically. We learned a lot about what our audience can provide. We learned a lot about what we can do for advertisers in a video live stream format."

So when we look at these 4 verticals and building out the best-of-breed application on Mobile for them, Gemini is how we'll begin to monetize them. That said, we have been doing some experimentation lately with some, for example, first -- sort of the day takeovers, things like that. So the first time you boot up the application you might see, for example, a full-screen advertisement. We tried that on Tumblr. That works well. But I would say with the ad formats we have, I'm comfortable with our ad load. I would rather not see us increase it. But one of the things we have seen excitement around both from advertisers and from users is in sometimes changing up some of the ad formats, introducing new ad formats and possibly increasing the ad load that way."

Today, I'll share an overview of our Q4 and overall 2015 performance. Then as we committed to on our last earnings call, Ken and I will discuss our plan for a more focused Yahoo in 2016 and beyond, with details on how we plan to concentrate our efforts, improve execution and further engage our users and advertisers.
Let's begin with Q4 highlights. I'm pleased to report that our Q4 performance exceeded guidance across GAAP revenue, revenue ex-TAC, adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP operating income. In Q4, we delivered $1,273,000,000 of GAAP revenue, which was 6% above our guidance range. In terms of revenue ex-TAC, we delivered just over $1 billion of revenue in the quarter, approximately 4% above our guidance range. And we delivered $215 million of adjusted EBITDA, 7% above our guidance range.
These results were enabled by Gemini native -- our Gemini native product, which continued to exceed expectations, and by strength in programmatic ads, which showed solid demand in Q4. I'd like to recognize our global sales team. They've worked tirelessly to deliver a great return on investment to our clients and in turn to deliver these results.
Looking at 2015 in total. Our GAAP revenue was just under $5 billion, up 8% year-over-year. I continue to be pleased to see top line GAAP revenue growth at this stage of our transformation. Our Display GAAP growth this year was propelled largely by growth in native and video with the addition of BrightRoll, offset by the drag of legacy Display.
Search GAAP grew year-over-year as well with the addition of our Mozilla partnership. On an ex-TAC basis, revenue was $4,091,000,000, down 7% year-over-year, driven by partner payments. Overall, while we grew GAAP revenue, we did not grow ex-TAC revenue as we planned.
I now want to talk a bit about where we are in our turnaround. Yahoo today is a far stronger, more modern company than the one I joined 3.5 years ago. We've tripled our mobile audience to more than 600 million monthly users, improved many partnerships, streamlined our data centers, hired incredible technical talent and invested wisely to meet future needs.
At the same time, we've shifted resources towards growth-oriented businesses and markets by closing 22 offices and sunsetting more than 120 products and features. As a result, in 2015 alone, about 1/3 of our revenue was completely new revenue with over $1.6 billion attributable to Mavens; mobile, video, native and social. I'd like to talk about the balance of new revenue versus legacy for a moment as well as some of the strategic decisions we've made.
In a turnaround, you must literally turn around declining revenue and get it to grow. There are 2 ways to do that: by returning current business lines to growth or by adding new business lines that grow. When I arrived at Yahoo, I reviewed all the lines of business. Each one was in decline and had been for years. Worse, we depended heavily upon banner ads and desktop users, both of which were declining in line with industry trends.
That was the bad news. It meant we were sitting on about $5 billion of deteriorating revenue with essentially no clear path to growth. We needed to turn that around, that declining revenue, with new businesses, not existing ones. And we needed something that was going to be big enough and grow fast enough to matter to a $5 billion business.
The next decision you have to make in a turnaround is do you completely cut deteriorating revenue lines so you can show significant growth faster or do you try and stem the decline so you have the stability but know that the headwinds will last longer as legacy revenue continues to deteriorate. We chose the latter. Given the size of our revenue and user base, we really didn't have a choice.
So to picture the turnaround, we knew we had a large but declining base of revenue. We knew it would be irresponsible to walk away from large streams of revenue and profits prematurely. And we knew we had to invent new businesses that were extremely fast-growing and large enough to be material.
Basically, our turnaround would look as shown here. This would have meant that we would have had some amount of time where revenue was flat to down. However, during that period, the make up of the revenue would change dramatically. As an analogy, it could be described as a tectonic shift where the plates shift beneath your feet in terms of revenue composition but you stay at roughly the same elevation in terms of total revenue. However, once the new businesses become large enough, you'll see -- begin to see the revenue from those new businesses overpower the legacy from the old and show growth.
Let's look at this as how this has actually played out for Yahoo. In our case, the legacy revenue is banner ads, and to some extent, desktop search. We have quantified the headwinds as at times more than $100 million per quarter, in other words, close to $0.5 billion per year. The new businesses are our Mavens, and as noted earlier, they generated more than $1.6 billion in GAAP revenue last year. This is essentially from 0.
Mavens, as a revenue source, didn't exist at all in 2011 and was nascent in 2012. And if you look at our actuals combined with our projected outlook, it follows this pattern. That said, if you look at our Mavens businesses alone, it looks like this. You can see how impressive the growth is. It's an incredibly fast-growing line of business, growing at 45% in 2015 year-over-year.
Now let's turn to the strategic plan that supports our forward projections. Today, we are announcing a strong set of actions that bring Yahoo into the future. We'll be doubling down in areas and markets of greatest strength so we can grow faster.
Our plan covers 4 core areas. The first is to play to our strengths, to grow user engagement, particularly on mobile. We'll channel all of our efforts towards the products and markets that matter most to engage users, distinguish us competitively and drive growth. This focus will let us escalate the pace of innovation to make our best products even better, faster.
Second, we will continue to drive Mavens revenue growth by investing in mobile, video, native and social through initiatives that improve advertiser satisfaction and sales. At the same time, we will continue to stabilize and slow declines in our legacy revenue.
Third, we will simplify the business to improve execution. Through product sunsets and divestitures, we will continue to prune our portfolio so that our priorities and value are clearer to users, advertisers, partners and shareholders.
And finally, as a result of these changes, we must efficiently align our resources to our priorities and size the business accordingly. We believe these changes will improve our course and influence a positive trajectory on our earnings.
Let's go into more depth on each of these. Our vision for Yahoo isn't changing and is rooted in our beginnings as Dave and Jerry's Guide to the World Wide Web. To consumers, we want to be known for discovery. We are a guide to digital information discovery. We inform, connect and entertain them with our search, communications and digital content products.
Search, communications and digital content form a 3-legged stool for Yahoo. Search is obviously essential to discovery, and the lucrative nature of Search makes it very important to our overall business. Communications drives frequency. Our most engaged and most frequent visitors have Yahoo Mail. Communications is easily the biggest driver of engagement on our network. And finally, digital content is our differentiation. People come to Yahoo because of our distinct voice through original content, aggregation and personalization.
The analogy of the 3-legged stool holds true because if you remove any 1 of the 3 legs, the system and the business works less well. Remove Search and you lose a key element of discovery and also a really lucrative piece of the business. Remove Mail and you lose engagement and the frequency of use. Remove digital content and you remove our differentiation, the reason people turn to us over other mail and search providers. Together, the 3 of them form a true digital network and make Yahoo, Yahoo.
On the B2B side, we're also an advertising-driven business, dedicated to helping our clients build and grow their businesses through precise targeting and superior return on investment. In 2016, Yahoo's portfolio will intensely focus on the products that drive the most substantial portion of our users, revenue and market opportunity.
Yahoo is all about discovery. We'll be focused on 3 global platforms, Search, Mail and Tumblr; and 4 core verticals, News, Sports, Finance and Lifestyle in our priority markets, those markets being U.S., Canada, U.K., Germany, Hong Kong and Taiwan. To prioritize these markets, we're shifting our focus away from providing local products for most of Europe and Latin America, and going forward, Yahoo will be defined by 2 core advertiser offerings: Gemini and BrightRoll. Gemini combines Search and native ads for superior results while BrightRoll is being expanded to offer programmatic buying and selling for video, display and native advertising.
Our total user population exceeds 1 billion monthly users. While we have one of the largest audiences on the web, 2016 is about growing how much each user uses Yahoo, in other words, engagement. And we want that engagement to grow, particularly on mobile. We must create more useful, relevant products to grow our page views, drive more logged-in users and grow our daily active users or DAUs.
Our product strategies are designed to foster growth in these areas. Let's start with the first leg of the stool, Search. Search is key to Yahoo's user proposition of discovery. As the mobile search market continues to expand and as user behavior shifts more towards contextual search queries, we see mobile search as the biggest opportunity.
As a result, we're shifting our focus toward forward-leaning mobile search investments and thinking through how Search should change. In Q4, we launched an initial update to our Yahoo Search application, the beginning of a complete re-imagination of mobile search. Given our strategic relationships with carriers and OEMs and the wealth of data within Yahoo Mail that can help us personalize our results better, we're positioned to succeed here. Overall, while this shift has and will continue to require great prioritization internally, we believe the mobile search opportunity will help drive sustainable, long-term growth and differentiation.
Turning to communications. Mail is a substantial driver of engagement across our entire product portfolio. In 2016, we're investing resources in speed, stability and features that can drive growth on our branded products. We'll continue to launch features that differentiate Yahoo Mail for consumers and improve their ability to share, search and connect. We want Yahoo Mail to be the absolute best place to send and receive your e-mail.
In Q4, we launched the ability for users to integrate their AOL, Outlook and Gmail account, and we've already seen millions of new accounts connected. And with the Q4 launch of our redesigned Messenger product now integrated into Yahoo Mail, we're deepening engagement even further. Users are responding very positively. We've achieved an impressive 4.5-star rating on both the App Store and Google Play. And we've reached record DAUs across our Mobile -- our Mail applications in Q4.
Finally, looking at digital content. There are really 2 areas, Tumblr and our verticals that Yahoo has always been strong in: News, Sports, Finance and Lifestyles. These are areas in which we're already strong and where we will invest for engagement growth. By engaging users as both consumers and creators of content, they are more likely to remain on our network.
With more than half of Tumblr users now on mobile, we're developing features to accelerate the mobile experience, including new mobile creation tools, in-stream recommendations and push notifications. The number of mobile follows has more than doubled since last year when we considered -- when we considered to be a strong -- which we consider to be a strong indicator of user retention and engagement.
We're also seeing incredible new traction in user-to-user engagement with the launch of Tumblr Messaging in Q4 that now sees millions of messages sent each day. By focusing on areas where Yahoo is strong and differentiated, we can propel our execution to a new level. Focusing on just 4 areas, News, Sports, Finance and Lifestyles, we can, not only, provide great content but also great tools and services in these areas.
Tools, like Finance portfolios or Yahoo's Fantasy Sports, fuel our engagement and help us develop a deeper interaction with the user and keeps them coming back. Just last week, we launched exciting changes to both the Yahoo App and yahoo.com, making it even easier than ever to -- for users to find, consume and engage around news, content and videos tailored to their interests.
Also in 2016, we'll be rolling out new features across our Sports and Finance apps that make engaging with sports scores, players and stocks much more compelling. We'll also further integrate Polyvore into the Lifestyle vertical to bring the other incredible content with actionable, shoppable utilities.
With these 7 products, Yahoo will better guide discovery for consumers going forward. Search, Mail and Tumblr will serve as global platforms to our worldwide audience. And our core verticals of News, Sports, Finance and Lifestyle will be more focused in our priority growth markets. Together, these products will play to our strengths and deliver a deeply integrated and differentiated experience across Yahoo's entire network.
Revenue growth remains the most important indicator of progress in our transformation. Over the past few years, we've experienced strong headwinds from legacy Display as the industry shifts away from ad formats such as banner ads. In addition, the recurring non-advertising-based TIPLA royalty revenue for Alibaba has now expired. As these revenue streams come to a close, we expect absolute revenue to face pressure. But we will achieve a baseline more reflective of a strong performance and growth potential of our core products.
As we seek to drive long-term sustainable revenue growth, our plan involves continued investment in Mavens to counterbalance legacy declines with a particular emphasis on mobile. With Mavens revenue at over $1.6 billion for the year, mobile is the largest contributor, adding over $1 billion or nearly 1/4 of our traffic-driven revenue.
On video, we delivered $375 million of GAAP revenue in 2015, up 64% year-over-year. Our native ad business continues to grow sharply, with native Display totaling over $0.5 billion of GAAP revenue for the year. And as social continues to be a long-term strategic play for us, we're pleased to see mobile DAUs on Tumblr up 34% year-over-year. At the same time, we're continuing to thoughtfully monetize Tumblr's growing audience.
Looking ahead, we continue to bolster our Mavens investments and expect to grow double digits this year, reaching at least $1.8 billion in Mavens GAAP revenue in 2016. Underpinning that continued growth will be the M in Mavens, Mobile, especially with the mobile industry ad spend estimated to nearly double by 2018. With a sharper focus on growing DAUs across our 7 consumer products, we expect engagement growth, combined with improved monetization, will ultimately drive long-term sustainable revenue growth. In addition to the monetization of our own products, we're syndicating our excellent mobile tools with our mobile developer suite, which continues to see great traction. Buoyed by our acquisition of Flurry, we now serve nearly 0.25 million developers, reaching nearly 800,000 apps across more than 2 billion devices with 10 billion sessions every day.
These staggering numbers also mean real revenue. Yahoo App Publishing, which allows developers to monetize their apps, now contributes roughly half of our Gemini native revenue. Advertisers are increasingly embracing programmatic technology for its optimal performance, pricing and control. In line with this trend, our global sales team has been training and scaling from traditional premium-focused sales to performance and programmatic offerings.
As part of this plan, we are streamlining our sales support and operations teams and simplifying our international organization to focus on fewer ad products. By refining our go-to-market strategy and reducing the number of client touch points, we expect to improve customer satisfaction. We have seen the benefits of this in Q4 with better-than-expected results. In all, these efforts are expected to drive sustainable growth going forward.
All sound strategies clarify what a company will and will not do. Yahoo cannot win the hearts and minds of users and advertisers with a complex fragmented portfolio of products and assets, especially if some no longer meet our aggressive growth goals or distract from growth products. A simplified Yahoo will yield better focus, execution and ultimately increase shareholder value.
Since 2012, we've invested in a series of bets across different product areas and markets. In an industry fueled by innovation, continued experimentation is critical for growth. While some investments have become essential to Yahoo's transformation, others have not. We've taken an honest look at those bets and have chosen to re-prioritize many resources towards more proven areas of growth.
To that end, in Q4, we closed Yahoo Screen and shifted away from original scripted content. In 2016, some of our digital magazines will have their content consolidated under 1 of our 4 core verticals while others will be shut down. We also exit legacy products, including Yahoo Games and Smart TV. While we will continue to support a handful of higher-margin, higher engagement legacy products like Flickr, Answers and Groups, we will do so with a more efficient model that requires significantly lower investment.
In addition to our clarified product portfolio, we've begun to explore divesting nonstrategic assets of value. As an example, these efforts include the responsible monetization of nonstrategic patents, the sale of valuable real estate and other noncore, nonstrategic assets. In total, we estimate that these efforts could generate significant cash in excess of $1 billion.
In sum, we believe a simplified Yahoo will increase shareholder value over the long term. Having fewer products also means we can improve those products faster and increase profitability and focus. With this plan, we will also execute on additional efforts to save money and operate more effectively and efficiently.
Our new vision for the company requires each and every employee to work on areas that play to our strength and drive the company forward. We've already made significant strides in managing headcount and achieving quality and stability with fewer employees. Our workforce is 34% smaller today than it was in 2012 after reducing headcount from around 17,000 total employees, roughly 14,200 employees and 2,800 contractors, to 10,400 employees and 860 contractors at the end of 2015. Throughout this time, we've also closed 22 offices. We value everyone who's dedicated themselves to Yahoo and made contributions here. The changes in our employee footprint to date have not been easy, but they've been necessary to position the company for a stronger future.
To that end, as we've already shared with our employees, we plan to reduce our workforce by roughly 15%. In addition, we will be exiting 5 of our offices: Dubai, Mexico City, Buenos Aires, Madrid and Milan. A majority of these changes will take place in Q1. But by the end of 2016, we anticipate we will have approximately 9,000 employees and less than 1,000 contractors. This represents a workforce that is roughly 42% smaller than it was in 2012 and will contribute to a total realized savings in short-term operating expense of approximately $400 million annually. This decision is not one we've taken lightly, and we will make every effort to treat affected employees with thoughtfulness, transparency and compassion.
On the issue of costs, I wanted to take a moment to discuss some blatant falsehoods that have been circulating in the press about the company's spending. I have found these untruths to be upsetting and I'm sure our investors have as well. And while we do not have time on today's call to address all of the inaccurate information, I want to touch on a few.
For example, there have been reports of a $7 million holiday party and a $450 million spend on food over the past few years at the company. Both numbers are exaggerated by more than a factor of 3. Our holiday parties globally cost approximately $150 per invited attendee. Our food program is extremely well run, and all of our employee perks are standard for our industry, in line with other companies in our area and generally run less expensively here than elsewhere.
There has been a discussion of millions of dollars spent on free smartphones. The notion of free implies that these were given to employees. These phones remain property of the company, much like the desks, chairs and computers we issued to employees.
Further, as is obvious from this call, mobile is a huge part of our strategy. We could not have built a billion-dollar mobile advertising business, one of the largest in the world, if the people building it did not use the tools, platforms and products we expect our users to use. There are many more examples of untruths and mischaracterizations. We can't touch on all of them. However, please know that we are very thoughtful about how we spend company resources and we will continue to be.
We strongly believe that our strategic plan will create the best version of Yahoo for our users, advertisers, employees and shareholders. As we implement these changes, 2016 will very much be a transition year with revenues and earnings expected to decline, returning to modest but accelerating growth in 2017 and 2018.
In sum, we expect our 2016 strategic plan to deliver the following value: better user and advertiser product quality with growth in daily active users across our 3 global platforms, including Search, Mail and Tumblr and 4 core vertical utilities, News, Sports, Finance and Lifestyle in our priority markets; continuing Mavens growth while on track to exceed $1.8 billion in 2016; GAAP revenue impact of product and regional exits of approximately $100 million; improved profitability with an adjusted EBITDA run rate of more than $1 billion by the second half of 2016; an annual operating expense reduction of over $400 million by the end of 2016; and overall simplification of Yahoo's business through nonstrategic asset divestitures, generating in excess of $1 billion in cash.
Before moving on from the plan, I wanted to say that I have never believed more in this company, in the people, in the products and in the inherent value of what we do. To be clear, this is a strong plan and a bold plan and one we are embarking on with the full support of the board.
We are very proud of the new billion-dollar Mavens business, $1.6 billion in GAAP revenue to be exact that we have built from essentially 0 in just 3 years. Today's announcements build from that achievement and will dramatically brighten our future and improve our competitiveness and attractiveness to users, advertisers and partners. This plan sets out to make Yahoo the very best version of itself, and I'm confident in the company's ability to successfully execute it.
Turning now to capital allocation. We understand the importance of potential value maximization that could be realized by separating our Alibaba stake from our operating business. For this reason, the board and management are aligned that exploring additional strategic alternatives in parallel to the execution of our plan is in the best interest of our shareholders.
Per our announcements in December, we have been focused on and evaluating a reverse spin transaction, whereby Yahoo's operating business and equity holdings in Yahoo Japan would be separated into a new operating entity. In addition to continuing the work on the reverse spin, the board will also engage with other qualified strategic proposals. Both the board and management feel pursuing these strategic alternatives in parallel is complementary to executing the plan. We are dedicated to being good stewards of capital and delivering shareholder value.
With that, thank you for your contained confidence in Yahoo, and I'll now turn it over to Ken to talk a bit more about Q4 and our 2016 plan."

We had good ove",2868,"Thanks, Marissa, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. Today, I will review our Q4 and full year 2015 financial results. In short, we're encouraged that our fourth quarter results exceeded expectations in many of our core metrics. We had good overall revenue growth in 2015, up 8% over 2014, including a significant contribution from Mavens revenue, which as Marissa said, grew to over $1.6 billion.
Additionally, we have made progress on multiple initiatives to strengthen the business and drive efficiencies. I will provide greater detail around our strategic plan and our long-term financial model so you'll be able to see where our business is going and how we plan to deliver value to our shareholders. Lastly, I will discuss our outlook for the coming quarter and full year as we position Yahoo for sustainable and profitable growth.
First, some facts about our performance and progress on multiple fronts. Q4 GAAP revenue was $1.273 billion and revenue ex-TAC was $1.002 billion, both above our guidance range as we saw better-than-expected performance in our native and programmatic Display businesses. For the full year 2015, GAAP revenue grew 8% year-over-year to $4.968 billion as we increased partnership revenue and executed on our Mavens investments. This helped offset headwinds from our legacy businesses and the loss of TIPLA amortization. Revenue ex-TAC was $4.091 billion and Mavens delivered $1.660 billion GAAP revenue for the full year, growing by 45% over 2014 and now representing 36% of traffic-driven revenue versus 28% in the prior year.
Our Q4 revenue performance led to a better-than-expected adjusted EBITDA of $215 million as our business transition is leading to greater efficiencies. As a result of these efforts, our full-time employee base declined by approximately 300 in the quarter, ending at 10,400 and reflected a year-over-year reduction of 2,100 or 17% even though we continue to substantially invest in the growth businesses.
Non-GAAP EPS was $0.13 for Q4 and $0.59 for the full year. Ending diluted share count for the period was 952 million. With our strategic plan announcement today, we are further reshaping the company and expect to realize cost efficiencies that will be reflected in our financial results throughout the next year and beyond.
Our new drivers of growth are strengthening and building on a number of investments and acquisitions that have helped us to drive the growth trajectory of the new Yahoo. Our Mavens strategy: Some have worked well and some have yet to but are expected to bear fruit. We continue to objectively and clinically evaluate how we will invest in these and other investments in this rapidly evolving technology landscape.
Today, we are going to be providing additional detail related to our plan to further reshape the company, realize cost efficiencies and grow the business based on our core strengths. As we go through our fourth quarter full year 2015 results in greater detail, as seen on Slides 11 and 12, I will focus the discussion around non-GAAP results, which excludes stock-based compensation, restructuring charges and other expenses and charges, and the related tax impacts from all of these items.
Non-GAAP results also exclude a noncash goodwill impairment of $4.5 billion as a result of our annual goodwill impairment test performed as of October 31. I will provide more detail around this later in the call. You can find complete reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP results in our earnings slides on our Investor Relations website.
In Q4, GAAP revenue was $1.273 billion, up 2% year-over-year or 4% excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Full year 2015 GAAP revenue was $4.968 billion, up 8% year-over-year. Search GAAP revenue grew 16% year-over-year while Display grew 11%. Traffic acquisition costs were $271 million, up $197 million compared to the prior year, primarily due to our Mozilla partnership, Gemini search and growth in our Display networks, including video.
Revenue ex-TAC was $1.002 billion for Q4, and as I noted, $4.091 billion for the year. And taking a closer look at Search, GAAP Search revenue was $522 million in Q4, up 12% year-over-year. Search revenue ex-TAC declined 8% year-over-year due to a click-driven revenue decline of 7% and increasing TAC payments.
Our global Paid Clicks declined 10% year-over-year in Q4 as we did see declines in Affiliate Yahoo traffic offset by growth from strategic partners like Mozilla and Oracle. The key drivers of the decline were volume decline in the U.S. across the Affiliates and Yahoo Search and investment into Gemini. PPC grew 3% mainly due to mix shift toward higher monetizing regions. We continue to make good progress on our internal Search efforts on the [ph] Gemini and see consistent PPCs across our platforms. Our overall investment in Gemini was similar to Q3 and in line with our plans. We expect that our first verticals will start to reach their RPM targets in the first quarter, and we expect to reach overall breakeven in the second half of 2016.
Now moving to Display. We saw a continuation of growth trends from the prior 2 quarters. GAAP Display revenue was $601 million, up 13% year-over-year as a result of our growing native and video businesses. Display ads sold [ph] grew 8% year-over-year, driven primarily by a continued native growth internationally and through our network of mobile apps.
PPA increased 6% year-over-year, driven by the growth of our video formats and marketplaces. We also saw encouraging increases in our premium programmatic segments, helping to reduce the drag from the legacy formats. Display revenue ex-TAC grew 2% year-over-year, up 5% excluding the impact of foreign exchange.
Let me now provide details on our Mavens investment businesses. Our Mavens GAAP revenue grew 26% year-over-year in Q4. Mavens now contributes 39% to our traffic-driven revenue, which was up 33% in the prior year.
Video experienced another good and solid quarter of year-over-year growth, with many exciting highlights such as a successful global stream of the NFL game. And advertisers can now buy our fast-growing native video ad formats on our BrightRoll platform.
Mobile GAAP revenue grew 15% year-over-year, and we continued to see our native ads build scale through syndication partners such as Bleacher Report and Cheetah. This will offset some deceleration in mobile search volumes. Our native Display revenue across all devices reached approximately $160 million in the quarter, driven by volume growth internationally and through syndication.
For our Tumblr, our priority remains user growth, and we have been pleased with the progress made in engagement, with over 80% of daily users on Mobile. In 2015, we experienced a slower ramp in monetization than we initially expected. And coupled with the sales realignment, the business did not deliver the $100 million revenue goal for the year.
Moving forward, the team has a solid plan in place, and we continue to believe that Tumblr's compelling content and attractive demographics will be a significant long-term driver of our overall Mavens and company growth.
For our revenue detail by region, please refer to Slide 10. Trends are consistent with the prior quarters.
Now let me move to expenses. Non-GAAP total operating expenses were $940 million for the quarter, which is up 2% versus the prior year. Depreciation and amortization remains consistent with the past several quarters at approximately $150 million. Our non-GAAP cash expenses in the fourth quarter came in at $788 million, which was up 2% year-over-year.
Excluding the $35 million benefit from patent sales in the prior year, we saw a decline of approximately 2% year-over-year as we continued to carefully drive operating efficiencies for the company. Sequentially from Q3, we did see one-off increases in non-headcount-related costs related to the quarter, which included NFL content costs, some additional legal costs and accruals for Accounts Receivable reserves. 
EBITDA was $215 million in Q4 with a margin of 21% based on revenue ex-TAC. Adjusted EBITDA for the full year was $952 million as we made investments in TAC to support our growth and partnership initiatives across search, communications and digital content. Non-GAAP operating income was $63 million and full year non-GAAP operating income was $342 million.
Now let me turn quickly to the balance sheet. I'd first like to cover our goodwill impairment charge. We test goodwill annually at the reporting unit level. During the first step, we determine the estimate fair value of each reporting unit using the income and market approaches by looking at future cash flows and current market comparables. As a result, we concluded the carrying value of several reporting units exceed their respective estimated fair values, resulting from a combination of factors, including a sustained decrease in our market capitalization in the fourth quarter and lower projected cash flows from the 2016 planning process as well as the overall decreases in public market valuations for technology companies.
A second step was performed to measure the impairment. This resulted in impairment charges for the following reported units: $3.7 billion for U.S. and Canada, $530 million for Europe, $230 million for Tumblr and $8 million for Latin America. Goodwill impairment testing is done on an aggregate basis by reporting unit. As such, $2 billion of goodwill originated from acquisitions prior to 2007, $1.3 billion from acquisitions from 2008 to 2011 and $1.2 billion from acquisitions since 2012.
Looking through -- looking back to the balance sheet, our Alibaba investment was $31 billion on the balance sheet, affecting the Alibaba share price at the end of Q4 as this was mark-to-market. At the end of Q4, we had a [ph] $6.8 billion in cash and marketable securities, a [ph] $5.5 billion net of our convertible and other debt.
Free cash flow for the quarter was $32 million, including CapEx -- which included CapEx spending of $126 million related to our products in Mail, Search and Mavens investments. Free cash flow for the full year adjusted for the settlement of $3.3 billion in taxes related to the Alibaba IPO in Q1 was approximately $270 million.
Let me now move the discussion to financial details about our strategic plan that incorporates our views for full year 2016 and our longer-term financial model. Earlier, Marissa outlined our strategy going forward. We anticipate this strategy will result in a business that delivers sustainable long-term revenue growth, enhanced profitability in excess of 25% EBITDA margins and significant free cash flow generation.
To get to that point, our strategic plan includes specific changes to our product portfolio and geographic footprint. Our decisions to exit or deemphasize certain areas of our business will have a near-term revenue impact, but are necessary in creating an improved company with a foundation for future growth and profitability.
We will narrow our focus on key priorities of Mavens and mobile search monetization as we allocate resources and align efforts for 2016. To illustrate some of the changes for the year in detail, let me walk through a revenue bridge for how we think about full year targets.
When starting with 2015 GAAP revenue, we factor in revenue changes arising from the loss of TIPLA amortization of approximately $200 million; a strategic exit impact of approximately $100 million as we enable [ph] our plan of consolidating our digital magazines and rightsizing our operational footprint; approximately $200 million decline from the platform shift in our Search business, reflecting the volume trends we are experiencing on desktop and the shifting of resources towards the forward leaning areas of mobile search; the ongoing headwinds from our legacy Display and leads listing of fees businesses will be a drag in the business of approximately $175 million. We expect our initiatives in Mavens areas across mobile search, native, social and video will continue to drive growth in the aggregate of approximately $200 million. All of these factors result in a full year 2016 GAAP revenue expectation of $4.4 billion to $4.6 billion.
As we realign the business, we will also invest in our core areas of search, communications and digital content to drive our long-term engagement and revenue growth. The combination of our exits, efficiency programs and investments should allow us to operate at a headcount of approximately 9,000 by the end of 2016 or nearly 15% below today's level. To do this, we will be driving business transformation, changing our approach to doing things in a few select areas.
For example, increasing our sales efficiency by getting the right balance between direct selling costs and sales support costs, rationalizing our regional approach and footprint, clarifying where we will offer the full breadth of our global products. In G&A, though we have made progress over the last year, we still have an opportunity to rightsize to best-in-class benchmarks. And in technology, we will more tightly align cost of core technology platforms with the products and businesses we are focusing on going forward.
This will result in savings of $400 million approximately in 2016 with a focus on expenses that can reduce in the short term rather than fixed costs such as facilities, days sales and content expense that will take additional time to address. With those actions, we aim to achieve a non-GAAP cash expense run rate of $2.4 billion to $2.6 billion after 2016.
While revenues will decline initially, EBITDA margin will improve as we move both variable and fixed costs as the year progresses. We expect full year adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $700 million to $800 million for 2016, exiting the year, however, with a second half annualized run rate of approximately $1 billion. As we think about longer-term targets, we plan to drive towards sustainable market growth rates with an EBITDA margin in excess of 25%.
In going through many of these changes in this transition year, we will be a more financially fit company with improving margins and growth over time. Regarding our separation with Alibaba, we continue to work through the business and regulatory issues necessary to effectuate a reverse spinoff as well as other strategic options. The board and management team working with our advisers are committed to ensuring a separation of the Alibaba assets as expeditiously and thoughtfully as possible. We are fully aligned with our shareholders in our desire to maximize value for this investment.
Spinoffs that involve the separation of operating business are inherently complex and lengthy processes, and there are a number of steps and considerations. As you can see on Slide 9 of our earnings deck, these include: separation planning; SEC matters, such as filings, audited financials and review; convertible note consideration; compliance with our agreements regarding Yahoo Japan; a likely stockholder vote; and other key steps as negotiation of third-party consents.
Yahoo would be separating its global operating business and it's Japanese joint venture Yahoo Japan from the remaining entity, which would retain the Alibaba stake. The reverse spin raises a number of issues not raised in the forward spin we pursued last year, some of which are not within our control. We estimate it will take 9 to 12 months to complete. Regarding future -- further shareholder value creation, Marissa mentioned that we have identified opportunities across real estate, patents and other noncore assets. We will continue to execute on all types of value creation programs, providing additional capital. And during our tenure, we have repurchased over $9 billion and reduced diluted share count by over 20%. With the remaining authorization of $2.7 billion for share repurchases, we will be prudent around timing of returning capital and excess cash. Over time, we will have a balanced approach in returning cash to shareholders.
In summary, this strategy and financial plan builds on the track record we have in creating new streams of revenue while continuing to drive efficiencies in the business and manage platform shifts to set us up for the next phase in transformation.
Now let me cover our guidance for the upcoming quarter, which will reflect many of the planned drivers I have previously discussed. For our GAAP revenue, we have now annualized the Mozilla partnership and BrightRoll acquisition. Investments in exits will have minimal revenue impact in Q1. TIPLA will continue to be a year-over-year headwind of approximately $69 million. For our TAC, growth will moderate now that we have annualized Mozilla and BrightRoll. We expect growth driven by our Gemini platform across search and native advertising.
For Q1 guidance, we expect the following: GAAP revenue in the range of $1.05 billion to $1.09 billion, TAC of approximately $230 million, revenue ex-TAC in the range of $820 million to $860 million, adjusted EBITDA in the range of $100 million to $120 million and non-GAAP operating income in the range of negative $50 million to negative $30 million. For the full year guidance, we expect the following: GAAP revenue in the range of $4.4 billion to $4.6 billion, TAC of approximately $1 billion, revenue ex-TAC in the range of $3.4 billion to $3.6 billion, adjusted EBITDA in the range of $700 million to $800 million and non-GAAP operating income in the range of $150 million to $250 million.
In closing, this guidance and our long-term targets reflect a more focused strategy for the company and actions we're taking to improve performance in 2016 and beyond.
With that, Marissa and I would like to take your questions. Shibani?"

It's a complicated one because there's mobile search as it exists today, and then there's what mobile search might become in the future. One of the things that we are seeing is that PPCs on mobile are under more pressure than they are in desktop. And the large part of that is because, for example, e-commerce transactions, et cetera, are more difficult from the mobile web on a smartphone. That said, we do see benefits and opportunities to do new kinds of advertising, for example, app marketing, et cetera, in our -- in the context of our mobile web offering. But even more so, we would love to see search evolve into a more app-oriented format where either from within the Flurry software development kit or through stand-alone applications, we're able to drive a really rich app-based experience for search. And search in that context probably behaves much differently than web search does. Web search will always be really useful. But that said, what you need on your phone, when you're on the go, under time pressure, you need to actually be searching over a lot more personal information. You also need to have better -- a better understanding of what apps people have on their phone, et cetera. So for example, I may want -- if I'm somewhere, say, in downtown San Francisco as early as [ph] 6:00 on a Saturday night, it's useful to be able to say, okay, use Yelp, use OpenTable, to actually book a reservation. And being able to know what applications you have on your phone, deep link to them and really provide great -- a great guidance, this is really where Yahoo's mission around being the guide comes into play, is something that's quite different. And it will monetize differently. The user interaction will be different, and we really think that mobile search needs a much deeper reimagination. So I would say that a lot of the trends that have been discussed more broadly are true in terms of mobile web-based search. That said, we do think that app-based search, some of the personal assistant work, that's happening across the industry really takes mobile search in a new direction, and we think those reimaginations are only going to become more intense."

We've gotten some estimates in terms of what we can do on patents, some estimates of what we can do on some of the land, ideas we have, as well as some thoughts on some of the noncore assets that we think we can monetize over time. In terms of -- I don't want to go through the exact numbers on tax. Honestly, we could do a reverse spin that would be basically tax-free. More likely it will be taxable, so we understand that. We do have some bases for our core business as well as a basis for Yahoo Japan. But I'd rather not go through those numbers because they're still being tuned a little bit in terms of right now for public process."

I want to know what's driving that inside the legacy business. And number two, on the Mavens forecast you provided for '16, that was probably lower than we would have thought for the Mavens business at around 12% revenue growth given the industry is growing roughly around the mid-teens broadly for digital advertising. So maybe help us -- give us a little bit of color on some of the puts and takes that drove the Mavens forecast."

In general, we have been experiencing, as we've talked about, rather intense legacy drag from our premium decline. That said, what we're seeing is the premium ad dollars are shifting both into programmatic with the same ad formats, but also they're shifting into new ad formats. Largely, the new ad formats are classified into our Mavens revenue. There are some historical ad formats that are staying in our legacy numbers. And so one of the things you're seeing happening is there's a lot of Price-per-Ad pressure in the near term, in terms of the immediate years following. As that premium shifts to programmatic, that mix shift continues to happen. That said, once that stabilizes, we do think we'll start to see price appreciation in programmatic selling of older-style ad formats. And so that's one of the things that causes that to buoy back up. And in terms of Mavens, as we projected, we anticipate it will be at least $1.8 billion in 2016. We're really happy with the strong growth we've seen in mobile and particularly in native. The fact that Gemini had more than $0.5 billion in GAAP revenue this past year is just terrific. It's a product that was invented in the middle of 2013. We're really excited about that. But overall as we looked at our strategic plan, one of the things that we did was we took a tighter view on revenue to basically help us really seek the types of efficiencies on cost that we ultimately would seek. And so we basically worked with a tight revenue number to really drive a larger set of cost efficiencies across the business. But we feel confident that given the industry trends and our own product momentum here that this is a reasonable number."

And then Marissa, if I may, just between the reverse spin strategy, the strategic plan for the core business and the potential for strategic proposals. It strikes me that you'll be pursuing 3 plans basically at the same time, all with their own complexities, all with their own multivariable outcomes, as you laid out in your prepared remarks. Can you just help us understand how you're going to prioritize your time or prioritize those 3? Are there 1 or 2 that you would favor over another, for example?"

One is in terms of cost, we're going to take -- we already talked about the actions on headcount. It'll take us a little bit of time to effectuate those. We do expect that to be fully effective for the second half of the year. So a lot of the costs that will go down includes workforce-related expenses, so that's a good part of it. There are facilities actions we're going to take, as Marissa noted, some of the facilities that we are eliminating. So that also will be costs that we'll take out. We'll be taking out some content costs. Particularly, we're looking at content costs that don't make sense for where we are, what regions were in and so forth. So there's a number of things we're going to do to take out cost. Certainly, the variable costs are more quickly to take out. The fixed costs, by nature, are a bit fixed. But even there, we're going to do some work particularly on the facilities things that come in my area. So -- and then there's a lot of workforce-related costs, like T&E, whatever, that will also come down with the headcount. So a lot of those costs -- as we take actions this quarter on those and then they get effectuated, that's how we see second half. The other thing that helps us on the EBITDA for the second half is clearly we expect revenue to grow in Q4. So we do expect a normal seasonal pattern in Q4 revenue. So some of the better EBITDA is both from the reducing the cost base by $100 million a quarter roughly as we go forward here once we get it all done, and 2 is then the higher revenue. I would say down the road, we continue -- we will continue to look at some of the fixed costs, where we can be more effective in our data centers, our other facilities, consolidations we can do and so forth. There may be areas in content partnership arrangements that we can also reduce. So there's a number of things that we look forward to as we go past '16 into '17. And the thing is, frankly, we've used a lot of objective data, benchmarking and so forth to really drive us -- ourselves to be much more efficient and effective."

And it's not surprising that the strategy for maximizing our value is also going to be complex. Yes, we need to execute on our strategic plan. We need to create the very best version of Yahoo that we can create. We also see a lot of possible value in a spinoff transaction and the reverse spinoff being likely the most viable there. And then finally, as we announced today, we would like to take a look at alternative strategic opportunities. And so we need to look at all 3 of those. It is going to be very busy. But to put things in perspective, for the majority of people here at Yahoo, we really need to be focused on executing the plan, because executing the plan well creates value in all possible scenarios and really increases our shareholder value. And that's what the majority of people here will be working on. There is a smaller group, much the same group that worked on the forward spin last year, that will be dedicating time to the reverse spin. There's many of the same complexities. There's a few new complexities, and they'll be dedicating their time there. And reviewing strategic alternatives, as well it should be, will be a board-led process. And so obviously, it has to be in our board will be dedicating their time there. I will have to spend time on each of the 3 things. But again, my view is the highest priority for me personally is working on the strategic plan and making sure that we really execute to the best of our abilities inside the company because that's what unlocks the most shareholder value."

I will say that our -- the native business that we have inside of Mavens as well as our syndicated business through Yahoo App Publishing is growing quite strong.

And while it's small in the context of Yahoo, it's quite large in the areas of those verticals, with most of those applications being either in #1 or #2 in their space both in terms of usage and ratings and other things.

Obviously, the web is really large and in some [indiscernible] is nearly infinite.

The search space is basically much smaller the required disk space, the computation space is smaller and we just think it really comes down to -- it's a lot about being able to do those basics of search well. But then it's really around user interaction, user expectations and how do we build the best possible application to really meet those needs. But I think the overall cost profile will be somewhat different, and I do think this is an area that's really deeply in need of reimagination.

It was just one of the biggest audiences ever assembled for something like that, and it's because the NFL brought us such great content.

I think it really shows how strong our streaming technology can be and where streaming ultimately can go. It also -- we also, I think, really showed and one of the things we really learned was the value of our network and the value of our large audience. The fact that on a Sunday morning, frankly quite early in a lot of places where they like to watch NFL, we were able to assemble such a large audience by basically putting the game in places where people who were coming to Yahoo properties might see it and might go on to view it. That was something that worked incredibly well, and it shows that Yahoo, having that large audience, what it can really do in terms of distributing great content and helping our users really get that same content.

We overall are really happy with the ad formats we have and the ad load that we have. We obviously use our Yahoo Gemini product to do our monetization on Mobile. So when we look at these 4 verticals and building out the best-of-breed application on Mobile for them, Gemini is how we'll begin to monetize them. That said, we have been doing some experimentation lately with some, for example, first -- sort of the day takeovers, things like that. So the first time you boot up the application you might see, for example, a full-screen advertisement. We've tried that on Tumblr. That works well. But I would say with the ad formats we have, I'm comfortable with our ad load. I would rather not see us increase it. But one of the things we have seen excitement around both from advertisers and from users is in sometimes changing up some of the ad formats, introducing new ad formats and possibly increasing the ad load that way."

Today, I'll share an overview of our Q4 and overall 2015 performance. Then as we committed to on our last earnings call, Ken and I will discuss our plan for a more focused Yahoo in 2016 and beyond, with details on how we plan to concentrate our efforts, improve execution and further engage our users and advertisers.
Let's begin with Q4 highlights. I'm pleased to report that our Q4 performance exceeded guidance across GAAP revenue, revenue ex-TAC, adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP operating income. In Q4, we delivered $1,273,000,000 of GAAP revenue, which was 6% above our guidance range. In terms of revenue ex-TAC, we delivered just over $1 billion of revenue in the quarter, approximately 4% above our guidance range. And we delivered $215 million of adjusted EBITDA, 7% above our guidance range.
These results were enabled by Gemini native -- our Gemini native product, which continued to exceed expectations, and by strength in programmatic ads, which showed solid demand in Q4. I'd like to recognize our global sales team. They've worked tirelessly to deliver a great return on investment to our clients and in turn to deliver these results.
Looking at 2015 in total. Our GAAP revenue was just under $5 billion, up 8% year-over-year. I continue to be pleased to see top line GAAP revenue growth at this stage of our transformation. Our Display GAAP growth this year was propelled largely by growth in native and video with the addition of BrightRoll, offset by the drag of legacy Display.
Search GAAP grew year-over-year as well with the addition of our Mozilla partnership. On an ex-TAC basis, revenue was $4,091,000,000, down 7% year-over-year, driven by partner payments. Overall, while we grew GAAP revenue, we did not grow ex-TAC revenue as we planned.
I now want to talk a bit about where we are in our turnaround. Yahoo today is a far stronger, more modern company than the one I joined 3.5 years ago. We've tripled our mobile audience to more than 600 million monthly users, improved many partnerships, streamlined our data centers, hired incredible technical talent and invested wisely to meet future needs.
At the same time, we've shifted resources towards growth-oriented businesses and markets by closing 22 offices and sunsetting more than 120 products and features. As a result, in 2015 alone, about 1/3 of our revenue was completely new revenue with over $1.6 billion attributable to Mavens; mobile, video, native and social. I'd like to talk about the balance of new revenue versus legacy for a moment as well as some of the strategic decisions we've made.
In a turnaround, you must literally turn around declining revenue and get it to grow. There are 2 ways to do that: by returning current business lines to growth or by adding new business lines that grow. When I arrived at Yahoo, I reviewed all the lines of business. Each one was in decline and had been for years. Worse, we depended heavily upon banner ads and desktop users, both of which were declining in line with industry trends.
That was the bad news. It meant we were sitting on about $5 billion of deteriorating revenue with essentially no clear path to growth. We needed to turn that around, that declining revenue, with new businesses, not existing ones. And we needed something that was going to be big enough and grow fast enough to matter to a $5 billion business.
The next decision you have to make in a turnaround is do you completely cut deteriorating revenue lines so you can show significant growth faster or do you try and stem the decline so you have the stability but know that the headwinds will last longer as legacy revenue continues to deteriorate. We chose the latter. Given the size of our revenue and user base, we really didn't have a choice.
So to picture the turnaround, we knew we had a large but declining base of revenue. We knew it would be irresponsible to walk away from large streams of revenue and profits prematurely. And we knew we had to invent new businesses that were extremely fast-growing and large enough to be material.
Basically, our turnaround would look as shown here. This would have meant that we would have had some amount of time where revenue was flat to down. However, during that period, the make up of the revenue would change dramatically. As an analogy, it could be described as a tectonic shift where the plates shift beneath your feet in terms of revenue composition but you stay at roughly the same elevation in terms of total revenue. However, once the new businesses become large enough, you'll see -- begin to see the revenue from those new businesses overpower the legacy from the old and show growth.
Let's look at this as how this has actually played out for Yahoo. In our case, the legacy revenue is banner ads, and to some extent, desktop search. We have quantified the headwinds as at times more than $100 million per quarter, in other words, close to $0.5 billion per year. The new businesses are our Mavens, and as noted earlier, they generated more than $1.6 billion in GAAP revenue last year. This is essentially from 0.
Mavens, as a revenue source, didn't exist at all in 2011 and was nascent in 2012. And if you look at our actuals combined with our projected outlook, it follows this pattern. That said, if you look at our Mavens businesses alone, it looks like this. You can see how impressive the growth is. It's an incredibly fast-growing line of business, growing at 45% in 2015 year-over-year.
Now let's turn to the strategic plan that supports our forward projections. Today, we are announcing a strong set of actions that bring Yahoo into the future. We'll be doubling down in areas and markets of greatest strength so we can grow faster.
Our plan covers 4 core areas. The first is to play to our strengths, to grow user engagement, particularly on mobile. We'll channel all of our efforts towards the products and markets that matter most to engage users, distinguish us competitively and drive growth. This focus will let us escalate the pace of innovation to make our best products even better, faster.
Second, we will continue to drive Mavens revenue growth by investing in mobile, video, native and social through initiatives that improve advertiser satisfaction and sales. At the same time, we will continue to stabilize and slow the declines in our legacy revenue.
Third, we will simplify the business to improve execution. Through product sunsets and divestitures, we will continue to prune our portfolio so that our priorities and value are clearer to users, advertisers, partners and shareholders.
And finally, as a result of these changes, we must efficiently align our resources to our priorities and size the business accordingly. We believe these changes will improve our course and influence a positive trajectory on our earnings.
Let's go into more depth on each of these. Our vision for Yahoo isn't changing and is rooted in our beginnings as Dave and Jerry's Guide to the World Wide Web. To consumers, we want to be known for discovery. We are a guide to digital information discovery. We inform, connect and entertain them with our search, communications and digital content products.
Search, communications and digital content form a 3-legged stool for Yahoo. Search is obviously essential to discovery, and the lucrative nature of Search makes it very important to our overall business. Communications drives frequency. Our most engaged and most frequent visitors have Yahoo Mail. Communications is easily the biggest driver of engagement on our network. And finally, digital content is our differentiation. People come to Yahoo because of our distinct voice through original content, aggregation and personalization.
The analogy of the 3-legged stool holds true because if you remove any 1 of the 3 legs, the system and the business works less well. Remove Search and you lose a key element of discovery and also a really lucrative piece of the business. Remove Mail and you lose engagement and the frequency of use. Remove digital content and you remove our differentiation, the reason people turn to us over other mail and search providers. Together, the 3 of them form a true digital network and make Yahoo, Yahoo.
On the B2B side, we're also an advertising-driven business, dedicated to helping our clients build and grow their businesses through precise targeting and superior return on investment. In 2016, Yahoo's portfolio will intensely focus on the products that drive the most substantial portion of our users, revenue and market opportunity.
Yahoo is all about discovery. We'll be focused on 3 global platforms, Search, Mail and Tumblr; and 4 core verticals, News, Sports, Finance and Lifestyle in our priority markets, those markets being U.S., Canada, U.K., Germany, Hong Kong and Taiwan. To prioritize these markets, we're shifting our focus away from providing local products for most of Europe and Latin America, and going forward, Yahoo will be defined by 2 core advertiser offerings: Gemini and BrightRoll. Gemini combines Search and native ads for superior results while BrightRoll is being expanded to offer programmatic buying and selling for video, display and native advertising.
Our total user population exceeds 1 billion monthly users. While we have one of the largest audiences on the web, 2016 is about growing how much each user uses Yahoo, in other words, engagement. And we want that engagement to grow, particularly on mobile. We must create more useful, relevant products to grow our page views, drive more logged-in users and grow our daily active users or DAUs.
Our product strategies are designed to foster growth in these areas. Let's start with the first leg of the stool, Search. Search is key to Yahoo's user proposition of discovery. As the mobile search market continues to expand and as user behavior shifts more towards contextual search queries, we see mobile search as the biggest opportunity.
As a result, we're shifting our focus toward forward-leaning mobile search investments and thinking through how Search should change. In Q4, we launched an initial update to our Yahoo Search application, the beginning of a complete re-imagination of mobile search. Given our strategic relationships with carriers and OEMs and the wealth of data within Yahoo Mail that can help us personalize our results better, we're positioned to succeed here. Overall, while this shift has and will continue to require great prioritization internally, we believe the mobile search opportunity will help drive sustainable, long-term growth and differentiation.
Turning to communications. Mail is a substantial driver of engagement across our entire product portfolio. In 2016, we're investing resources in speed, stability and features that can drive growth on our branded products. We'll continue to launch features that differentiate Yahoo Mail for consumers and improve their ability to share, search and connect. We want Yahoo Mail to be the absolute best place to send and receive your e-mail.
In Q4, we launched the ability for users to integrate their AOL, Outlook and Gmail account, and we've already seen millions of new accounts connected. And with the Q4 launch of our redesigned Messenger product now integrated into Yahoo Mail, we're deepening engagement even further. Users are responding very positively. We've achieved an impressive 4.5-star rating on both the App Store and Google Play. And we've reached record DAUs across our Mobile -- our Mail applications in Q4.
Finally, looking at digital content. There are really 2 areas, Tumblr and our verticals that Yahoo has always been strong in: News, Sports, Finance and Lifestyles. These are areas in which we're already strong and where we will invest for engagement growth. By engaging users as both consumers and creators of content, they are more likely to remain on our network.
With more than half of Tumblr users now on mobile, we're developing features to accelerate the mobile experience, including new mobile creation tools, in-stream recommendations and push notifications. The number of mobile follows has more than doubled since last year when we considered -- when we considered to be a strong -- which we consider to be a strong indicator of user retention and engagement.
We're also seeing incredible new traction in user-to-user engagement with the launch of Tumblr Messaging in Q4 that now sees millions of messages sent each day. By focusing on areas where Yahoo is strong and differentiated, we can propel our execution to a new level. Focusing on just 4 areas, News, Sports, Finance and Lifestyles, we can, not only, provide great content but also great tools and services in these areas.
Tools, like Finance portfolios or Yahoo's Fantasy Sports, fuel our engagement and help us develop a deeper interaction with the user and keeps them coming back. Just last week, we launched exciting changes to both the Yahoo App and yahoo.com, making it even easier than ever to -- for users to find, consume and engage around news, content and videos tailored to their interests.
Also in 2016, we'll be rolling out new features across our Sports and Finance apps that make engaging with sports scores, players and stocks much more compelling. We'll also further integrate Polyvore into the Lifestyle vertical to bring the other incredible content with actionable, shoppable utilities.
With these 7 products, Yahoo will better guide discovery for consumers going forward. Search, Mail and Tumblr will serve as global platforms to our worldwide audience. And our core verticals of News, Sports, Finance and Lifestyle will be more focused in our priority growth markets. Together, these products will play to our strengths and deliver a deeply integrated and differentiated experience across Yahoo's entire network.
Revenue growth remains the most important indicator of progress in our transformation. Over the past few years, we've experienced strong headwinds from legacy Display as the industry shifts away from ad formats such as banner ads. In addition, the recurring non-advertising-based TIPLA royalty revenue for Alibaba has now expired. As these revenue streams come to a close, we expect absolute revenue to face pressure. But we will achieve a baseline more reflective of a strong performance and growth potential of our core products.
As we seek to drive long-term sustainable revenue growth, our plan involves continued investment in Mavens to counterbalance legacy declines with a particular emphasis on mobile. With Mavens revenue at over $1.6 billion for the year, mobile is the largest contributor, adding over $1 billion or nearly 1/4 of our traffic-driven revenue.
On video, we delivered $375 million of GAAP revenue in 2015, up 64% year-over-year. Our native ad business continues to grow sharply, with native Display totaling over $0.5 billion of GAAP revenue for the year. And as social continues to be a long-term strategic play for us, we're pleased to see mobile DAUs on Tumblr up 34% year-over-year. At the same time, we're continuing to thoughtfully monetize Tumblr's growing audience.
Looking ahead, we continue to bolster our Mavens investments and expect to grow double digits this year, reaching at least $1.8 billion in Mavens GAAP revenue in 2016. Underpinning that continued growth will be the M in Mavens, Mobile, especially with the mobile industry ad spend estimated to nearly double by 2018. With a sharper focus on growing DAUs across our 7 consumer products, we expect engagement growth, combined with improved monetization, will ultimately drive long-term sustainable revenue growth. In addition to the monetization of our own products, we're syndicating our excellent mobile tools with our mobile developer suite, which continues to see great traction. Buoyed by our acquisition of Flurry, we now serve nearly 0.25 million developers, reaching nearly 800,000 apps across more than 2 billion devices with 10 billion sessions every day.
These staggering numbers also mean real revenue. Yahoo App Publishing, which allows developers to monetize their apps, now contributes roughly half of our Gemini native revenue. Advertisers are increasingly embracing programmatic technology for its optimal performance, pricing and control. In line with this trend, our global sales team has been training and scaling from traditional premium-focused sales to performance and programmatic offerings.
As part of this plan, we are streamlining our sales support and operations teams and simplifying our international organization to focus on fewer ad products. By refining our go-to-market strategy and reducing the number of client touch points, we expect to improve customer satisfaction. We have seen the benefits of this in Q4 with better-than-expected results. In all, these efforts are expected to drive sustainable growth going forward.
All sound strategies clarify what a company will and will not do. Yahoo cannot win the hearts and minds of users and advertisers with a complex fragmented portfolio of products and assets, especially if some no longer meet our aggressive growth goals or distract from growth products. A simplified Yahoo will yield better focus, execution and ultimately increase shareholder value.
Since 2012, we've invested in a series of bets across different product areas and markets. In an industry fueled by innovation, continued experimentation is critical for growth. While some investments have become essential to Yahoo's transformation, others have not. We've taken an honest look at those bets and have chosen to re-prioritize many resources towards more proven areas of growth.
To that end, in Q4, we closed Yahoo Screen and shifted away from original scripted content. In 2016, some of our digital magazines will have their content consolidated under 1 of our 4 core verticals while others will be shut down. We also exit legacy products, including Yahoo Games and Smart TV. While we will continue to support a handful of higher-margin, higher engagement legacy products like Flickr, Answers and Groups, we will do so with a more efficient model that requires significantly lower investment.
In addition to our clarified product portfolio, we've begun to explore divesting nonstrategic assets of value. As an example, these efforts include the responsible monetization of nonstrategic patents, the sale of valuable real estate and other noncore, nonstrategic assets. In total, we estimate that these efforts could generate significant cash in excess of $1 billion.
In sum, we believe a simplified Yahoo will increase shareholder value over the long term. Having fewer products also means we can improve those products faster and increase profitability and focus. With this plan, we will also execute on additional efforts to save money and operate more effectively and efficiently.
Our new vision for the company requires each and every employee to work on areas that play to our strength and drive the company forward. We've already made significant strides in managing headcount and achieving quality and stability with fewer employees. Our workforce is 34% smaller today than it was in 2012 after reducing headcount from around 17,000 total employees, roughly 14,200 employees and 2,800 contractors, to 10,400 employees and 860 contractors at the end of 2015. Throughout this time, we've also closed 22 offices. We value everyone who's dedicated themselves to Yahoo and made contributions here. The changes in our employee footprint to date have not been easy, but they've been necessary to position the company for a stronger future.
To that end, as we've already shared with our employees, we plan to reduce our workforce by roughly 15%. In addition, we will be exiting 5 of our offices: Dubai, Mexico City, Buenos Aires, Madrid and Milan. A majority of these changes will take place in Q1. But by the end of 2016, we anticipate we will have approximately 9,000 employees and less than 1,000 contractors. This represents a workforce that is roughly 42% smaller than it was in 2012 and will contribute to a total realized savings in short-term operating expense of approximately $400 million annually. This decision is not one we've taken lightly, and we will make every effort to treat affected employees with thoughtfulness, transparency and compassion.
On the issue of costs, I wanted to take a moment to discuss some blatant falsehoods that have been circulating in the press about the company's spending. I have found these untruths to be upsetting and I'm sure our investors have as well. And while we do not have time on today's call to address all of the inaccurate information, I want to touch on a few.
For example, there have been reports of a $7 million holiday party and a $450 million spend on food over the past few years at the company. Both numbers are exaggerated by more than a factor of 3. Our holiday parties globally cost approximately $150 per invited attendee. Our food program is extremely well run, and all of our employee perks are standard for our industry, in line with other companies in our area and generally run less expensively here than elsewhere.
There has been a discussion of millions of dollars spent on free smartphones. The notion of free implies that these were given to employees. These phones remain property of the company, much like the desks, chairs and computers we issued to employees.
Further, as is obvious from this call, mobile is a huge part of our strategy. We could not have built a billion-dollar mobile advertising business, one of the largest in the world, if the people building it did not use the tools, platforms and products we expect our users to use. There are many more examples of untruths and mischaracterizations. We can't touch on all of them. However, please know that we are very thoughtful about how we spend company resources and we will continue to be.
We strongly believe that our strategic plan will create the best version of Yahoo for our users, advertisers, employees and shareholders. As we implement these changes, 2016 will very much be a transition year with revenues and earnings expected to decline, returning to modest but accelerating growth in 2017 and 2018.
In sum, we expect our 2016 strategic plan to deliver the following value: better user and advertiser product quality with growth in daily active users across our 3 global platforms, including Search, Mail and Tumblr and 4 core vertical utilities, News, Sports, Finance and Lifestyle in our priority markets; continuing Mavens growth while on track to exceed $1.8 billion in 2016; GAAP revenue impact of product and regional exits of approximately $100 million; improved profitability with an adjusted EBITDA run rate of more than $1 billion by the second half of 2016; an annual operating expense reduction of over $400 million by the end of 2016; and overall simplification of Yahoo's business through nonstrategic asset divestitures, generating in excess of $1 billion in cash.
Before moving on from the plan, I wanted to say that I have never believed more in this company, in the people, in the products and in the inherent value of what we do. To be clear, this is a strong plan and a bold plan and one we are embarking on with the full support of the board.
We are very proud of the new billion-dollar Mavens business, $1.6 billion in GAAP revenue to be exact that we have built from essentially 0 in just 3 years. Today's announcements build from that achievement and will dramatically brighten our future and improve our competitiveness and attractiveness to users, advertisers and partners. This plan sets out to make Yahoo the very best version of itself, and I'm confident in the company's ability to successfully execute it.
Turning now to capital allocation. We understand the importance of potential value maximization that could be realized by separating our Alibaba stake from our operating business. For this reason, the board and management are aligned that exploring additional strategic alternatives in parallel to the execution of our plan is in the best interest of our shareholders.
Per our announcements in December, we have been focused on and evaluating a reverse spin transaction, whereby Yahoo's operating business and equity holdings in Yahoo Japan would be separated into a new operating entity. In addition to continuing the work on the reverse spin, the board will also engage with other qualified strategic proposals. Both the board and management feel pursuing these strategic alternatives in parallel is complementary to executing the plan. We are dedicated to being good stewards of capital and delivering shareholder value.
With that, thank you for your continued confidence in Yahoo, and I'll now turn it over to Ken to talk a bit more about Q4 and our 2016 plan."

In short, we're encouraged that our fourth quarter results exceeded expectations in many of our core metrics. We had good overall revenue growth in 2015, up 8% over 2014, including a significant contribution from Mavens revenue, which as Marissa said, grew to over $1.6 billion.
Additionally, we have made progress on multiple initiatives to strengthen the business and drive efficiencies. I will provide greater detail around our strategic plan and our long-term financial model so you'll be able to see where our business is going and how we plan to deliver value to our shareholders. Lastly, I will discuss our outlook for the coming quarter and full year as we position Yahoo for sustainable and profitable growth.
First, some facts about our performance and progress on multiple fronts. Q4 GAAP revenue was $1.273 billion and revenue ex-TAC was $1.002 billion, both above our guidance range as we saw better-than-expected performance in our native and programmatic Display businesses. For the full year 2015, GAAP revenue grew 8% year-over-year to $4.968 billion as we increased partnership revenue and executed on our Mavens investments. This helped offset headwinds from our legacy businesses and the loss of TIPLA amortization. Revenue ex-TAC was $4.091 billion and Mavens delivered $1.660 billion GAAP revenue for the full year, growing by 45% over 2014 and now representing 36% of traffic-driven revenue versus 28% in the prior year.
Our Q4 revenue performance led to a better-than-expected adjusted EBITDA of $215 million as our business transition is leading to greater efficiencies. As a result of these efforts, our full-time employee base declined by approximately 300 in the quarter, ending at 10,400 and reflected a year-over-year reduction of 2,100 or 17% even though we continue to substantially invest in the growth businesses.
Non-GAAP EPS was $0.13 for Q4 and $0.59 for the full year. Ending diluted share count for the period was 952 million. With our strategic plan announcement today, we are further reshaping the company and expect to realize cost efficiencies that will be reflected in our financial results throughout the next year and beyond.
Our new drivers of growth are strengthening and building on a number of investments and acquisitions that have helped us to drive the growth trajectory of the new Yahoo. Our Mavens strategy: Some have worked well and some have yet to but are expected to bear fruit. We continue to objectively and clinically evaluate how we will invest in these and other investments in this rapidly evolving technology landscape.
Today, we are going to be providing additional detail related to our plan to further reshape the company, realize cost efficiencies and grow the business based on our core strengths. As we go through our fourth quarter full year 2015 results in greater detail, as seen on Slides 11 and 12, I will focus the discussion around non-GAAP results, which excludes stock-based compensation, restructuring charges and other expenses and charges, and the related tax impacts from all of these items.
Non-GAAP results also exclude a noncash goodwill impairment of $4.5 billion as a result of our annual goodwill impairment test performed as of October 31. I will provide more detail around this later in the call. You can find complete reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP results in our earnings slides on our Investor Relations website.
In Q4, GAAP revenue was $1.273 billion, up 2% year-over-year or 4% excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Full year 2015 GAAP revenue was $4.968 billion, up 8% year-over-year. Search GAAP revenue grew 16% year-over-year while Display grew 11%. Traffic acquisition costs were $271 million, up $197 million compared to the prior year, primarily due to our Mozilla partnership, Gemini search and growth in our Display networks, including video.
Revenue ex-TAC was $1.002 billion for Q4, and as I noted, $4.091 billion for the year. And taking a closer look at Search, GAAP Search revenue was $522 million in Q4, up 12% year-over-year. Search revenue ex-TAC declined 8% year-over-year due to a click-driven revenue decline of 7% and increasing TAC payments.
Our global Paid Clicks declined 10% year-over-year in Q4 as we did see declines in Affiliate Yahoo traffic offset by growth from strategic partners like Mozilla and Oracle. The key drivers of the decline were volume decline in the U.S. across the Affiliates and Yahoo Search and investment into Gemini. PPC grew 3% mainly due to mix shift toward higher monetizing regions. We continue to make good progress on our internal Search efforts and in Gemini and see consistent PPCs across our platforms. Our overall investment in Gemini was similar to Q3 and in line with our plans. We expect that our first verticals will start to reach their RPM targets in the first quarter, and we expect to reach overall breakeven in the second half of 2016.
Now moving to Display. We saw a continuation of growth trends from the prior 2 quarters. GAAP Display revenue was $601 million, up 13% year-over-year as a result of our growing native and video businesses. Display ads grew 8% year-over-year, driven primarily by a continued native growth internationally and through our network of mobile apps.
PPA increased 6% year-over-year, driven by the growth of our video formats and marketplaces. We also saw encouraging increases in our premium programmatic segments, helping to reduce the drag from the legacy formats. Display revenue ex-TAC grew 2% year-over-year, up 5% excluding the impact of foreign exchange.
Let me now provide details on our Mavens investment businesses. Our Mavens GAAP revenue grew 26% year-over-year in Q4. Mavens now contributes 39% to our traffic-driven revenue, which was up 33% in the prior year.
Video experienced another good and solid quarter of year-over-year growth, with many exciting highlights such as a successful global stream of the NFL game. And advertisers can now buy our fast-growing native video ad formats on our BrightRoll platform.
Mobile GAAP revenue grew 15% year-over-year, and we continued to see our native ads build scale through syndication partners such as Bleacher Report and Cheetah. This will offset some deceleration in mobile search volumes. Our native Display revenue across all devices reached approximately $160 million in the quarter, driven by volume growth internationally and through syndication.
For our Tumblr, our priority remains user growth, and we have been pleased with the progress made in engagement, with over 80% of daily users on Mobile. In 2015, we experienced a slower ramp in monetization than we initially expected. And coupled with the sales realignment, the business did not deliver the $100 million revenue goal for the year.
Moving forward, the team has a solid plan in place, and we continue to believe that Tumblr's compelling content and attractive demographics will be a significant long-term driver of our overall Mavens and company growth.
For our revenue detail by region, please refer to Slide 10. Trends are consistent with the prior quarters.
Now let me move to expenses. Non-GAAP total operating expenses were $940 million for the quarter, which is up 2% versus the prior year. Depreciation and amortization remains consistent with the past several quarters at approximately $150 million. Our non-GAAP cash expenses in the fourth quarter came in at $788 million, which was up 2% year-over-year.
Excluding the $35 million benefit from patent sales in the prior year, we saw a decline of approximately 2% year-over-year as we continued to carefully drive operating efficiencies for the company. Sequentially for Q3, we did see one-off increases in non-headcount-related costs related to the quarter, which included NFL content costs, some additional legal costs and accruals for Accounts Receivable reserves. 
EBITDA was $215 million in Q4 with a margin of 21% based on revenue ex-TAC. Adjusted EBITDA for the full year was $952 million as we made investments in TAC to support our growth and partnership initiatives across search, communications and digital content. Non-GAAP operating income was $63 million and full year non-GAAP operating income was $342 million.
Now let me turn quickly to the balance sheet. I'd first like to cover our goodwill impairment charge. We test goodwill annually at the reporting unit level. During the first step, we determine the estimate fair value of each reporting unit using the income and market approaches by looking at future cash flows and current market comparables. As a result, we concluded the carrying value of several reporting units exceed their respective estimated fair values, resulting from a combination of factors, including a sustained decrease in our market capitalization in the fourth quarter and lower projected cash flows from the 2016 planning process as well as the overall decreases in public market valuations for technology companies.
A second step was performed to measure the impairment. This resulted in impairment charges for the following reported units: $3.7 billion for U.S. and Canada, $530 million for Europe, $230 million for Tumblr and $8 million for Latin America. Goodwill impairment testing is done on an aggregate basis by reporting unit. As such, $2 billion of goodwill originated from acquisitions prior to 2007, $1.3 billion from acquisitions from 2008 to 2011 and $1.2 billion from acquisitions since 2012.
Looking through -- looking back to the balance sheet, our Alibaba investment was $31 billion on the balance sheet reflecting the Alibaba share price at the end of Q4 as this was mark-to-market. At the end of Q4, we had a $6.8 billion in cash and marketable securities, a $5.5 billion net of our convertible and other debt.
Free cash flow for the quarter was $32 million, including CapEx -- which included CapEx spending of $126 million related to our products in Mail, Search and Mavens investments. Free cash flow for the full year adjusted for the settlement of $3.3 billion in taxes related to the Alibaba IPO in Q1 was approximately $270 million.
Let me now move the discussion to financial details about our strategic plan that incorporates our views for full year 2016 and our longer-term financial model. Earlier, Marissa outlined our strategy going forward. We anticipate this strategy will result in a business that delivers sustainable long-term revenue growth, enhanced profitability in excess of 25% EBITDA margins and significant free cash flow generation.
To get to that point, our strategic plan includes specific changes to our product portfolio and geographic footprint. Our decisions to exit or deemphasize certain areas of our business will have a near-term revenue impact, but are necessary in creating an improved company with a foundation for future growth and profitability.
We will narrow our focus on key priorities of Mavens and mobile search monetization as we allocate resources and align efforts for 2016. To illustrate some of the changes for the year in detail, let me walk through a revenue bridge for how we think about full year targets.
When starting with 2015 GAAP revenue, we factor in revenue changes arising from the loss of TIPLA amortization of approximately $200 million; a strategic exit impact of approximately $100 million as we build our plan of consolidating our digital magazines and rightsizing our operational footprint; approximately $200 million decline from the platform shift in our Search business, reflecting the volume trends we are experiencing on desktop and the shifting of resources towards the forward leaning areas of mobile search; the ongoing headwinds from our legacy Display and leads listing of fees businesses will be a drag in the business of approximately $175 million. We expect our initiatives in Mavens areas across mobile search, native, social and video will continue to drive growth in the aggregate of approximately $200 million. All of these factors result in a full year 2016 GAAP revenue expectation of $4.4 billion to $4.6 billion.
As we realign the business, we will also invest in our core areas of search, communications and digital content to drive our long-term engagement and revenue growth. The combination of our exits, efficiency programs and investments should allow us to operate at a headcount of approximately 9,000 by the end of 2016 or nearly 15% below today's level. To do this, we will be driving business transformation, changing our approach to doing things in a few select areas.
For example, increasing our sales efficiency by getting the right balance between direct selling costs and sales support costs, rationalizing our regional approach and footprint, clarifying where we will offer the full breadth of our global products. In G&A, though we have made progress over the last year, we still have an opportunity to rightsize to best-in-class benchmarks. And in technology, we will more tightly align cost of core technology platforms with the products and businesses we are focusing on going forward.
This will result in savings of $400 million approximately in 2016 with a focus on expenses that can reduce in the short term rather than fixed costs such as facilities, days sales and content expense that will take additional time to address. With those actions, we aim to achieve a non-GAAP cash expense run rate of $2.4 billion to $2.6 billion after 2016.
While revenues will decline initially, EBITDA margin will improve as we move both variable and fixed costs as the year progresses. We expect full year adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $700 million to $800 million for 2016, exiting the year, however, with a second half annualized run rate of approximately $1 billion. As we think about longer-term targets, we plan to drive towards sustainable market growth rates with an EBITDA margin in excess of 25%.
In going through many of these changes in this transition year, we will be a more financially fit company with improving margins and growth over time. Regarding our separation with Alibaba, we continue to work through the business and regulatory issues necessary to effectuate a reverse spinoff as well as other strategic options. The board and management team working with our advisers are committed to ensuring a separation of the Alibaba assets as expeditiously and thoughtfully as possible. We are fully aligned with our shareholders in our desire to maximize value for this investment.
Spinoffs that involve the separation of operating business are inherently complex and lengthy processes, and there are a number of steps and considerations. As you can see on Slide 9 of our earnings deck, these include: separation planning; SEC matters, such as filings, audited financials and review; convertible note consideration; compliance with our agreements regarding Yahoo Japan; a likely stockholder vote; and other key steps as negotiation of third-party consents.
Yahoo would be separating its global operating business and its Japanese joint venture Yahoo Japan from the remaining entity, which would retain the Alibaba stake. The reverse spin raises a number of issues not raised in the forward spin we pursued last year, some of which are not within our control. We estimate it will take 9 to 12 months to complete. Regarding future -- further shareholder value creation, Marissa mentioned that we have identified opportunities across real estate, patents and other noncore assets. We will continue to execute on all types of value creation programs, providing additional capital. And during our tenure, we have repurchased over $9 billion and reduced diluted share count by over 20%. With the remaining authorization of $2.7 billion for share repurchases, we will be prudent around timing of returning capital and excess cash. Over time, we will have a balanced approach in returning cash to shareholders.
In summary, this strategy and financial plan builds on the track record we have in creating new streams of revenue while continuing to drive efficiencies in the business and manage platform shifts to set us up for the next phase in transformation.
Now let me cover our guidance for the upcoming quarter, which will reflect many of the planned drivers I have previously discussed. For our GAAP revenue, we have now annualized the Mozilla partnership and BrightRoll acquisition. Investments in exits will have minimal revenue impact in Q1. TIPLA will continue to be a year-over-year headwind of approximately $69 million. For our TAC, growth will moderate now that we have annualized Mozilla and BrightRoll. We expect growth driven by our Gemini platform across search and native advertising.
For Q1 guidance, we expect the following: GAAP revenue in the range of $1.05 billion to $1.09 billion, TAC of approximately $230 million, revenue ex-TAC in the range of $820 million to $860 million, adjusted EBITDA in the range of $100 million to $120 million and non-GAAP operating income in the range of negative $50 million to negative $30 million. For the full year guidance, we expect the following: GAAP revenue in the range of $4.4 billion to $4.6 billion, TAC of approximately $1 billion, revenue ex-TAC in the range of $3.4 billion to $3.6 billion, adjusted EBITDA in the range of $700 million to $800 million and non-GAAP operating income in the range of $150 million to $250 million.
In closing, this guidance and our long-term targets reflect a more focused strategy for the company and the actions we're taking to improve performance in 2016 and beyond.
With that, Marissa and I would like to take your questions. Shibani?"

It's a complicated one because there's mobile search as it exists today, and then there's what mobile search might become in the future. One of the things that we are seeing is that PPCs on mobile are under more pressure than they are in desktop. And the large part of that is because, for example, e-commerce transactions, et cetera, are more difficult from the mobile web on a smartphone. That said, we do see benefits and opportunities to do new kinds of advertising, for example, app marketing, et cetera, in our -- in the context of our mobile web offering. But even more so, we would love to see search evolve into a more app-oriented format where either from -- within the Flurry software development kit or through stand-alone applications, we're able to drive a really rich app-based experience for search. And search in that context probably behaves much differently than web search does. Web search will always be really useful. But that said, what you need on your phone, when you're on the go, under time pressure, you need to actually be searching over a lot more personal information. You also need to have better -- a better understanding of what apps people have on their phone, et cetera. So for example, I may want -- if I'm somewhere, say, in downtown San Francisco as early as [ph] 6:00 on a Saturday night, it's useful to be able to say, okay, use Yelp, use OpenTable, to actually book a reservation. And being able to know what applications you have on your phone, deep link to them and really provide great -- a great guidance, this is really where Yahoo's mission around being the guide comes into play, is something that's quite different. And it will monetize differently. The user interaction will be different, and we really think that mobile search needs a much deeper reimagination. So I would say that a lot of the trends that have been discussed more broadly are true in terms of mobile web-based search. That said, we do think that app-based search, some of the personal assistant work, that's happening across the industry really takes mobile search in a new direction, and we think those reimaginations are only going to become more intense."

In general, we have been experiencing, as we've talked about, rather intense legacy drag from our premium decline. That said, what we're seeing is the premium ad dollars are shifting both into programmatic with the same ad formats, but also they're shifting into new ad formats. Largely, the new ad formats are classified into our Mavens revenue. There are some historical ad formats that are staying in our legacy numbers. And so one of the things you're seeing happening is there's a lot of Price-per-Ad pressure in the near term, in terms of the immediate years following. As that premium shifts to programmatic, that mix shift continues to happen. That said, once that stabilizes, we do think we'll start to see price appreciation in programmatic selling of older-style ad formats. And so that's one of the things that causes that to buoy back up. And in terms of Mavens, as we projected, we anticipate it will be at least $1.8 billion in 2016. We're really happy with the strong growth we've seen in mobile and particularly in native. The fact that Gemini had more than $0.5 billion in GAAP revenue this past year is just terrific. It's a product that was invented in the middle of 2013. We're really excited about that. But overall as we looked at our strategic plan, one of the things that we did was we took a tighter view on revenue to basically help us really seek the types of efficiencies on cost that we ultimately would seek. And so we basically worked with a tight revenue number to really drive a larger set of cost efficiencies across the business. But we feel confident that given the industry trends and our own product momentum here that this is a reasonable number."

There are facilities actions we're going to take, as Marissa noted, some of the facilities that we are eliminating. So that also will be costs that we'll take out. We'll be taking out some content costs. Particularly, we're looking at content costs that don't make sense for where we are, what regions were in and so forth. So there's a number of things we're going to do to take out cost. Certainly, the variable costs are more quickly to take out. The fixed costs, by nature, are a bit fixed. But even there, we're going to do some work particularly on the facilities things that come in my area. So -- and then there's a lot of workforce-related costs, like T&E, whatever, that will also come down with the headcount. So a lot of those costs -- as we take actions this quarter on those and then they get effectuated, that's how we see second half. The other thing that helps us on the EBITDA for the second half is clearly we expect revenue to grow in Q4. So we do expect a normal seasonal pattern in Q4 revenue. So some of the better EBITDA is both from the reduce the cost base by $100 million a quarter roughly as we go forward here once we get it all done, and 2 is then the higher revenue. I would say down the road, we continue -- we will continue to look at some of the fixed costs, where we can be more effective in our data centers, our other facilities, consolidations we can do and so forth. There may be areas in content partnership arrangements that we can also reduce. So there's a number of things that we look forward to as we go past '16 into '17. And the thing is, frankly, we've used a lot of objective data, benchmarking and so forth to really drive us -- ourselves to be much more efficient and effective."

And it's not surprising that the strategy for maximizing our value is also going to be complex. Yes, we need to execute on our strategic plan. We need to create the very best version of Yahoo that we can create. We also see a lot of possible value in a spinoff transaction and the reverse spinoff being likely the most viable there. And then finally, as we announced today, we would like to take a look at alternative strategic opportunities. And so we need to look at all 3 of those. It is going to be very busy. But to put things in perspective, for the majority of people here at Yahoo, we really need to be focused on executing the plan, because executing the plan well creates value in all possible scenarios and really increases our shareholder value. And that's what the majority of people here will be working on. There is a smaller group, much the same group that worked on the forward spin last year, that will be dedicating time to the reverse spin. There's many of the same complexities. There's a few new complexities, and they'll be dedicating their time there. And reviewing strategic alternatives, as well it should be, will be a board-led process. And so obviously, it has to be in our board will be dedicating their time there. I will have to spend time on each of the 3 things. But again, my view is the highest priority for me personally is working on the strategic plan and making sure that we really execute to the best of our abilities inside the company because that's what unlocks the most shareholder value."

I will say that our -- the native business that we have inside of Mavens as well as our syndicated business through Yahoo App Publishing is growing quite strong. And so we're -- a lot of these it's really, I would say, hard to project exactly where we're likely to end up, but we do feel confident in the $1.8 billion number.

So to your point of do we feel confident about completing it in 2016, yes, we do. We're very focused on it. We do feel, we've always felt, that having a separation of Alibaba and letting it be free, so to speak, and let us focus on the core business would be very helpful no matter what direction we take this.

That said that traffic is very well targeted. It's very desirable traffic for advertisers. And while it's small in the context of Yahoo, it's quite large in the areas of those verticals, with most of those applications being either in #1 or #2 in their space both in terms of usage and ratings and other things. And so it is something that we think is really important to focus on in terms of digital content. It helps us ultimately really differentiate, and they are very valuable businesses in their space where Yahoo can make a name for itself. In terms of reviewing the strategic alternatives, we did reference in our announcement in December that while we were focused on a reverse spin, we were going to look at a number of different alternatives, and I think that the announcement today is basically just the formalization of that."

Obviously, the web is really large and in some ways it’s nearly infinite. And so crawling all information that's out on the web that's publicly available, that's privately available is something that's really challenging and very capital intensive. In mobile search, it's much more about your personal information: how can we make you more efficient, more effective, know where you might want to be going, how to get you there most efficiently, what apps can help you accomplish the task that you ultimately want to accomplish. The search space is basically much smaller the required disk space, the computation space is smaller and we just think it really comes down to -- it's a lot about being able to do those basics of search well. But then it's really around user interaction, user expectations and how do we build the best possible application to really meet those needs. But I think the overall cost profile will be somewhat different, and I do think this is an area that's really deeply in need of reimagination. I think when you look at how smartphones have transformed so many different industries and different types of activities that we all do, when you look at search and mail, it's very clear that there's going to be a lot more evolution to come. And that's something that we're really excited to participate in, and we have a long heritage in search. We have a lot of people here who have great ideas about what they'd like to do."

It really set records in a number of different ways in terms of a live event, a live sporting event. It was just one of the biggest audiences ever assembled for something like that, and it's because the NFL brought us such great content. But I was also really proud of how our team executed technically. We had, I believe, a 0.6% rebuffering rate, which is unheard of across the industry. We were running in incredibly high definition on all platforms. It was really, really magnificent to see how the technical piece of this performed. I think it really shows how strong our streaming technology can be and where streaming ultimately can go. It also -- we also, I think, really showed and one of the things we really learned was the value of our network and the value of our large audience. The fact that on a Sunday morning, frankly quite early in a lot of places where they like to watch NFL, we were able to assemble such a large audience by basically putting the game in places where people who were coming to Yahoo properties might see it and might go on to view it. That was something that worked incredibly well, and it shows that Yahoo, having that large audience, what it can really do in terms of distributing great content and helping our users really get that same content. And then finally, I was really very impressed with our sales team. We had more than 30 different brands participating in approximately 70 spots overall in the game. The commercials were all terrific, and I was just really happy with the execution of those advertisements for our advertisers, and our advertisers were really excited about it as well to participate in that type of opportunity. So it was terrific to be involved in. I think we learned a lot technically. We learned a lot about what our audience can provide.

So when we look at these 4 verticals and building out the best-of-breed application on Mobile for them, Gemini is how we'll begin to monetize them. That said, we have been doing some experimentation lately with some, for example, first -- sort of the day takeovers, things like that. So the first time you boot up the application you might see, for example, a full-screen advertisement. We've tried that on Tumblr. That works well. But I would say with the ad formats we have, I'm comfortable with our ad load. I would rather not see us increase it.

Our first quarter of 2016 was very active for us, and we're off to good start to the year, achieving the top of our revenue guidance range. Despite internal restructuring, significant business changes and substantial external noise about our company, Yahoo employees made great progress against our previously announced 2016 plan. I'm proud of their work and today, we'll highlight much of that progress. 
But before we dive into the quarter, I want to address the strategic alternatives process we announced on our last earnings call. Given the obvious interest of our base of shareholders, I want to be very clear about the actions we're taking and address the misconceptions. 
To begin, let me be unequivocal. Our board, our management team and I have made the strategic alternative process a top priority. Our strategic review committee is comprised of independent directors, well experienced in strategic transactions. They are leading a well-run process to achieve the best possible outcome for our shareholders. 
The management team and I have supported the board's process from the start and we are moving expeditiously. To give you a sense of the time, energy and leadership being devoted, management participates in daily calls and meetings, often several per day, with the strategic review committee and its advisers. 
I personally believe that the right transaction could unlock tremendous value in 2 ways: one, by realizing strategic synergies and accelerating growth in our business; and two, by separating our equity stakes from our operating business, enabling various value-accretive subsequent transactions. We've been very thoughtful about running a high-quality process designed to keep interested parties engaged and highlight the tremendous value in Yahoo.
These efforts have included delivering a comprehensive management presentation and assembling a robust data room. Our efforts today reflect clear decisive action to move forward quickly and in a way that we believe will yield enhanced value. 
Over the past 2 months, Ken and I and the rest of the management team have spent time in person and on the phone with interested participants, including some of the most well-known respected names in the industry. We've been responsive and engaging, having personally answered hundreds of questions and requests for information. We have a well-defined aggressive calendar to move forward at the fastest possible pace. In order to preserve the value and integrity of the process, we do not intend to provide future updates or comments on specific details.
I want to state it again: our board and management team are fully committed to maximizing value for shareholders and are completely aligned in pursuit of strategic alternatives. We're working expeditiously and diligently. We're here to serve shareholders and create value, and we are doing all that, that entails.
In terms of our board composition, I'm pleased to report that we appointed 2 new board members this past quarter, Cathy Friedman and Eric Brandt. Cathy spent 23 years at Morgan Stanley as a strategic and transaction adviser to many of the most important companies in health care and biotech. Eric brings significant financial experience in the technology sector and most recently helped lead the acquisition of Broadcom. We're delighted to have them join us.
With that, I now want to turn to Yahoo's operating business. On our last call, we announced Yahoo's 2016 strategic plan to drive product engagement, grow Mavens revenue, simplify the business and operate efficiently. Our actions in Q1 show that we successfully balanced our focus on moving forward with strategic alternatives, well executing on our plans to lower cost and improve long-term growth. 
I'm pleased to report that our Q1 performance across GAAP revenue, revenue ex-TAC, adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP operating income met our expectations. In Q1, we delivered $1,087,000,000 of GAAP revenue and $859 million of revenue ex-TAC. We delivered a healthy adjusted EBITDA of $147 million, well above the high end of our guidance range. 
Now let's take a closer look at our Q1 progress towards our 2016 plan. As discussed in the last call, the first point of our plan is playing to our strengths to grow user engagement and advance our mission as a guide to digital information. We focus on 3 global platforms: Search, Mail and Tumblr and 4 core verticals: News, Sports, Finance and Lifestyles in our priority markets: the U.S., the Canada, the U.K., Germany, Hong Kong and Taiwan. 
And for our advertisers, we're committed to our 2 key offerings: Gemini and BrightRoll. Let's start with Search. Over the past 3 years, we've increased our revenue per search by nearly 3x and have achieved highly optimal search RPMs. This achievement in RPM has shifted our focus to improving query and click volume, so we pursued syndication and distribution opportunities including those with Mozilla and Oracle. 
Additionally, improving the quality of our search experience is key to driving volume, and our partnerships with Microsoft and Google help us optimize the search experience for our users as well as optimize our search revenue. 
In Q1, we saw higher PPCs but a lower number of queries and clicks. As a result, click-driven revenue fell 15% year-over-year. As a reminder, mobile search generally sees lower revenue per search than desktop. While headwinds exist here both in terms of volume and the mix shift to Mobile, we're working hard to drive query and click volume to achieve growth.
Turning to communications. Yahoo Mail is the most substantial driver of engagement across Yahoo's network, and we continue to invest in speed, stability and differentiation to drive growth across Mail's significant user base of hundreds of millions of users. We see encouraging trends in our Mail business as new features are growing user engagement. We recently launched the ability to integrate Gmail, Outlook and AOL accounts with Yahoo Mail and users love it. Over the past few months, we've added more than 5 million mailboxes to Yahoo Mail through IMAP . 
Let's move to our core verticals: News, Sports, Finance and Lifestyles, which marry Yahoo's authoritative editorial voice with useful tools. In Q1, we launched a new Yahoo app, yahoo.com to help users discover, consume and engage with news and users are responding enthusiastically. In the U.S., we're seeing 14% more total page views on yahoo.com than last quarter and 10% more page views per user in our app. 
In Sports, we've signed partnerships with Major League Baseball, the NHL and the PGA to stream live games and premium video content to sports fans. We also launched Yahoo Esports for gamers to tune into live games with exclusive [indiscernible] coverage and stats and engage with fellow fans. 
As we make Yahoo Finance a more dynamic and useful experience, we've added smart price notifications to alert users when stocks and their watchlist change significantly. This encourages users to engage with the app for an even deeper analysis of their portfolios. We also announced a partnership with Berkshire Hathaway to host the first-ever annual live stream of its annual -- live stream of its Annual Shareholder Meeting on April 30. 
In the Lifestyles vertical, we launched menswear on Polyvore to reach an even broader base of fashion lovers. With this launch, users on Polyvore can now discover the latest trends in men's fashion, create personalized looks from their favorite brands and retailers and shop for men's products. 
Yahoo has long held the commanding position in News, Sports, Finance and Lifestyles. We continue to see promise in these 4 core verticals as we strive to maximize their potential and drive deeper engagement.
On Tumblr, we continue -- we're continuing to see strong trends in user engagement with monthly mobile active users up 12% quarter-over-quarter and up 35% year-over-year. One unique element of Tumblr's Community is to connect users through shared interests and passions, and the redesign of the replies and notes functionality brings conversations to the forefront of the Tumblr dashboard. After launching this feature, mobile users have been engaging with notes over 20% more. So we're pleased to see early promise of these launches.
In addition to our sharpened focus on consumer products, we've also strengthened the value of our offering to the advertisers through Gemini and BrightRoll. On Gemini, native install ads gained traction, with advertiser spend up 50% quarter-over-quarter. 
We also integrated Gemini into the BrightRoll DSP to let advertisers buy premium native video placements on Yahoo properties and native display advertisements on third-party exchanges. Through the quarter, we grew our DSP platform business and saw increased spend from key brand advertisers. Also in Q1, we launched programmatic native advertising on the BrightRoll Exchange, giving advertisers, DSPs and agency trading desks access to native mobile inventory. We realized strong growth in our exchange on both the supply and the demand side. As the advertising industry shifts towards programmatic, our hard work on Gemini and BrightRoll solidifies Yahoo's position as a leader in digital advertising.
The second aspect of our 2016 plan is to drive Mavens revenue growth. We set a target to deliver $1.8 billion of Mavens revenue in 2016, and we anticipate we will meet or exceed this goal. We delivered $390 million in Mavens GAAP revenue in Q1, up 7% year-over-year. 
On mobile, we delivered $250 million in GAAP revenue, up 11% year-over-year. On video, we're increasing supply and focusing on user engagement across our network. The significant increase in supply creates downward pressure on Price-per-Ad, so we're turning our efforts towards video ads, which generally yield higher prices. 
While some of our video revenue faced headwinds, we didn't see growth in video revenue across O&O, native and Tumblr compared to last year. Since engagement drives revenue, we are proud to see improved engagement with our editorial and licensed content. In the U.S., we saw time spent watching videos up 94% year-over-year.
Our native Display ad business continues to grow, increasing 28% year-over-year. Our syndication business contributed significantly to this growth as our strong relationships with the developer community continue to bear fruit. In Q1, we hosted our third domestic Yahoo Mobile Developer Conference in San Francisco. We also expanded the reach of Yahoo's Mobile Developer Conference internationally by hosting conferences in Taiwan and Hong Kong. The Yahoo developer network have now grown to 250,000 developers that all have the ability to monetize their apps with Yahoo App Publishing. In all, syndication accounted for 1/3 of native GAAP revenue in Q1. 
On social, monetizing Tumblr remains a focus as we optimize new ad formats. This quarter, we rolled out blog with ads, reducing the time needed to onboard an advertising client and get their sponsored posts live. This make it easier for advertisers to spend on Tumblr. We also rolled out community targeting, which allows advertisers the ability to target again specific fandoms and communities on Tumblr. With new formats targeting and a dedicated direct sales team, we are making progress building Tumblr sales pipeline.
Overall, our investments in mobile, video native and social are critical to counterbalancing our legacy business declines, and we're progressing towards our $1.8 billion revenue goal for 2016. Also in Q1, we streamlined sales support and operations and continue to fine-tune our international sales model. We remapped orders, accounts, opportunities and advertisers across all sales personnel tools. While this was a huge undertaking, the sales team did a fantastic job of seamlessly aligning to the new structure. The resulting approach improves customer satisfaction by reducing friction in client touch points and dramatically shortening the sales cycle. As we continue to train and scale our global sales team to execute with sharper focus, we're improving our delivery on performance and pricing.
Let's turn to the third component of our 2016 plan: simplifying the business to improve execution. We shared bold plans last quarter to simplify Yahoo and to strengthen our value to users and advertisers. In Q1, we acted decisively to clarify our product portfolio. We exited the food, health, parenting, makers and travel digital magazines to focus on our core verticals of News, Sports, Finance and Lifestyles. 
We shut down live as a standalone product while we'll explore ways to utilize the valuable learnings technologies into future messaging launches. We're also in the process of sunsetting autos, games, real estate and smart TV. By sunsetting products that don't meet our aggressive growth goals and reducing investment in high-margin legacy products, we're already yielding better focus and execution. Additionally, we continue to explore ways to generate value through the divestiture of noncore assets, including real estate and nonstrategic patents. Ken will be sharing more about the progress we've made on this front.
The fourth point of our 2016 plan is to efficiently align resources to operate more effectively. On our last earnings call, we announced that we will reduce our workforce and refocus employee efforts to ensure that everyone is directly impacting critical initiatives. Today, we have 1,200 fewer employees working at Yahoo than we did at the end of Q4. These difficult workforce reductions and related actions were necessary, and we took great care to treat affected employees respectively. 
Today, we have less than 9,200 active employees and 700 contractors, with some employees on transition, and we're down roughly 22% since last year and 42% since 2012. Our efforts to tighten our global footprint continue as we plan to close our offices in Burbank, Buenos Aires, Dubai, Madrid, Mexico City and Milan. Pending consultation processes consistent with local laws for these international offices, we anticipate completing these office closures by the end of Q3.
Throughout Q1, we meaningfully reduced our expenses compared to last year. In a moment, Ken will cover this in more detail. Overall, we intend to achieve quality and stability in our day-to-day operations despite a reduced cost basis for workforce expenditures. 
Before I turn it over to Ken, I want to acknowledge the incredible people here at Yahoo and their resilience. The changes we instituted this quarter were necessary but they were not easy. In particular, the workforce reductions and office closures were hard on our close-knit teams. Despite these changes, along with the external noise, the company rallied to deliver a productive quarter against ambitious goals. 
From the global sales team, who tirelessly delivered great return on client investments to the product teams that shipped impressive new products and features, our Q1 performance reflects the strength and resilience of Yahoo. The people I work with here inspire me every day. I'm so proud of what we've achieved.
The board and I understand the paramount importance of maximizing value for shareholders. As we strive to clarify Yahoo's next chapter, it's more important than ever to make Yahoo's operating business as strong as possible. For this reason, we will continue to execute on our plan in parallel to the board's efforts to pursue strategic alternatives. 
We are pleased with the company's solid performance this quarter achieves the milestones laid out in the 2016 strategic plan. I remain confident that our focus on execution will create a better Yahoo for our users, advertisers, employees and shareholders.
I have long respected Yahoo as a pioneer in our industry. Over the past 3.5 years, we took a company that, despite its rich history, faced legacy revenue declines, and we forged a Yahoo that is stronger and more modern. We built a strong base of technical talent to deliver a product portfolio for a mobile-first world, grew our mobile audience to over 600 million monthly users, one of the largest mobile audiences in the world and created a $1.6 billion Mavens business from scratch. That business by itself would rival some of today's fastest-growing startups. 
We saw the potential of Yahoo and we continue to believe in it. The high level of interest throughout the strategic alternatives process validates those efforts and has been both humbling and inspiring to see. Now here's Ken to talk more about our Q1 financials."
91800,330972941,959623,"Yahoo! Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 19, 2016",2016-04-19,"Earnings Calls","Altaba Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Marissa. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I plan to review our first quarter operating results in the context of our strategic alternatives review and later close with the outlook for the upcoming quarter. As Marissa",1580,"Thanks, Marissa. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I plan to review our first quarter operating results in the context of our strategic alternatives review and later close with the outlook for the upcoming quarter. 
As Marissa mentioned earlier, strategic review process is a top priority for us. We are working responsibly with a real sense of urgency and are fully committed to deploying the board's process. In Q1, we delivered solid results that were better than our financial guidance, with GAAP revenue of $1.087 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $147 million. 
We delivered strong free cash flow of $297 million in the quarter, translating to $0.30 per share of demonstrable value. This was achieved through our efforts on cost controls and working capital efficiencies, growing strong collections and an early receipt of a relatively large tax refund. 
Additionally, we reduced capital spending by 32% year-over-year to $76 million. Despite the restructuring charges and ongoing strategic review, we executed on our 2016 plan, which is a real testament to the professionalism of our employees and leadership of our sales and product teams. 
We got off to a good start for the year in our plans to drive operational efficiencies and improved execution. We have aggressively cut costs and continue to drive those efficiencies. We made meaningful progress toward our $400 million savings target for 2016 to improve profitability. 
We reduced our active headcount, which is now 9,200. This represents a 42% reduction in total workforce including contractors since the beginning of 2012. We have created a more focused company resources properly aligned to our strategy. We executed -- exited nonstrategic businesses, closed 6 offices and implemented efficiency programs. 
Looking ahead, we will continue to work on longer-term projects to reduce our fixed cost base to continually achieve a more efficient and effective cost structure. We are making real progress monetizing our noncore assets and generating cash value. We are in active dialogue for the sale of our Santa Clara real estate, and we are confident that the sale will be completed. 
We plan to maximize the value of our significant noncore IP assets. This evaluation is being coordinated with a strategic review process. As a reminder, this management team has already delivered nearly $600 million of total cash value from IP monetization. We realized another $31 million of cash value from our Japanese yen hedges in Q1, resulting in total value of nearly $700 million from hedging our balance sheet investment. 
Our commitment to shareholders has been consistent and long-standing. Since early 2012, we have reduced our fully diluted share count by approximately 270 million as we returned nearly $10 billion capital proceeds. Compared to acquisitions, we have returned over 4x of capital to shareholders over the same period. We are relentlessly focus on ways to drive revenue, reduce cost, improve cash flows and prudently allocate capital to deliver real value to our shareholders.
Now let's run through our first quarter financial results in more detail. Once again, I will focus most of the discussion around non-GAAP results, which excludes stock-based compensation expense of $108 million, restructuring charge of $57 million, advisory fees of $9 million and a $39 million noncash loss on warrants.
Our financial highlights for Q1 can be seen on Slide 5. GAAP revenue was $1.087 billion, down 11% year-over-year. Traffic acquisition costs were $228 million, which is up 24% compared to prior year, primarily due to Gemini Search. We also saw a growth in native syndication. Revenue ex-TAC was $859 million. 
Now taking a closer look at Search. GAAP Search revenue is $492 million, which was down 9% year-over-year. As Marissa noted, search click-driven revenue declined 15% year-over-year. This was a result from Paid Clicks decline of 21%, driven primarily by overall traffic trends across Yahoo properties and the desktop. 
Our Gemini Search marketplace has achieved increased monetization but we did migrate less supply than anticipated. Search Price-per-Click grew 7% year-over-year, mostly as a result of mix shift toward higher monetizing segments and regions. Search revenue ex-TAC declined 20% year-over-year, driven primarily by declines in Paid Clicks and increasing part payments as a percentage of revenue.
Now moving to Display. GAAP Display revenue was $463 million, roughly flat year-over-year as our growing Mavens revenue continues to offset by legacy drag. Americas Display revenue grew modestly year-over-year. In addition, we saw an impact of $11 million from exits and have now fully annualized the BrightRoll acquisition. 
Display ads sold increased 8% year-over-year, driven by continued growth in our native business across Yahoo Properties and partners and growth in our programmatic channels. PPA declined 6% year-over-year caused by overall pricing pressure and a continued mix shift from premium to native formats. 
Display revenue ex-TAC was also roughly flat year-over-year. In our Mavens businesses, we saw 7% GAAP revenue growth year-over-year for those areas in aggregate. Though largely in line with our expectations, more work is required on video and mobile search. Mavens contributed 38% to our traffic-driven revenue, up from 33% in the prior year. 
Mobile GAAP revenue grew 11% year-over-year. In our native Display revenue across all devices grew 28% year-over-year, driven by mobile across partner properties. We grew video supply in the quarter and saw high sell-through rates in our most premium inventory. We also saw more leading brands adopt our BrightRoll DSP. In the short term, we have seen some headwinds in the managed network business. However, we do see large opportunities ahead in native video and through the BrightRoll platform.
In terms of other revenue, ex-TAC declined 39% year-over-year due primarily to the ending of the Alibaba-related fees last September, resulting in a headwind of approximately $70 million. reduction is in our listings and fees businesses. 
For revenue detail by region, please refer to Slide 10. America's GAAP revenue declined 13% year-over-year. As a reminder, the prior year included TIPLA amortization, and excluding FX headwinds, international GAAP revenue was approximately flat year-over-year. 
Now let's take a couple of minutes to go through our expenses and income in a bit more detail. Non-GAAP operating expenses were down 12% year-over-year or $111 million. Depreciation and amortization was down $12 million at $140 million. Our non-GAAP cash expenses for the full quarter came in better than expectations at $712 million, declining nearly $100 million year-over-year. This was primarily workforce-driven, a result of our ongoing focus on cost over the last year, the company initiatives announced last quarter. 
We are driving a business transformation, enabling us to invest in key initiatives for our search and communications by changing our approach to doing things in a few select areas. For example, we are scaling our sales and regional teams by getting the right balance doing direct selling and support costs to achieve improved productivity. 
We rationalized our regional footprint, exiting multiple magazines and properties. We are targeting opportunities to efficiently support our revenue plan and G&A. In technology, we're reducing seeing across corporate IT, advertising and search platforms. We reorganized our teams to better align with our core consumer and advertiser products. We have closed or consolidated our real estate footprint to reduce facilities-related costs and improve cash flow. We delivered adjusted EBITDA of $147 million in Q1, above our guidance range. 
Turning now to the income statement. Earnings and equity interest were $82 million. Our non-GAAP tax rate is 35% and is the estimate we expect to use for all of 2016 non-GAAP presentations. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.08.
Turning to the balance sheet. At the end of Q1, we had $7.1 billion in cash and marketable securities, up $5.8 billion, net of our convertible and other debt. The change in cash balance from Q4 to Q1 was primarily driven by free cash flow of $297 million. 
Of note, capital spending was $76 million, lower than many recent quarters. We had a benefit in cash tax in the quarter due to the receipt of $190 million tax refund as a result of carrying back net losses to prior years. 
We realized excellent working capital management in the quarter, primarily from improved collections. Assuming we receive a similar dividend amount from Yahoo Japan this quarter as we had last year, this translates to nearly $0.40 to $0.50 per share, a demonstrable value in the first half of this year.
Now let me cover guidance. Before I walk through the outlook, we will continue to execute against our 2016 plan for the year as we described last quarter. We expect our revenue in Q2 to be generally consistent with our seasonal trends, which will deliver a slightly lower sequential revenue as we continue to work through our platform shifts and exits. 
On cost, we will remain disciplined to meet our cash flow and expense targets. For Q2 guidance, we expect the following: GAAP revenue in the range of $1.05 billion to $1.09 billion; TAC of approximately $240 million; revenue ex-TAC in the range of $810 million to $850 million; adjusted EBITDA in the range of $135 million to $155 million; and non-GAAP operating income in the range of negative $5 million to $15 million.
In closing, despite the potential of employee distraction despite increasing demands for our time, we have had a solid start to the year. We are achieving our financial goals, shipping products, driving engagement and meeting our advertisers' needs. And as Marissa discussed, we maintain our utmost focus on strategic alternatives process. With that, Marissa and I would like to take your questions. Shibani?"

We continue to work very hard to make sure we keep good growth in video as well as in social, particularly on Tumblr. And we are seeing some headwinds overall in mobile search, both because mobile search monetizes at a slightly lower rate than desktop search as well as the fact that it's a very competitive space in terms of overall retaining users, having their default mobile search set to Yahoo. So we're working very hard on all of those. We have initiatives in place to make sure we keep our growth vibrant there.

In our view, almost all of the decline was, in some way or another, mix shift-related because there's actually 3 different mix shifts happening: one, we're seeing more of our Display ads sold programmatically versus premium and obviously, programmatic ads do come at a lower price then premium ads. Our Mobile, the shift from desktop to mobile, we are happy overall with our mobile monetization. That said, it still is not [indiscernible] higher than our desktop monetization. We've been doing a lot of good work there on things like cost per install ads that have recently seen a lot of strength. This past quarter, we saw advertisers spend up 50% over just Q4, so we're starting to see better trends in terms of Mobile monetization. We really want to get it to the point where it surpasses our desktop monetization. And also in terms of video, we know that video is a really lucrative format, where premium ads may sell for anywhere in the order of $5 to $10. You might see a video ad, especially a premium video ad anywhere from $15 to $60 per 1,000 impressions. So we have been moving heavily towards video ads across the network in order to drive PPA up. That said, we right now do see that overall [indiscernible] when we put extra supply into that marketplace, it does cause short-term price pressures. And so we have added a lot of video supply to the BrightRoll marketplace, particularly in the video segment of it, both the marketplace form the DSP as well as the exchange. And that has caused somewhat to be short-term price pressures overall in our Display formats that we think that, that will improve. So those are the 3 mix shifts: premium to programmatic, desktop to mobile and static Display or classic banner ads shifted to videos. In each of those cases for different reasons, we're seeing some price pressure, though we do feel we have a handle on it and have initiatives in place to create some correction over the course of the year."

The simplification of our advertising platforms to Gemini and BrightRoll and having all of our different offerings, native, banners and video available in our BrightRoll DSP as well as the BrightRoll Exchange with that data is something that's going particularly well.

As we've talked about in past calls, there are times when the system is learning when we may accept lower revenue in order to have that system learn. In order to drive growth in Search, we have been applying Gemini more judiciously. And so we have taken less revenue suppression [indiscernible] higher revenue by deploying it less in learning situations, which means we generally tend to deploy it in verticals that were transitioned early on and have already achieved parity with some of the other offerings we see in the market. We also tended to deploy Gemini more on our mobile search than on our desktop search just because of different TAC rates that we pay overall on Mobile. And so it overall makes Gemini more a healthier option on Mobile. So we've overall been judicious and we haven't necessarily made the entirety of the investment that we've hoped to, or in some cases, plan to in Gemini.

Today, we have about 70% of our overall inventory sold in marketplace. And those could be for our programmatic exchange, it could be the DSP but about 70% of Yahoo's overall inventory is sold either programmatically or at auction. And that's a market increase [ph] from just a few years ago. It used to be probably somewhere in the 10% range. And we have been bringing large pockets of our inventory over into marketplaces, auctions and programmatic offerings in order to meet our advertisers' more modern demands for programmatic access. And we think of that shift is largely done because we do think there will always be some amount of inventory that is sold at a premium, sponsorships for the quarter or for particular video program. Some of our home page offerings will always be sold likely at a premium or available as a premium sale. And so to that end, one of the things that people have noticed, when you look at our overall, the various turnaround [indiscernible] shown, in many cases, you actually -- we start and [indiscernible] anticipate not only continued growth in Mavens but actually some growth in the core. And a lot of that is driven from the fact that once we finish the full mix shift to programmatic offerings and auction-based offerings, we actually do think we will start to see an accretion in price. So the past few years, we have been feeling the drag of taking premium ads that may have been $5, $8, $10 per 1,000 impressions and moving them into programmatic exchanges that today, using rough numbers could be somewhere in the order of $2 to $3. Once we get all that inventory shifted over and met with demand, we actually think that we will see prices begin to increase and overall revenue increasing in the programmatic these almost finished with that mix shift, given it's now 70%.

And 2015 was a very high growth year for us in terms of click. And that wasn't only based on Search query volume. That was also based in the fact we're making the ads clicked on by providing higher quality and more information on those ads. Now as we mentioned, as we've actually gotten to a very good RPM overall in Search as we are now more susceptible to pressure overall on query volume. And so we certainly are pursuing some syndication opportunities like Mozilla, like Oracle keep our existing syndication partners as vibrant as possible but one of the things of that happens here is there is a trade-off if your Search is perceived to be high enough quality or perceived to be too commercial people start to trust they start to do less searches overall. And so it's a tenuous balance in terms of how do you generate more clicks be making those ads more likely to be clicked on but also maintaining the integrity of Search versus [indiscernible] what causes you to get higher Search volume's over time and maintain higher Search volumes over time, and we think we struck that balance will be to a lot of very detailed experiments, understanding the effect of the changes we have had not only in our RPMs but on our search retentions in our Search volume over time. And so we think we struck the balance right but that said, as we've seen or has been [indiscernible] decline overall in Search volume just as people tend to associate the Yahoo brand slightly less would Search."

Overall, I would say the ad business and the digital ad space looks to be growing quite nicely across many different segments. We saw a lot of growth, particularly in native. We saw growth in programmatic overall. We saw a large growth in video supply, and we're now working to meet that with demand to make the pricing on video as robust as it should be. So overall, we tend to see a lot of health overall in advertisers spend. It's usually the case in Q1. You see lower advertisers spend at least in some pockets like cost per install ads. We actually saw advertisers increase their spend even over their Q4. Q4 is often their high are seeing some advertisers increase their budgets in Q1. I do think we're seeing some tightening potentially as some of the private companies as you mentioned. As budgets get tight in valuations get a little bit tighter in that market, there are some -- we see some slowing but then again for just this past quarter, we added both Uber and Lyft native advertisers and I believe also, they did some programmatic with us as well. And so we are really happy to be adding new strong advertisers both who are private as well as public and seeing some increasing trends quarter-over-quarter so the market still looks quite healthy to us."

Our first quarter of 2016 was very active for us, and we're off to good start to the year, achieving the top of our revenue guidance range. Despite internal restructuring, significant business changes and substantial external noise about our company, Yahoo employees made great progress against our previously announced 2016 plan. I'm proud of their work and today, we'll highlight much of that progress. 
But before we dive into the quarter, I want to address the strategic alternatives process we announced on our last earnings call. Given the obvious interest of our base of shareholders, I want to be very clear about the actions we're taking and address the misconceptions.
To begin, let me be unequivocal. Our board, our management team and I have made the strategic alternative process a top priority. Our strategic review committee is comprised of independent directors well-experienced in strategic transactions. They are leading a well-run process to achieve the best possible outcome for our shareholders. 
The management team and I have supported the board's process from the start and we are moving expeditiously. To give you a sense of the time, energy and leadership being devoted, management participates in daily calls and meetings, often several per day, with the strategic review committee and its advisers. I personally believe that the right transaction could unlock tremendous value in 2 ways: one, by realizing strategic synergies and accelerating growth in our business; and two, by separating our equity stakes from our operating business, enabling various value-accretive subsequent transactions. 
We've been very thoughtful about running a high-quality process designed to keep interested parties engaged and highlight the tremendous value in Yahoo. These efforts have included delivering a comprehensive management presentation and assembling a robust data room. Our efforts today reflect clear, decisive action to move forward quickly and in a way that we believe will yield enhanced value. 
Over the past 2 months, Ken and I and the rest of the management team have spent time in person and on the phone with interested participants, including some of the most well-known respected names in the industry. We've been responsive and engaging, having personally answered hundreds of questions and requests for information. We have a well-defined aggressive calendar to move forward at the fastest possible pace. In order to preserve the value and integrity of the process, we do not intend to provide future updates or comments on specific details.
I want to state it again: our board and management team are fully committed to maximizing value for shareholders and are completely aligned in pursuit of strategic alternatives. We're working expeditiously and diligently. We're here to serve shareholders and create value, and we are doing all that, that entails.
In terms of our board composition, I'm pleased to report that we appointed 2 new board members this past quarter, Cathy Friedman and Eric Brandt. Cathy spent 23 years at Morgan Stanley as a strategic and transaction adviser to many of the most important companies in health care and biotech. Eric brings significant financial experience in the technology sector and most recently helped lead the acquisition of Broadcom. We're delighted to have them join us.
With that, I now want to turn to Yahoo's operating business. On our last call, we announced Yahoo's 2016 strategic plan to drive product engagement, grow Mavens revenue, simplify the business and operate efficiently. Our actions in Q1 show that we successfully balanced our focus on moving forward with strategic alternatives while executing on our plans to lower cost and improve long-term growth. 
I'm pleased to report that our Q1 performance across GAAP revenue, revenue ex-TAC, adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP operating income met our expectations. In Q1, we delivered $1,087,000,000 of GAAP revenue and $859 million of revenue ex-TAC. We delivered a healthy adjusted EBITDA of $147 million, well above the high end of our guidance range. 
Now let's take a closer look at our Q1 progress towards our 2016 plan. As discussed in the last call, the first point of our plan is playing to our strengths to grow user engagement and advance our mission as a guide to digital information. We focus on 3 global platforms: Search, Mail and Tumblr and 4 core verticals: News, Sports, Finance and Lifestyles in our priority markets: the U.S., the Canada, the U.K., Germany, Hong Kong and Taiwan. 
And for our advertisers, we're committed to our 2 key offerings: Gemini and BrightRoll. Let's start with Search. Over the past 3 years, we've increased our revenue per search by nearly 3x and have achieved highly optimal search RPMs. This achievement in RPM has shifted our focus to improving query and click volume, so we have pursued syndication and distribution opportunities, including those with Mozilla and Oracle. 
Additionally, improving the quality of our search experience is key to driving volume, and our partnerships with Microsoft and Google help us optimize the search experience for our users as well as optimize our search revenue. 
In Q1, we saw higher PPCs but a lower number of queries and clicks. As a result, click-driven revenue fell 15% year-over-year. As a reminder, mobile search generally sees lower revenue per search than desktop. While headwinds exist here, both in terms of volume and the mix shift to Mobile, we're working hard to drive query and click volume to achieve growth.
Turning to communications. Yahoo Mail is the most substantial driver of engagement across Yahoo's network, and we continue to invest in speed, stability and differentiation to drive growth across Mail's significant user base of hundreds of millions of users. We see encouraging trends in our Mail business as new features are growing user engagement. We recently launched the ability to integrate Gmail, Outlook and AOL accounts with Yahoo Mail, and users love it. Over the past few months, we've added more than 5 million mailboxes to Yahoo Mail through IMAP in.
Let's move to our core verticals: News, Sports, Finance and Lifestyles, which marry Yahoo's authoritative editorial voice with useful tools. In Q1, we launched a new Yahoo app and yahoo.com to help users discover, consume and engage with news, and users are responding enthusiastically. In the U.S., we're seeing 14% more total page views on yahoo.com than last quarter and 10% more page views per user in our app. 
In Sports, we've signed partnerships with Major League Baseball, the NHL and the PDA to stream live games and premium video content to sports fans. We also launched Yahoo Esports for gamers to tune into live games with exclusive editorial coverage and stats and engage with fellow fans. 
As we make Yahoo Finance a more dynamic and useful experience, we've added smart price notifications to alert users when stocks in their watchlist change significantly. This encourages users to engage with the app for an even deeper analysis of their portfolios. We also announced a partnership with Berkshire Hathaway to host the first-ever annual live stream of its annual -- live stream of its Annual Shareholder Meeting on April 30. 
In the Lifestyles vertical, we launched menswear on Polyvore to reach an even broader base of fashion lovers. With this launch, users on Polyvore can now discover the latest trends in men's fashion, create personalized looks from their favorite brands and retailers and shop for men's products. 
Yahoo has long held the commanding position in News, Sports, Finance and Lifestyles. We continue to see promise in these 4 core verticals as we strive to maximize their potential and drive deeper engagement.
On Tumblr, we continue -- we're continuing to see strong trends in user engagement with monthly mobile active users up 12% quarter-over-quarter and up 35% year-over-year. One unique element of Tumblr's community is to connect users through shared interests and passions, and the redesign of the replies and notes functionality brings conversations in the forefront of the Tumblr dashboard. After launching this feature, mobile users have been engaging with notes over 20% more. So we're pleased to see early promise of these launches.
In addition to our sharpened focus on consumer products, we've also strengthened the value of our offering to the advertisers through Gemini and BrightRoll. On Gemini, native install ads gained traction, with advertiser spend up 50% quarter-over-quarter. 
We also integrated Gemini into the BrightRoll DSP to let advertisers buy premium native video placements on Yahoo properties and native display advertisements on third-party exchanges. Through the quarter, we grew our DSP platform business and saw increased spend from key brand advertisers. 
Also in Q1, we launched programmatic native advertising on the BrightRoll Exchange, giving advertisers, DSPs and agency-trading desks access to native mobile inventory. We realized strong growth in our exchange on both the supply and the demand side. As the advertising industry shifts towards programmatic, our hard work on Gemini and BrightRoll solidifies Yahoo's position as a leader in digital advertising.
The second aspect of our 2016 plan is to drive Mavens revenue growth. We set a target to deliver $1.8 billion of Mavens revenue in 2016, and we anticipate we will meet or exceed this goal. We delivered $390 million in Mavens GAAP revenue in Q1, up 7% year-over-year. 
On mobile, we delivered $250 million in GAAP revenue, up 11% year-over-year. On video, we're increasing supply and focusing on user engagement across our network. The significant increase in supply creates downward pressure on Price-per-Ad, so we're turning our efforts towards video ads, which generally yield higher prices. 
While some of our video revenue faced headwinds, we didn't see growth in video revenue across O&O, native and Tumblr compared to last year. 
Since engagement drives revenue, we are proud to see improved engagement with our editorial and licensed content. In the U.S., we saw time spent watching videos up 94% year-over-year.
Our native Display ad business continues to grow, increasing 28% year-over-year. Our syndication business contributed significantly to this growth as our strong relationships with the developer community continue to bear fruit. 
In Q1, we hosted our third domestic Yahoo Mobile Developer Conference in San Francisco. We also expanded the reach of Yahoo's Mobile Developer Conference internationally by hosting conferences in Taiwan and Hong Kong. The Yahoo developer network have now grown to 250,000 developers that all have the ability to monetize their apps with Yahoo App Publishing. In all, syndication accounted for 1/3 of native GAAP revenue in Q1. 
On social. Monetizing Tumblr remains a focus as we optimize new ad formats. This quarter, we rolled out blog with ads, reducing the time needed to onboard an advertising client and get their sponsored posts live. This make it easier for advertisers to spend on Tumblr. We also rolled out community targeting, which allows advertisers the ability to target again specific fandoms and communities on Tumblr. With new format targeting and a dedicated direct sales team, we are making progress building Tumblr sales pipeline.
Overall, our investments in mobile video, native and social are critical to counterbalancing our legacy business declines, and we're progressing towards our $1.8 billion revenue goal for 2016. Also in Q1, we streamlined sales support and operations and continue to fine-tune our international sales model. We remapped orders, accounts, opportunities and advertisers across all sales personnel and internal tools. 
While this was a huge undertaking, the sales team did a fantastic job of seamlessly aligning to the new structure. The resulting approach improves customer satisfaction by reducing friction in client touch points and dramatically shortening the sales cycle. As we continue to train and scale our global sales team to execute with sharper focus, we're improving our delivery on performance and pricing.
Let's turn to the third component of our 2016 plan: simplifying the business to improve execution. We shared bold plans last quarter to simplify Yahoo and to strengthen our value to users and advertisers. In Q1, we acted decisively to clarify our product portfolio. We exited the food, health, parenting, makers and travel digital magazines to focus on our core verticals of News, Sports, Finance and Lifestyles. 
We shut down live tech [ph] as a standalone product while we'll explore ways to utilize the valuable learnings of technologies in the future messaging launches. 
We're also in the process of sunsetting autos, games, real estate and smart TV. By sunsetting products that don't meet our aggressive growth goals and reducing investment in high-margin legacy products, we're already yielding better focus and execution. Additionally, we continue to explore ways to generate value through the divestiture of noncore assets, including real estate and nonstrategic patents. Ken will be sharing more about the progress we've made on this front.
The fourth point of our 2016 plan is to efficiently align resources to operate more effectively. On our last earnings call, we announced that we will reduce our workforce and refocus employee efforts to ensure that everyone is directly impacting critical initiatives. Today, we have 1,200 fewer employees working at Yahoo than we did at the end of Q4. These difficult workforce reductions and related actions were necessary, and we took great care to treat affected employees respectively. 
Today, we have less than 9,200 active employees and 700 contractors, with some employees on transition, and we're down roughly 22% since last year and 42% since 2012. Our efforts to tighten our global footprint continue as we plan to close our offices in Burbank, Buenos Aires, Dubai, Madrid, Mexico City and Milan. Pending consultation processes consistent with local laws for these international offices, we anticipate completing these office closures by the end of Q3.
Throughout Q1, we meaningfully reduced our expenses compared to last year. In a moment, Ken will cover this in more detail. Overall, we intend to achieve quality and stability in our day-to-day operations despite a reduced cost basis for workforce expenditures. 
Before I turn it over to Ken, I want to acknowledge the incredible people here at Yahoo and their resilience. The changes we instituted this quarter were necessary but they were not easy. In particular, the workforce reductions and office closures were hard on our close-knit teams. Despite these changes, along with the external noise, the company rallied to deliver a productive quarter against ambitious goals. 
From the global sales team who tirelessly delivered great return on client investments to the product teams that shipped impressive new products and features, our Q1 performance reflects the strength and resilience of Yahoo. The people I work with here inspire me every day. I'm so proud of what we've achieved.
The board and I understand the paramount importance of maximizing value for shareholders. As we strive to clarify Yahoo's next chapter, it's more important than ever to make Yahoo's operating business as strong as possible. For this reason, we will continue to execute on our plan in parallel to the board's efforts to pursue strategic alternatives. 
We are pleased that the company's solid performance this quarter achieved the milestones laid out in the 2016 strategic plan. I remain confident that our focus on execution will create a better Yahoo for our users, advertisers, employees and shareholders.
I have long respected Yahoo as a pioneer in our industry. Over the past 3.5 years, we took a company that, despite its rich history, faced legacy revenue declines, and we forged a Yahoo that is stronger and more modern. We've built a strong base of technical talent to deliver a product portfolio for a mobile-first world, grew our mobile audience to over 600 million monthly users, one of the largest mobile audiences in the world and created a $1.6 billion Mavens business from scratch. That business, by itself, would rival some of today's fastest-growing startups. 
We saw the potential of Yahoo and we continue to believe in it. The high level of interest throughout the strategic alternatives process validates those efforts and has been both humbling and inspiring to see. Now here's Ken to talk more about our Q1 financials."
91800,330972941,959640,"Yahoo! Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 19, 2016",2016-04-19,"Earnings Calls","Altaba Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Marissa. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I plan to review our first quarter operating results in the context of our strategic alternatives review and later close with the outlook for the upcoming quarter. As Marissa",1588,"Thanks, Marissa. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I plan to review our first quarter operating results in the context of our strategic alternatives review and later close with the outlook for the upcoming quarter. 
As Marissa mentioned earlier, strategic review process is a top priority for us. We are working responsibly with a real sense of urgency and are fully committed to deploying the board's process. In Q1, we delivered solid results that were better than our financial guidance, with GAAP revenue of $1.087 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $147 million. 
We delivered strong free cash flow of $297 million in the quarter, translating to $0.30 per share of demonstrable value. This was achieved through our efforts on cost controls and working capital efficiencies, growing strong collections and an early receipt of a relatively large tax refund. Additionally, we reduced capital spending by 32% year-over-year to $76 million. 
Despite the restructuring charges and ongoing strategic review, we executed on our 2016 plan, which is a real testament to the professionalism of our employees and the leadership of our sales and product teams. 
We got off to a good start for the year in our plans to drive operational efficiencies and improved execution. We have aggressively cut costs and continue to drive those efficiencies. We made meaningful progress toward our $400 million savings target for 2016 to improve profitability. 
We reduced our active headcount, which is now 9,200. This represents a 42% reduction in total workforce including contractors, since the beginning of 2012. We have created a more focused company resources properly aligned to our strategy. We executed -- exited nonstrategic businesses, closed 6 offices and implemented efficiency programs. 
Looking ahead, we will continue to work on longer-term projects to reduce our fixed cost base to continually achieve a more efficient and effective cost structure. 
We are making real progress monetizing our noncore assets and generating cash value. We are in an active dialogue for the sale of our Santa Clara real estate, and we are confident that the sale will be completed. 
We plan to maximize the value of our significant noncore IP assets. This evaluation is being coordinated with the strategic review process. As a reminder, this management team has already delivered nearly $600 million of total cash value from IP monetization. We realized another $31 million in cash value from our Japanese yen hedges in Q1, resulting in total value of nearly $700 million from hedging our balance sheet investment. 
Our commitment to shareholders has been consistent and long-standing. Since early 2012, we have reduced our fully diluted share count by approximately 270 million as we returned nearly $10 billion capital proceeds. Compared to acquisitions, we have returned over 4x of capital to shareholders over the same period. We are relentlessly focus on ways to drive revenue, reduce cost, improve cash flows and prudently allocate capital to deliver real value to our shareholders.
Now let's run through our first quarter financial results in more detail. Once again, I will focus most of the discussion around non-GAAP results, which excludes stock-based compensation expense of $108 million, restructuring charge of $57 million, advisory fees of $9 million and a $39 million noncash loss on our [indiscernible] warrants.
Our financial highlights for Q1 can be seen on Slide 5. GAAP revenue was 1.8 -- $1.087 billion, down 11% year-over-year. Traffic acquisition costs were $228 million, which was up 24% compared to prior year, primarily due to Gemini search. We also saw growth in natives syndication. Revenue ex-TAC was $859 million. 
Now taking a closer look at Search. GAAP Search revenue is $492 million, which was down 9% year-over-year. As Marissa noted, search click-driven revenue declined 15% year-over-year. This was a result from Paid Clicks decline of 21%, driven primarily by overall traffic trends across Yahoo properties and the desktop. 
Our Gemini search marketplace has achieved increased monetization but we did migrate less supply than anticipated. 
Search Price-per-Click grew 7% year-over-year, mostly as a result of mix shift toward higher monetizing segments and regions. Search revenue ex-TAC declined 20% year-over-year, driven primarily by declines in Paid Clicks and increasing part in payments as a percentage of revenue.
Now moving to Display. GAAP Display revenue was $463 million, roughly flat year-over-year as our growing Mavens revenue continues to offset by legacy drag. Americas Display revenue grew modestly year-over-year. In addition, we saw an impact of $11 million from exits and have now fully annualized the BrightRoll acquisition. 
Display ads sold increased 8% year-over-year, driven by continued growth in our native business across Yahoo Properties and partners and growth in our programmatic channels. PPA declined 6% year-over-year caused by overall pricing pressure and a continued mix shift from premium to native formats. Display revenue ex-TAC was also roughly flat year-over-year. 
In our Mavens businesses, we saw 7% GAAP revenue growth year-over-year for those areas in aggregate. Though largely in line with our expectations, more work is required on video and mobile search. Mavens contributed 38% to our traffic-driven revenue, up from 33% in the prior year. 
Mobile GAAP revenue grew 11% year-over-year. In our native display revenue across all devices grew 28% year-over-year, driven by mobile across partner properties. We grew video supply in the quarter and saw high sell-through rates in our most premium inventory. We also saw more leading brands adopt our BrightRoll DSP. 
In the short term, we have seen some headwinds in the managed network business. However, we do see large opportunities ahead in native video and through the BrightRoll platform.
In terms of other revenue, ex-TAC declined 39% year-over-year due primarily to the ending of the Alibaba-related fees last September, resulting in a headwind of approximately $70 million in reductions in our listings and fees businesses. 
For revenue detail by region, please refer to Slide 10. America's GAAP revenue declined 13% year-over-year. As a reminder, the prior year included TIPLA amortization, and excluding FX headwinds, international GAAP revenue was approximately flat year-over-year. 
Now let's take a couple of minutes to go through our expenses and income in a bit more detail. Non-GAAP operating expenses were down 12% year-over-year or $111 million. Depreciation and amortization was down $12 million at $140 million. Our non-GAAP cash expenses for the full quarter came in better than expectations at $712 million, declining nearly $100 million year-over-year. This was primarily workforce-driven, a result of our ongoing focus on cost over the last year, company initiatives announced last quarter. 
We are driving a business transformation, enabling us to invest in key initiatives for our search and communications by changing our approach to doing things in a few select areas. For example, we are scaling our sales and regional teams by getting the right balance doing direct selling and support costs to achieve improved productivity. 
We rationalized our regional footprint, exiting multiple magazines and properties. We are targeting opportunities to efficiently support our revenue plan and G&A. In technology, we are reducing with densities across corporate IT, advertising and search platforms. We reorganized our lab teams to better align with our core consumer and advertiser products. We have closed or consolidated our real estate footprint to reduce facilities-related costs and improve cash flow. We delivered adjusted EBITDA of $147 million in Q1, above our guidance range. 
Turning now to the income statement. Earnings and equity interest were $82 million. Our non-GAAP tax rate is 35%, and it's the estimate we expect to use for all of 2016 non-GAAP presentations. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.08.
Turning to the balance sheet. At the end of Q1, we had $7.1 billion in cash and marketable securities, up $5.8 billion, net of our convertible and other debt. The change in cash balance from Q4 to Q1 was primarily driven by free cash flow of $297 million. 
Of note, capital spending was $76 million, lower than many recent quarters. We had a benefit in cash tax in the quarter due to the receipt of $190 million tax refund as a result of carrying back net losses to prior years. 
We realized excellent working capital management in the quarter, primarily from improved collections. Assuming we receive a similar dividend amount from Yahoo Japan this quarter, as we had last year, this translates to nearly $0.40 to $0.50 per share, a demonstrable value in the first half of this year.
Now let me cover guidance. Before I walk through the outlook, we will continue to execute against our 2016 plan for the year as we described last quarter. We expect our revenues in Q2 to be generally consistent with our seasonal trends, which will deliver a slightly lower sequential revenue as we continue to work through our platform shifts and exits. 
On cost, we will remain disciplined to meet our cash flow and expense targets. For Q2 guidance, we expect the following: GAAP revenue in the range of $1.05 billion to $1.09 billion; TAC of approximately $240 million; revenue ex-TAC in the range of $810 million to $850 million; adjusted EBITDA in the range of $135 million to $155 million; and non-GAAP operating income in the range of negative $5 million to $15 million.
In closing, despite the potential of employee distraction, despite increasing demands for our time, we have had a solid start to the year. We are achieving our financial goals, shipping products, driving engagement and meeting our advertisers' needs. And as Marissa discussed, we maintain our utmost focus on strategic alternatives process. 
With that, Marissa and I would like to take your questions. Shibani?"

In our view, almost all of the decline was, in some way or another, mix shift-related because there's actually 3 different mix shifts happening: One, we're seeing more of our display ads sold programmatically versus premium, and obviously, programmatic ads do come at a lower price than premium ads. Our mobile -- the shift from desktop to mobile, we are happy overall with our mobile monetization. That said, it still is not in a state where it's higher than our desktop monetization. We've been doing a lot of good work there on things like cost per install ads that have recently seen a lot of strength. This past quarter, we saw advertiser spend up 50% over just Q4. So we're starting to see better trends in terms of mobile monetization. We really want to get it to the point where it surpasses our desktop monetization. And also, in terms of video, we know that video is a really lucrative format, where premium ads may sell for anywhere on the order of $5 to $10. You might see a video ad, especially a premium video ad, anywhere from $15 to $60 per 1,000 impressions. So we have been moving heavily towards video ads across the network in order to drive PPA up. That said, we, right now, do see that overall -- what happens is when we put extra supply into that marketplace, it does cause short-term price pressures. And so we have added a lot of video supply to the BrightRoll marketplace, particularly in the video segment of it, both the marketplace in the form of the DSP as well as the Exchange. And that has caused somewhat, we view, to be short-term price pressures overall in our display formats that we think that, that will improve. So those are the 3 mix shifts: premium to programmatic, desktop to mobile, and static display or classic banner ads being shifted to videos. In each of those cases, for different reasons, we're seeing some price pressure though we do feel we have a handle on it and have initiatives in place to create some correction over the course of the year."

As we've talked about in past calls, there are times when the system is learning when we may accept lower revenue in order to have that system learn. In order to drive growth in Search, we have been applying Gemini more judiciously. And so we have taken less revenue suppression, basically higher revenue, by deploying it less in learning situations, which means we generally tend to deploy it in verticals that were transitioned early on and have already achieved parity with some of the other offerings we see in the market. And we also tended to deploy Gemini more on our mobile search than on our desktop search just because of different TAC rates that we pay overall on mobile. And so it overall makes Gemini more a healthier option on mobile. So we've overall been judicious and we haven't necessarily made the entirety of the investment that we've hoped to or, in some cases, plan to in Gemini. That said, the verticals we have transitioned have performed very well and are now very competitive, with great results for advertisers and good opportunities for us in terms of how to monetize the searches."

And those could be for our programmatic exchange. It could be the DSP. But about 70% of Yahoo's overall inventory is sold either programmatically or at auction. And that's a marked increase from just a few years ago. It used to be probably somewhere on the 10% range. And we have been bringing large pockets of our inventory over into marketplaces, auctions and programmatic offerings in order to meet our advertisers' more modern demands for programmatic access. And we think of that shift is largely done because we do think there will always be some amount of our inventory that is sold at a premium, sponsorships for, say, fantasy football for the quarter or for a particular video program. Some of our home page offerings will always be sold likely at a premium or available as a premium sale. And so to that end, one of the things that people have noticed, when you look at our overall -- the various turnaround targets we've shown, in many cases, you -- actually, we saw and we -- to see and anticipate not only continued growth in Mavens but actually some growth in the core. And a lot of that is driven from the fact that once we finish the full mix shift to programmatic offerings and auction-based offerings, we actually do think we will start to see an accretion in price. So for the past few years, we've been feeling the drag of taking premium ads that may have been $5, $8, $10 per 1,000 impressions and moving them into programmatic exchanges that today, using rough numbers, could be somewhere on the order of $2 to $3. Once we get all that inventory shifted over and met with demand, we actually think that we will see prices begin to increase and overall revenue increasing in the programmatic piece. We're almost finished with that mix shift given it's now at 70%. And I'll have Ken comment on SBC."

And RPMs not only comes with PPC increases but also comes with increased clicks. So if you make a search results page, you make it more likely that a user will click on an ad by making the ads better, by making it more visually appealing, by making them higher quality and richer with, for example, prices or pictures, that is something that can overall drive clicks. And 2015 was a very high growth year for us in terms of click. And that wasn't only based on search query volume. That was also based on the fact that we are making the ads more likely to be clicked on by providing higher quality and more information on those ads. Now as we mentioned, as we've actually gotten to a very good RPM overall in Search as we are now more susceptible to pressure overall on query volume -- and so we certainly are pursuing some syndication opportunities like Mozilla, like Oracle, and we're continuing to keep our existing syndication partners as vibrant as possible. But one of the things that happens here is there is a trade-off. If your search isn't perceived to be high-enough quality or is perceived to be too commercial, people start to trust it last. They start to do less searches overall. And so it's a tenuous balance in terms of how do you generate more clicks by making those ads more likely to be clicked on but also maintaining the integrity of Search, which is also going to be what causes you to get higher search volumes over time and maintain higher search volumes over time. And we think we've struck that balance well. We do a lot of very detailed experiments, understanding the effect, the changes we have on our -- not only our RPMs but on our search retentions and our search volume over time. And so we think that we've struck the balance right. But that said, as we've seen, there has been some decline overall in Search volume just as people tend to associate the Yahoo brand slightly less with search."

We saw growth in programmatic, overall. We saw a large growth in video supply, and we're now working to meet that with demand to make the pricing on video as robust as it should be. So overall, we tend to see a lot of health, overall, in advertiser spends. And it's usually the case in Q1. You see lower advertiser spends at least in some pockets, like cost per install ads. We actually saw advertisers increase their spend even over their Q4. Q4 is often their high, and we actually are seeing some advertisers that increase their budgets in Q1. I do think we are seeing some tightening potentially of some of the private companies, as you mentioned, as budgets get tight and valuations get a little bit tighter in that market. There are some -- we see some slowing. But then again, for just this past quarter, we added both Uber and Lyft as native advertisers, and I believe also they did some programmatic with us as well. And so we're really happy to be adding new strong advertisers, both who are private as well as public, and seeing some increasing trends quarter-over-quarter.

Our first quarter of 2016 was very active for us, and we're off to good start to the year, achieving the top of our revenue guidance range. Despite internal restructuring, significant business changes and s",2645,"Good afternoon, and thank you for joining today. Our first quarter of 2016 was very active for us, and we're off to good start to the year, achieving the top of our revenue guidance range. Despite internal restructuring, significant business changes and substantial external noise about our company, Yahoo employees made great progress against our previously announced 2016 plan. I'm proud of their work and today, we'll highlight much of that progress. 
But before we dive into the quarter, I want to address the strategic alternatives process we announced on our last earnings call. Given the obvious interest of our base of shareholders, I want to be very clear about the actions we're taking and address the misconceptions.
To begin, let me be unequivocal. Our board, our management team and I have made the strategic alternative process a top priority. Our strategic review committee is comprised of independent directors well-experienced in strategic transactions. They are leading a well-run process to achieve the best possible outcome for our shareholders. 
The management team and I have supported the board's process from the start and we are moving expeditiously. To give you a sense of the time, energy and leadership being devoted, management participates in daily calls and meetings, often several per day, with the strategic review committee and its advisers. I personally believe that the right transaction could unlock tremendous value in 2 ways: one, by realizing strategic synergies and accelerating growth in our business; and two, by separating our equity stakes from our operating business, enabling various value-accretive subsequent transactions. 
We've been very thoughtful about running a high-quality process designed to keep interested parties engaged and highlight the tremendous value in Yahoo. These efforts have included delivering a comprehensive management presentation and assembling a robust data room. Our efforts to date reflect clear, decisive action to move forward quickly and in a way that we believe will yield enhanced value. 
Over the past 2 months, Ken and I and the rest of the management team have spent time in person and on the phone with interested participants, including some of the most well-known respected names in the industry. We've been responsive and engaging, having personally answered hundreds of questions and requests for information. We have a well-defined aggressive calendar to move forward at the fastest possible pace. In order to preserve the value and integrity of the process, we do not intend to provide future updates or comments on specific details.
I want to state it again: our board and management team are fully committed to maximizing value for shareholders and are completely aligned in pursuit of strategic alternatives. We're working expeditiously and diligently. We're here to serve shareholders and create value, and we are doing all that, that entails.
In terms of our board composition, I'm pleased to report that we appointed 2 new board members this past quarter, Cathy Friedman and Eric Brandt. Cathy spent 23 years at Morgan Stanley as a strategic and transaction adviser to many of the most important companies in health care and biotech. Eric brings significant financial experience in the technology sector and most recently helped lead the acquisition of Broadcom. We're delighted to have them join us.
With that, I now want to turn to Yahoo's operating business. On our last call, we announced Yahoo's 2016 strategic plan to drive product engagement, grow Mavens revenue, simplify the business and operate efficiently. Our actions in Q1 show that we successfully balanced our focus on moving forward with strategic alternatives while executing on our plans to lower cost and improve long-term growth. 
I'm pleased to report that our Q1 performance across GAAP revenue, revenue ex-TAC, adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP operating income met our expectations. In Q1, we delivered $1,087,000,000 of GAAP revenue and $859 million of revenue ex-TAC. We delivered a healthy adjusted EBITDA of $147 million, well above the high end of our guidance range. 
Now let's take a closer look at our Q1 progress towards our 2016 plan. As discussed in the last call, the first point of our plan is playing to our strengths to grow user engagement and advance our mission as a guide to digital information. We focus on 3 global platforms: Search, Mail and Tumblr and 4 core verticals: News, Sports, Finance and Lifestyles in our priority markets: the U.S., Canada, the U.K., Germany, Hong Kong and Taiwan. 
And for our advertisers, we're committed to our 2 key offerings: Gemini and BrightRoll. Let's start with Search. Over the past 3 years, we've increased our revenue per search by nearly 3x and have achieved highly optimal search RPMs. This achievement in RPM has shifted our focus to improving query and click volume, so we have pursued syndication and distribution opportunities, including those with Mozilla and Oracle. 
Additionally, improving the quality of our search experience is key to driving volume, and our partnerships with Microsoft and Google help us optimize the search experience for our users as well as optimize our search revenue. 
In Q1, we saw higher PPCs but a lower number of queries and clicks. As a result, click-driven revenue fell 15% year-over-year. As a reminder, mobile search generally sees lower revenue per search than desktop. While headwinds exist here, both in terms of volume and the mix shift to Mobile, we're working hard to drive query and click volume to achieve growth.
Turning to communications. Yahoo Mail is the most substantial driver of engagement across Yahoo's network, and we continue to invest in speed, stability and differentiation to drive growth across Mail's significant user base of hundreds of millions of users. We see encouraging trends in our Mail business as new features are growing user engagement. We recently launched the ability to integrate Gmail, Outlook and AOL accounts with Yahoo Mail, and users love it. Over the past few months, we've added more than 5 million mailboxes to Yahoo Mail through IMAP in.
Let's move to our core verticals: News, Sports, Finance and Lifestyles, which marry Yahoo's authoritative editorial voice with useful tools. In Q1, we launched a new Yahoo app and yahoo.com to help users discover, consume and engage with news, and users are responding enthusiastically. In the U.S., we're seeing 14% more total page views on yahoo.com than last quarter and 10% more page views per user in our app. 
In Sports, we've signed partnerships with Major League Baseball, the NHL and the PDA to stream live games and premium video content to sports fans. We also launched Yahoo Esports for gamers to tune into live games, read exclusive editorial coverage and stats and engage with fellow fans. 
As we make Yahoo Finance a more dynamic and useful experience, we've added smart price notifications to alert users when stocks in their watchlist change significantly. This encourages users to engage with the app for an even deeper analysis of their portfolios. We also announced a partnership with Berkshire Hathaway to host the first-ever annual live stream of its annual -- live stream of its Annual Shareholder Meeting on April 30. 
In the Lifestyles vertical, we launched menswear on Polyvore to reach an even broader base of fashion lovers. With this launch, users on Polyvore can now discover the latest trends in men's fashion, create personalized looks from their favorite brands and retailers and shop for men's products. 
Yahoo has long held the commanding position in News, Sports, Finance and Lifestyles. We continue to see promise in these 4 core verticals as we strive to maximize their potential and drive deeper engagement.
On Tumblr, we continue -- we're continuing to see strong trends in user engagement with monthly mobile active users up 12% quarter-over-quarter and up 35% year-over-year. One unique element of Tumblr's community is to connect users through shared interests and passions, and the redesign of the replies and notes functionality brings conversations to the forefront of the Tumblr dashboard. After launching this feature, mobile users have been engaging with notes over 20% more. So we're pleased to see early promise of these launches.
In addition to our sharpened focus on consumer products, we've also strengthened the value of our offering to the advertisers through Gemini and BrightRoll. On Gemini, native install ads gained traction, with advertiser spend up 50% quarter-over-quarter. 
We also integrated Gemini into the BrightRoll DSP to let advertisers buy premium native video placements on Yahoo properties and native display advertisements on third-party exchanges. Through the quarter, we grew our DSP platform business and saw increased spend from key brand advertisers. 
Also in Q1, we launched programmatic native advertising on the BrightRoll Exchange, giving advertisers, DSPs and agency-trading desks access to native mobile inventory. We realized strong growth in our exchange on both the supply and the demand side. As the advertising industry shifts towards programmatic, our hard work on Gemini and BrightRoll solidifies Yahoo's position as a leader in digital advertising.
The second aspect of our 2016 plan is to drive Mavens revenue growth. We set a target to deliver $1.8 billion of Mavens revenue in 2016, and we anticipate we will meet or exceed this goal. We delivered $390 million in Mavens GAAP revenue in Q1, up 7% year-over-year. 
On mobile, we delivered $250 million in GAAP revenue, up 11% year-over-year. On video, we're increasing supply and focusing on user engagement across our network. The significant increase in supply creates downward pressure on Price-per-Ad, so we're turning our efforts towards video ads, which generally yield higher prices. 
While some of our video revenue faced headwinds, we did see growth in video revenue across O&O, native and Tumblr compared to last year. 
Since engagement drives revenue, we are proud to see improved engagement with our editorial and licensed content. In the U.S., we saw time spent watching videos up 94% year-over-year.
Our native Display ad business continues to grow, increasing 28% year-over-year. Our syndication business contributed significantly to this growth as our strong relationships with the developer community continue to bear fruit. 
In Q1, we hosted our third domestic Yahoo Mobile Developer Conference in San Francisco. We also expanded the reach of Yahoo's Mobile Developer Conference internationally by hosting conferences in Taiwan and Hong Kong. The Yahoo developer network have now grown to 250,000 developers that all have the ability to monetize their apps with Yahoo App Publishing. In all, syndication accounted for 1/3 of native GAAP revenue in Q1. 
On social. Monetizing Tumblr remains a focus as we optimize new ad formats. This quarter, we rolled out blog with ads, reducing the time needed to onboard an advertising client and get their sponsored posts live. This makes it easier for advertisers to spend on Tumblr. We also rolled out community targeting, which allows advertisers the ability to target again specific fandoms and communities on Tumblr. With new format targeting and a dedicated direct sales team, we are making progress building Tumblr sales pipeline.
Overall, our investments in mobile video, native and social are critical to counterbalancing our legacy business declines, and we're progressing towards our $1.8 billion revenue goal for 2016. Also in Q1, we streamlined sales support and operations and continue to fine-tune our international sales model. We remapped orders, accounts, opportunities and advertisers across all sales personnel and internal tools. 
While this was a huge undertaking, the sales team did a fantastic job of seamlessly aligning to the new structure. The resulting approach improves customer satisfaction by reducing friction in client touch points and dramatically shortening the sales cycle. As we continue to train and scale our global sales team to execute with sharper focus, we're improving our delivery on performance and pricing.
Let's turn to the third component of our 2016 plan: simplifying the business to improve execution. We shared bold plans last quarter to simplify Yahoo and to strengthen our value to users and advertisers. In Q1, we acted decisively to clarify our product portfolio. We exited the food, health, parenting, makers and travel digital magazines to focus on our core verticals of News, Sports, Finance and Lifestyles. 
We shut down live text as a standalone product while we'll explore ways to utilize the valuable learnings of technologies in the future messaging launches. 
We're also in the process of sunsetting autos, games, real estate and smart TV. By sunsetting products that don't meet our aggressive growth goals and reducing investment in high-margin legacy products, we're already yielding better focus and execution. Additionally, we continue to explore ways to generate value through the divestiture of noncore assets, including real estate and nonstrategic patents. Ken will be sharing more about the progress we've made on this front.
The fourth point of our 2016 plan is to efficiently align resources to operate more effectively. On our last earnings call, we announced that we will reduce our workforce and refocus employee efforts to ensure that everyone is directly impacting critical initiatives. Today, we have 1,200 fewer employees working at Yahoo than we did at the end of Q4. These difficult workforce reductions and related actions were necessary, and we took great care to treat affected employees respectfully. 
Today, we have less than 9,200 active employees and 700 contractors, with some employees on transition, and we're down roughly 22% since last year and 42% since 2012. Our efforts to tighten our global footprint continue as we plan to close our offices in Burbank, Buenos Aires, Dubai, Madrid, Mexico City and Milan. Pending consultation processes consistent with local laws for these international offices, we anticipate completing these office closures by the end of Q3.
Throughout Q1, we meaningfully reduced our expenses compared to last year. In a moment, Ken will cover this in more detail. Overall, we intend to achieve quality and stability in our day-to-day operations despite a reduced cost basis for workforce expenditures. 
Before I turn it over to Ken, I want to acknowledge the incredible people here at Yahoo and their resilience. The changes we instituted this quarter were necessary but they were not easy. In particular, the workforce reductions and office closures were hard on our close-knit teams. Despite these changes, along with the external noise, the company rallied to deliver a productive quarter against ambitious goals. 
From the global sales team who tirelessly delivered great return on client investments to the product teams that shipped impressive new products and features, our Q1 performance reflects the strength and resilience of Yahoo. The people I work with here inspire me every day. I'm so proud of what we've achieved.
The board and I understand the paramount importance of maximizing value for shareholders. As we strive to clarify Yahoo's next chapter, it's more important than ever to make Yahoo's operating business as strong as possible. For this reason, we will continue to execute on our plan in parallel to the board's efforts to pursue strategic alternatives. 
We are pleased that the company's solid performance this quarter achieved the milestones laid out in the 2016 strategic plan. I remain confident that our focus on execution will create a better Yahoo for our users, advertisers, employees and shareholders.
I have long respected Yahoo as a pioneer in our industry. Over the past 3.5 years, we took a company that, despite its rich history, faced legacy revenue declines, and we forged a Yahoo that is stronger and more modern. We've built a strong base of technical talent to deliver a product portfolio for a mobile-first world, grew our mobile audience to over 600 million monthly users, one of the largest mobile audiences in the world and created a $1.6 billion Mavens business from scratch. That business, by itself, would rival some of today's fastest-growing startups. 
We saw the potential of Yahoo and we continue to believe in it. The high level of interest throughout the strategic alternatives process validates those efforts and has been both humbling and inspiring to see. Now here's Ken to talk more about our Q1 financials."
91800,330972941,959656,"Yahoo! Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 19, 2016",2016-04-19,"Earnings Calls","Altaba Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Marissa. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I plan to review our first quarter operating results in the context of our strategic alternatives review and later close with the outlook for the upcoming quarter. As Marissa",1587,"Thanks, Marissa. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I plan to review our first quarter operating results in the context of our strategic alternatives review and later close with the outlook for the upcoming quarter. 
As Marissa mentioned earlier, strategic review process is a top priority for us. We are working responsibly with a real sense of urgency and are fully committed to supporting the board's process. In Q1, we delivered solid results that were better than our financial guidance, with GAAP revenue of $1.087 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $147 million. 
We delivered strong free cash flow of $297 million in the quarter, translating to $0.30 per share of demonstrable value. This was achieved through our efforts on cost controls and working capital efficiencies, including strong collections and an early receipt of a relatively large tax refund. Additionally, we reduced capital spending by 32% year-over-year to $76 million. 
Despite the restructuring charges and ongoing strategic review, we executed on our 2016 plan, which is a real testament to the professionalism of our employees and the leadership of our sales and product teams. 
We got off to a good start for the year in our plans to drive operational efficiencies and improved execution. We have aggressively cut costs and continue to drive those efficiencies. We made meaningful progress toward our $400 million savings target for 2016 to improve profitability. 
We reduced our active headcount, which is now 9,200. This represents a 42% reduction in total workforce including contractors, since the beginning of 2012. We have created a more focused company resources properly aligned to our strategy. We executed -- exited nonstrategic businesses, closed 6 offices and implemented efficiency programs. 
Looking ahead, we will continue to work on longer-term projects to reduce our fixed cost base to continually achieve a more efficient and effective cost structure. 
We are making real progress monetizing our noncore assets and generating cash value. We are in an active dialogue for the sale of our Santa Clara real estate, and we are confident that the sale will be completed. 
We plan to maximize the value of our significant noncore IP assets. This evaluation is being coordinated with the strategic review process. As a reminder, this management team has already delivered nearly $600 million of total cash value from IP monetization. We realized another $31 million in cash value from our Japanese yen hedges in Q1, resulting in total value of nearly $700 million from hedging our balance sheet investment. 
Our commitment to shareholders has been consistent and long-standing. Since early 2012, we have reduced our fully diluted share count by approximately 270 million as we returned nearly $10 billion capital proceeds. Compared to acquisitions, we have returned over 4x of capital to shareholders over the same period. We are relentlessly focused on ways to drive revenue, reduce cost, improve cash flows and prudently allocate capital to deliver real value to our shareholders.
Now let's run through our first quarter financial results in more detail. Once again, I will focus most of the discussion around non-GAAP results, which excludes stock-based compensation expense of $108 million, restructuring charge of $57 million, advisory fees of $9 million and a $39 million noncash loss on our Hortonworks warrants.
Our financial highlights for Q1 can be seen on Slide 5. GAAP revenue was 1.8 -- $1.087 billion, down 11% year-over-year. Traffic acquisition costs were $228 million, which was up 24% compared to prior year, primarily due to Gemini search. We also saw growth in natives syndication. Revenue ex-TAC was $859 million. 
Now taking a closer look at Search. GAAP Search revenue is $492 million, which was down 9% year-over-year. As Marissa noted, search click-driven revenue declined 15% year-over-year. This was a result from Paid Clicks decline of 21%, driven primarily by overall traffic trends across Yahoo properties and the desktop. 
Our Gemini search marketplace has achieved increased monetization but we did migrate less supply than anticipated. 
Search Price-per-Click grew 7% year-over-year, mostly as a result of mix shift toward higher monetizing segments and regions. Search revenue ex-TAC declined 20% year-over-year, driven primarily by declines in Paid Clicks and increasing partner payments as a percentage of revenue.
Now moving to Display. GAAP Display revenue was $463 million, roughly flat year-over-year as our growing Mavens revenue continues to offset by legacy drag. Americas Display revenue grew modestly year-over-year. In addition, we saw an impact of $11 million from exits and have now fully annualized the BrightRoll acquisition. 
Display ads sold increased 8% year-over-year, driven by continued growth in our native business across Yahoo Properties and partners and growth in our programmatic channels. PPA declined 6% year-over-year caused by overall pricing pressure and a continued mix shift from premium to native formats. Display revenue ex-TAC was also roughly flat year-over-year. 
In our Mavens businesses, we saw 7% GAAP revenue growth year-over-year for those areas in aggregate. Though largely in line with our expectations, more work is required on video and mobile search. Mavens contributed 38% to our traffic-driven revenue, up from 33% in the prior year. 
Mobile GAAP revenue grew 11% year-over-year. In our native display revenue across all devices grew 28% year-over-year, driven by mobile across partner properties. We grew video supply in the quarter and saw high sell-through rates in our most premium inventory. We also saw more leading brands adopt our BrightRoll DSP. 
In the short term, we have seen some headwinds in the managed network business. However, we do see large opportunities ahead in native video and through the BrightRoll platform.
In terms of other revenue, ex-TAC declined 39% year-over-year due primarily to the ending of the Alibaba-related fees last September, resulting in a headwind of approximately $70 million in reductions in our listings and fees businesses. 
For revenue detail by region, please refer to Slide 10. America's GAAP revenue declined 13% year-over-year. As a reminder, the prior year included TIPLA amortization, and excluding FX headwinds, international GAAP revenue was approximately flat year-over-year. 
Now let's take a couple of minutes to go through our expenses and income in a bit more detail. Non-GAAP operating expenses were down 12% year-over-year or $111 million. Depreciation and amortization was down $12 million at $140 million. Our non-GAAP cash expenses for the full quarter came in better than expectations at $712 million, declining nearly $100 million year-over-year. This was primarily workforce-driven, a result of our ongoing focus on cost over the last year, company initiatives announced last quarter. 
We are driving a business transformation, enabling us to invest in key initiatives for our search and communications by changing our approach to doing things in a few select areas. For example, we are scaling our sales and regional teams by getting the right balance doing direct selling and support costs to achieve improved productivity. 
We rationalized our regional footprint, exiting multiple magazines and properties. We are targeting opportunities to efficiently support our revenue plan and G&A. In technology, we are reducing with densities across corporate IT, advertising and search platforms. We reorganized our lab teams to better align with our core consumer and advertiser products. We have closed or consolidated our real estate footprint to reduce facilities-related costs and improve cash flow. We delivered adjusted EBITDA of $147 million in Q1, above our guidance range. 
Turning now to the income statement. Earnings and equity interest were $82 million. Our non-GAAP tax rate is 35%, and it's the estimate we expect to use for all of 2016 non-GAAP presentations. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.08.
Turning to the balance sheet. At the end of Q1, we had $7.1 billion in cash and marketable securities, up $5.8 billion, net of our convertible and other debt. The change in cash balance from Q4 to Q1 was primarily driven by free cash flow of $297 million. 
Of note, capital spending was $76 million, lower than many recent quarters. We had a benefit in cash tax in the quarter due to the receipt of $190 million tax refund as a result of carrying back net losses to prior years. 
We realized excellent working capital management in the quarter, primarily from improved collections. Assuming we receive a similar dividend amount from Yahoo Japan this quarter, as we had last year, this translates to nearly $0.40 to $0.50 per share, a demonstrable value in the first half of this year.
Now let me cover guidance. Before I walk through the outlook, we will continue to execute against our 2016 plan for the year as we described last quarter. We expect our revenues in Q2 to be generally consistent with our seasonal trends, which will deliver a slightly lower sequential revenue as we continue to work through our platform shifts and exits. 
On cost, we will remain disciplined to meet our cash flow and expense targets. For Q2 guidance, we expect the following: GAAP revenue in the range of $1.05 billion to $1.09 billion; TAC of approximately $240 million; revenue ex-TAC in the range of $810 million to $850 million; adjusted EBITDA in the range of $135 million to $155 million; and non-GAAP operating income in the range of negative $5 million to $15 million.
In closing, despite the potential of employee distraction, despite increasing demands for our time, we have had a solid start to the year. We are achieving our financial goals, shipping products, driving engagement and meeting our advertisers' needs. And as Marissa discussed, we maintain our utmost focus on strategic alternatives process. 
With that, Marissa and I would like to take your questions. Shibani?"

We continue to work very hard to make sure we keep good growth in video as well as in social, particularly on Tumblr. And we are seeing some headwinds overall in mobile search both because mobile search monetizes at a slightly lower rate than desktop search as well as the fact that it's a very competitive space in terms of overall retaining users, having their default mobile search set to Yahoo. So we're working very hard on all of those. We have initiatives in place to make sure we keep our growth vibrant there.

In our view, almost all of the decline was, in some way or another, mix shift-related because there's actually 3 different mix shifts happening: One, we're seeing more of our display ads sold programmatically versus premium, and obviously, programmatic ads do come at a lower price than premium ads. Our mobile -- the shift from desktop to mobile, we are happy overall with our mobile monetization. That said, it still is not in a state where it's higher than our desktop monetization. We've been doing a lot of good work there on things like cost per install ads that have recently seen a lot of strength. This past quarter, we saw advertiser spend up 50% over just Q4. So we're starting to see better trends in terms of mobile monetization. We really want to get it to the point where it surpasses our desktop monetization. And also, in terms of video, we know that video is a really lucrative format, where premium ads may sell for anywhere on the order of $5 to $10. You might see a video ad, especially a premium video ad, anywhere from $15 to $60 per 1,000 impressions. So we have been moving heavily towards video ads across the network in order to drive PPA up. That said, we, right now, do see that overall -- what happens is when we put extra supply into that marketplace, it does cause short-term price pressures. And so we have added a lot of video supply to the BrightRoll marketplace, particularly in the video segment of it, both the marketplace in the form of the DSP as well as the Exchange. And that has caused somewhat, we view, to be short-term price pressures overall in our display formats that we think that, that will improve. So those are the 3 mix shifts: premium to programmatic, desktop to mobile, and static display or classic banner ads being shifted to videos. In each of those cases, for different reasons, we're seeing some price pressure though we do feel we have a handle on it and have initiatives in place to create some correction over the course of the year."

As we've talked about in past calls, there are times when the system is learning when we may accept lower revenue in order to have that system learn. In order to drive growth in Search, we have been applying Gemini more judiciously. And so we have taken less revenue suppression, basically higher revenue, by deploying it less in learning situations, which means we generally tend to deploy it in verticals that were transitioned early on and have already achieved parity with some of the other offerings we see in the market. And we also tended to deploy Gemini more on our mobile search than on our desktop search just because of different TAC rates that we pay overall on mobile. And so it overall makes Gemini more a healthier option on mobile. So we've overall been judicious and we haven't necessarily made the entirety of the investment that we've hoped to or, in some cases, plan to in Gemini. That said, the verticals we have transitioned have performed very well and are now very competitive, with great results for advertisers and good opportunities for us in terms of how to monetize the searches."

And those could be for our programmatic exchange. It could be the DSP. But about 70% of Yahoo's overall inventory is sold either programmatically or at auction. And that's a marked increase from just a few years ago. It used to be probably somewhere on the 10% range. And we have been bringing large pockets of our inventory over into marketplaces, auctions and programmatic offerings in order to meet our advertisers' more modern demands for programmatic access. And we think of that shift is largely done because we do think there will always be some amount of our inventory that is sold at a premium, sponsorships for, say, fantasy football for the quarter or for a particular video program. Some of our home page offerings will always be sold likely at a premium or available as a premium sale. And so to that end, one of the things that people have noticed, when you look at our overall -- the various turnaround charts we've shown, in many cases, you -- actually, we saw and we -- to see and anticipate not only continued growth in Mavens but actually some growth in the core. And a lot of that is driven from the fact that once we finish the full mix shift to programmatic offerings and auction-based offerings, we actually do think we will start to see an accretion in price. So for the past few years, we've been feeling the drag of taking premium ads that may have been $5, $8, $10 per 1,000 impressions and moving them into programmatic exchanges that today, using rough numbers, could be somewhere on the order of $2 to $3. Once we get all that inventory shifted over and met with demand, we actually think that we will see prices begin to increase and overall revenue increasing in the programmatic piece. We're almost finished with that mix shift given it's now at 70%. And I'll have Ken comment on SBC."

That was also based on the fact that we are making the ads more likely to be clicked on by providing higher quality and more information on those ads. Now as we mentioned, as we've actually gotten to a very good RPM overall in Search as we are now more susceptible to pressure overall on query volume -- and so we certainly are pursuing some syndication opportunities like Mozilla, like Oracle, and we're continuing to keep our existing syndication partners as vibrant as possible. But one of the things that happens here is there is a trade-off. If your search isn't perceived to be high-enough quality or is perceived to be too commercial, people start to trust it less. They start to do less searches overall. And so it's a tenuous balance in terms of how do you generate more clicks by making those ads more likely to be clicked on but also maintaining the integrity of Search, which is also going to be what causes you to get higher search volumes over time and maintain higher search volumes over time. And we think we've struck that balance well. We do a lot of very detailed experiments, understanding the effect, the changes we have on our -- not only our RPMs but on our search retentions and our search volume over time. And so we think that we've struck the balance right. But that said, as we've seen, there has been some decline overall in Search volume just as people tend to associate the Yahoo brand slightly less with search."

Overall, I would say to us, the ad business and the ad -- the digital ad space looks to be growing quite nicely across many different segments. We saw a lot of growth particularly in native. We saw growth in programmatic, overall. We saw a large growth in video supply, and we're now working to meet that with demand to make the pricing on video as robust as it should be. So overall, we tend to see a lot of health, overall, in advertiser spends. And it's usually the case in Q1. You see lower advertiser spends at least in some pockets, like cost per install ads. We actually saw advertisers increase their spend even over their Q4. Q4 is often their high, and we actually are seeing some advertisers that increase their budgets in Q1. I do think we are seeing some tightening potentially of some of the private companies, as you mentioned, as budgets get tight and valuations get a little bit tighter in that market. There are some -- we see some slowing. But then again, for just this past quarter, we added both Uber and Lyft as native advertisers, and I believe also they did some programmatic with us as well. And so we're really happy to be adding new strong advertisers, both who are private as well as public, and seeing some increasing trends quarter-over-quarter. So the market still looks quite healthy to us."

For my portion of today's call, I'll cover our Q2 performance as well as an update against our 2016 strategic plan. 
Before we jump into the quarter, I want to briefly address the strategic alternatives process, which continues to be top of mind for shareholders as a top priority for our board and management team. Although we have no announcement today, I want to restate our commitment to delivering shareholder value with this process. By separating Yahoo's operating business from our equity stake in Alibaba, there is substantial value that we can potentially unlock. 
To that end, the right transaction could strategically and efficiently achieve such as operation. Our board's independent strategic review committee, which is leading a well-run robust process, continues to manage this effort and we are making great progress. While we have no announcement today, I can say we are deep into the process of evaluating proposals and alternatives and will update our shareholders as soon as is prudent.
In parallel, we continue to strengthen our operating business through the execution of our 2016 strategic plan. As I've said before, our plan complements the strategic alternatives process and is important to maximize the value of Yahoo in any scenario. With that, let's turn to our business updates for the quarter.
In Q2, we delivered $1,308,000,000 of GAAP revenue and $841 million of ex-TAC revenue, meeting the high end of our ex-TAC guidance. Our GAAP revenue presentation has changed this quarter. This is due to a required change stemming from the implementation of the 11th amendment of our Microsoft Search Agreement last April. Per the agreement, we transitioned our exclusive sales responsibilities for premium advertisers to Microsoft. Our GAAP revenue will now track search revenue both this quarter and in the future. Ken will elaborate in further detail about this GAAP revenue presentation change.
Our adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP operating income both exceeded our guidance range, coming in at $172 million and $39 million, respectively. Our overall performance in Q2 reflects the hard work of Yahoo's employees to drive value for our users, advertisers and shareholders. Our team demonstrated excellent teamwork in implementing our strategic plans and delivering this quarter's results. We faced a lot of adversity and uncertainty throughout this quarter, and Yahoo showed resolve and resilience to deliver in line with our expectations. 
With that, let's turn to our 2016 strategic plan. The first focus of our plan is to play to our strengths to grow user engagement on Yahoo's 3 global platforms: Search, Mail and Tumblr; and 4 core verticals: News, Sports, Finance and Lifestyles. 
Starting with Search. With Search making up more than half of our GAAP revenue, it remains an important area of our business. Today, our Search business is built on strong partnerships with Microsoft, Google, Mozilla, Apple and Oracle, among others. Our with Google and Microsoft remains strong, and we continue to improve performance and monetization on Yahoo Gemini Search ads. We also continue to leverage all 3 platforms to compete for traffic in order to deliver the best quality search experience to our users. We're pleased that Yahoo Gemini Search performs particularly well on Mobile.
We anticipate that much of the innovation in Search will incur in the form of mobile assistance. Examples of others entering what we call the mobile assistance space include Alexa from Amazon or from Facebook. This quarter, we launched early but important experiments in the areas of conversational interfaces, personal assistance and real-time answers, which we believe can be important differentiators for us in the mobile assistance space. 
Also related to our Search business, I wanted to take a moment to address some questions surrounding our Mozilla partnership. Mozilla is a very important partner to Yahoo and Search. We've built strong relationships with the Mozilla team and we are closely engaged with them. While we would certainly like to continue the partnership regardless of our strategic alternatives process, should Mozilla choose not to, our agreement does provide for certain mitigations, which will reduce our exposure. Ultimately, it remains in our mutual best interest to maintain a healthy path forward and we do hope to do just that.
Next, as you know, Yahoo Mail drives significant user engagement and revenue. For every dollar generated on Yahoo Mail, we see roughly $3 of incremental revenue across the network. Over the past 4 years I spent at Yahoo, I've watched our team completely rebuild Yahoo Mail from the ground up. And today, not only is it incredibly stable, reliable with great spam protection but Yahoo Mail for iOS and for Android is the highest rated e-mail client, consistently achieving 4.5 stars in the App Store and on Google Play. And with over 7 million additional mailboxes now connected through IMAP we're reaching even more users outside of Yahoo with our best-in-class features. 
With Tumblr, we've relentlessly focused on mobile engagement, and we're seeing good growth in engagement with signed-in users, particularly on mobile. This past quarter, we made enhancements to our popular gift maker and launched Live Video posts to allow users to broadcast videos live to their followers. As we continue to strengthen our mobile creative tools, we've seen great traction with 84% of our daily average users active on mobile devices.
For our core verticals, we made solid progress with launches across News, Sports, Finance and Lifestyles. This quarter, we continued to bring together passionate communities of like-minded users, offered personalized content with even more video and empowered our users with engagement tools and utilities to enhance our News experience. 
For example, as the U.K. contemplated the Brexit vote, users turned to Yahoo to follow 37 hours of continuous live updates that results in the highest number of users on Yahoo Finance in 4 years. And when news broke of Prince's passing earlier this spring, Yahoo experienced an unprecedented surge in traffic, with the highest load on the site seen in the last 7 years. This illustrates once again that the Internet turns to Yahoo for the most accurate, fastest and most in-depth information on any breaking news. Overall, our investment in news have resulted in solid user engagement [indiscernible] and really highlight the power of Yahoo as a trusted news source. 
In terms of product improvements, we leverage our learnings from the Yahoo Homepage last quarter -- launched last quarter as we've updated News, Sports and Finance on desktop, with one consistent look and feel for a cleaner, faster and more personalized experience. 
We also recently launched updated apps for Yahoo Sports and Yahoo Finance that bring video front and center. We've doubled down on Live Video with NBA exclusives on the vertical with and began live streaming MLB's Game of the Day on Yahoo Sports as well as live coverage of key financial events, including the first-ever global live stream on the Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting, that generated 1.8 million live streams and over 8 million views on demand on Yahoo Finance. 
And for Lifestyles, Polyvore was recognized with a Webby for the Best Mobile Site and App for Lifestyle for engaging and inspiring style lovers around the world. Additionally, we continue to integrate Polyvore across Yahoo's network with Polyvore-powered product listing ads running in Gemini native display ad inventory. 
Polyvore surpasses operational goals and is EBITDA accretive. While the results are small in the overall picture for Yahoo, they have been an excellent investment due to their fit with our products and their excellent team. 
For our advertisers, we fully committed to delivering solid ROI with innovative, simplified ad products and top tier client services. On Gemini, we rolled out a new mobile serving algorithm and now see 4x as many clients, meeting our advertising goals for app install campaigns. And on BrightRoll, both our DSP and exchange businesses continue to gain traction and produced meaningful revenue. 
Through Ad Tech, Yahoo continues to deliver a unique value that provides superior ads, data and user experiences for all advertisers. We also introduced Yahoo Tiles, a new mobile ad format with dynamic and interactive features in native video and display, and Yahoo Storytellers as a new content marketing studio, which leverages Yahoo's editorial expertise, extensive data and Gemini Native to create engaging premium content. While still nascent, we are pleased to see positive reception from advertisers and active engagement from our early partners.
As our advertising products and sales operations are closely tied revenue performance, let's move to our second focus: driving Mavens revenue growth. Mavens, which stands for mobile, video, native and social, represent the fastest-growing areas of digital advertising and are key areas of investment for us. These business lines were nascent at Yahoo in 2012, with essentially no revenue and lack of product focus in these areas. 
Going back even further, recall that Yahoo's early market lead in digital advertising was based heavily on desktop ads. As the industry shifted over time to favor mobile and programmatic advertising, Yahoo's had one of the largest legacy businesses to modernize and transform. Our investments in Mavens offset legacy business declines and have helped build a solid foundation for Yahoo's future. 
In Q2, we delivered $504 million in Mavens GAAP revenue. Excluding the Microsoft accounting impact, this equates to a 4% decrease year-over-year. Holding video aside, Mavens would've shown modest growth roughly in line with our expectations. In video, we experienced pricing pressure and general demand issues in our third-party ad network. We attribute some of these challenges to uncertainty around the ongoing strategic alternatives process. 
Video on Yahoo's properties however was a highlight, with the growth in supply and revenue as we continue to invest in bringing video-rich experiences across our offerings like the new rollouts that I mentioned in News, Sports and Finance. This investment has significantly increased video engagement on our properties and thus also our ad supply. 
Our O&O video revenue grew 108% year-over-year. Mavens is a key part of our strategy, our growth and our turnaround story, and we will work very hard to get the Mavens collectively back to growth in the second half of the year. 
Let's take a deeper look at the other areas of Mavens. On Mobile, we delivered $378 million in revenue -- in GAAP revenue, representing a 3% year-over-year increase. With our redesigned apps and ad units on Mobile, we're optimistic that our continued focus on building the greatest mobile experiences for our users and advertisers will continue to bear fruit. 
For video, while we've already discussed the overall impact on Mavens revenue this quarter, we are seeing promising size of engagement, with an 88% year-over-year boost in total video streams globally. As we continue into the second half of the year, we remain focused on growing our video business, specifically with O&O supply and Gemini Video on the BrightRoll DSP and exchange.
On Native, we aim to grow demand by improving both product performance and advertiser satisfaction. We improved the mechanics of our algorithm to optimize campaign performance, and we are pleased to see positive advertiser response, with our Gemini native advertiser base growing 25% in the last quarter. 
And on Social, we made strides on our Tumblr platform to enhance ad serving and increase supply with Gemini to improve Tumblr's monetization potential. With these ad experience enhancements, we are seeing twice as many Tumblr users engaging with ads compared to last year. 
We'll continue our focus on Mavens to maximize growth and to win our share of these fast-growing areas of digital advertising. As we rounded the last 2 areas on our strategic plan, we're doing exactly what we said we would: simplifying the business and efficiently aligning our resources. We announced that we would retire products that either failed to meet our growth goals or did not fit strategically with Yahoo's future. 
Most products we committed to shutting down have already been sunset, and we recently announced that we will also be retiring Yahoo Recommends and the legacy Yahoo Messenger product by the end of Q3. Yahoo Messenger remains an important communications tool, and we encourage all legacy Messenger users to switch to the new Yahoo Messenger for more modern, secure and feature-rich experience. 
In addition to our products, we also identified ways to unlock value for our shareholders through nonstrategic assets, including real estate and intellectual property. As we mentioned during our shareholder meeting, we recently closed on the $250 million sale of our Santa Clara real estate, a parcel of land close to our Senegal headquarters. 
And our strategic plan identified ways to maximize the value of over 4,000 patents and patent applications from our global portfolio. Over the past 21 years, Yahoo's grown a vast, valuable and foundational intellectual property portfolio covering technologies, including Search, advertising, cloud, mobile, web and more. 
As our businesses evolve, we've outgrown the need for certain intellectual property. That portfolio, which we've identified and entitled Excalibur, represents a unique opportunity to acquire pioneering pans. Our strategic review committee is overseeing exploration of these options, including the sale of the portfolio as a whole or retaining remain to use strategically or to monetize. Moving forward, we'll keep all of our -- we'll keep IP that is core to our business and will have a license back to the caliber portfolio as we have done with other divestitures.
Finally, we also announced a series of changes to ensure that every product counts, every market matters and every employee's efforts drive excellence, competitiveness and profitability. As the -- as of the end of Q2, we completed the 6 planned office closures in Buenos Aires, Burbank, Dubai, Madrid, Mexico and Milan. And we've met our commitment to reduce our workforce by 15%. 
As of the end of the quarter, our active headcount stands at 8,800 employees and 700 contractors. This represents a reduction of approximately 45% since I started in 2012. Our headcount has returned to 2005 levels. 
In terms of cost reduction, we continue to make meaningful progress towards our savings target to improve profitability. We reduced non-GAAP cash expenses by 14% year-over-year and reduced capital spend by 50% year-over-year. Prior to Q2 2016, the last quarter our non-GAAP cash expenses were this low was Q3 2006, almost 10 years ago. We're now running the company at the lowest cost structure and with the smallest headcount in a decade. As you can see from our business updates, we continue to run the company efficiently and responsibly. 
Before I turn over to Ken, I want to share a few closing thoughts. We set forth a plan to return this iconic company to growth over multiple years, one that will create long-term sustainable growth for Yahoo and deliver value to our users, advertisers, employees and shareholders. We took a hard honest look at where we were and where we wanted to be and have taken necessary steps to get there. 
From building a mobile team from the ground up to modernizing and simplifying our digital advertising strategy and products and creating a brand-new Mavens business, these efforts are just a few of the achievements that have delivered a far stronger, more modern Yahoo of today. 
This quarter has not been without its unique set of challenges, but above all, we've kept true to our commitment to deliver the results laid out in our strategic plan. Our refreshed products are yielding stronger engagement. We continue to focus on our investments in mobile, video, native and social. Our business is dramatically simplified, and we've continued to manage costs while efficiently running the company. 
I remain confident that these are the right steps to create a better Yahoo. I'm very proud of the team for focusing on the task at hand despite a lot of distraction and uncertainty and pulling together as a team to deliver this quarter's results. 
As we work to conclude the strategic alternatives process, this groundwork will serve as a solid foundation for Yahoo's next chapter. I'm proud of what this company has achieved over these past 4 years, I remain committed to our team and our company and I continue to be optimistic and passionate about the future of Yahoo. Thank you, and over to you, Ken."

Today, I would like to discuss our solid execution over the first half of the year against our 2016 strategic plan in the prior guidance we have provided. 
Through excellent expansion management of our cost and capital, we achieved above the high end of our guidance on adjusted EBITDA and significantly increased cash flow. Additionally, I will discuss the required change in the revenue presentation related to the 11th amendment to the Microsoft Search Agreement. 
I will later close with outlook going forward, inclusive of this impact. As Marissa noted, we do not have specific updates in our strategic alternatives update, but we will -- but we understand this is in top of mind of our shareholders. We are working expeditiously with our board's strategic review committee, and I can assure you it's the top priority for all of us. 
In Q2, we delivered revenue ex-TAC and profitability results near the higher -- above -- or the higher end of our guidance range. plan commitment for revenue and demonstrated exceptional cost control. Revenue ex-TAC of $841 million results from stable performances on properties driven by solid performance on Mail, which offset continued softness in Search volume. 
We had another good quarter of cost target achievement and cash generation, delivering an adjusted EBITDA of $172 million and free cash flow of $426 million. We are focused in taking actions to reduce cost as well as increase cash throughout the quarter. 
Our non-GAAP cash expenses were $669 million, down 14% year-over-year or $112 million, ahead of our planned targets. This was primarily driven by lower headcount numbers through planned actions and attrition as we ended the quarter at 8,800 active employees, down approximately 2,100 year-over-year. 
Our focus has shifted to the effectiveness of our cost structure, for example, in the areas of IT infrastructure, content spend, sales and support and G&A. Through the first half of the year, we increased our cash balance by over $800 million from both operating improvements and monetization efforts, including $776 million of cash from operating activities for the first 6 months. This includes positive adjusted EBITDA of $319 million, $157 million dividend from Yahoo Japan in the second quarter and also reflects the ongoing working capital improvements to improve collections and the receipt of $190 million tax refund in first quarter. 
Capital expenditures over this period of $152 million, which were down 43% year-over-year, as we continued our disciplined approach to capital spend. In the sale of Santa Clara land for net cash proceeds of $246 million as part of our noncore asset monetization efforts. This has resulted in a very strong balance sheet with nearly $7.7 billion in cash from marketable securities. 
We will continue to look for ways to generate cash through operations and asset monetization to deliver tangible and demonstrable value to our shareholders. We have heard shareholder input and feedback and importance of capital allocation, enjoying value for our shareholders and look forward to sharing more information at the appropriate time, taking into account our strategic review process. We remain focused on ways to drive revenue, reduce costs, improve cash flows and prudently allocate capital, maximizing value for our shareholders.
Before going through operating results for the quarter, I want to discuss required change of revenue presentation related to the 11th amendment to the Microsoft Search Agreement. Pursuant to the amendment, we completed the transition of our exclusive sale responsibilities to Microsoft for Microsoft's paid search services to premium advertisers in the United States, Canada and Europe on April 1, 2016, and other markets on June 1, 2016. 
Following this transition, Yahoo is now considered principal sale traffic to Microsoft in the transition markets. And as a result, we recognize Search Affiliate revenues on a gross basis rather than net basis in those markets. This resulted in an increase to search GAAP revenue and cost of revenue tax of $252 million in the second quarter as amounts paid to Affiliates as recorded as TAC rather than as a reduction to GAAP revenue. TAC [indiscernible] non-transition markets of Taiwan and Hong Kong will continue to be reduction to revenue. For further clarification, this change in revenue presentation does not impact revenue ex-TAC or profit. Please refer to Table 12, the slide deck for example of the change.
Now let's run through our second quarter financial results in more detail. And once again, I will focus most of the discussion around non-GAAP results. These exclude: a noncash goodwill intangible impairment charge of $482 million that we recorded this quarter that I will provide more detail around this later in the call; secondly, $120 million gain on sale of Santa Clara land; stock-based compensation expense of $132 million, up sequentially due to a full quarter retention cost and factoring in our first half performance in executing our plan; and finally, restructuring charges of $19 million, advisory fees of $15 million and $2 million noncash loss on our Hortonworks warrants.
Our financial results for Q2 can be seen on Slide 5. GAAP revenue was $1.308 billion and traffic acquisition costs were $466 million. As I mentioned earlier, $252 million of the GAAP revenue in TAC was due to the required change of revenue presentation related to the Microsoft agreement. 
Excluding this impact, GAAP revenue was $1.055 billion, down 15% year-over-year. Revenue ex-TAC of $840 million -- $841 million. Taking a closer look at Search, GAAP search revenue was $711 million but excluding the impact of the change in revenue presentation, GAAP search revenue decreased by 13% year-over-year. 
Search click-driven revenue declined 18% year-over-year. Paid Clicks declined 24%, driven primarily by overall traffic trends across Yahoo properties, Affiliates and partners and especially on desktop where volume remains challenged. Search PPC grew 8% year-over-year, mostly as a result of mix shift to its higher monetizing segments. 
We have made good progress optimizing our advertising performance across our 3 marketplaces: Gemini, Bing and Google. Search revenue ex-TAC of $319 million declined 24% year-over-year, driven primarily by the declines in Paid Clicks and increasing payments -- partner payments as a percentage of revenues.
Now moving to Display. GAAP display revenue was $470 million, down 7% year-over-year. Display ads sold increased 9% year-over-year due to increased Yahoo property supply, especially in our core verticals sold to our programmatic channels and continued growth in our native syndication business. 
PPA declined 15% year-over-year caused by continued pressure on our premium business and the ongoing mix shift to programmatic channels and data formats. Display revenue ex-TAC was $396 million. America display revenue ex-TAC was flat year-over-year and globally excluding the impact from exits, revenue ex-TAC was approximately flat year-over-year as well. GAAP Mavens revenue, as Marissa noted, was $504 million and excluding the impact of the change of revenue presentation, GAAP Mavens revenue was $385 million, down 4% year-over-year. And excluding video, Mavens would have been modestly up year-over-year.
Gab Mobile revenue was $370 million. Excluding the impact of change of revenue presentation, GAAP mobile revenue was $259 million or up 3% year-over-year. [indiscernible] revenue ex-TAC declined 40% year-over-year due primarily to the ending of the Alibaba-related fees last September, resulting in a headwind of approximately $70 million. We had modest reductions in other listings and fees businesses. 
Now let's take a couple of minutes to go through our expenses and income in a bit more detail. Non-GAAP total operating expense were down 40% year-over-year. Depreciation and amortization was down $21 million and $133 million, benefiting from lower capital expenditures and a one-off of intangible amortization. 
Our non-GAAP cash expenses for the full quarter came in better than our expectations at $669 million, [indiscernible] approximately $112 million year-over-year. This was primarily driven by: $61 million in workforce expense through net reduction of approximately 2,100 active employees year-over-year; $22 million from content deals and marketing; $13 million of streamlining our real estate and IT infrastructure; and $16 million in T&E and outside services.
With the major restructuring actions behind us, our focus shifts to ensure the effectiveness of our cost structure and driving growth through our key initiatives for search, media and communications. And we delivered adjusted EBITDA of $172 million in Q2, above our guidance range, with the sequential margin improvement of 300 basis points. 
Now running on the income statement, earnings and equity interest were $52 million. This is lower than prior quarters but simply reflects our share of Yahoo Japan's results for the prior quarter. Our non-GAAP tax rate is 35%. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.09. Ending diluted share count for the period ended at 951 million.
In terms of balance sheet, I'd first like to cover our impairment charges. In Q2, we recorded noncash goodwill impairment charge of $395 million and noncash intangibles impairment charge of $87 million related to The goodwill intangibles impairment charge resulted from a combination of factors, including decreases in our projected Tumblr operating results and estimated future cash flows. 
Now looking to the balance sheet, at the end of Q2, we had $7.7 billion in cash and marketable securities or $6.3 billion net of convertible and other debt. This change in cash balance of $535 million from Q1 to Q2 was primarily driven by free cash flow of $426 million, by a dividend of $157 million from Yahoo Japan, offset by tax withholding from stock-based compensation of $49 million.
[indiscernible] guidance contributing to improved cash flow include: lower CapEx spending of $76 million in line with Q1; and the sale of Santa Clara land, which netted $246 million of cash.
Now let me cover guidance. We are reaffirming our annual guidance in EBITDA in revenue ex-TAC, recognizing that we have overachieved on EBITDA in the first half and have good momentum entering the second half. At this point, given the likely transactional effects that are difficult to predict, we do not feel it prudent to adjust our annual guidance range for revenue ex-TAC and EBITDA. 
And as discussed earlier, GAAP revenue is now impacted by the change in revenue presentation related to the Microsoft agreement. We estimate the impact of this change to be approximately $250 million per quarter in the second half of 2016. 
Given this change and to reflect our trends in Q2 and entering Q3, we are adjusting our full year guidance range for GAAP revenue to $4.9 billion to $5.1 billion. For Q3 guidance, we expect the following: GAAP revenue in the range of $1.275 billion to $1.325 billion; TAC of approximately $440 million; revenue ex-TAC in the range of $840 million to $880 million; adjusted EBITDA in the range of $190 million to $220 million; and non-GAAP operating income in the range of $65 million to $95 million. 
In closing, through excellent management of cost and capital, we had a strong first half and achieved above the high end of our guidance on EBITDA and significantly increased our cash flow. We bring that focus into the second half of 2016 and will continue to prioritize our efforts behind the most significant drivers of engagement growth in advertisers with demand. With that, Marissa and I would like to take your questions. Shibani?"

When we look at our day of the game, we're seeing really nice solid numbers and users who are repeating and coming back each day to see those games overall. And in terms of the participation from advertisers, our advertisers are really demanding premium placements for video where they can reach a broad reach over a particular demographic or user site. And so these particular live streaming opportunities, because they're so focused on sports or finance, have a really desirable audience with no demographics and really offer our advertisers really premium placement in terms of the types of brand advertisements or commercials they like to run in digital video."

I think there are 3 components that I would point to because I think as we look at our PPA [indiscernible] over time and had to make predictions about when they can return to positive, the positive factors there are video, which generally prices at a premium to banner advertisements and/or native advertisements. Mobile, we today make less money on our Mobile traffic than we do on our desktop traffic on a CPM basis. We don't think that necessarily has to be the case, and we think that we're very close to seeing a crossover point there where we can make more money in our Mobile traffic but that remains an opportunity in terms of where we could go with the PPA. And we continue to see pressures as we see unfavorable mix shift from premium to programmatic. And we do think that we've transitioned a lot of our inventory from the premium sales channels as well as the managed network sales channels into our exchange and that DSP business and really being bought on a real-time bidding business as a get to the national equilibrium of how much of our inventor is sold and programmatic, we do actually think we'll see price increases. So I think we'll start to see turns on the programmatic pricing and start -- stop seeing as much drag from that legacy shift inside of the next 4 quarters. So inside the next year, we'll start to see price appreciation in our banner advertisements and the programmatic piece. Video, as we mentioned, we've had a lot of new supply but we have been finding good demand for our O&O video, less demand for the managed network piece and the third-party video. And so here we really think it's about finding that demand, bringing those television dollars, and so they're not only bidding on to our O&O inventory, but they're also bidding into our third-party network. But right now, because of there's been so much additional supply coming in on video and not only to hear but across industry, there's been price pressure on video Display that I think it's a very premium unit. And on Mobile, we have done a lot of hard work around cost per install ads, new ad formats, really looking what's happening in the competitive landscape in terms of how do we make mobile ads really work for advertisers. And we saw a lot of progress there. As I mentioned in my comments, we've seen 4x as much engagement -- sorry, 4x as much achievement of campaign goals with our advertisers based on some changes we made to our algorithms on mobile, cost per install ads, and we anticipate that would increase. And so we're hopeful the point of our strategic plan is to really unlock additional opportunity in mobile monetization yet this year. So with programmatic, I think next 4 quarters, video is when the supply really stabilizes and Mobile really matter half of this year."

I think that on the whole, depending on how you measure it either on revenue or an impression basis, I believe impression basis is about 70%. Non-excess of that is now being sold through programmatic channels. And so overall, we feel that it was important for us to take our inventory and shift it into these programmatic channels to really catch that wave despite the fact that it did cause pressure on our PPA but allowed those inventory chefs have now happened, and we still experience of legacy drag. I'm told that it's somewhere on the order now about $20 million a quarter, where that used to be at times almost $100 million a quarter or more of pricing pressure being introduced by mix shift to programmatic."

And from that -- to that, and that's why we really focused on digital video because we can see the types of budgets that advertises deploy the type of which is that they want that comes from the broadcast television media, and we can see these offer something like that but even more measurable, even more targeted than you can get in the television buy from and unique advantages in buying online. And so that's why we've been focused in increasing our video engagement and growing our network and third-party as well as really working with advertisers to help them to help understand what it would take to transition some of those brand dollars off of television and into digital video. This is some of the experience with streaming and some of the unique content that we've had has really gotten a long way in helping us understand the overall criteria how they're going to think about that spend how they are going to measure ROI, et cetera, and we've been lighting up our products to benefit from that."

First off, the Mobile app engagement that we see on Tumblr is growing really nicely. Are seeing growth in signed in users and overall seeing a lot of the user's engagement in the Mobile app. It's nearing 90% of our daily active users are now engaging with the application on our phone in addition to desktop. In terms of the revenue side, we've taken various different approaches over the past year or 2 in terms of how we activated the sales were sent have we've gone to market. In particular, this quarter, we have made some good improvements. We've doubled down on Gemini, and so we are working hard to bring our Gemini formats into Tumblr. We think that they will monetize very well and provide good results for advertisers and really attractive format of advertising, both for the advertisers as well as for the community on Tumblr. But one of the things that's happening is our supply, because it's growing so quickly, is outpacing demand and is causing this monetization shortfall. So we've worked to introduce more Gemini demand. We think that the ad load in Tumblr is appropriate. It's really about being the demented. Towards the end of Q2, we activated the Facebook ad network also known as part of our backfill efforts in order to bring more advertisements to fill that ad load on Tumblr. And we also started to bring to bear some of our exchange efforts in terms of our classic displays as [indiscernible] rectangle ads or this call is being recorded ads on to Tumblr and appropriate cases. And so this may be at lower prices because there's not as much demand [indiscernible] supply. Overall, we think that we're bringing -- or activating the right demand channels to address the fact supply has been outpacing demand. And on Mozilla, this not a lot more that I can see because it is a confidential relationship. But we didn't want to point out because I think it has been misunderstood at least in some of the analysis I've seen. It has been misunderstood that there is some indication in the contract that ultimately would reduce some of our exposure and liabilities."

For my portion of today's call, I'll cover our Q2 performance as well as an update against our 2016 strategic plan.Before we jump into the quarter, I want to briefly address the strategic alternatives",2714,"Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. For my portion of today's call, I'll cover our Q2 performance as well as an update against our 2016 strategic plan.
Before we jump into the quarter, I want to briefly address the strategic alternatives process, which continues to be top of mind for shareholders and is a top priority for our board and management team. Although we have no announcement today, I want to restate our commitment to delivering shareholder value with this process. By separating Yahoo's operating business from our equity stake in Alibaba, there is substantial value that we can potentially unlock.
To that end, the right transaction could strategically and efficiently achieve such a separation. Our board's independent strategic review committee, which is leading a well-run robust process, continues to manage this effort. And we are making great progress. While we have no announcement today, I can say we are deep into the process of evaluating proposals and alternatives and will update our shareholders as soon as is prudent.
In parallel, we continue to strengthen our operating business through the execution of our 2016 strategic plan. As I've said before, our plan complements the strategic alternatives process and is important to maximize the value of Yahoo in any scenario.
With that, let's turn to our business updates for the quarter. In Q2, we delivered $1,308,000,000 of GAAP revenue and $841 million of ex-TAC revenue, meeting the high end of our ex-TAC guidance. Our GAAP revenue presentation has changed this quarter. This is due to a required change stemming from the implementation of the 11th amendment of our Microsoft Search Agreement last April. Per the agreement, we transitioned our exclusive sales responsibilities for premium advertisers to Microsoft. Our GAAP revenue will now track gross search revenue both this quarter and in the future. Ken will elaborate in further detail about this GAAP revenue presentation change.
Our adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP operating income both exceeded our guidance range, coming in at $172 million and $39 million, respectively. Our overall performance in Q2 reflects the hard work of Yahoo's employees to drive value for our users, advertisers and shareholders. Our team demonstrated excellent teamwork in implementing our strategic plan and delivering this quarter's results. We faced a lot of adversity and uncertainty throughout this quarter, and Yahoo showed resolve and resilience to deliver in line with our expectations.
With that, let's turn to our 2016 strategic plan. The first focus of our plan is to play to our strengths to grow user engagement on Yahoo's 3 global platforms: Search, Mail and Tumblr; and 4 core verticals: News, Sports, Finance and Lifestyles.
Starting with Search. With Search making up more than half of our GAAP revenue, it remains an important area of our business. Today, our search business is built on strong partnerships with Microsoft, Google, Mozilla, Apple and Oracle, among others. Our partnerships with Google and Microsoft remain strong, and we continue to improve performance and monetization on Yahoo Gemini search ads. We also continue to leverage all 3 platforms to compete for traffic in order to deliver the best quality search experience to our users. We're pleased that Yahoo Gemini search performs particularly well on mobile.
We anticipate that much of the innovation in Search will incur in the form of mobile assistance. Examples of others entering what we call the mobile assistance space include Alexa from Amazon or M from Facebook. This quarter, we launched early but important experiments in the areas of conversational interfaces, personal assistance and real-time answers, which we believe can be important differentiators for us in the mobile assistance space.
Also related to our search business, I wanted to take a moment to address some questions surrounding our Mozilla partnership. Mozilla is a very important partner to Yahoo in Search. We have built strong relationships with the Mozilla team, and we are closely engaged with them. While we would certainly like to continue the partnership regardless of our strategic alternatives process, should Mozilla choose not to, our agreement does provide for certain mitigations, which will reduce our exposure. Ultimately, it remains in our mutual best interest to maintain a healthy path forward, and we do hope to do just that.
Next, as you know, Yahoo Mail drives significant user engagement and revenue. For every dollar generated on Yahoo Mail, we see roughly $3 of incremental revenue across the network. Over the past 4 years I spent at Yahoo, I've watched our team completely rebuild Yahoo Mail from the ground up. And today, not only is it incredibly stable, reliable with great spam protection, but Yahoo Mail for iOS and for Android is the highest rated e-mail client, consistently achieving 4.5 stars in the App Store and on Google Play. And with over 7 million additional mailboxes now connected through IMAP in, we're reaching even more users outside of Yahoo with our best-in-class features.
With Tumblr, we've relentlessly focused on mobile engagement, and we're seeing good growth in engagement with signed-in users, particularly on mobile. This past quarter, we made enhancements to our popular GIF maker and launched Live Video posts to allow users to broadcast videos live to their followers. As we continue to strengthen our mobile creative tools, we've seen great traction with 84% of our daily average users active on mobile devices.
For our core verticals, we made solid progress with launches across News, Sports, Finance and Lifestyles. This quarter, we continued to bring together passionate communities of like-minded users, offered personalized content with even more video and empowered our users with engagement tools and utilities to enhance our News experience.
For example, as the U.K. contemplated the Brexit vote, users turned to Yahoo to follow 37 hours of continuous live updates that resulted in the highest number of users on Yahoo Finance in 4 years. And when news broke of Prince's passing earlier this spring, Yahoo experienced an unprecedented surge in traffic with the highest load on the site seen in the last 7 years. This illustrates once again that the Internet turns to Yahoo for the most accurate, fastest and most in-depth information on any breaking news. Overall, our investment in News have resulted in solid user engagement metrics and really highlight the power of Yahoo as a trusted news source.
In terms of product improvements, we leverage our learnings from the Yahoo Homepage last quarter -- launched last quarter as we've updated News, Sports and Finance on desktop with one consistent look and feel for a cleaner, faster and more personalized experience.
We also recently launched updated apps for Yahoo Sports and Yahoo Finance that bring video front and center. We've doubled down on Live Video with NBA exclusives on THE VERTICAL with Woj and began live streaming MLB's Game of the Day on Yahoo Sports as well as live coverage of key financial events, including the first-ever global live stream of the Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting that generated 1.8 million live streams and over 8 million views on demand on Yahoo Finance.
And for Lifestyles, Polyvore was recognized with a Webby for the best mobile site and app for lifestyle for engaging and inspiring style lovers around the world. Additionally, we continue to integrate Polyvore across Yahoo's network with Polyvore-powered product listing ads running in Gemini native display ad inventory. Polyvore surpasses operational goals and is EBITDA accretive. While the results are small in the overall picture for Yahoo, they have been an excellent investment due to their fit with our products and their excellent team.
For our advertisers, we fully committed to delivering solid ROI with innovative, simplified ad products and top tier client services. On Gemini, we rolled out a new mobile serving algorithm and now see 4x as many clients, meeting our advertising goals for app install campaigns. And on BrightRoll, both our DSP and Exchange businesses continue to gain traction and produce meaningful revenue.
Through Ad Tech, Yahoo continues to deliver a unique value that provides superior ads, data and user experiences for all advertisers. We also introduced Yahoo Tiles, a new mobile ad format with dynamic and interactive features in native video and display, and Yahoo Storytellers as a new content marketing studio, which leverages Yahoo's editorial expertise, extensive data and Gemini native to create engaging premium content. While still nascent, we're pleased to see positive reception from advertisers and active engagement from our early partners.
As our advertising products and sales operations are closely tied to revenue performance, let's move to our second focus: driving Mavens revenue growth. Mavens, which stands for mobile, video, native and social, represent the fastest-growing areas of digital advertising and are key areas of investment for us. These business lines were nascent at Yahoo in 2012 with essentially no revenue and lack of product focus in these areas.
Going back even further, recall that Yahoo's early market lead in digital advertising was based heavily on desktop banner ads. As the industry shifted over time to favor mobile and programmatic advertising, Yahoo has had one of the largest legacy businesses to modernize and transform. Our investments in Mavens offset legacy business declines and have helped build a solid foundation for Yahoo's future.
In Q2, we delivered $504 million in Mavens GAAP revenue. Excluding the Microsoft accounting impact, this equates to a 4% decrease year-over-year. Holding video aside, Mavens would have shown modest growth, roughly in line with our expectations. In video, we experienced pricing pressure and general demand issues in our third-party ad network. We attribute some of these challenges to uncertainty around the ongoing strategic alternatives process.
Video on Yahoo's properties, however, was a highlight, with the growth in supply and revenue as we continue to invest in bringing video-rich experiences across our offerings like the new rollouts that I mentioned in News, Sports and Finance. This investment has significantly increased video engagement on our properties and thus also our ad supply.
Our O&O video revenue grew 108% year-over-year. Mavens is a key part of our strategy, our growth and our turnaround story, and we will work very hard to get the Mavens collectively back to growth in the second half of the year.
Let's take a deeper look at the other areas of Mavens. On mobile, we delivered $378 million in revenue -- in GAAP revenue, representing a 3% year-over-year increase. With our redesigned apps and ad units on mobile, we're optimistic that our continued focus on building the greatest mobile experiences for our users and advertisers will continue to bear fruit.
For video, while we've already discussed the overall impact on Mavens revenue this quarter, we are seeing promising signs of engagement with an 88% year-over-year boost of total video streams globally. As we continue into the second half of the year, we remain focused on growing our video business, specifically with O&O supply and Gemini video on the BrightRoll DSP and Exchange.
On native, we aim to grow demand by improving both product performance and advertiser satisfaction. We improved the mechanics of our algorithm to optimize campaign performance, and we are pleased to see positive advertiser response with our Gemini native advertiser base growing 25% in the last quarter.
And on social, we made strides on our Tumblr platform to enhance ad serving and increase supply with Gemini to improve Tumblr's monetization potential. With these ad experience enhancements, we are seeing twice as many Tumblr users engaging with ads compared to last year.
We'll continue our focus on Mavens to maximize growth and to win our share of these fast-growing areas of digital advertising. As we rounded the last 2 areas on our strategic plan, we're doing exactly what we said we would: simplifying the business and efficiently aligning our resources. We announced that we would retire products that either failed to meet our growth goals or did not fit strategically with Yahoo's future.
Most products we committed to shutting down have already been sunset, and we recently announced that we will also be retiring Yahoo Recommends and the legacy Yahoo Messenger product by the end of Q3. Yahoo Messenger remains an important communications tool, and we encourage all legacy Messenger users to switch to the new Yahoo Messenger for more modern, secure and feature-rich experience.
In addition to our products, we also identified ways to unlock value for our shareholders through nonstrategic assets, including real estate and intellectual property. As we mentioned during our shareholder meeting, we recently closed on the $250 million sale of our Santa Clara real estate, a parcel of land close to our Sunnyvale headquarters.
And our strategic plan identified ways to maximize the value of over 4,000 patents and patent applications from our global portfolio. Over the past 21 years, Yahoo has grown a vast, valuable and foundational intellectual property portfolio covering technologies including search, advertising, cloud, mobile, web and more.
As our businesses evolve, we've outgrown the need for certain intellectual property. That portfolio, which we've identified and titled Excalibur, represents a unique opportunity to acquire pioneering patents. Our strategic review committee is overseeing exploration of these options, including the sale of the portfolio as a whole or retaining the RemainCo to use strategically or to monetize. Moving forward, we'll keep all of our -- we'll keep all IP that is core to our business and will have a license back to the Excalibur portfolio as we have done with other divestitures.
Finally, we also announced a series of changes to ensure that every product counts, every market matters and every employee's efforts drive excellence, competitiveness and profitability. As the end -- as of the end of Q2, we completed the 6 planned office closures in Buenos Aires, Burbank, Dubai, Madrid, Mexico and Milan. And we've met our commitment to reduce our workforce by 15%.
As of the end of the quarter, our active headcount stands at 8,800 employees and 700 contractors. This represents a reduction of approximately 45% since I started in 2012. Our headcount has returned to 2005 levels.
In terms of cost reduction, we continue to make meaningful progress towards our savings target to improve profitability. We reduced non-GAAP cash expenses by 14% year-over-year and reduced capital spend by 50% year-over-year. Prior to Q2 2016, the last quarter our non-GAAP cash expenses were this low was Q3 2006, almost 10 years ago. We're now running the company at the lowest cost structure and with the smallest headcount in a decade. As you can see from our business updates, we continue to run the company efficiently and responsibly.
Before I turn over to Ken, I want to share a few closing thoughts. We set forth a plan to return this iconic company to growth over multiple years, one that will create long-term sustainable growth for Yahoo and deliver value to our users, advertisers, employees and shareholders. We took a hard honest look at where we were and where we wanted to be and have taken necessary steps to get there.
From building a mobile team from the ground up to modernizing and simplifying our digital advertising strategy and products and creating a brand-new Mavens business, these efforts are just a few of the achievements that have delivered the far stronger, more modern Yahoo of today.
This quarter has not been without its unique set of challenges, but above all, we've kept true to our commitment to deliver the results laid out in our strategic plan. Our refreshed products are yielding stronger engagement. We continue to focus on our investments in mobile, video, native and social. Our business is dramatically simplified, and we've continued to manage costs while efficiently running the company.
I remain confident that these are the right steps to create a better Yahoo. I'm very proud of the team for focusing on the task at hand despite a lot of distraction and uncertainty and pulling together as a team to deliver this quarter's results.
As we work to conclude the strategic alternatives process, this groundwork will serve as a solid foundation for Yahoo's next chapter. I'm proud of what this company has achieved over these past 4 years. I remain committed to our team and our company, and I continue to be optimistic and passionate about the future of Yahoo. Thank you, and over to you, Ken."

Today, I would like to discuss our solid execution over the first half of the year against our 2016 strategic plan and the prior guidance we have provided.Through excelle",1888,"Well, thanks, Marissa, and good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, I would like to discuss our solid execution over the first half of the year against our 2016 strategic plan and the prior guidance we have provided.
Through excellent expenditure management of our cost and capital, we achieved above the high end of our guidance of adjusted EBITDA and significantly increased cash flow. Additionally, I will discuss the required change in the revenue presentation related to the Eleventh Amendment to the Microsoft Search Agreement. I will later close with outlook going forward, inclusive of this impact.
As Marissa noted, we do not have specific updates in our strategic alternatives update, but we will -- but we understand this is top of mind of our shareholders. We are working expeditiously with our board and strategic review committee, and I can assure you it's the top priority for all of us.
In Q2, we delivered revenue ex-TAC and profitability results near the higher -- above -- or the higher end of our guidance range, delivering our planned commitments for revenue and demonstrated exceptional cost control. Revenue ex-TAC of $841 million resulted from stable performances on display properties driven by solid performance on Mail, which offset continued softness in Search volume.
We had another good quarter of cost target achievement and cash generation, delivering an adjusted EBITDA of $172 million and free cash flow of $426 million. We are focused in taking actions to reduce cost as well as increase cash throughout the quarter.
Our non-GAAP cash expenses were $669 million, down 14% year-over-year or $112 million, ahead of our planned targets. This was primarily driven by lower headcount numbers through planned actions and attrition as we ended the quarter at 8,800 active employees, down approximately 2,100 year-over-year.
Our focus has shifted to the effectiveness of our cost structure, for example, in the areas of IT infrastructure, content spend, sales and support and G&A. Through the first half of the year, we increased our cash balance by over $800 million from both operating improvements and monetization efforts, including $776 million of cash from operating activities for the first 6 months. This includes positive adjusted EBITDA of $319 million, $157 million dividend from Yahoo Japan in the second quarter and also reflects the ongoing working capital improvements to improve collections and the receipt of $190 million tax refund in first quarter.
Capital expenditures over this period of $152 million, which were down 43% year-over-year, as we continued our disciplined approach to capital spend. And the sale of Santa Clara land for net cash proceeds of $246 million as part of our noncore asset monetization efforts. This has resulted in a very strong balance sheet with nearly $7.7 billion in cash and marketable securities.
We will continue to look for ways to generate cash through operations and asset monetization to deliver tangible and demonstrable value to our shareholders. We have heard shareholder input and feedback and understand the importance of capital allocation and delivering value for our shareholders and look forward to sharing more information at the appropriate time, taking into account our strategic review process. We will remain focused on ways to drive revenue, reduce cost, improve cash flows and prudently allocate capital, maximizing value for our shareholders.
Before going through operating results for the quarter, I want to discuss required change of revenue presentation related to the Eleventh Amendment to the Microsoft Search Agreement. Pursuant to the amendment, we completed the transition of our exclusive sale responsibilities to Microsoft for Microsoft's paid search services to premium advertisers in the United States, Canada and Europe on April 1, 2016, and other markets on June 1, 2016.
Following this transition, Yahoo is now considered principal in the sale of search traffic to Microsoft in the transition markets. And as a result, we recognize search Affiliate revenues on a gross basis rather than net basis in those markets. This resulted in an increase to search GAAP revenue and cost of revenue TAC of $252 million in the second quarter as amounts paid to Affiliates are recorded as TAC rather than as a reduction to GAAP revenue. TAC in the non-transition markets of Taiwan and Hong Kong will continue to be recorded as a reduction to revenue. For further clarification, this change in revenue presentation does not impact revenue ex-TAC or profit. Please refer to Table 12 on the slide deck for illustrative example of the change.
Now let's run through our second quarter financial results in more detail. And once again, I will focus most of the discussion around non-GAAP results. These exclude: a noncash goodwill intangible impairment charge of $482 million that we recorded this quarter that I will provide more detail around this later in the call; secondly, $120 million gain on sale of the Santa Clara land; stock-based compensation expense of $132 million, up sequentially due to a full quarter retention cost and factoring in our first half performance in executing our plan; and finally, restructuring charges of $19 million, advisory fees of $15 million and $2 million noncash loss on our Hortonworks warrants.
Our financial results for Q2 can be seen on Slide 5. GAAP revenue was $1.308 billion and traffic acquisition costs were $466 million. As I mentioned earlier, $252 million of the GAAP revenue and TAC was due to the required change of revenue presentation related to the Microsoft agreement. Excluding this impact, GAAP revenue was $1.055 billion, down 15% year-over-year; revenue ex-TAC of $840 million -- $841 million.
Taking a closer look at search. GAAP search revenue was $711 million. But excluding the impact of the change in revenue presentation, GAAP search revenue decreased by 13% year-over-year.
Search click-driven revenue declined 18% year-over-year. Paid Clicks declined 24%, driven primarily by overall traffic trends across Yahoo Properties, Affiliates and partners and especially on desktop where volume remains challenged. Search PPC grew 8% year-over-year, mostly as a result of mix shift to its higher monetizing segments.
We have made good progress optimizing our advertising performance across our 3 marketplaces: Gemini, Bing and Google. Search revenue ex-TAC of $319 million declined 24% year-over-year, driven primarily by the declines in Paid Clicks and increasing payments -- partner payments as a percentage of revenue.
Now moving to display. GAAP display revenue was $470 million, down 7% year-over-year. Display ads sold increased 9% year-over-year due to increased Yahoo Properties supply, especially in our core verticals, sold through our programmatic channels and continued growth in our native syndication business.
PPA declined 15% year-over-year caused by continued pressure on our premium business and the ongoing mix shift to programmatic channels and data formats. Display revenue ex-TAC was $396 million. America display revenue ex-TAC was flat year-over-year. And globally, excluding the impact from exits, revenue ex-TAC was approximately flat year-over-year as well.
GAAP Mavens revenue, as Marissa noted, was $504 million. And excluding the impact of the change of revenue presentation, GAAP Mavens revenue was $385 million, down 4% year-over-year. And excluding video, Mavens would have been modestly up year-over-year.
GAAP mobile revenue was $378 million. And excluding the impact of the change of revenue presentation, GAAP mobile revenue was $259 million or up 3% year-over-year.
And other revenue ex-TAC declined 40% year-over-year due primarily to the ending of the Alibaba-related fees last September, resulting in a headwind of approximately $70 million, and modest reductions in other listings and fees businesses.
Now let's take a couple of minutes to go through our expenses and income in a bit more detail. Non-GAAP total operating expenses were down 40% year-over-year. Depreciation and amortization was down $21 million and $133 million, benefiting from lower capital expenditures and a one-off of intangible amortization.
Our non-GAAP cash expenses for the full quarter came in better than our expectations at $669 million, declining approximately $112 million year-over-year. This was primarily driven by: $61 million in workforce expense through net reduction of approximately 2,100 active employees year-over-year; $22 million from content deals and marketing; $13 million of streamlining our real estate and IT infrastructure; and $16 million in T&E and outside services.
With the major restructuring actions behind us, our focus shifts to ensuring the effectiveness of our cost structure and driving growth through our key initiatives for search, media and communications. And we delivered adjusted EBITDA of $172 million in Q2, above our guidance range, with the sequential margin improvement of 300 basis points.
Now rounding out the income statement. Earnings in equity interest were $52 million. This is lower than prior quarters, but it simply reflects our share of Yahoo Japan's results for the prior quarter. And our non-GAAP tax rate is 35%. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.09. Ending diluted share count for the period ended at 951 million.
In terms of balance sheet, I'd first like to cover our impairment charges. In Q2, we recorded noncash goodwill impairment charge of $395 million and noncash intangibles impairment charge of $87 million related to Tumblr. The goodwill intangibles impairment charge resulted from a combination of factors, including decreases in our projected Tumblr operating results and estimated future cash flows.
Now looking to the balance sheet. At the end of Q2, we had $7.7 billion in cash and marketable securities or $6.3 billion net of convertible and other debt. This change in cash balance of $535 million from Q1 to Q2 was primarily driven by free cash flow of $426 million and a dividend of $157 million from Yahoo Japan, offset by tax withholding from stock-based compensation of $49 million.
Some of the guidance contributing to improved cash flow include: lower CapEx spending of $76 million, in line with Q1; and the sale of Santa Clara land, which netted $246 million of cash.
Now let me cover guidance. We are reaffirming our annual guidance in EBITDA and revenue ex-TAC, recognizing that we have overachieved on EBITDA in the first half and have good momentum entering the second half. At this point, given the likely transactional effects that are difficult to predict, we do not feel it prudent to adjust our annual guidance range for revenue ex-TAC and EBITDA.
And as discussed earlier, GAAP revenue is now impacted by the change in revenue presentation related to the Microsoft agreement. We estimate the impact of this change to be approximately $250 million per quarter in the second half of 2016.
Given this change and to reflect our trends in Q2 and entering Q3, we are adjusting our full year guidance range for GAAP revenue to $4.9 billion to $5.1 billion. For Q3 guidance, we expect the following: GAAP revenue in the range of $1.275 billion to $1.325 billion; TAC of approximately $440 million; revenue ex-TAC in the range of $840 million to $880 million; adjusted EBITDA in the range of $190 million to $220 million; and non-GAAP operating income in the range of $65 million to $95 million.
In closing, through excellent expenditure management of cost and capital, we had a strong first half and achieved above the high end of our guidance on EBITDA and significantly increased our cash flow. We bring that focus into the second half of 2016, and we'll continue to prioritize our efforts behind the most significant drivers of engagement growth in advertisers with demand. With that, Marissa and I would like to take your questions. Shibani?"

As you pointed out, we have partnerships for live streaming in place with the NHL during their active season, NBA as well as PGA.

And as we did the NBA Draft, Woj on THE VERTICAL to both the live draft show as well as various live follow-up shows. Overall, we're seeing tremendous engagement. We saw, I believe, 1.8 million unique viewers on the Berkshire Hathaway stream. When we look at our day of the game, we're seeing really nice solid numbers and users who are repeating and coming back each day to see those games overall. And in terms of the participation from advertisers, our advertisers are really demanding premium placements for video where they can reach a broad reach over a particular demographic or user site. And so these particular live streaming opportunities, because they're so focused on sports or finance, have a really desirable audience with no demographics and really offer our advertisers really premium placement in terms of the types of brand advertisements or commercials they like to run in digital video."

I think there are 3 components that I would point to because I think as we looked at our PPA and studied it over time and had to make predictions about when they can return to positive, the positive factors there are video, which generally prices at a premium to, say, banner advertisements and/or native advertisements. Mobile, we today make less money on our mobile traffic than we do on our desktop traffic on a CPM basis. We don't think that necessarily has to be the case, and we think that we're very close to seeing a crossover point there where we can make as much, if not more, money on our mobile traffic. But that remains an opportunity in terms of where we could go with the PPA. And we continue to see pressures as we see unfavorable mix shift from premium to programmatic. And we do think that we've transitioned a lot of our inventory from the premium sales channels as well as the managed network sales channels into our Exchange and that DSP business and really being bought on a real-time bidding basis. And so as we get to the natural equilibrium of how much of our inventory is sold in programmatic, we do actually think we'll see price increases. So I think we'll start to see turns on the programmatic pricing and start -- stop seeing as much drag from that legacy shift inside of the next 4 quarters. So inside the next year, we'll start to see price appreciation in our banner advertisements and the classic programmatic piece. Video, as we mentioned, we've had a lot of new supply. But we have been finding good demand for our O&O video, less demand for the managed network piece and the third-party video. And so here, we really think it's about finding that demand, bringing those television dollars. And so they're not only bidding on to our O&O inventory, but they're also bidding into our third-party network. But right now, because there's been so much additional supply coming in on video, and that's not only true here but across the industry, there's been price pressure on video display with the fact that it's a very premium unit. And on mobile, we have done a lot of hard work around cost per install ads, new ad formats, really looking at what's happening in the competitive landscape in terms of how do we make mobile ads really work for our advertisers. And we saw a lot of progress there. As I mentioned in my comments, we've seen 4x as much engagement -- sorry, 4x as much achievement of campaign goals with our advertisers based on some changes we made to our algorithms on mobile, cost per install ads, and we anticipate that would increase. And so we're hopeful. Certainly the point of our strategic plan is to really unlock additional opportunity in mobile monetization yet this year. So with programmatic, I think within the next 4 quarters, video is when the supply really stabilizes. And mobile, I really hope, is in the latter half of this year."

So we have a really robust offering in managed network, setting aside premium inventory both on our site and other sites in advance and really running those impressions at a premium. We, overall, want to see a lot more activity in the real-time bidding channel. And our Exchange this quarter was particularly strong. We're seeing a lot of real-time bidding efforts on our Exchange from other DSPs and other providers and other third parties.

Our Daily Fantasy, which was introduced last summer, has also shown a lot of traction. And we've also worked over the past quarter to make changes to it to ultimately help it sidestep some of the current controversy. We've really gotten very focused on Fair Play being more transparent, fun, trustworthy. So for example, if there's some professional participants who are coming in and entering almost every contest or putting multiple entries into a single contest, that's now noted on our interface. So you really get a sense for who you're playing against, what their style of play is and whether or not this is someone who is playing for fun or playing professionally. And that ultimately really helps us make the game more in the spirit that is intended of really being fun and entertaining, and as I said, sidestepping some of the controversies.

When we look at the landscape, one thing we see is TV dollars are shifting to digital, and they are shifting into social in particular. That said, not unlike other shifts that have happened with advertising dollars in the past, it is lagging where the actual users and the actual -- the eyeballs and consumers are. So for example, we know that digital video surpassed television last year, or at least as high, in time spent in all digital devices, including digital video, surpassed television last year in terms of time spent here in the United States. That said, we still are seeing more money spent on television than we're seeing spend in digital media. And so we think that over time that will follow, the advertising dollars will follow where the users are spending their time. But it's not unusual to see a lag like that. And from that -- to that end, that's why we've really focused on digital video, because we can see the types of budgets that advertisers deploy, the type of reach that they want that comes from the broadcast television media. And we can see that we need to offer something like that but even more measurable, even more targeted than you can get in that television platform and there's unique advantages in buying online. And so that's why we've been focused in increasing our video engagement and growing our network and third party as well as really working with advertisers to help them -- to help understand what would it take to transition some of those brand dollars off of television and into digital video. This is some of the experiments we've done with live streaming, and some of the unique content that we've had has really gone a long way in helping us understand the overall criteria, how they're going to think about that spend, how they're going to measure ROI, et cetera. And we've been lining up our products to benefit from that."

First off, the mobile app engagement that we see on Tumblr is growing really nicely. We're seeing growth in signed-in users, and we're overall seeing a lot of the users' engagement in the mobile app. I believe it's nearing 90% of our daily active users are now engaging with the application on their phone in addition to desktop. In terms of the revenue side, we've taken various different approaches over the past year or 2 in terms of how we've activated the sales force and how we've gone to market. In particular, this quarter, we have made some good improvements. We've doubled down on Gemini, and so we are working hard to bring our Gemini formats into Tumblr. We think that they will monetize very well and provide good results for advertisers. There are really attractive format of advertising both for the advertisers as well as for the community on Tumblr. But one of the things that's happening is our supply, because it's growing so quickly, is outpacing demand and is causing this monetization shortfall. So we've worked to introduce more Gemini demand. We think that the ad load in Tumblr is appropriate. It's really about bringing the demand to bear there. Towards the end of Q2, we activated the Facebook ad network, also known as FAN, as part of our backfill efforts in order to bring more advertisements to fill that ad load on Tumblr. And we also started to bring to bear some of our Exchange efforts in terms of our classic displays. So it's most known as our large rectangle ads or LREC ads onto Tumblr in appropriate places. And so while this may be at lower prices because there's not as much demand to keep up with supply, overall, we think that we're bringing -- we're activating the right demand channels to address the fact that supply has been outpacing demand. And on Mozilla, there's not a lot more that I can say because it is a confidential relationship. But we did want to point out because I think it has been misunderstood at least in some of the analysis I've seen. It has been misunderstood that there is some indication in the contract that ultimately would reduce some of our exposure and liabilities."

As we look at the sheer number of dollars, it looks possible to me that we could see increases in prices and video really pricing at a premium, in particular the banners or even native.

For my portion of today's call, I'll cover our Q2 performance as well as an update against our 2016 strategic plan.
Before we jump into the quarter, I want to briefly address the strategic alternatives process, which continues to be top of mind for shareholders and is a top priority for our board and management team. Although we have no announcement today, I want to restate our commitment to delivering shareholder value with this process. By separating Yahoo's operating business from our equity stake in Alibaba, there is substantial value that we can potentially unlock.
To that end, the right transaction could strategically and efficiently achieve such a separation. Our board's independent strategic review committee, which is leading a well-run robust process, continues to manage this effort. And we are making great progress. While we have no announcement today, I can say we are deep into the process of evaluating proposals and alternatives and will update our shareholders as soon as is prudent.
In parallel, we continue to strengthen our operating business through the execution of our 2016 strategic plan. As I've said before, our plan complements the strategic alternatives process and is important to maximize the value of Yahoo in any scenario.
With that, let's turn to our business updates for the quarter. In Q2, we delivered $1,308,000,000 of GAAP revenue and $841 million of ex-TAC revenue, meeting the high end of our ex-TAC guidance. Our GAAP revenue presentation has changed this quarter. This is due to a required change stemming from the implementation of the 11th amendment of our Microsoft Search Agreement last April. Per the agreement, we transitioned our exclusive sales responsibilities for premium advertisers to Microsoft. Our GAAP revenue will now track gross search revenue both this quarter and in the future. Ken will elaborate in further detail about this GAAP revenue presentation change.
Our adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP operating income both exceeded our guidance range, coming in at $172 million and $39 million, respectively. Our overall performance in Q2 reflects the hard work of Yahoo's employees to drive value for our users, advertisers and shareholders. Our team demonstrated excellent teamwork in implementing our strategic plan and delivering this quarter's results. We faced a lot of adversity and uncertainty throughout this quarter, and Yahoo showed resolve and resilience to deliver in line with our expectations.
With that, let's turn to our 2016 strategic plan. The first focus of our plan is to play to our strengths to grow user engagement on Yahoo's 3 global platforms: Search, Mail and Tumblr; and 4 core verticals: News, Sports, Finance and Lifestyles.
Starting with Search. With Search making up more than half of our GAAP revenue, it remains an important area of our business. Today, our search business is built on strong partnerships with Microsoft, Google, Mozilla, Apple and Oracle, among others. Our partnerships with Google and Microsoft remain strong, and we continue to improve performance and monetization on Yahoo Gemini search ads. We also continue to leverage all 3 platforms to compete for traffic in order to deliver the best quality search experience to our users. We're pleased that Yahoo Gemini search performs particularly well on mobile.
We anticipate that much of the innovation in Search will incur in the form of mobile assistance. Examples of others entering what we call the mobile assistance space include Alexa from Amazon or M from Facebook. This quarter, we launched early but important experiments in the areas of conversational interfaces, personal assistance and real-time answers, which we believe can be important differentiators for us in the mobile assistance space.
Also related to our search business, I wanted to take a moment to address some questions surrounding our Mozilla partnership. Mozilla is a very important partner to Yahoo in Search. We have built strong relationships with the Mozilla team, and we are closely engaged with them. While we would certainly like to continue the partnership regardless of our strategic alternatives process, should Mozilla choose not to, our agreement does provide for certain mitigations, which would reduce our exposure. Ultimately, it remains in our mutual best interest to maintain a healthy path forward, and we do hope to do just that.
Next, as you know, Yahoo Mail drives significant user engagement and revenue. For every dollar generated on Yahoo Mail, we see roughly $3 of incremental revenue across the network. Over the past 4 years I spent at Yahoo, I've watched our team completely rebuild Yahoo Mail from the ground up. And today, not only is it incredibly stable, reliable with great spam protection, but Yahoo Mail for iOS and for Android is the highest rated e-mail client, consistently achieving 4.5 stars in the App Store and on Google Play. And with over 7 million additional mailboxes now connected through IMAP in, we're reaching even more users outside of Yahoo with our best-in-class features.
With Tumblr, we've relentlessly focused on mobile engagement, and we're seeing good growth in engagement with signed-in users, particularly on mobile. This past quarter, we made enhancements to our popular GIF maker and launched Live Video posts to allow users to broadcast videos live to their followers. As we continue to strengthen our mobile creative tools, we've seen great traction with 84% of our daily average users active on mobile devices.
For our core verticals, we made solid progress with launches across News, Sports, Finance and Lifestyles. This quarter, we continued to bring together passionate communities of like-minded users, offered personalized content with even more video and empowered our users with engagement tools and utilities to enhance our News experience.
For example, as the U.K. contemplated the Brexit vote, users turned to Yahoo to follow 37 hours of continuous live updates that resulted in the highest number of users on Yahoo Finance in 4 years. And when news broke of Prince's passing earlier this spring, Yahoo experienced an unprecedented surge in traffic with the highest load on the site seen in the last 7 years. This illustrates once again that the Internet turns to Yahoo for the most accurate, fastest and most in-depth information on any breaking news. Overall, our investment in News have resulted in solid user engagement metrics and really highlight the power of Yahoo as a trusted news source.
In terms of product improvements, we leveraged our learnings from the Yahoo Homepage last quarter -- launched last quarter as we've updated News, Sports and Finance on desktop with one consistent look and feel for a cleaner, faster and more personalized experience.
We also recently launched updated apps for Yahoo Sports and Yahoo Finance that bring video front and center. We've doubled down on Live Video with NBA exclusives on THE VERTICAL with Woj and began live streaming MLB's Game of the Day on Yahoo Sports as well as live coverage of key financial events, including the first-ever global live stream of the Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting that generated 1.8 million live streams and over 8 million views on demand on Yahoo Finance.
And for Lifestyles, Polyvore was recognized with a Webby for the best mobile site and app for lifestyle for engaging and inspiring style lovers around the world. Additionally, we continued to integrate Polyvore across Yahoo's network with Polyvore-powered product listing ads running in Gemini native display ad inventory. Polyvore surpasses operational goals and is EBITDA accretive. While the results are small in the overall picture for Yahoo, they have been an excellent investment due to their fit with our products and their excellent team.
For our advertisers, we fully committed to delivering solid ROI with innovative, simplified ad products and top tier client services. On Gemini, we rolled out a new mobile serving algorithm and now see 4x as many clients, meeting our advertising goals for app install campaigns. And on BrightRoll, both our DSP and Exchange businesses continue to gain traction and produce meaningful revenue.
Through Ad Tech, Yahoo continues to deliver a unique value that provides superior ads, data and user experiences for all advertisers. We also introduced Yahoo Tiles, a new mobile ad format with dynamic and interactive features in native video and display, and Yahoo Storytellers as a new content marketing studio, which leverages Yahoo's editorial expertise, extensive data and Gemini native to create engaging premium content. While still nascent, we're pleased to see positive reception from advertisers and active engagement from our early partners.
As our advertising products and sales operations are closely tied to revenue performance, let's move to our second focus: driving Mavens revenue growth. Mavens, which stands for mobile, video, native and social, represent the fastest-growing areas of digital advertising and are key areas of investment for us. These business lines were nascent at Yahoo in 2012 with essentially no revenue and lack of product focus in these areas.
Going back even further, recall that Yahoo's early market lead in digital advertising was based heavily on desktop banner ads. As the industry shifted over time to favor mobile and programmatic advertising, Yahoo has had one of the largest legacy businesses to modernize and transform. Our investments in Mavens offset legacy business declines and have helped build a solid foundation for Yahoo's future.
In Q2, we delivered $504 million in Mavens GAAP revenue. Excluding the Microsoft accounting impact, this equates to a 4% decrease year-over-year. Holding video aside, Mavens would have shown modest growth, roughly in line with our expectations. In video, we experienced pricing pressure and general demand issues in our third-party ad network. We attribute some of these challenges to uncertainty around the ongoing strategic alternatives process.
Video on Yahoo's properties, however, was a highlight, with the growth in supply and revenue as we continued to invest in bringing video-rich experiences across our offerings like the new rollouts that I mentioned in News, Sports and Finance. This investment has significantly increased video engagement on our properties and thus also our ad supply.
Our O&O video revenue grew 108% year-over-year. Mavens is a key part of our strategy, our growth and our turnaround story, and we will work very hard to get the Mavens collectively back to growth in the second half of the year.
Let's take a deeper look at the other areas of Mavens. On mobile, we delivered $378 million in revenue -- in GAAP revenue, representing a 3% year-over-year increase. With our redesigned apps and ad units on mobile, we're optimistic that our continued focus on building the greatest mobile experiences for our users and advertisers will continue to bear fruit.
For video, while we've already discussed the overall impact on Mavens revenue this quarter, we are seeing promising signs of engagement with an 88% year-over-year boost of total video streams globally. As we continue into the second half of the year, we remain focused on growing our video business, specifically with O&O supply and Gemini video on the BrightRoll DSP and Exchange.
On native, we aim to grow demand by improving both product performance and advertiser satisfaction. We improved the mechanics of our algorithm to optimize campaign performance, and we are pleased to see positive advertiser response with our Gemini native advertiser base growing 25% in the last quarter.
And on social, we made strides on our Tumblr platform to enhance ad serving and increase supply with Gemini to improve Tumblr's monetization potential. With these ad experience enhancements, we are seeing twice as many Tumblr users engaging with ads compared to last year.
We'll continue our focus on Mavens to maximize growth and to win our share of these fast-growing areas of digital advertising. As we rounded the last 2 areas on our strategic plan, we're doing exactly what we said we would: simplifying the business and efficiently aligning our resources. We announced that we would retire products that either failed to meet our growth goals or did not fit strategically with Yahoo's future.
Most products we committed to shutting down have already been sunset, and we recently announced that we will also be retiring Yahoo Recommends and the legacy Yahoo Messenger product by the end of Q3. Yahoo Messenger remains an important communications tool, and we encourage all legacy Messenger users to switch to the new Yahoo Messenger for a more modern, secure and feature-rich experience.
In addition to our products, we also identified ways to unlock value for our shareholders through nonstrategic assets, including real estate and intellectual property. As we mentioned during our shareholder meeting, we recently closed on the $250 million sale of our Santa Clara real estate, a parcel of land close to our Sunnyvale headquarters.
And our strategic plan identified ways to maximize the value of over 4,000 patents and patent applications from our global portfolio. Over the past 21 years, Yahoo has grown a vast, valuable and foundational intellectual property portfolio covering technologies including search, advertising, cloud, mobile, web and more.
As our businesses evolve, we've outgrown the need for certain intellectual property. That portfolio, which we've identified and titled Excalibur, represents a unique opportunity to acquire pioneering patents. Our strategic review committee is overseeing exploration of these options, including the sale of the portfolio as a whole or retaining the RemainCo to use strategically or to monetize. Moving forward, we'll keep all of our -- we'll keep all IP that is core to our business and will have a license back to the Excalibur portfolio as we have done with other divestitures.
Finally, we also announced a series of changes to ensure that every product counts, every market matters and every employee's efforts drive excellence, competitiveness and profitability. As the end -- as of the end of Q2, we completed the 6 planned office closures in Buenos Aires, Burbank, Dubai, Madrid, Mexico and Milan. And we've met our commitment to reduce our workforce by 15%.
As of the end of the quarter, our active headcount stands at 8,800 employees and 700 contractors. This represents a reduction of approximately 45% since I started in 2012. Our headcount has returned to 2005 levels.
In terms of cost reduction, we continue to make meaningful progress towards our savings target to improve profitability. We reduced non-GAAP cash expenses by 14% year-over-year and reduced capital spend by 50% year-over-year. Prior to Q2 2016, the last quarter our non-GAAP cash expenses were this low was Q3 2006, almost 10 years ago. We're now running the company at the lowest cost structure and with the smallest headcount in a decade. As you can see from our business updates, we continue to run the company efficiently and responsibly.
Before I turn it over to Ken, I wanted to share a few closing thoughts. We set forth a plan to return this iconic company to growth over multiple years, one that would create long-term sustainable growth for Yahoo and deliver value to our users, advertisers, employees and shareholders. We took a hard honest look at where we were and where we wanted to be and have taken necessary steps to get there.
From building a mobile team from the ground up to modernizing and simplifying our digital advertising strategy and products and creating a brand-new Mavens business, these efforts are just a few of the achievements that have delivered the far stronger, more modern Yahoo of today.
This quarter has not been without its unique set of challenges, but above all, we've kept true to our commitment to deliver the results laid out in our strategic plan. Our refreshed products are yielding stronger engagement. We continue to focus on our investments in mobile, video, native and social. Our business is dramatically simplified, and we've continued to manage costs while efficiently running the company.
I remain confident that these are the right steps to create a better Yahoo. I'm very proud of the team for focusing on the task at hand despite a lot of distraction and uncertainty and pulling together as a team to deliver this quarter's results.
As we work to conclude the strategic alternatives process, this groundwork will serve as a solid foundation for Yahoo's next chapter. I'm proud of what this company has achieved over these past 4 years. I remain committed to our team and our company, and I continue to be optimistic and passionate about the future of Yahoo. Thank you, and over to you, Ken."
91800,373715245,1007648,"Yahoo! Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 18, 2016",2016-07-18,"Earnings Calls","Altaba Inc.","Executives","Well, thanks, Marissa, and good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, I would like to discuss our solid execution over the first half of the year against our 2016 strategic plan and the prior guidance we have provided.Through excelle",1889,"Well, thanks, Marissa, and good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, I would like to discuss our solid execution over the first half of the year against our 2016 strategic plan and the prior guidance we have provided.
Through excellent expenditure management of our cost and capital, we achieved above the high end of our guidance of adjusted EBITDA and significantly increased cash flow. Additionally, I will discuss the required change in the revenue presentation related to the Eleventh Amendment to the Microsoft Search Agreement. I will later close with outlook going forward, inclusive of this impact.
As Marissa noted, we do not have specific updates in our strategic alternatives update, but we will -- but we understand this is top of mind of our shareholders. We are working expeditiously with our board and strategic review committee, and I can assure you it's the top priority for all of us.
In Q2, we delivered revenue ex-TAC and profitability results near the higher -- above -- or the higher end of our guidance range, delivering our planned commitments for revenue and demonstrated exceptional cost control. Revenue ex-TAC of $841 million resulted from stable performances on our display properties driven by solid performance on Mail, which offset continued softness in Search volume.
We had another good quarter of cost target achievement and cash generation, delivering an adjusted EBITDA of $172 million and free cash flow of $426 million. We are focused in taking actions to reduce costs as well as increase cash throughout the quarter.
Our non-GAAP cash expenses were $669 million, down 14% year-over-year or $112 million, ahead of our planned targets. This was primarily driven by lower headcount numbers through planned actions and attrition as we ended the quarter at 8,800 active employees, down approximately 2,100 year-over-year.
Our focus has shifted to the effectiveness of our cost structure, for example, in the areas of IT infrastructure, content spend, sales and support and G&A. Through the first half of the year, we increased our cash balance by over $800 million from both operating improvements and monetization efforts, including $776 million of cash from operating activities for the first 6 months. This includes positive adjusted EBITDA of $319 million, $157 million dividend from Yahoo Japan in the second quarter and also reflects the ongoing working capital improvements to improve collections and the receipt of $190 million tax refund in first quarter.
Capital expenditures over this period of $152 million, which were down 43% year-over-year, as we continued our disciplined approach to capital spend. And the sale of Santa Clara land for net cash proceeds of $246 million as part of our noncore asset monetization efforts. This has resulted in a very strong balance sheet with nearly $7.7 billion in cash and marketable securities.
We will continue to look for ways to generate cash through operations and asset monetization to deliver tangible and demonstrable value to our shareholders. We have heard shareholder input and feedback and understand the importance of capital allocation and delivering value for our shareholders and look forward to sharing more information at the appropriate time, taking into account our strategic review process. We will remain focused on ways to drive revenue, reduce costs, improve cash flows and prudently allocate capital, maximizing value for our shareholders.
Before going through operating results for the quarter, I want to discuss required change of revenue presentation related to the Eleventh Amendment to the Microsoft Search Agreement. Pursuant to the amendment, we completed the transition of our exclusive sale responsibilities to Microsoft for Microsoft's paid search services to premium advertisers in the United States, Canada and Europe on April 1, 2016, and other markets on June 1, 2016.
Following this transition, Yahoo is now considered principal in the sale of search traffic to Microsoft in the transition markets. And as a result, we recognize search Affiliate revenues on a gross basis rather than net basis in those markets. This resulted in an increase to search GAAP revenue and cost of revenue TAC of $252 million in the second quarter as amounts paid to Affiliates are recorded as TAC rather than as a reduction to GAAP revenue. TAC in the non-transition markets of Taiwan and Hong Kong will continue to be recorded as a reduction to revenue. For further clarification, this change in revenue presentation does not impact revenue ex-TAC or profit. Please refer to Table 12 in the slide deck for an illustrative example of the change.
Now let's run through our second quarter financial results in more detail. And once again, I will focus most of the discussion around non-GAAP results. These exclude: a noncash goodwill intangible impairment charge of $482 million that we recorded this quarter that I will provide more detail around this later in the call; secondly, $120 million gain on sale of the Santa Clara land; stock-based compensation expense of $132 million, up sequentially due to a full quarter retention cost and factoring in our first half performance in executing our plan; and finally, restructuring charges of $19 million, advisory fees of $15 million and a $2 million noncash loss on our Hortonworks warrants.
Our financial results for Q2 can be seen on Slide 5. GAAP revenue was $1.308 billion and traffic acquisition costs were $466 million. As I mentioned earlier, $252 million of the GAAP revenue and TAC was due to the required change of revenue presentation related to the Microsoft agreement. Excluding this impact, GAAP revenue was $1.055 billion, down 15% year-over-year; revenue ex-TAC of $840 million -- $841 million.
Taking a closer look at search. GAAP search revenue was $711 million. But excluding the impact of the change in revenue presentation, GAAP search revenue decreased by 13% year-over-year.
Search click-driven revenue declined 18% year-over-year. Paid Clicks declined 24%, driven primarily by overall traffic trends across Yahoo Properties, Affiliates and partners and especially on desktop where volume remains challenged. Search PPC grew 8% year-over-year, mostly as a result of mix shift towards higher monetizing segments.
We have made good progress optimizing our advertising performance across our 3 marketplaces: Gemini, Bing and Google. Search revenue ex-TAC of $319 million declined 24% year-over-year, driven primarily by the declines in Paid Clicks and increasing payments -- partner payments as a percentage of revenue.
Now moving to display. GAAP display revenue was $470 million, down 7% year-over-year. Display ads sold increased 9% year-over-year due to increased Yahoo Properties supply, especially in our core verticals, sold through our programmatic channels and continued growth in our native syndication business.
PPA declined 15% year-over-year caused by continued pressure on our premium business and the ongoing mix shift to programmatic channels and native formats. Display revenue ex-TAC was $396 million. America display revenue ex-TAC was flat year-over-year. And globally, excluding the impact from exits, revenue ex-TAC was approximately flat year-over-year as well.
GAAP Mavens revenue, as Marissa noted, was $504 million. And excluding the impact of the change of revenue presentation, GAAP Mavens revenue was $385 million, down 4% year-over-year. And excluding video, Mavens would have been modestly up year-over-year.
GAAP mobile revenue was $378 million. And excluding the impact of the change of revenue presentation, GAAP mobile revenue was $259 million or up 3% year-over-year.
And other revenue ex-TAC declined 40% year-over-year due primarily to the ending of the Alibaba-related fees last September, resulting in a headwind of approximately $70 million, and modest reductions in other listings and fees businesses.
Now let's take a couple of minutes to go through our expenses and income in a bit more detail. Non-GAAP total operating expenses were down 40% year-over-year. Depreciation and amortization was down $21 million at $133 million, benefiting from lower capital expenditures and a write-off [ph] of intangible amortization.
Our non-GAAP cash expenses for the full quarter came in better than our expectations at $669 million, declining approximately $112 million year-over-year. This was primarily driven by: $61 million in workforce expense through net reduction of approximately 2,100 active employees year-over-year; $22 million from content deals and marketing; $13 million of streamlining our real estate and IT infrastructure; and $16 million in T&E and outside services.
With the major restructuring actions behind us, our focus shifts to ensuring the effectiveness of our cost structure and driving growth through our key initiatives for search, media and communications. And we delivered adjusted EBITDA of $172 million in Q2, above our guidance range, with the sequential margin improvement of 300 basis points.
Now rounding out the income statement. Earnings in equity interest were $52 million. This is lower than prior quarters, but it simply reflects our share of Yahoo Japan's results for the prior quarter. And our non-GAAP tax rate is 35%. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.09. Ending diluted share count for the period ended at 951 million.
In terms of balance sheet, I'd first like to cover our impairment charges. In Q2, we recorded noncash goodwill impairment charge of $395 million and a noncash intangibles impairment charge of $87 million related to Tumblr. The goodwill intangibles impairment charge resulted from a combination of factors, including decreases in our projected Tumblr operating results and estimated future cash flows.
Now looking to the balance sheet. At the end of Q2, we had $7.7 billion in cash and marketable securities or $6.3 billion net of convertible and other debt. This change in cash balance of $535 million from Q1 to Q2 was primarily driven by free cash flow of $426 million and a dividend of $157 million from Yahoo Japan, offset by tax withholding from stock-based compensation of $49 million.
Specific items contributing to improved cash flow include: lower CapEx spending of $76 million, in line with Q1; and the sale of Santa Clara land, which netted $246 million of cash.
Now let me cover guidance. We are reaffirming our annual guidance in EBITDA and revenue ex-TAC, recognizing that we have overachieved on EBITDA in the first half and have good momentum entering the second half. At this point, given likely transactional effects that are difficult to predict, we do not feel it prudent to adjust our annual guidance range for revenue ex-TAC and EBITDA.
And as discussed earlier, GAAP revenue is now impacted by the change in revenue presentation related to the Microsoft agreement. We estimate the impact of this change to be approximately $250 million per quarter in the second half of 2016.
Given this change and to reflect our trends in Q2 and entering Q3, we are adjusting our full year guidance range for GAAP revenue to $4.9 billion to $5.1 billion. For Q3 guidance, we expect the following: GAAP revenue in the range of $1.275 billion to $1.325 billion; TAC of approximately $440 million; revenue ex-TAC in the range of $840 million to $880 million; adjusted EBITDA in the range of $190 million to $220 million; and non-GAAP operating income in the range of $65 million to $95 million.
In closing, through excellent expenditure management of cost and capital, we had a strong first half and achieved above the high end of our guidance on EBITDA and significantly increased our cash flow. We bring that focus into the second half of 2016, and we'll continue to prioritize our efforts behind the most significant drivers of engagement growth in advertisers with demand. With that, Marissa and I would like to take your questions. Shibani?"

As you pointed out, we have partnerships for live streaming in place with the NHL during their active season, NBA as well as PGA. And we also, on Yahoo Finance, did some live streaming this quarter around Berkshire Hathaway's annual meeting. And as we did the NBA Draft, Woj on THE VERTICAL did both a live draft show as well as various live follow-up shows. Overall, we're seeing tremendous engagement. We saw, I believe, 1.8 million unique viewers on the Berkshire Hathaway stream. When we look at our day of the game, we're seeing really nice solid numbers and users who are repeating and coming back each day to see those games overall. And in terms of the participation from advertisers, our advertisers are really demanding premium placements for video where they can reach a broad reach over a particular demographic or user set. And so these particular live streaming opportunities, because they're so focused on sports or finance, have a really desirable audience with known demographics and really offer our advertisers a really premium placement in terms of the types of brand advertisements or commercials they'd like to run in digital video."

I think there are 3 components that I would point to because I think as we've looked at our PPA and studied it over time and had to make predictions about when they can return to positive, the positive factors there are video, which generally prices",519,"Sure. I think there are 3 components that I would point to because I think as we've looked at our PPA and studied it over time and had to make predictions about when they can return to positive, the positive factors there are video, which generally prices at a premium to, say, banner advertisements and/or native advertisements. Mobile, we today make less money on our mobile traffic than we do on our desktop traffic on a CPM basis. We don't think that necessarily has to be the case, and we think that we're very close to seeing a crossover point there where we could make as much, if not more, money on our mobile traffic. But that remains an opportunity in terms of where we could go with the PPA. And we continue to see pressures as we see unfavorable mix shift from premium to programmatic. And we do think that we've transitioned a lot of our inventory from the premium sales channels as well as the managed network sales channels into our Exchange and that DSP business and really being bought on a real-time bidding basis. And so as we get to the natural equilibrium of how much of our inventory is sold in programmatic, we do actually think we'll see price increases. So I think we'll start to see turns on the programmatic pricing and start -- stop seeing as much drag from that legacy shift inside of the next 4 quarters. So inside the next year, we'll start to see price appreciation in our banner advertisements and the classic programmatic piece. Video, as we mentioned, we've had a lot of new supply. But we have been finding good demand for our O&O video, less demand for the managed network piece and the third-party video. And so here, we really think it's about finding that demand, bringing those television dollars. And so they're not only bidding on to our O&O inventory, but they're also bidding into our third-party network. But right now, because there's been so much additional supply coming in on video, and that's not only true here but across the industry, there's been price pressure on video display with that because it's a very premium unit. And on mobile, we have done a lot of hard work around cost per install ads, new ad formats, really looking at what's happening in the competitive landscape in terms of how do we make mobile ads really work for our advertisers. And we saw a lot of progress there. As I mentioned in my comments, we've seen 4x as much engagement -- sorry, 4x as much achievement of campaign goals with our advertisers based on some changes we made to our algorithms on mobile, cost per install ads, and we anticipate that would increase. And so we're hopeful. Certainly, the point of our strategic plan is to really unlock additional opportunity in mobile monetization yet this year. So with programmatic, I think it's in the next 4 quarters, video is when the supply really stabilizes. And mobile, I really hope, is in the latter half of this year."

So we have a really robust offering in managed network, setting aside premium inventory both on our site and other sites in advance and really running those impressions at a premium. We, overall, want to see a lot more activity in the real-time bidding channel. And our Exchange this quarter was particularly strong. We're seeing a lot of real-time bidding efforts on our Exchange from other DSPs and other providers and other third parties.

And we've also worked over the past quarter to make changes to it to ultimately help it sidestep some of the current controversy. We've really gotten very focused on Fair Play being more transparent, fun, trustworthy. So for example, if there's some professional participants who are coming in and entering almost every contest or putting multiple entries into a single contest, that's now noted on our interface. So you really get a sense for who you're playing against, what their style of play is and whether or not this is someone who is playing for fun or playing professionally. And that ultimately really helps us make the game more in the spirit that it's intended of really being fun and entertaining, and as I said, sidestepping some of the controversies.

We're also happy with the traction we have on Gemini search, particularly in the mobile sphere. As you know, through our alliance with Microsoft, we send 51% of our desktop traffic to Microsoft. Mobile is unencumbered. But as to the types of percentages we send to either Gemini or Google, those are confidential and we don't break them out. So we can't say much more there. Though I will say overall, we're really happy with the unique piece of technology that we've built that really assesses a user's query, their demographics, who they are and ultimately finds the right search provider both for algorithmic results as well as paid search results. And in terms of programmatic, the majority of our impressions are being sold through the programmatic sector. And the Exchange segment, in particular, is one of the largest segments of our display business, if not the largest. So we're seeing a lot of traction there. I think that on the whole, depending on how you measure it, either on revenue or an impression basis, I believe on an impression basis, about 70%, not in excess [ph] of that, is now being sold through programmatic channels. And so overall, we feel that it was important for us to take our inventory and shift it into these programmatic channels to really catch that wave despite the fact that it did cause pressure on our PPA, but a lot of those inventory shifts have now happened. And while we still experience some legacy drag, I'm told that it's somewhere on the order now of about $20 million a quarter, where that used to be at times almost $100 million a quarter or more of pricing pressure being introduced by mix shift to programmatic."

When we look at the landscape, one of the things we see is TV dollars are shifting to digital, and they are shifting into social in particular. That said, not unlike other shifts that have happened with advertising dollars in the past, it is lagging where the actual users and the actual -- the eyeballs and consumers are. So for example, we know that digital video surpassed television last year or at least time spent on all digital devices, including digital video, surpassed television last year in terms of time spent here in the United States. That said, we still are seeing more money spent on television than we're seeing spent in digital mediums. And so we think that over time that will follow, the advertising dollars will follow where the users are spending their time. But it's not unusual to see a lag like that. And from that -- to that end, that's why we've really focused on digital video, because we can see the types of budgets that advertisers deploy, the type of reach that they want that comes from the broadcast television media. And we can see that we need to offer something like that but even more measurable, even more targeted than you can get in that television platform and there's unique advantages in buying online. And so that's why we've been focused in increasing our video engagement and growing our network and third party as well as really working with advertisers to help them -- to help understand what would it take to transition some of those brand dollars off of television and into digital video. This is some of the experiments we've done with live streaming, and some of the unique content that we've had has really gone a long way in helping us understand the overall criteria, how they're going to think about that spend, how they're going to measure ROI, et cetera. And we've been lining up our products to benefit from that."

First off, the mobile app engagement that we see on Tumblr is growing really nicely. We're seeing growth in signed-in users, and we're overall seeing a lot of the users engaged in the mobile app. I believe it's nearing 90% of our daily active users are now engaging with the application on their phone in addition to desktop. In terms of the revenue side, we've taken various different approaches over the past year or 2 in terms of how we've activated the sales force and how we've gone to market. In particular, this quarter, we have made some good improvements. We've doubled down on Gemini, and so we are working hard to bring our Gemini formats into Tumblr. We think that they will monetize very well and provide good results for advertisers. They're a really attractive format of advertising both for the advertiser as well as for the community on Tumblr. But one of the things that's happening is our supply, because it's growing so quickly, is outpacing demand and is causing this monetization shortfall. So we've worked to introduce more Gemini demand. We think that the ad load in Tumblr is appropriate. It's really about bringing the demand to bear there. Towards the end of Q2, we activated the Facebook ad network, also known as FAN, as part of our backfill efforts in order to bring more advertisements to fill that ad load on Tumblr. And we also started to bring to bear some of our Exchange efforts in terms of our classic displays, what's known as our large rectangle ads or LREC ads onto Tumblr in appropriate places. And so while these may be at lower prices because there's not as much demand to keep up with supply, overall, we think that we're bringing -- we're activating the right demand channels to address the fact that supply has been outpacing demand. And on Mozilla, there's not a lot more that I can say because it is a confidential relationship. But we did want to point out because I think it has been misunderstood at least in some of the analyses I've seen. It has been misunderstood that there is a mitigation in the contract that ultimately would reduce some of our exposure and liabilities."

But overall, when you look at the desirability of the format, the amount of creative that's been created in the video medium for television or otherwise, we ultimately think it's really about bringing advertisers into these digital channels, into these mobile channels and having them bring those creatives, target them well, measure them well and really put that demand -- because if you look at the sheer number of dollars, it looks possible to me that we could see increases in prices and video really pricing at a premium, in particular the banners or even native.

For my portion of today's call, I'll cover our Q2 performance as well as an update against our 2016 strategic plan.
Before we jump into the quarter, I want to briefly address the strategic alternatives process, which continues to be top of mind for shareholders and is a top priority for our board and management team. Although we have no announcement today, I want to restate our commitment to delivering shareholder value with this process. By separating Yahoo's operating business from our equity stake in Alibaba, there is substantial value that we can potentially unlock.
To that end, the right transaction could strategically and efficiently achieve such a separation. Our board's independent strategic review committee, which is leading a well-run robust process, continues to manage this effort. And we are making great progress. While we have no announcement today, I can say we are deep into the process of evaluating proposals and alternatives and will update our shareholders as soon as is prudent.
In parallel, we continue to strengthen our operating business through the execution of our 2016 strategic plan. As I've said before, our plan complements the strategic alternatives process and is important to maximize the value of Yahoo in any scenario.
With that, let's turn to our business updates for the quarter. In Q2, we delivered $1,308,000,000 of GAAP revenue and $841 million of ex-TAC revenue, meeting the high end of our ex-TAC guidance. Our GAAP revenue presentation has changed this quarter. This is due to a required change stemming from the implementation of the 11th amendment of our Microsoft Search Agreement last April. Per the agreement, we transitioned our exclusive sales responsibilities for premium advertisers to Microsoft. Our GAAP revenue will now track gross search revenue both this quarter and in the future. Ken will elaborate in further detail about this GAAP revenue presentation change.
Our adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP operating income both exceeded our guidance range, coming in at $172 million and $39 million, respectively. Our overall performance in Q2 reflects the hard work of Yahoo's employees to drive value for our users, advertisers and shareholders. Our team demonstrated excellent teamwork in implementing our strategic plan and delivering this quarter's results. We faced a lot of adversity and uncertainty throughout this quarter, and Yahoo showed resolve and resilience to deliver in line with our expectations.
With that, let's turn to our 2016 strategic plan. The first focus of our plan is to play to our strengths to grow user engagement on Yahoo's 3 global platforms: Search, Mail and Tumblr; and 4 core verticals: News, Sports, Finance and Lifestyles.
Starting with Search. With Search making up more than half of our GAAP revenue, it remains an important area of our business. Today, our search business is built on strong partnerships with Microsoft, Google, Mozilla, Apple and Oracle, among others. Our partnerships with Google and Microsoft remain strong, and we continue to improve performance and monetization on Yahoo Gemini search ads. We also continue to leverage all 3 platforms to compete for traffic in order to deliver the best quality search experience to our users. We're pleased that Yahoo Gemini search performs particularly well on mobile.
We anticipate that much of the innovation in Search will incur in the form of mobile assistance. Examples of others entering what we call the mobile assistance space include Alexa from Amazon or M from Facebook. This quarter, we launched early but important experiments in the areas of conversational interfaces, personal assistance and real-time answers, which we believe can be important differentiators for us in the mobile assistance space.
Also related to our search business, I wanted to take a moment to address some questions surrounding our Mozilla partnership. Mozilla is a very important partner to Yahoo in Search. We have built strong relationships with the Mozilla team, and we are closely engaged with them. While we would certainly like to continue the partnership regardless of our strategic alternatives process, should Mozilla choose not to, our agreement does provide for certain mitigations, which would reduce our exposure. Ultimately, it remains in our mutual best interest to maintain a healthy path forward, and we do hope to do just that.
Next, as you know, Yahoo Mail drives significant user engagement and revenue. For every dollar generated on Yahoo Mail, we see roughly $3 of incremental revenue across the network. Over the past 4 years I spent at Yahoo, I've watched our team completely rebuild Yahoo Mail from the ground up. And today, not only is it incredibly stable, reliable with great spam protection, but Yahoo Mail for iOS and for Android is the highest rated e-mail client, consistently achieving 4.5 stars in the App Store and on Google Play. And with over 7 million additional mailboxes now connected through IMAP in, we're reaching even more users outside of Yahoo with our best-in-class features.
With Tumblr, we've relentlessly focused on mobile engagement, and we're seeing good growth in engagement with signed-in users, particularly on mobile. This past quarter, we made enhancements to our popular GIF maker and launched Live Video posts to allow users to broadcast videos live to their followers. As we continue to strengthen our mobile creative tools, we've seen great traction with 84% of our daily average users active on mobile devices.
For our core verticals, we made solid progress with launches across News, Sports, Finance and Lifestyles. This quarter, we continued to bring together passionate communities of like-minded users, offered personalized content with even more video and empowered our users with engagement tools and utilities to enhance our News experience.
For example, as the U.K. contemplated the Brexit vote, users turned to Yahoo to follow 37 hours of continuous live updates that resulted in the highest number of users on Yahoo Finance in 4 years. And when news broke of Prince's passing earlier this spring, Yahoo experienced an unprecedented surge in traffic with the highest load on the site seen in the last 7 years. This illustrates once again that the Internet turns to Yahoo for the most accurate, fastest and most in-depth information on any breaking news. Overall, our investment in News have resulted in solid user engagement metrics and really highlight the power of Yahoo as a trusted news source.
In terms of product improvements, we leveraged our learnings from the Yahoo Homepage last quarter -- launched last quarter as we've updated News, Sports and Finance on desktop with one consistent look and feel for a cleaner, faster and more personalized experience.
We also recently launched updated apps for Yahoo Sports and Yahoo Finance that bring video front and center. We've doubled down on Live Video with NBA exclusives on THE VERTICAL with Woj and began live streaming MLB's Game of the Day on Yahoo Sports as well as live coverage of key financial events, including the first-ever global live stream of the Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting that generated 1.8 million live streams and over 8 million views on demand on Yahoo Finance.
And for Lifestyles, Polyvore was recognized with a Webby for the best mobile site and app for lifestyle for engaging and inspiring style lovers around the world. Additionally, we continued to integrate Polyvore across Yahoo's network with Polyvore-powered product listing ads running in Gemini native display ad inventory. Polyvore surpasses operational goals and is EBITDA accretive. While the results are small in the overall picture for Yahoo, they have been an excellent investment due to their fit with our products and their excellent team.
For our advertisers, we fully committed to delivering solid ROI with innovative, simplified ad products and top tier client services. On Gemini, we rolled out a new mobile serving algorithm and now see 4x as many clients, meeting our advertising goals for app install campaigns. And on BrightRoll, both our DSP and Exchange businesses continue to gain traction and produce meaningful revenue.
Through Ad Tech, Yahoo continues to deliver a unique value that provides superior ads, data and user experiences for all advertisers. We also introduced Yahoo Tiles, a new mobile ad format with dynamic and interactive features in native video and display, and Yahoo Storytellers as a new content marketing studio, which leverages Yahoo's editorial expertise, extensive data and Gemini native to create engaging premium content. While still nascent, we're pleased to see positive reception from advertisers and active engagement from our early partners.
As our advertising products and sales operations are closely tied to revenue performance, let's move to our second focus: driving Mavens revenue growth. Mavens, which stands for mobile, video, native and social, represent the fastest-growing areas of digital advertising and are key areas of investment for us. These business lines were nascent at Yahoo in 2012 with essentially no revenue and lack of product focus in these areas.
Going back even further, recall that Yahoo's early market lead in digital advertising was based heavily on desktop banner ads. As the industry shifted over time to favor mobile and programmatic advertising, Yahoo has had one of the largest legacy businesses to modernize and transform. Our investments in Mavens offset legacy business declines and have helped build a solid foundation for Yahoo's future.
In Q2, we delivered $504 million in Mavens GAAP revenue. Excluding the Microsoft accounting impact, this equates to a 4% decrease year-over-year. Holding video aside, Mavens would have shown modest growth, roughly in line with our expectations. In video, we experienced pricing pressure and general demand issues in our third-party ad network. We attribute some of these challenges to uncertainty around the ongoing strategic alternatives process.
Video on Yahoo's properties, however, was a highlight, with the growth in supply and revenue as we continued to invest in bringing video-rich experiences across our offerings like the new rollouts that I mentioned in News, Sports and Finance. This investment has significantly increased video engagement on our properties and thus also our ad supply.
Our O&O video revenue grew 108% year-over-year. Mavens is a key part of our strategy, our growth and our turnaround story, and we will work very hard to get the Mavens collectively back to growth in the second half of the year.
Let's take a deeper look at the other areas of Mavens. On mobile, we delivered $378 million in revenue -- in GAAP revenue, representing a 3% year-over-year increase. With our redesigned apps and ad units on mobile, we're optimistic that our continued focus on building the greatest mobile experiences for our users and advertisers will continue to bear fruit.
For video, while we've already discussed the overall impact on Mavens revenue this quarter, we are seeing promising signs of engagement with an 88% year-over-year boost of total video streams globally. As we continue into the second half of the year, we remain focused on growing our video business, specifically with O&O supply and Gemini video on the BrightRoll DSP and Exchange.
On native, we aim to grow demand by improving both product performance and advertiser satisfaction. We improved the mechanics of our algorithm to optimize campaign performance, and we are pleased to see positive advertiser response with our Gemini native advertiser base growing 25% in the last quarter.
And on social, we made strides on our Tumblr platform to enhance ad serving and increase supply with Gemini to improve Tumblr's monetization potential. With these ad experience enhancements, we are seeing twice as many Tumblr users engaging with ads compared to last year.
We'll continue our focus on Mavens to maximize growth and to win our share of these fast-growing areas of digital advertising. As we rounded the last 2 areas on our strategic plan, we're doing exactly what we said we would: simplifying the business and efficiently aligning our resources. We announced that we would retire products that either failed to meet our growth goals or did not fit strategically with Yahoo's future.
Most products we committed to shutting down have already been sunset, and we recently announced that we will also be retiring Yahoo Recommends and the legacy Yahoo Messenger product by the end of Q3. Yahoo Messenger remains an important communications tool, and we encourage all legacy Messenger users to switch to the new Yahoo Messenger for a more modern, secure and feature-rich experience.
In addition to our products, we also identified ways to unlock value for our shareholders through nonstrategic assets, including real estate and intellectual property. As we mentioned during our shareholder meeting, we recently closed on the $250 million sale of our Santa Clara real estate, a parcel of land close to our Sunnyvale headquarters.
And our strategic plan identified ways to maximize the value of over 4,000 patents and patent applications from our global portfolio. Over the past 21 years, Yahoo has grown a vast, valuable and foundational intellectual property portfolio covering technologies including search, advertising, cloud, mobile, web and more.
As our businesses evolve, we've outgrown the need for certain intellectual property. That portfolio, which we've identified and titled Excalibur, represents a unique opportunity to acquire pioneering patents. Our strategic review committee is overseeing exploration of these options, including the sale of the portfolio as a whole or retaining the RemainCo to use strategically or to monetize. Moving forward, we'll keep all of our -- we'll keep all IP that is core to our business and will have a license back to the Excalibur portfolio as we have done with other divestitures.
Finally, we also announced a series of changes to ensure that every product counts, every market matters and every employee's efforts drive excellence, competitiveness and profitability. As the end -- as of the end of Q2, we completed the 6 planned office closures in Buenos Aires, Burbank, Dubai, Madrid, Mexico and Milan. And we've met our commitment to reduce our workforce by 15%.
As of the end of the quarter, our active headcount stands at 8,800 employees and 700 contractors. This represents a reduction of approximately 45% since I started in 2012. Our headcount has returned to 2005 levels.
In terms of cost reduction, we continue to make meaningful progress towards our savings target to improve profitability. We reduced non-GAAP cash expenses by 14% year-over-year and reduced capital spend by 50% year-over-year. Prior to Q2 2016, the last quarter our non-GAAP cash expenses were this low was Q3 2006, almost 10 years ago. We're now running the company at the lowest cost structure and with the smallest headcount in a decade. As you can see from our business updates, we continue to run the company efficiently and responsibly.
Before I turn it over to Ken, I wanted to share a few closing thoughts. We set forth a plan to return this iconic company to growth over multiple years, one that would create long-term sustainable growth for Yahoo and deliver value to our users, advertisers, employees and shareholders. We took a hard honest look at where we were and where we wanted to be and have taken necessary steps to get there.
From building a mobile team from the ground up to modernizing and simplifying our digital advertising strategy and products and creating a brand-new Mavens business, these efforts are just a few of the achievements that have delivered the far stronger, more modern Yahoo of today.
This quarter has not been without its unique set of challenges, but above all, we've kept true to our commitment to deliver the results laid out in our strategic plan. Our refreshed products are yielding stronger engagement. We continue to focus on our investments in mobile, video, native and social. Our business is dramatically simplified, and we've continued to manage costs while efficiently running the company.
I remain confident that these are the right steps to create a better Yahoo. I'm very proud of the team for focusing on the task at hand despite a lot of distraction and uncertainty and pulling together as a team to deliver this quarter's results.
As we work to conclude the strategic alternatives process, this groundwork will serve as a solid foundation for Yahoo's next chapter. I'm proud of what this company has achieved over these past 4 years. I remain committed to our team and our company, and I continue to be optimistic and passionate about the future of Yahoo. Thank you, and over to you, Ken."

Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 18, 2016",2016-07-18,"Earnings Calls","Altaba Inc.","Executives","Well, thanks, Marissa, and good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, I would like to discuss our solid execution over the first half of the year against our 2016 strategic plan and the prior guidance we have provided.Through excelle",1889,"Well, thanks, Marissa, and good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, I would like to discuss our solid execution over the first half of the year against our 2016 strategic plan and the prior guidance we have provided.
Through excellent expenditure management of our cost and capital, we achieved above the high end of our guidance of adjusted EBITDA and significantly increased cash flow. Additionally, I will discuss the required change in the revenue presentation related to the Eleventh Amendment to the Microsoft Search Agreement. I will later close with outlook going forward, inclusive of this impact.
As Marissa noted, we do not have specific updates in our strategic alternatives update, but we will -- but we understand this is top of mind of our shareholders. We are working expeditiously with our board and strategic review committee, and I can assure you it's the top priority for all of us.
In Q2, we delivered revenue ex-TAC and profitability results near the higher -- above -- or the higher end of our guidance range, delivering our planned commitments for revenue and demonstrated exceptional cost control. Revenue ex-TAC of $841 million resulted from stable performances on our display properties driven by solid performance on Mail, which offset continued softness in Search volume.
We had another good quarter of cost target achievement and cash generation, delivering an adjusted EBITDA of $172 million and free cash flow of $426 million. We are focused in taking actions to reduce costs as well as increase cash throughout the quarter.
Our non-GAAP cash expenses were $669 million, down 14% year-over-year or $112 million, ahead of our planned targets. This was primarily driven by lower headcount numbers through planned actions and attrition as we ended the quarter at 8,800 active employees, down approximately 2,100 year-over-year.
Our focus has shifted to the effectiveness of our cost structure, for example, in the areas of IT infrastructure, content spend, sales and support and G&A. Through the first half of the year, we increased our cash balance by over $800 million from both operating improvements and monetization efforts, including $776 million of cash from operating activities for the first 6 months. This includes positive adjusted EBITDA of $319 million, $157 million dividend from Yahoo Japan in the second quarter and also reflects the ongoing working capital improvements to improve collections and the receipt of $190 million tax refund in first quarter.
Capital expenditures over this period of $152 million, which were down 43% year-over-year, as we continued our disciplined approach to capital spend. And the sale of Santa Clara land for net cash proceeds of $246 million as part of our noncore asset monetization efforts. This has resulted in a very strong balance sheet with nearly $7.7 billion in cash and marketable securities.
We will continue to look for ways to generate cash through operations and asset monetization to deliver tangible and demonstrable value to our shareholders. We have heard shareholder input and feedback and understand the importance of capital allocation and delivering value for our shareholders and look forward to sharing more information at the appropriate time, taking into account our strategic review process. We will remain focused on ways to drive revenue, reduce costs, improve cash flows and prudently allocate capital, maximizing value for our shareholders.
Before going through operating results for the quarter, I want to discuss required change of revenue presentation related to the Eleventh Amendment to the Microsoft Search Agreement. Pursuant to the amendment, we completed the transition of our exclusive sale responsibilities to Microsoft for Microsoft's paid search services to premium advertisers in the United States, Canada and Europe on April 1, 2016, and other markets on June 1, 2016.
Following this transition, Yahoo is now considered principal in the sale of search traffic to Microsoft in the transition markets. And as a result, we recognize search Affiliate revenues on a gross basis rather than net basis in those markets. This resulted in an increase to search GAAP revenue and cost of revenue TAC of $252 million in the second quarter as amounts paid to Affiliates are recorded as TAC rather than as a reduction to GAAP revenue. TAC in the non-transition markets of Taiwan and Hong Kong will continue to be recorded as a reduction to revenue. For further clarification, this change in revenue presentation does not impact revenue ex-TAC or profit. Please refer to Table 12 in the slide deck for an illustrative example of the change.
Now let's run through our second quarter financial results in more detail. And once again, I will focus most of the discussion around non-GAAP results. These exclude: a noncash goodwill intangible impairment charge of $482 million that we recorded this quarter that I will provide more detail around this later in the call; secondly, $120 million gain on sale of the Santa Clara land; stock-based compensation expense of $132 million, up sequentially due to a full quarter retention cost and factoring in our first half performance in executing our plan; and finally, restructuring charges of $19 million, advisory fees of $15 million and a $2 million noncash loss on our Hortonworks warrants.
Our financial results for Q2 can be seen on Slide 5. GAAP revenue was $1.308 billion and traffic acquisition costs were $466 million. As I mentioned earlier, $252 million of the GAAP revenue and TAC was due to the required change of revenue presentation related to the Microsoft agreement. Excluding this impact, GAAP revenue was $1.055 billion, down 15% year-over-year; revenue ex-TAC of $840 million -- $841 million.
Taking a closer look at search. GAAP search revenue was $711 million. But excluding the impact of the change in revenue presentation, GAAP search revenue decreased by 13% year-over-year.
Search click-driven revenue declined 18% year-over-year. Paid Clicks declined 24%, driven primarily by overall traffic trends across Yahoo Properties, Affiliates and partners and especially on desktop where volume remains challenged. Search PPC grew 8% year-over-year, mostly as a result of mix shift towards higher monetizing segments.
We have made good progress optimizing our advertising performance across our 3 marketplaces: Gemini, Bing and Google. Search revenue ex-TAC of $319 million declined 24% year-over-year, driven primarily by the declines in Paid Clicks and increasing payments -- partner payments as a percentage of revenue.
Now moving to display. GAAP display revenue was $470 million, down 7% year-over-year. Display ads sold increased 9% year-over-year due to increased Yahoo Properties supply, especially in our core verticals, sold through our programmatic channels and continued growth in our native syndication business.
PPA declined 15% year-over-year caused by continued pressure on our premium business and the ongoing mix shift to programmatic channels and native formats. Display revenue ex-TAC was $396 million. America display revenue ex-TAC was flat year-over-year. And globally, excluding the impact from exits, revenue ex-TAC was approximately flat year-over-year as well.
GAAP Mavens revenue, as Marissa noted, was $504 million. And excluding the impact of the change of revenue presentation, GAAP Mavens revenue was $385 million, down 4% year-over-year. And excluding video, Mavens would have been modestly up year-over-year.
GAAP mobile revenue was $378 million. And excluding the impact of the change of revenue presentation, GAAP mobile revenue was $259 million or up 3% year-over-year.
And other revenue ex-TAC declined 40% year-over-year due primarily to the ending of the Alibaba-related fees last September, resulting in a headwind of approximately $70 million, and modest reductions in other listings and fees businesses.
Now let's take a couple of minutes to go through our expenses and income in a bit more detail. Non-GAAP total operating expenses were down 40% year-over-year. Depreciation and amortization was down $21 million at $133 million, benefiting from lower capital expenditures and a write-off [ph] of intangible amortization.
Our non-GAAP cash expenses for the full quarter came in better than our expectations at $669 million, declining approximately $112 million year-over-year. This was primarily driven by: $61 million in workforce expense through net reduction of approximately 2,100 active employees year-over-year; $22 million from content deals and marketing; $13 million of streamlining our real estate and IT infrastructure; and $16 million in T&E and outside services.
With the major restructuring actions behind us, our focus shifts to ensuring the effectiveness of our cost structure and driving growth through our key initiatives for search, media and communications. And we delivered adjusted EBITDA of $172 million in Q2, above our guidance range, with the sequential margin improvement of 300 basis points.
Now rounding out the income statement. Earnings in equity interest were $52 million. This is lower than prior quarters, but it simply reflects our share of Yahoo Japan's results for the prior quarter. And our non-GAAP tax rate is 35%. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.09. Ending diluted share count for the period ended at 951 million.
In terms of balance sheet, I'd first like to cover our impairment charges. In Q2, we recorded noncash goodwill impairment charge of $395 million and a noncash intangibles impairment charge of $87 million related to Tumblr. The goodwill intangibles impairment charge resulted from a combination of factors, including decreases in our projected Tumblr operating results and estimated future cash flows.
Now looking to the balance sheet. At the end of Q2, we had $7.7 billion in cash and marketable securities or $6.3 billion net of convertible and other debt. This change in cash balance of $535 million from Q1 to Q2 was primarily driven by free cash flow of $426 million and a dividend of $157 million from Yahoo Japan, offset by tax withholding from stock-based compensation of $49 million.
Specific items contributing to improved cash flow include: lower CapEx spending of $76 million, in line with Q1; and the sale of Santa Clara land, which netted $246 million of cash.
Now let me cover guidance. We are reaffirming our annual guidance in EBITDA and revenue ex-TAC, recognizing that we have overachieved on EBITDA in the first half and have good momentum entering the second half. At this point, given likely transactional effects that are difficult to predict, we do not feel it prudent to adjust our annual guidance range for revenue ex-TAC and EBITDA.
And as discussed earlier, GAAP revenue is now impacted by the change in revenue presentation related to the Microsoft agreement. We estimate the impact of this change to be approximately $250 million per quarter in the second half of 2016.
Given this change and to reflect our trends in Q2 and entering Q3, we are adjusting our full year guidance range for GAAP revenue to $4.9 billion to $5.1 billion. For Q3 guidance, we expect the following: GAAP revenue in the range of $1.275 billion to $1.325 billion; TAC of approximately $440 million; revenue ex-TAC in the range of $840 million to $880 million; adjusted EBITDA in the range of $190 million to $220 million; and non-GAAP operating income in the range of $65 million to $95 million.
In closing, through excellent expenditure management of cost and capital, we had a strong first half and achieved above the high end of our guidance on EBITDA and significantly increased our cash flow. We bring that focus into the second half of 2016, and we'll continue to prioritize our efforts behind the most significant drivers of engagement growth in advertisers with demand. With that, Marissa and I would like to take your questions. Shibani?"

And as we did the NBA Draft, Woj on THE VERTICAL did both a live draft show as well as various live follow-up shows. Overall, we're seeing tremendous engagement. We saw, I believe, 1.8 million unique viewers on the Berkshire Hathaway stream. When we look at our day of the game, we're seeing really nice solid numbers and users who are repeating and coming back each day to see those games overall. And in terms of the participation from advertisers, our advertisers are really demanding premium placements for video where they can reach a broad reach over a particular demographic or user set. And so these particular live streaming opportunities, because they're so focused on sports or finance, have a really desirable audience with known demographics and really offer our advertisers a really premium placement in terms of the types of brand advertisements or commercials they'd like to run in digital video."

I think there are 3 components that I would point to because I think as we've looked at our PPA and studied it over time and had to make predictions about when they can return to positive, the positive factors there are video, which generally prices",519,"Sure. I think there are 3 components that I would point to because I think as we've looked at our PPA and studied it over time and had to make predictions about when they can return to positive, the positive factors there are video, which generally prices at a premium to, say, banner advertisements and/or native advertisements. Mobile, we today make less money on our mobile traffic than we do on our desktop traffic on a CPM basis. We don't think that necessarily has to be the case, and we think that we're very close to seeing a crossover point there where we could make as much, if not more, money on our mobile traffic. But that remains an opportunity in terms of where we could go with the PPA. And we continue to see pressures as we see unfavorable mix shift from premium to programmatic. And we do think that we've transitioned a lot of our inventory from the premium sales channels as well as the managed network sales channels into our Exchange and that DSP business and really being bought on a real-time bidding basis. And so as we get to the natural equilibrium of how much of our inventory is sold in programmatic, we do actually think we'll see price increases. So I think we'll start to see turns on the programmatic pricing and start -- stop seeing as much drag from that legacy shift inside of the next 4 quarters. So inside the next year, we'll start to see price appreciation in our banner advertisements and the classic programmatic piece. Video, as we mentioned, we've had a lot of new supply. But we have been finding good demand for our O&O video, less demand for the managed network piece and the third-party video. And so here, we really think it's about finding that demand, bringing those television dollars. And so they're not only bidding on to our O&O inventory, but they're also bidding into our third-party network. But right now, because there's been so much additional supply coming in on video, and that's not only true here but across the industry, there's been price pressure on video display with that because it's a very premium unit. And on mobile, we have done a lot of hard work around cost per install ads, new ad formats, really looking at what's happening in the competitive landscape in terms of how do we make mobile ads really work for our advertisers. And we saw a lot of progress there. As I mentioned in my comments, we've seen 4x as much engagement -- sorry, 4x as much achievement of campaign goals with our advertisers based on some changes we made to our algorithms on mobile, cost per install ads, and we anticipate that would increase. And so we're hopeful. Certainly, the point of our strategic plan is to really unlock additional opportunity in mobile monetization yet this year. So with programmatic, I think it's in the next 4 quarters, video is when the supply really stabilizes. And mobile, I really hope, is in the latter half of this year."

We're seeing a lot of real-time bidding efforts on our Exchange from other DSPs and other providers and other third parties.

I think it's really consistent with the strategy that we have laid out. As I thought about this more last night, I mean, clearly, I think we're benefiting on cost and continue to benefit on cost in a couple of ways. One is, we continue to be very tight on expense control and have even tightened that. So we're really watching every dollar even more so maybe than we have in the past. And two is, we've become more effective. And so by that, I mean, we looked at areas where we may have had duplication, redundancies or where we can just get the same job done with less people, better capital utilization. So some of it is effectiveness. Some of it is really tightening up. And I think, again, on both those aspects, we can continue probably to do better because we continue to focus on it. But I think as Marissa noted, I think the general headcount now is predicated on the strategic plan we put together. And subject to that, we think it's about right again."

Overall, Fantasy Sports is obviously a stronghold for Yahoo and is a product we've invested in. We feel we made it much better over the past few years, and it's really a very vibrant part overall of our franchise. Our full season sports -- it's important to recognize that we have 2 offerings in Fantasy. We have full season as well as daily. Our full season sports, we believe, is away from the controversy that you may be hearing about in the daily play. And overall, it's a very strong offering for us. Our Daily Fantasy, which was introduced last summer, has also shown a lot of traction. And we've also worked over the past quarter to make changes to it to ultimately help it sidestep some of the current controversy. We've really gotten very focused on Fair Play being more transparent, fun, trustworthy. So for example, if there's some professional participants who are coming in and entering almost every contest or putting multiple entries into a single contest, that's now noted on our interface. So you really get a sense for who you're playing against, what their style of play is and whether or not this is someone who is playing for fun or playing professionally. And that ultimately really helps us make the game more in the spirit that it's intended of really being fun and entertaining, and as I said, sidestepping some of the controversies. The full season sport does that naturally. The daily -- the adjustments we made to our daily games in the past quarter have really helped with that."

We're also happy with the traction we have on Gemini search, particularly in the mobile sphere. As you know, through our alliance with Microsoft, we send 51% of our desktop traffic to Microsoft. Mobile is unencumbered. But as to the types of percentages we send to either Gemini or Google, those are confidential and we don't break them out. So we can't say much more there. Though I will say overall, we're really happy with the unique piece of technology that we've built that really assesses a user's query, their demographics, who they are and ultimately finds the right search provider both for algorithmic results as well as paid search results. And in terms of programmatic, the majority of our impressions are being sold through the programmatic sector. And the Exchange segment, in particular, is one of the largest segments of our display business, if not the largest. So we're seeing a lot of traction there. I think that on the whole, depending on how you measure it, either on revenue or an impression basis, I believe on an impression basis, about 70%, not in excess [ph] of that, is now being sold through programmatic channels. And so overall, we feel that it was important for us to take our inventory and shift it into these programmatic channels to really catch that wave despite the fact that it did cause pressure on our PPA, but a lot of those inventory shifts have now happened. And while we still experience some legacy drag, I'm told that it's somewhere on the order now of about $20 million a quarter, where that used to be at times almost $100 million a quarter or more of pricing pressure being introduced by mix shift to programmatic."

When we look at the landscape, one of the things we see is TV dollars are shifting to digital, and they are shifting into social in particular. That said, not unlike other shifts that have happened with advertising dollars in the past, it is lagging where the actual users and the actual -- the eyeballs and consumers are. So for example, we know that digital video surpassed television last year or at least time spent on all digital devices, including digital video, surpassed television last year in terms of time spent here in the United States. That said, we still are seeing more money spent on television than we're seeing spent in digital mediums. And so we think that over time that will follow, the advertising dollars will follow where the users are spending their time. But it's not unusual to see a lag like that. And from that -- to that end, that's why we've really focused on digital video, because we can see the types of budgets that advertisers deploy, the type of reach that they want that comes from the broadcast television media. And we can see that we need to offer something like that but even more measurable, even more targeted than you can get in that television platform and there's unique advantages in buying online. And so that's why we've been focused in increasing our video engagement and growing our network and third party as well as really working with advertisers to help them -- to help understand what would it take to transition some of those brand dollars off of television and into digital video. This is some of the experiments we've done with live streaming, and some of the unique content that we've had has really gone a long way in helping us understand the overall criteria, how they're going to think about that spend, how they're going to measure ROI, et cetera. And we've been lining up our products to benefit from that."

I'd also point out last year, we had TIPLA of $70 million per quarter, which effectively was all margin -- it was basically all bottom line margin. We no longer have TIPLA anymore. So that effect -- so you have a mix shift in terms of other revenue and the lack of the Alibaba TIPLA, which is significant, and you had -- which also contributed to the revenue reduction.

First off, the mobile app engagement that we see on Tumblr is growing really nicely. We're seeing growth in signed-in users, and we're overall seeing a lot of the users engaged in the mobile app. I believe it's nearing 90% of our daily active users are now engaging with the application on their phone in addition to desktop. In terms of the revenue side, we've taken various different approaches over the past year or 2 in terms of how we've activated the sales force and how we've gone to market. In particular, this quarter, we have made some good improvements. We've doubled down on Gemini, and so we are working hard to bring our Gemini formats into Tumblr. We think that they will monetize very well and provide good results for advertisers. They're a really attractive format of advertising both for the advertiser as well as for the community on Tumblr. But one of the things that's happening is our supply, because it's growing so quickly, is outpacing demand and is causing this monetization shortfall. So we've worked to introduce more Gemini demand. We think that the ad load in Tumblr is appropriate. It's really about bringing the demand to bear there. Towards the end of Q2, we activated the Facebook ad network, also known as FAN, as part of our backfill efforts in order to bring more advertisements to fill that ad load on Tumblr. And we also started to bring to bear some of our Exchange efforts in terms of our classic displays, what's known as our large rectangle ads or LREC ads onto Tumblr in appropriate places. And so while these may be at lower prices because there's not as much demand to keep up with supply, overall, we think that we're bringing -- we're activating the right demand channels to address the fact that supply has been outpacing demand. And on Mozilla, there's not a lot more that I can say because it is a confidential relationship. But we did want to point out because I think it has been misunderstood at least in some of the analyses I've seen. It has been misunderstood that there is a mitigation in the contract that ultimately would reduce some of our exposure and liabilities."
