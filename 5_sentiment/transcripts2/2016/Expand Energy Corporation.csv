We also have a few slides related to our call, as Brad noted, today that can be found on our website. 
Despite the challenging commodity market, we made significant progress in 2015. Further details regarding our financial and operational performance can be found in the press release. For the purpose of this call, I want to focus more specifically on our strategy and plans for 2016. I want to address today the primary issues facing the corporation and hopefully answer any questions you have about Chesapeake. 
To start, I'm very pleased with the meaningful progress and asset sales year-to-date. We have posed on our have under a purchasing sale agreement approximately $700 million of divestitures. This amount significantly exceeds our prior 2016 first quarter projection of $200 million to $300 million. The asset sale areas include properties that are covered by 3 BPPs or volumetric production payments and were used a portion of the proceeds to repurchase these BPPs at favorable prices and further reduce the complexity of our balance sheet. Net proceeds from these property sales will be approximately $500 million. 
In addition, we also have line of sight on a number $500 million to $1 billion of further asset sales that we expect to close by year-end. Due to the size and diversity Chesapeake's portfolio, we have received several inbound offers and sales inquiries for smaller, noncore, nonoperated properties from strategic buyers. These smaller packages can range anywhere from $10 million to $500 million with limited EBITDA and production. 
The interest level and larger $1 billion-plus size asset sales is very low in the current market. We expect to continue to make progress on several smaller asset divestitures, which, when taken together, can add up to meaningful amounts until we can evaluate the possibility of divesting a larger asset. 
The quality and diversity of our portfolio provides tremendous opportunities to further optimize our current assets and bring additional value forward. 
Secondly, we are addressing the operational leverage and commitments we have as a company. In 2015, we were able to renegotiate 2 gathering agreements with mutually beneficial solutions to Chesapeake in Williams in our Haynesville and dry gas Utica areas. In 2016, we'll continue to actively pursue improving our gathering and transportation costs, as demonstrated by 2 recently signed agreements with other midstream service providers. These 2 agreements will enhance our EBITDA by an additional $50 million this year through lower front transportation volume commitments and lower fees on certain pipelines in our Haynesville, Barnett and Eagle Ford areas. These achievements will primarily, with our midstream partner, energy transfer and were achieved by awarding additional business for services we need in our core basins at market rates. We continue to work with all of our midstream partners in each of our major operating areas to find cost-effective, mutually beneficial solutions reflective of the current operating environment. By leveraging Chesapeake's future midstream business opportunities for incremental dedications for gathering services, processing, fractionation, liquids handling and marketing, we expect to continue to negotiate improved gathering, processing and transportation costs for our company in 2016. 
Turning to our cost structure. In 2015, we reduced our production costs on a per barrel of oil equivalent basis by 10% compared to 2014. We also reduced our general and administrative cost per barrel of oil equivalent by 24% in 2015, including noncash stock-based compensation. 
Our confidence remains very high that we can continue to lower these costs even further in 2016, as we are targeting another 10% reduction in our production cost and a 15% reduction in our G&A costs on a BOE basis. 
On an absolute dollar basis, this represents a combined reduction of over $200 million compared to 2015. 
As we plan for 2016, our current capital program is 50% lower than in 2015 using the midpoint of our guidance. And we'll focus on shorter cash cycle projects that generate positive or rates of return in to this commodity price environment. The improving quality of our operations, our capital efficiency and lower service costs all give us incrementally positive point forward economics even with today's price deck. 
In 2016, we'll be focusing on more completions and less drilling, with our completion dollars representing 70% of our total billing and completion program. We plan to place 330 to 370 wells on production this year, resulting in a flat to moderate decline of 5% compared to 2015 adjusted for asset sales. 
Commodity prices are frontline for all of us, so we remain flexible in our capital program depending on prices and market conditions. 
Finally, we've made significant progress since the third quarter of 2015 to reduce our overall debt level by $2.2 billion through an exchange using second lien secured debt in December that also reduced cash interest expense due to redemption of convertible notes in November and through ongoing open-market purchases. This is a stunning accomplishment, and it's also no secret that we're looking forward to reducing our debt load even further in 2016. 
We expect continued pressure on commodity prices with the current deposition and the high operational leverage associated with our midstream commitments estimate the challenge of Chesapeake. However, we have multiple levers of available to us to further strengthen our financial and operational stability and strength. 
Lability management and issues are underway for 2016, asset sales are progressing and our capital efficiency and cost structure continue to improve. 
We will continue to demonstrate our commitment and passion to create value for our shareholders using all of our available resources in this current market. 
I'll now pass the call over to Nick who will share more with you regarding our balance sheet liquidity."

I want to start by addressing our strategy and managing our near-term maturities.

I want to start by addressing our strategy and managing our near-term maturities. 
We made significant progress in 2015 to reduce our overall debt level by $2.2 billion, primarily through an exchange using second lien secure debt in December that also reduced our cash interest expense. 
However, there is much more work to do. The primary focus for Chesapeake is the reduction or removal of our 2017 and 2018 debt maturities. We are pursuing several avenues to reduce these obligations, including the use of additional secured debt, private negotiations with bondholders and other types of exchange and tender offers. We will continue to be active in the market through exchange our repurchase our debt and reduce these principal balances even further. 
Turning to our liquidity. Our undrawn revolving credit facility that's just under $4 billion of availability to us with about $92 million of collateral posted. We went back to a secured facility in late September with our oil and gas assets acting as the collateral for the credit facility lenders. However, there were unencumbered assets and assets that been pledged to a collateralized hedge facility properties that were not pledged to the credit facility lenders. As of this month, our collateralized hedge facility has been terminated, which gives us more flexibility as we move into the spring redetermination season. 
If necessary, we can pledge our unencumbered assets and assets previously pledged to the hedge facility to be used as collateral for the credit facility lenders in April. 
As a result, we feel good about our ability to maintain robust liquidity to the upcoming borrowing base despite the significant drop in commodity price strips. 
We expect to end the month of February with approximately $300 million in cash on hand, which reflects having already used approximately $230 million of cash to retire bonds due March 15 at an average price below 95. This cash balance also reflects only $135 million of the approximately $700 million of asset sales Doug referred to in his comments that have already closed. The remainder of sales for which we signed purchasing sales agreements and expect to close between now and the end of the second quarter. Along with these spending sales, we will repurchase 3 of the company's press release sold volumetric production payments, RVPPs 2, 3 and 10 for approximately $200 million. The total projected net impact of these expected sales after purchasing the VPPs will be a reduction of approximately 25,000 barrels a day of equivalent production, which has been adjusted in our outlook provided this morning. 
We are pursuing additional asset sales targeted at $500 million to $1 billion of proceeds in 2016 to further improve our near-term liquidity. I look forward to updating you on our asset sales progress throughout the coming months. 
As you have seen in our press release, we have broken out our gathering, processing and transportation charges in a line item in the income statement to provide greater transparency into these costs. Previously, these were reported as deductions to oil and natural gas and NGL revenues. We continue to work to further reduce these costs expect to optimize additional gathering, processing and transportation agreements in 2016. 
As Doug noted in his comments, we're proud to announce that we recently competed an agreement to reduce our Haynesville transportation volume commitment and fees, primarily on energy transportation pipeline to better align with our volume profile, resulting in a $0.06 per MCF reduction in our total company gas gathering transportation cost in 2016. 
To further maximize our cash flow in 2016 and provide additional protection against even lower commodity prices, we have hedged over half of our projected natural gas production at approximately $2.84 per MCF and over half of our projected oil at approximately $47.74 per barrel. 
So to close, we have a lot of work to do to execute our strategy. We will rely on our extremely talented workforce, outstanding portfolio of oil and gas assets and strong partner relationships to adapt our challenges. Based on these strengths, we believe we can continue to adjust our business to reflect the new operating environment as a result of lower prices and return to significant profitability as a highly efficient developer of high-quality, unconventional U.S. oil and gas assets. 
We appreciate your time today. That concludes my comic, and I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions."

We also have a few slides related to our call, as Brad noted, today that can be found on our website. 
Despite the challenging commodity market, we made significant progress in 2015. Further details regarding our financial and operating performance can be found in the press release. For the purpose of this call, I want to focus more specifically on our strategy and plans for 2016. I want to address today the primary issues facing the corporation and hopefully answer any questions you have about Chesapeake. 
To start, I'm very pleased with the meaningful progress in asset sales year-to-date. We have closed on or have under a purchase and sale agreement approximately $700 million of divestitures. This amount significantly exceeds our prior 2016 first quarter projection of $200 million to $300 million. The asset sale areas include properties that are covered by 3 VPPs, or volumetric production payments, and were used, a portion of the proceeds, to repurchase these VPPs at favorable prices and further reduce the complexity of our balance sheet. Net proceeds from these property sales will be approximately $500 million. In addition, we also have line of sight on a number $500 million to $1 billion of further asset sales that we expect to close by year-end. 
Due to the size and diversity Chesapeake's portfolio, we have received several inbound offers and sales inquiries for smaller, noncore, nonoperated properties from strategic buyers. These smaller packages can range anywhere from $10 million to $500 million with limited EBITDA and production. The interest level and larger $1 billion-plus size asset sales is very low in the current market. We expect to continue to make progress on several smaller asset divestitures, which, when taken together, can add up to meaningful amounts until we can evaluate the possibility of divesting a larger asset. The quality and diversity of our portfolio provides tremendous opportunities to further optimize our current assets and bring additional value forward. 
Secondly, we are addressing the operational leverage and commitments we have as a company. In 2015, we're able to renegotiate 2 gathering agreements with mutually beneficial solutions to Chesapeake and Williams in our Haynesville and dry gas Utica areas. In 2016, we'll continue to actively pursue improving our gathering and transportation costs as demonstrated by 2 recently signed agreements with other midstream service providers. These 2 agreements will enhance our EBITDA by an additional $50 million this year through lower firm transportation volume commitments and lower fees on certain pipelines in our Haynesville, Barnett and Eagle Ford areas. 
These achievements were primarily with our midstream partner, Energy Transfer, and were achieved by awarding additional business for services we need in our core basins at market rates. We continue to work with all of our midstream partners in each of our major operating areas to find cost-effective, mutually beneficial solutions reflective of the current operating environment. By leveraging Chesapeake's future midstream business opportunities for incremental dedications for gathering services, processing, fractionation, liquids handling and marketing, we expect to continue to negotiate improved gathering, processing and transportation costs for our company in 2016. 
Turning to our cost structure. In 2015, we reduced our production costs on a per barrel of oil equivalent basis by 10% compared to 2014. We also reduced our general and administrative cost per barrel oil equivalent by 24% in 2015, including noncash stock-based compensation. Our confidence remains very high that we can continue to lower these costs even further in 2016 as we're targeting another 10% reduction in our production cost and a 15% reduction in our G&A costs on a BOE basis. On an absolute dollar basis, this represents a combined reduction of over $200 million compared to 2015. 
As we plan for 2016, our current capital program is 50% lower than in 2015 using the midpoint of our guidance and will focus on shorter cash cycle projects that generate positive rates of return in today's commodity price environment. The improving quality of our operations, our capital efficiency and lower service costs all give us incrementally positive point-forward economics even with today's price deck. 
In 2016, we'll be focusing on more completions and less drilling with our completion dollars representing 70% of our total billing in completion program. We plan to place 330 to 370 wells on production this year, resulting in a flat to modest decline of 5% compared to 2015 adjusted for asset sales. Commodity prices are front in line for all of us. So we remain flexible in our capital program depending on prices and market conditions. 
And finally, we've made significant progress since the third quarter of 2015 to reduce our overall debt level by $2.2 billion through an exchange using second lien secured debt in December that also reduced cash interest expense due to redemption of convertible notes in November into ongoing open-market purchases. This is a stunning accomplishment, and it's also no secret that we're looking forward to reducing our debt load even further in 2016. 
We expect continued pressure on commodity prices. The current deposition and the high operational leverage associated with our midstream commitments exacerbate the challenge here at Chesapeake. However, we have multiple levers available to us to further strengthen our financial and operational stability and strength. Lability management and issues are underway for 2016, asset sales are progressing and our capital efficiency and cost structure continue to improve. We'll continue to demonstrate our commitment and passion to create value for our shareholders using all of our available resources in this current market.
I'll now pass the call to Nick, who'll share more with you regarding our balance sheet and liquidity."

I want to start by addressing our strategy in managing our near-term maturities.

I want to start by addressing our strategy in managing our near-term maturities. We made significant progress in 2015 to reduce our overall debt level by $2.2 billion, primarily through an exchange using second lien secure debt in December that also reduced our cash interest expense. However, there is much more work to do. The primary focus for Chesapeake is the reduction or removal of our 2017 and 2018 debt maturities. We are pursuing several avenues to reduce these obligations, including the use of additional secured debt, private negotiations with bondholders and other types of exchange and tender offers. We will continue to be active in the market through exchange or repurchase our debt and reduce these principal balances even further. 
Turning to our liquidity. Our undrawn revolving credit facility is just under $4 billion of availability to us with about $92 million of LCs and collateral posted. We went back to a secured facility in late September with our oil and gas assets acting as the collateral for the credit facility lenders. However, there were unencumbered assets and assets that have been pledged to our collateralized hedge facility properties that were not pledged to the credit facility lenders. As of this month, our collateralized hedge facility has been terminated, which gives us more flexibility as we move into the spring redetermination season. If necessary, we can pledge our unencumbered assets and assets previously pledged to the hedge facility to be used as collateral for the credit facility lenders in April. As a result, we feel good about our ability to maintain robust liquidity through the upcoming borrowing base despite the significant drop in commodity price strips. 
We expect to end the month of February with approximately $300 million in cash on hand, which reflects having already used approximately $230 million of cash to retire bonds due March 15 at an average price below 95. This cash balance also reflects only $135 million of the approximately $700 million of asset sales Doug referred to in his comments that have already closed, the remainder of sales for which we have signed purchase and sales agreements and expect to close between now and the end of the second quarter. 
Along with these pending sales, we will repurchase 3 of the company's previously sold volumetric production payments, or VPPs 2, 3 and 10, for approximately $200 million. The total projected net impact of these expected sales after purchasing the VPPs will be a reduction of approximately 25,000 barrels a day of equivalent production, which has been adjusted in our outlook provided this morning. We are pursuing additional asset sales targeted at $500 million to $1 billion of proceeds in 2016 to further improve our near-term liquidity. I look forward to updating you on our asset sales progress throughout the coming months. 
As you have seen in our press release, we have broken out our gathering, processing and transportation charges in a line item in the income statement to provide greater transparency into these costs. Previously, these were reported as deductions to oil and natural gas and NGL revenues. We continue to work to further reduce these costs and expect to optimize additional gathering, processing and transportation agreements in 2016. 
As Doug noted in his comments, we're proud to announce that we recently competed an agreement to reduce our Haynesville transportation volume commitment and fees, primarily on Energy Transfer's Tiger Pipeline to better align with our volume profile, resulting in a $0.06 per Mcf reduction in our total company gas gathering and transportation costs in 2016. To further maximize our cash flow in 2016 and provide additional protection against even lower commodity prices, we have hedged over half of our projected natural gas production at approximately $2.84 per Mcf and over half of our projected oil at approximately $47.74 per barrel. 
So to close, we have a lot of work to do to execute our strategy. We will rely on our extremely talented workforce, outstanding portfolio of oil and gas assets and strong partner relationships to attack our challenges. Based on these strengths, we believe we can continue to adjust our business to reflect the new operating environment as a result of lower prices and return to significant profitability as a highly efficient developer of high-quality, unconventional U.S. oil and gas assets. 
We appreciate your time today. That concludes my comments, and I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions."

We also have brought in counsel that's pretty adept at debt exchanges and other more complicated transactions around balance sheet restructurings like this, whether restructurings in that context to me could mean a lot of things, and debt exchanges are more much more complicated than your regular way transactions. And it makes a lot of sense to have counsel around that works on these types of things on a regular basis, and it's very, very helpful in navigating all the things that need to be considered when going through this type of an effort. We have debt security to trade at significant discount. There are real opportunity in that. And we're going to continue to think through the various avenues the company can take to deal with the near-term maturities we have by capturing some of that discount that's there and position the company for better success in years to come."

The operating synergies, capital efficiencies, the recoveries that we see, productivity on a per-well basis, our asset position and opportunity to drive value very quick there, I think, is as good or better than anyone in the industry. But that all has to be tempered with we have to be very mindful of our financial position and make sure that we're making the best investments across the portfolio, which could include still working on the balance sheet. So no commitment on how we will respond in '17 at this point in time with higher prices, but definitely want to be as balanced as we possibly can be using asset sales as a measure to help with that activity and as a measure to help buy down debt at a discount."

I hope you got the opportunity to review our press release issued earlier this morning. We also have a few slides related to our call, as Brad noted today, that can be found on our website. Despite the challenging comm",957,"Thank you, Brad, and good morning. I hope you got the opportunity to review our press release issued earlier this morning. We also have a few slides related to our call, as Brad noted today, that can be found on our website. 
Despite the challenging commodity market, we made significant progress in 2015. Further details regarding our financial and operating performance can be found in the press release. For the purpose of this call, I want to focus more specifically on our strategy and plans for 2016. I want to address today the primary issues facing the corporation and hopefully answer any questions you have about Chesapeake. 
To start, I'm very pleased with the meaningful progress in asset sales year-to-date. We have closed on or have under a purchase and sale agreement approximately $700 million of divestitures. This amount significantly exceeds our prior 2016 first quarter projection of $200 million to $300 million. The asset sale areas include properties that are covered by 3 VPPs, or volumetric production payments, and we will use a portion of the proceeds to repurchase these VPPs at favorable prices and further reduce the complexity of our balance sheet. Net proceeds from these property sales will be approximately $500 million. In addition, we also have line of sight on another $500 million to $1 billion of further asset sales that we expect to close by year-end. 
Due to the size and diversity of Chesapeake's portfolio, we have received several inbound offers and sales inquiries for smaller, noncore, nonoperated properties from strategic buyers. These smaller packages can range anywhere from $10 million to $500 million with limited EBITDA and production. The interest level in larger $1 billion-plus size asset sales is very low in the current market. We expect to continue to make progress on several smaller asset divestitures, which, when taken together, can add up to meaningful amounts, until we can evaluate the possibility of divesting a larger asset. The quality and diversity of our portfolio provides tremendous opportunities to further optimize our current assets and bring additional value forward. 
Secondly, we are addressing the operational leverage and commitments we have as a company. In 2015, we're able to renegotiate 2 gathering agreements with mutually beneficial solutions to Chesapeake and Williams in our Haynesville and dry gas Utica areas. In 2016, we'll continue to actively pursue improving our gathering and transportation costs as demonstrated by 2 recently signed agreements with other midstream service providers. These 2 agreements will enhance our EBITDA by an additional $50 million this year through lower firm transportation volume commitments and lower fees on certain pipelines in our Haynesville, Barnett and Eagle Ford areas. 
These achievements were primarily with our midstream partner, Energy Transfer, and were achieved by awarding additional business for services we need in our core basins at market rates. We continue to work with all of our midstream partners in each of our major operating areas to find cost-effective, mutually beneficial solutions reflective of the current operating environment. By leveraging Chesapeake's future midstream business opportunities for incremental dedications for gathering services, processing, fractionation, liquids handling and marketing, we expect to continue to negotiate improved gathering, processing and transportation costs for our company in 2016. 
Turning to our cost structure. In 2015, we reduced our production costs on a per barrel of oil equivalent basis by 10% compared to 2014. We also reduced our general and administrative cost per barrel oil equivalent by 24% in 2015, including noncash stock-based compensation. Our confidence remains very high that we can continue to lower these costs even further in 2016 as we're targeting another 10% reduction in our production cost and a 15% reduction in our G&A costs on a BOE basis. On an absolute dollar basis, this represents a combined reduction of over $200 million compared to 2015. 
As we plan for 2016, our current capital program is 50% lower than in 2015 using the midpoint of our guidance, and we'll focus on shorter cash-cycle projects that generate positive rates of return in today's commodity price environment. The improving quality of our operations, our capital efficiency and lower service costs all give us incrementally positive point-forward economics even with today's price deck. 
In 2016, we'll be focusing on more completions and less drilling, with our completion dollars representing 70% of our total drilling and completion program. We plan to place 330 to 370 wells on production this year, resulting in a flat to modest decline of 5% compared to 2015, adjusted for asset sales. Commodity prices are front of mind for all of us, so we remain flexible in our capital program, depending on prices and market conditions. 
And finally, we've made significant progress since the third quarter of 2015 to reduce our overall debt level by $2.2 billion through an exchange using second lien secured debt in December that also reduced cash interest expense due to redemption of convertible notes in November and through ongoing open-market purchases. This is a stunning accomplishment, and it's also no secret that we're looking forward to reducing our debt load even further in 2016. 
We expect continued pressure on commodity prices. The current deposition and the high operational leverage associated with our midstream commitments exacerbate the challenge here at Chesapeake. However, we have multiple levers available to us to further strengthen our financial and operational stability and strength. Liability management initiatives are underway for 2016, asset sales are progressing and our capital efficiency and cost structure continue to improve. We'll continue to demonstrate our commitment and passion to create value for our shareholders using all of our available resources in this current market.
I'll now pass the call to Nick, who'll share more with you regarding our balance sheet and liquidity."

I want to start by addressing our strategy in managing our near-term maturities. We made significant progress in 2015 to reduce our overall debt level by $2.2 billion, primarily through an exchange using second",747,"Thank you, Doug, and good morning, everyone. I want to start by addressing our strategy in managing our near-term maturities. We made significant progress in 2015 to reduce our overall debt level by $2.2 billion, primarily through an exchange using second lien secure debt in December that also reduced our cash interest expense. However, there is much more work to do. The primary focus for Chesapeake is the reduction or removal of our 2017 and 2018 debt maturities. We are pursuing several avenues to reduce these obligations, including the use of additional secured debt, private negotiations with bondholders and other types of exchange and tender offers. We will continue to be active in the market to exchange or repurchase our debt and reduce these principal balances even further. 
Turning to our liquidity. Our undrawn revolving credit facility is just under $4 billion of availability to us, with about $92 million of LCs and collateral posted. We went back to a secured facility in late September, with our oil and gas assets acting as the collateral for the credit facility lenders. However, there were unencumbered assets and assets that have been pledged to our collateralized hedge facility properties that were not pledged to the credit facility lenders. As of this month, our collateralized hedge facility has been terminated, which gives us more flexibility as we move into the spring redetermination season. If necessary, we can pledge our unencumbered assets and assets previously pledged to the hedge facility to be used as collateral for the credit facility lenders in April. As a result, we feel good about our ability to maintain robust liquidity through the upcoming borrowing base despite the significant drop in commodity price strips. 
We expect to end the month of February with approximately $300 million in cash on hand, which reflects having already used approximately $230 million of cash to retire bonds due March 15 at an average price below 95. This cash balance also reflects only $135 million of the approximately $700 million of asset sales Doug referred to in his comments that have already closed. The remainder are sales for which we have signed purchase and sales agreements and expect to close between now and the end of the second quarter. 
Along with these pending sales, we will repurchase 3 of the company's previously sold volumetric production payments, or VPPs 2, 3 and 10, for approximately $200 million. The total projected net impact of these expected sales after purchasing the VPPs will be a reduction of approximately 25,000 barrels a day of equivalent production, which has been adjusted in our outlook provided this morning. We are pursuing additional asset sales targeted at $500 million to $1 billion of proceeds in 2016 to further improve our near-term liquidity. I look forward to updating you on our asset sales progress throughout the coming months. 
As you have seen in our press release, we have broken out our gathering, processing and transportation charges in a line item in the income statement to provide greater transparency into these costs. Previously, these were reported as deductions to oil and natural gas and NGL revenues. We continue to work to further reduce these costs and expect to optimize additional gathering, processing and transportation agreements in 2016. 
As Doug noted in his comments, we're proud to announce that we recently competed an agreement to reduce our Haynesville transportation volume commitment and fees, primarily on Energy Transfer's Tiger Pipeline, to better align with our volume profile, resulting in a $0.06 per Mcf reduction in our total company gas gathering and transportation costs in 2016. To further maximize our cash flow in 2016 and provide additional protection against even lower commodity prices, we have hedged over half of our projected natural gas production at approximately $2.84 per Mcf and over half of our projected oil at approximately $47.74 per barrel. 
So to close, we have a lot of work to do to execute our strategy. We will rely on our extremely talented workforce, outstanding portfolio of oil and gas assets and strong partner relationships to attack our challenges. Based on these strengths, we believe we can continue to adjust our business to reflect the new operating environment as a result of lower prices, and return to significant profitability as a highly efficient developer of high-quality, unconventional U.S. oil and gas assets. 
We appreciate your time today. That concludes my comments, and I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions."

The operating synergies, capital efficiencies, the recoveries that we see, productivity on a per-well basis, our asset position and opportunity to drive value very quick there, I think, is as good or better than anyone in the industry. But that all has to be tempered with we have to be very mindful of our financial position and make sure that we're making the best investments across the portfolio, which could include still working on the balance sheet.

I trust everyone's had an opportunity to review our press release this morning. We continue to make solid progress in reducing our cost and strengthening our balance sheet and optimizing our portfolio. Starting with the portfolio, year-to-date, we closed or have undersigned the purchase and sale agreements of approximately $1.2 billion of gross sales proceeds. This is up approximately $500 million from our earnings call in February. As previously discussed, certain of these reductions are contingent upon the repurchase of VPPs, so net proceeds from these property sales will be approximately $950 million. On the February earnings call, we guided to an additional $500 million to $1 billion in gross proceeds by year-end 2016. With our announcement this morning, we've already achieved the lower end of that range. In February, we stated that the closed sales and signed purchase and sale agreements targeted smaller noncore, nonoperating properties. As noted in today's press release, we are divesting to Newfield exploration a portion of our STACK acreage in Northern Oklahoma for approximately $470 million, maintain the objective of divesting smaller noncore assets, and in this case, principally nonoperated acreage. While we believe the play is highly economic in today's prices, the value acceleration from this currently undeveloped principally nonoperating acreage position is highly accretive and allows us to direct cash to our balance sheet, creating greater value for our shareholders. The year-to-date asset sale agreements have minimal impact on 2016 and 2017 production and EBITDA. 
For 2016, total production is projected to be reduced by roughly 5% due to the announced sales of approximately 35,000 barrels of oil equivalent production per day, of which roughly 60% of that represents gas production. The 2016 EBITDA impact is also minimal, currently estimated to be approximately $20 million using today's strip pricing. We continue to focus on improving our margins not only by adjusting the cost side of our business but also working to reduce our operational leverage in midstream commitments. Our operating and G&A cost continue to fall and together were 28% lower in the first quarter on a per barrel of oil equivalent basis compared to the first quarter of 2015. We intend to further expand our margins through continued discussions with our midstream and downstream partners on several funds to find mutually beneficial solutions that will increase EBITDA. These efforts are ongoing as we speak, and we believe we will have more to share as the year progresses. Nick will speak more about our balance sheet and liquidity in a moment, but I wanted to note that we successfully reduced debt that matures in 2017 or that can be put to us in 2017 by $282 million in the first quarter. With the potential for additional debt exchanges open market repurchases and the capability issue additional secured debt, in addition to our sufficient liquidity, we have several tools, as you can see, at our disposal to handle our 2017 maturity obligations. 
In closing, Chesapeake continues the ground game progress, working hard to advance our strategies on improving our financial and operational strength. This process and journey begins with each highly motivated Chesapeake employee. Our employees have worked exceptionally hard over the past 3 years to improve our company, both operationally and financially. We're actively working on liability management initiatives, and our balance sheet is getting leaner and less complex. Asset sales are progressing and are providing additional fuel for our collective efforts. I want to thank all of our shareholders during this difficult and tough times, and I encourage other investors to keep your eye on Chesapeake. Our outstanding employees combined with high quality assets, industry-leading capital efficiency, cash cost leadership and further balance sheet improvements will drive further value creation. We look forward discussing further progress on all these fronts throughout the year prepare for operating in a time of greater commodity price stability. 
I'll now pass the call to Nick, and we'll open the call up for a few questions."

As Doug has stated, our priority is the continued refinancing, exchanging and reduction of debt from our balance sheet, specifically debt maturing in the next 18 to 24 months. We continue to look at all our options, including the use of additional secured debt, private transactions with bondholders and other types of exchange offers and open market purchases to manage these maturities. As you're aware, in April, we amended our revolving credit facility to receive significant relief on our covenants and expand our flexibility with respect to issuing new secured debt while reaffirming the $4 billion borrowing base through at least March of 2017. In return, we pledged additional properties. 
As of March 31, we had approximately $619 million of revolver capacity utilized for letters of credit, the majority of which we're supporting to surety bond related to our 2019 notes litigation. So while we are pleased to sure up our current liquidity position, we are squarely focused on utilizing the flexibility granted under our credit facility amendment to refinance or exchange our pending 2017 and 2018 debt maturities. On the expense side, we expect our cash cost, in aggregate, to continue to decline throughout the year. You may have seen in our outlook that we lowered our production expense guidance due to additional cost savings. We've also assisted our total gathering, processing and transportation expense estimate down due to lower cost we are stating for both gas and NGLs, partially offset by higher stabilization fees for our Utica oil. The reduced cost on GAAP and NGLs as a result of closer alignment with our midstream partners on future capital expenditures as well as optimizing usage of contract and negotiations. The oil stabilization fees will allow us to reduce vapor pressure and improve ATI, providing more marketing options to downstream pipes and access to better prices. As a result, we expect to see our basis for oil improved throughout the year. 
As Doug mentioned, we continue to have meaningful dialogue with our midstream and downstream partners to further reduce and optimize our gathering, processing and transportation agreements. We will keep you posted on any new announcement as they happen.
We also increased our interest expense guidance recognized on the income statement due to a decrease in expected capitalized interest, so that change will have no cash impact. Since we last spoke to you in February, we've layered on additional hedges for 2016 to help increase our cash flow. We have approximately 476 Bcf of our remaining 2016 gas production hedged at $2.71 and approximately 18.2 million barrels of our remaining 2016 oil production hedged at $46.32 per barrel, representing 64% and 69% of our Q2 through Q4 2016 gas and oil volumes, respectively. We've also started to add some 2017 hedges at recent prices.
So to close, we're continuing to deliver on our 2016 finance we outlined in February to maximize liquidity, optimize our portfolio, increase EBITDA and reduce our debt.
We have achieved a bit more success in the market with our announcement this morning, and that has no impact on our borrowing base under our revolving credit facility. We are attacking the challenges of our financial and operational leverage and continue to work on many fronts to make Chesapeake a stronger company regardless of commodity prices. We look forward to be able to talk with you about this later this year.
That concludes my comments. I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions."

What we know here is that this position is for Chesapeake the amount of funding that we're going to put towards in the near term and the value-acceleration opportunity was just compelling for us at this point in time. And so bringing those proceeds versus investing the capital over a multiyear period for Chesapeake, it was in our best interest to divest of the property.

What's great about that for me is a couple of years ago when I came into the role, it seems we were making 40,500-foot laterals at $8.5 million a well. So we've seen walls that are twice as productive at the same cost we were 2 years ago, so a huge efficiency gain for us. Because of our agreement with Williams, we'll continue to run 3 rigs there.

We have 1.5 million acres there.  So we got really strong economics there, and then our Eagle Ford has experienced a renaissance as well with the longer laterals. So those are still preferentially spending more dollars. Those plays look really strong. In the Haynesville, again, we're continuing to improve. We're getting close to 20% returns at the strip here. So -- and it's hard to explain how impactful these long laterals have been to that play out there because we're getting -- we see no degradation in performance with these 10,000-foot wells, so we're getting double the production for effectively half the cost out there. We also have a new play there. I didn't mention in my first set of comments you got our first 7,500-foot Bossier well that's flowing today, and it's 17 million cubic feet a day at 7,300 pounds. I mean, there's a lot of exciting things going on the Haynesville, but our Eagle Ford team, they're drilling -- plan to drill for this year 9800-foot well on average, which is nearly double what they were a couple of years ago. So their returns have gone through the roof, and we're actually -- our returns today in Eagle Ford and the current cost are about the same as when oil was $80. I mean it's just significant how much of a change the Eagle Ford team has made there. We had wells coming on a year ago at 500 barrels a day, latest well coming on close to 1,000 barrels a day. So we've had just a huge transformation in the Eagle Ford team this first quarter here that for me, again, if I'm finding capital, that's the area I want to send it first."

I trust everyone has had an opportunity to review our press release this morning. We continue to make solid progress in reducing our costs, strengthening our balance sheet and optimizing our portfolio. Starting with the portfolio, year-to-date, we closed or have undersigned purchase and sale agreements of approximately $1.2 billion of gross sales proceeds. This is up approximately $500 million from our earnings call in February. As previously discussed, certain of these reductions are contingent upon the repurchase of VPPs, so net proceeds from these property sales will be approximately $950 million. On the February earnings call, we guided to an additional $500 million to $1 billion in gross proceeds by year-end 2016. With our announcement this morning, we've already achieved the lower end of that range. In February, we stated that the closed sales and signed purchase and sale agreements targeted smaller noncore, nonoperated properties. As noted in today's press release, we are divesting to Newfield Exploration a portion of our STACK acreage positioned in Northern Oklahoma for approximately $470 million, maintaining the objective of divesting smaller noncore assets, and in this case, principally nonoperated acreage. While we believe the play is highly economic in today's prices, the value acceleration from this currently undeveloped principally nonoperated acreage position is highly accretive and allows us to direct cash to our balance sheet, creating greater value for our shareholders. The year-to-date asset sale agreements have minimal impact on 2016 and 2017 production and EBITDA.
For 2016, total production is projected to be reduced by roughly 5%, due to the announced sales, or approximately 35,000 barrels of oil equivalent production per day, of which roughly 60% of that represents gas production. The 2016 EBITDA impact is also minimal, currently estimated to be approximately $20 million using today's strip pricing. We continue to focus on improving our margins not only by addressing the cost side of our business but also working to reduce our operational leverage in midstream commitments. Our operating and G&A cost continue to fall, and together we're 28% lower in the first quarter on a per barrel of oil equivalent basis compared to the first quarter of 2015. We intend to further expand our margins through continued discussions with our midstream and downstream partners on several funds to find mutually beneficial solutions that will increase EBITDA. These efforts are ongoing as we speak, and we believe we will have more to share as the year progresses. Nick will speak more about our balance sheet and liquidity in a moment, but I wanted to note that we successfully reduced debt that matures in 2017 or that can be put to us in 2017 by $282 million in the first quarter. With the potential for additional debt exchanges, open market repurchases and the capability to issue additional secured debt, in addition to our sufficient liquidity, we have several tools, as you can see, at our disposal to handle our 2017 maturity obligations.
In closing, Chesapeake continues the ground game progress, working hard to advance our strategies, while improving our financial and operational strength. This process and journey begins with each highly motivated Chesapeake employee. Our employees have worked exceptionally hard over the past 3 years to improve our company, both operationally and financially. We're actively working on liability management initiatives, and our balance sheet is getting leaner and less complex. Asset sales are progressing and are providing additional fuel for our collective efforts. I want to thank all of our shareholders who have stayed with us during these difficult and tough times, and I encourage other investors to keep your eye on Chesapeake. Our outstanding employees combined with high quality assets, industry-leading capital efficiency, cash cost leadership and further balance sheet improvements will drive further value creation. We look forward in discussing further progress on all these fronts throughout the year as we prepare for operating in a time of greater commodity price stability.
I'll now pass the call to Nick, and then, we'll open the call up for a few questions."

As Doug has stated, our priority is the continued refinancing, exchanging and reduction of debt from our balance sheet, specifically debt maturing in the next 18 to 24 months. We continue to look at all other options, including the use of additional secured debt, private transactions with bondholders and other types of exchange offers and open market purchases to manage these maturities. As you're aware, in April, we amended our revolving credit facility to receive significant relief on our covenants and expand our flexibility with respect to issuing new secured debt while reaffirming the $4 billion borrowing base through at least March of 2017. In return, we pledged additional properties.
As of March 31, we had approximately $619 million of revolver capacity utilized for letters of credit, the majority of which we're supporting to surety bond related to our 2019 notes litigation. So while we are pleased to [indiscernible] our current liquidity position, we are squarely focused on utilizing the flexibility granted under our credit facility amendment to refinance or exchange our pending 2017 and 2018 debt maturities. On the expense side, we expect our cash cost, in aggregate, to continue to decline throughout the year. You may have seen in our outlook that we lowered our production expense guidance due to additional cost savings. We've also adjusted our total gathering, processing and transportation expense estimate down due to lower cost we are seeing for both gas and NGLs, partially offset by higher stabilization fees for our Utica oil. The reduced cost on GAAP and NGLs are the result of closer alignment with our midstream partners on future capital expenditures as well as optimizing usage of contracts and negotiations. The oil stabilization fees will allow us to reduce vapor pressure and improve API, providing more marketing options to downstream pipes and access to better prices. As a result, we expect to see our basis for oil improved throughout the year.
As Doug mentioned, we continue to have meaningful dialogue with our midstream and downstream partners to further reduce and optimize our gathering, processing and transportation agreements. We will keep you posted on any new announcements as they happen. We also increased our interest expense guidance recognized on the income statement due to a decrease in expected capitalized interest, so that change will have no cash impact. 
Since we last spoke to you in February, we've layered on additional hedges for 2016 to help increase our cash flow. We have approximately 476 Bcf of our remaining 2016 gas production hedged at $2.71 and approximately 18.2 million barrels of our remaining 2016 oil production hedged at $46.32 per barrel, representing 64% and 69% of our Q2 through Q4 2016 gas and oil volumes, respectively. We've also started to add some 2017 hedges at recent prices.
So to close, we're continuing to deliver on our 2016 finance we outlined in February to maximize liquidity, optimize our portfolio, increase EBITDA and reduce our debt.
We have achieved a bit more success in the A&D market with our announcement this morning, and that has no impact on our borrowing base under our revolving credit facility. We are attacking the challenges of our financial and operational leverage and continue to work on many fronts to make Chesapeake a stronger company, regardless of commodity prices. We look forward being able to talk with you about this later this year.
That concludes my comments. I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions."

We still have approximately half of our STACK acreage in the play with other significant opportunities, as noted in the past, in particular, like Oswego, that we still really like and encouraged by. What we know here is that this position for Chesapeake, the amount of funding that we're going to put towards it in the near term and the value-acceleration opportunity, was just compelling for us at this point in time. And so bringing those proceeds in versus investing the capital over a multiyear period for Chesapeake, it was in our best interest to divest of the property. So as we evaluate other assets, the noncore areas that were -- in many cases are nonoperated properties, we'll continue to look for those, to continue to plant those seeds towards our capital structure or other corporate investments.

What's great about that for me is a couple of years ago when I came into the role, it seems we were making 40,500-foot laterals at $8.5 million a well. So we've seen wells that are twice as productive at the same cost we were 2 years ago, so that's been a huge efficiency gain for us.

So those are still preferentially for spending more dollars. Those plays always look really strong. In the Haynesville, again, we're continuing to improve. We're getting close to 20% returns at the strip here. So -- and it's hard to explain how impactful these long laterals have been to that play out there, because we're getting -- we are seeing no degradation in performance with these 10,000-foot wells, so we're getting double the production for effectively half the cost out there. We also have a new play there. I didn't mention in my first set of comments. We've got our first 7,500-foot Bossier well that's flowing today, and it's 17 million cubic feet a day at 7,300 pounds. I mean, there's a lot of exciting things going on the Haynesville, but our Eagle Ford team, they're drilling -- plan to drill for this year 9,800-foot well on average, which is nearly double what they were a couple of years ago. So their returns have gone through the roof, and we're actually -- our returns today in Eagle Ford with the current cost are about the same as when oil was $80. I mean it's just significant how much of a change the Eagle Ford team has made there. We had wells coming on a year ago at 500 barrels a day, latest wells are coming on close to 1,000 barrels a day.

I trust everyone has had an opportunity to review our press release this morning. We continue to make solid progress in reducing our costs, strengthening our balance sheet and optimizing our portfolio. Starting with the portfolio, year-to-date, we closed or have undersigned purchase and sale agreements of approximately $1.2 billion of gross sales proceeds. This is up approximately $500 million from our earnings call in February. As previously discussed, certain of these reductions are contingent upon the repurchase of VPPs, so net proceeds from these property sales will be approximately $950 million. On the February earnings call, we guided to an additional $500 million to $1 billion in gross proceeds by year-end 2016. With our announcement this morning, we've already achieved the lower end of that range. 
In February, we stated that the closed sales and signed purchase and sale agreements targeted smaller noncore, nonoperated properties. As noted in today's press release, we are divesting to Newfield Exploration a portion of our STACK acreage positioned in Northern Oklahoma for approximately $470 million, maintaining the objective of divesting smaller noncore assets, and in this case, principally nonoperated acreage. While we believe the play is highly economic in today's prices, the value acceleration from this currently undeveloped principally nonoperated acreage position is highly accretive and allows us to direct cash to our balance sheet, creating greater value for our shareholders. The year-to-date asset sale agreements have minimal impact on 2016 and 2017 production and EBITDA. For 2016, total production is projected to be reduced by roughly 5%, due to the announced sales, or approximately 35,000 barrels of oil equivalent production per day, of which roughly 60% of that represents gas production. The 2016 EBITDA impact is also minimal, currently estimated to be approximately $20 million using today's strip pricing. 
We continue to focus on improving our margins not only by addressing the cost side of our business but also working to reduce our operational leverage in midstream commitments. Our operating and G&A cost continue to fall, and together we're 28% lower in the first quarter on a per barrel of oil equivalent basis compared to the first quarter of 2015. We intend to further expand our margins through continued discussions with our midstream and downstream partners on several funds to find mutually beneficial solutions that will increase EBITDA. These efforts are ongoing as we speak, and we believe we will have more to share as the year progresses. Nick will speak more about our balance sheet and liquidity in a moment, but I wanted to note that we successfully reduced debt that matures in 2017 or that can be put to us in 2017 by $282 million in the first quarter. With the potential for additional debt exchanges, open market repurchases and the capability to issue additional secured debt, in addition to our sufficient liquidity, we have several tools, as you can see, at our disposal to handle our 2017 maturity obligations.
In closing, Chesapeake continues the ground game progress, working hard to advance our strategies, while improving our financial and operational strength. This process and journey begins with each highly motivated Chesapeake employee. Our employees have worked exceptionally hard over the past 3 years to improve our company, both operationally and financially. We're actively working on liability management initiatives, and our balance sheet is getting leaner and less complex. Asset sales are progressing and are providing additional fuel for our collective efforts. I want to thank all of our shareholders who have stayed with us during these difficult and tough times, and I encourage other investors to keep your eye on Chesapeake. Our outstanding employees combined with high quality assets, industry-leading capital efficiency, cash cost leadership and further balance sheet improvements will drive further value creation. We look forward in discussing further progress on all these fronts throughout the year as we prepare for operating in a time of greater commodity price stability.
I'll now pass the call to Nick, and then we'll open the call up for a few questions."
323857,331549294,974023,"Chesapeake Energy Corporation, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 05, 2016",2016-05-05,"Earnings Calls","Expand Energy Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Doug, and good morning, everyone. As Doug has stated, our priority is the continued refinancing, exchanging and reduction of debt from our balance sheet, specifically debt maturing in the next 18 to 24 months. We continue to look at all other o",587,"Thank you, Doug, and good morning, everyone. As Doug has stated, our priority is the continued refinancing, exchanging and reduction of debt from our balance sheet, specifically debt maturing in the next 18 to 24 months. We continue to look at all other options, including the use of additional secured debt, private transactions with bondholders and other types of exchange offers and open market purchases to manage these maturities. As you're aware, in April, we amended our revolving credit facility to receive significant relief on our covenants and expand our flexibility with respect to issuing new secured debt while reaffirming the $4 billion borrowing base through at least March of 2017. In return, we pledged additional properties.
As of March 31, we had approximately $619 million of revolver capacity utilized for letters of credit, the majority of which we're supporting to surety bond related to our 2019 notes litigation. So while we are pleased to have shored up our current liquidity position, we are squarely focused on utilizing the flexibility granted under our credit facility amendment to refinance or exchange our pending 2017 and 2018 debt maturities. On the expense side, we expect our cash cost, in aggregate, to continue to decline throughout the year. You may have seen in our outlook that we lowered our production expense guidance due to additional cost savings. We've also adjusted our total gathering, processing and transportation expense estimate down due to lower cost we are seeing for both gas and NGLs, partially offset by higher stabilization fees for our Utica oil. The reduced costs on gas and NGLs are the result of closer alignment with our midstream partners on future capital expenditures as well as optimizing usage of contracts and negotiations. The oil stabilization fees will allow us to reduce vapor pressure and improve API, providing more marketing options to downstream pipes and access to better prices. As a result, we expect to see our basis for oil improve throughout the year.
As Doug mentioned, we continue to have meaningful dialogue with our midstream and downstream partners to further reduce and optimize our gathering, processing and transportation agreements. We will keep you posted on any new announcements as they happen. We also increased our interest expense guidance recognized on the income statement due to a decrease in expected capitalized interest, so that change will have no cash impact. 
Since we last spoke to you in February, we've layered on additional hedges for 2016 to help increase our cash flow. We have approximately 476 Bcf of our remaining 2016 gas production hedged at $2.71 and approximately 18.2 million barrels of our remaining 2016 oil production hedged at $46.32 per barrel, representing 64% and 69% of our Q2 through Q4 2016 gas and oil volumes, respectively. We've also started to add some 2017 hedges at recent prices. 
So to close, we're continuing to deliver on our 2016 finance we outlined in February to maximize liquidity, optimize our portfolio, increase EBITDA and reduce our debt. We have achieved a bit more success in the A&D market with our announcement this morning, and that has no impact on our borrowing base under our revolving credit facility. We are attacking the challenges of our financial and operational leverage and continue to work on many fronts to make Chesapeake a stronger company, regardless of commodity prices. We look forward being able to talk with you about this later this year.
That concludes my comments. I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions."

What we know here is that this position for Chesapeake, the amount of funding that we're going to put towards it in the near term and the value-acceleration opportunity, was just compelling for us at this point in time. And so bringing those proceeds in versus investing the capital over a multiyear period for Chesapeake, it was in our best interest to divest of the property. So as we evaluate other assets, the noncore areas that were -- that in many cases are nonoperated properties, we'll continue to look for those, to continue to plant those seeds towards our capital structure or other corporate investments.

It's Nick. We remain in constant dialogue with Williams on a number of fronts as well as some of our other downstream partners, and you've seen us have a variety of success across the number of fronts this year to align our current operating activity to current market environment with contracts that we have in place, and we had very good receptivity from all of our partners to do that. With respect to Williams, you did see that we lowered our gas gathering outlook by $0.05, and that really just comes down as we set the cost-to-service for the year and alignment around what our activity plans are, where to spend money, how much to spend and how that rolls through the calculation. So that's minor evidence, although it does generate a pretty reasonable amount of cash flow for us, minor evidence of how we can continue to work together to optimize around existing structures. Negotiations on these structures, like you said, do continue, and we are making good progress there, and we'll just have to ask you to hang with us. Obviously, we've had good success over the last year there and are confident that we will continue to have more in the coming months."

I guess, as you guys look at that, that asset, and compare it to maybe the Utica and the Haynesville from a rate of return perspective over the next few years, how does that fit into the STACK in terms of capital allocation? And I guess, longer term, does this still fit in terms of the core strategy from a development perspective going forward? Or are there potentially opportunities to extract additional value from an asset-sale perspective in plays like the Marcellus where we've seen an uptick in A&D activity as of late?"

Matt, we have gas that we can manage our production rates to a very manageable, no decline, basically, which is a great opportunity for us in the Marcellus. As far as the delays that we've seen, we were not on constitution, so that's really not something that we were counting on. We did have a small amount of gas that we wanted to put through NED. Of course, that's apparently gone now. So we have an opportunity here to really manage this field to a really nice no-decline position with very little capital. If you go to Page 13 on the slides, you'll see that we're really not putting a lot of capital into the Marcellus because it doesn't need capital. As far as money is being spent in the field, it is going to the Utica. The Utica has access through OPEN to the Gulf, and we are going to be putting on additional Utica dry wells this year and next year and drilling some additional Utica dry wells going forward. As far as sales or divestitures of assets, Marcellus is a core asset. There are parts of the Marcellus that might not be core, and we would consider that and with the right price. Utica, we're pretty happy with our position."

We have 1.5 million acres there. So we've got really strong economics there, and then our Eagle Ford has experienced a renaissance as well with a longer laterals. So those are still preferentially for spending more dollars. Those plays always look really strong. In the Haynesville, again, we're continuing to improve. We're getting close to 20% returns at the strip here. So I mean and just, it's hard to explain how impactful these long laterals have been to that play out there, because we're getting -- we are seeing no degradation in performance with these 10,000-foot wells, so we're getting double the production for effectively half the cost out there. We also have a new play there. I didn't mention in my first set of comments. We've got our first 7,500-foot Bossier well that's flowing today, and it's 17 million cubic feet a day at 7,300 pounds. I mean, there's a lot of exciting things going on in the Haynesville, but our Eagle Ford team, they're drilling -- plan to drill for this year 9,800-foot well on average, which is nearly double what they were a couple of years ago. So their returns have gone through the roof, and we're actually -- our returns today in Eagle Ford with the current cost are about the same as when oil was $80. I mean it's just significant how much of a change the Eagle Ford team has made there. We had wells coming on a year ago at 500 barrels a day, latest wells are coming on close to 1,000 barrels a day. So we kind of had just a huge transformation in the Eagle Ford team over this first quarter here, that for me, again, if I'm finding for capital, that's the area I want to send it first."

I hope you had the opportunity to repair press release and presentation from earlier this morning. We continue to make good progress on multiple fronts, including a meaningful reduction on our debt, stronger production, lowe",1399,"Thank you, Brad. Good morning. I hope you had the opportunity to repair press release and presentation from earlier this morning. We continue to make good progress on multiple fronts, including a meaningful reduction on our debt, stronger production, lower operating costs and optimization of our portfolio. While we still face a challenging commodity price environment, I think it's important to note the significant progress that Chesapeake Energy has made despite commodity prices. In the past 3 years, we've reduced our total leverage by approximately 50%. We've reduced our cash cost by roughly 50% and significantly improved our capital efficiency. This year's capital program is roughly 10% of the capital spend in 2012. And importantly, our production today is approximately equivalent to our 2012 production. We've sharpened our operational capability, technology, geoscience and engineering to drive further value for shareholders for the long term. We have 3 major gas assets, each with a significant well inventory of new drilling opportunities that can produce in excess of 30 million cubic feet per day per well. 
I'd like to share a few examples of our continued progress. In the Haynesville, we have recognized inspirational value improvements this quarter. We continue to lead industry on long-lateral technology with 6 10,000-foot wells drilled to date. We have recently tested the largest completion in Chesapeake's history with over 30 million pounds of sand being pumped in the well. Results very impressive with restrictive initial rate of 38 million cubic feet per day and a slowing pressure of approximately 7,500-psi. We called this new era in completion technology profit getting. not yet reached the point of diminishing returns in the Haynesville, and we plan additional tests up to 50 million pounds in the back half of the year. We look forward to sharing more results in the future.
In the Eagle Ford, similar to the Haynesville, we continue to optimize our drilling schedule with longer laterals. We moved from an average lateral length of 6500 feet in 2015 to an average of 9300 feet in the second quarter of 2016. We've slashed our cost of drilling complete in the Eagle Ford well by more than 50% on a cost per foot basis. Total well cost for wells completed in the second quarter averaged just under $4 million with drill times reduced to 9.7 days even though we are drilling wells with longer laterals. The move to longer laterals in all of our fields allows us to accelerate value capture as each rig is developing up to twice the rock volume compared to last year. These are just a few examples of our recent cost of technology improvements, and we believe these improvements directed with our high-quality assets provider shareholders with competitive investment opportunities for years to come. We have in excess of 9,000 well locations across the portfolio that can generate greater than a 20% rate of return at $3 gas and $60 oil. Since June of 2015, we have reduced our total debt by over $3 billion with $1 billion of that reduction since the beginning of 2016. In addition, we are confident in our ability to completely retire and/or refinance our 2017 maturities. The complexity of our businesses further improved in the second quarter with the repurchase of 4 volumetric production payment contracts leaving the company with only 2 of the 9 VPPs that we had 3 years ago. You've also seen that we've increased our production guidance for the full year. This is driven primarily by gas volume increases from the Haynesville and Marcellus assets. Our operating teams have done a fantastic job in generating more value out of our capital program, primarily due to operating efficiencies and lower service cost, resulting in the opportunity for higher activity in the second half of 2016. 
For the last 6 months of the year, we plan to take the following actions, all of which will be completed within our previously estimated CapEx guidance range. First, we plan to drill 100 more wells, which is roughly twice the number of wells originally planned in 2016. Primarily, this will aggressively keep 3 rigs running in the Eagle Ford when we had previously expected to release those rigs earlier this summer. Secondly, we're projecting to place our production approximately 75 more wells that we originally planned. Third, in July, we took done a small property acquisition in the Haynesville for $87 million. I'm very proud of our team's ability to more than overcome the 35,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day sold in 2016 dispositions within the same calendar year. However, more important is the great momentum this additional activity provides to our 2017 production and cash-generating capabilities. You will note w5 updated our oil production guidance majority of our announced divestiture transaction closed in the second quarter. Full year guidance has been reduced by 1 million barrels in the Mid-Continent area as a result of the Granite Wash divestiture to and the STACK divestiture to Newfield. To a lesser extent, Mid-Continent oil production for the year was also impacted due to compliance water restriction directives established by the State of Oklahoma. 
The increase drilling and completion activities in the latter half 2016 made possible through our efficiency gains will greatly benefit 2017 oil volumes, offsetting decline and resulting in 2017 oil volumes being relatively flat year-over-year. As a very preliminary look to full year production guidance for 2017, our total production volumes are projected to be down by a mid-single-digit compared to 2016 production levels. We continue to focus on improving our gathering and transportation cost across the portfolio. We are actively working with Williams in all of our midstream and downstream service providers on win-win solutions in the current pricing environment. We're encouraged by the progress we have made to date, and we believe we will be able to announce an additional meaningful improvements in the near future. 
Following on to my initial comments, we have used this period of reduced activity to perform an in-depth study of the resource position and potential of each one of our operating areas. In short, the oil and gas resource potential of Chesapeake Energy is stunning. Our asset value and portfolio of investment opportunities are being redefined through better operating efficiencies and cost structure improvements and also through the rapid evolution of the technologies we apply. The result of this work provides the foundation for competitive investment performance with significantly enhanced economics. We're working hard every day to apply these technologies to our extensive undeveloped acreage position and anticipate that these efforts will translate into incremental shareholder value. As an example and as noted, you can look at the Investor Relations slides posted to our website this morning. You can see the impact in operational efficiency and technology application we're having on the Haynesville asset. We look forward to sharing more about the value proposition and competitive portfolio in the near future. On the A&D front, we are increasing our target of gross proceeds from divestiture either close or undersigned to over $2 billion for 2016. One of the select areas that we believe will contribute to the new divestiture target is certain acreage within our large Haynesville footprint. Nick can provide some additional detail regarding our recent they and the efforts including the highly accretive acquisition that we closed last week in the Haynesville.
In closing, I mean pleased with the significant progress we continue to make in reducing our debt, eliminating complexity, lowering our cost and high-grading our portfolio. We are beginning to see evidence that our differential leverage reduction and industry-leading operational capabilities are gaining traction with investors. However, we are just getting started. We believe the portfolio of high-quality economic opportunities within Chesapeake is unmatched in the unconventional oil and gas business. We are driven to succeed and will continue to work relentlessly to reduce our debt and improve our midstream contracts, and we will continue to share news about our progress on both fronts soon. The breadth and depth of our portfolio will continue to expand from a multiplier effect as we apply our leading-edge technologies to the development of our assets. This will result in unlocking more and more value. The momentum transformation of Chesapeake is building and with the realization of greater value throughout our portfolio. I'll now pass the call to Nick and then we'll open the call for questions."

As Doug has stated, financial discipline across our entire business remains a priority at Chesapeake. It's not only about reducing our operating expenses are capital cost savings, although we've done very well",866,"Thank you, Doug, and good morning, everyone. As Doug has stated, financial discipline across our entire business remains a priority at Chesapeake. It's not only about reducing our operating expenses are capital cost savings, although we've done very well in those areas, our main focus is on the reduction of our total debt and the improvement in our liquidity, specifically debt maturing in the next 6 to 24 months. While the debt capital markets amid constrained of the past 12 months, we are pleased with the recent increase in the pricing of our securities and believe our opportunities to enter the market are improving. 
As you are aware, in April, we've reaffirmed the $4 billion borrowing base for our revolving credit facility and in return, we pledged additional properties. The recent improvements in our cost structure along with our leverage to gas prices which yielded a significant uplift in the value to our reserves. Using the same database, same type curves and same reserves but using June 30 strip pricing, our proved reserves increased to approximately 11.1 billion at June 30 compared to approximately 3.1 billion when using the SEC methodology of the average of commodity prices on the first day of the month over a trailing 12-month period. Using June 30 strip pricing at a 9% discount rate, similar to how our values reserves, the value increased to approximately 11.9 billion. We have ample reserves back in our liquidity position of approximately 3.1 billion at June 30. With this liquidity we, are well-positioned to fully retire our refinance our pending 2017 debt maturities. On the expense side, our cash cost continued to decline and we have moved our production expense guidance lower due to additional cost savings. During the quarter, our G&A ticked up a bit due to additional legal expenses related to the settlements of legacy lawsuits and some bad debt expense that we wrote off impacting our EPS by about a $0.01. Overall, however, we expect our G&A to remain within our current guidance range at this time.
On the A&D front, we have closed on the announced sales to in Newfield. We've also stated that we intend to put a select portion of our Haynesville assets on the market. These are developed properties that we will not likely further develop for some time. Given the depth of our Haynesville drilling inventory, after the acquisition we completed in July, we currently have approximately 430,000 net acres in the Haynesville and are looking to sell approximately 150,000 net acres of that position. While we know there are substantial value to be created with evolution towards longer laterals, higher frac cost efficiencies going forward we will retain a position where we have hundreds of locations remaining to be drilled by Chesapeake after the planned disposition. The acreage we are looking to sell includes approximately 95 million cubic feet a day of production. In July, we acquired approximately 70,000 net acres in the Haynesville, primarily within our already existing operating units for approximately $87 million, pursuant to we had in the properties. Through the acquisition, we increased our average working interest in the area to approximately 83% along with adding daily net production of approximately 60 million cubic feet a day of gas. The midstream contracts on the asset are the same as Chesapeake's and the rates in those of decreased since our renegotiations with Williams last year and some of the downstream transport this year. Additionally, our operational efficiencies are allowing us to better utilize our transportation, which brings even more improvement to those contracts. Most importantly, we exercised our preference in the purchase because we felt we were getting the assets for a fraction of the value using current pricing. Using June 30 strip pricing, we internally valued incremental asset at approximately $200 million or more than double the cost. Additionally, the PV-10 of the PVP alone was higher than the purchase price. We are huge believers in the Haynesville and with gas prices lifting in the current completion techniques being employed, we are very pleased to have increased our working interest in the play at an attractive price. We have been adding to our hedge position for the remainder of 2016 and '17 to help derisk our cash flow. For the remainder of 2016, we are hedged at approximately 75% of our projected production with approximately 373 Bcf of our remaining 2016 gas production hedged at $2.77 per Mcf and approximately 12.1 million barrels of our 2016 oil production hedged at approximately $46.60 per barrel. We've also started to add some 2017 hedges. For 2017, we currently have 290 Bcf hedged at $3 per Mcf and 7.7 million barrels hedged at approximately $47.79 per barrel. In closing, we are making meaningful strides in our debt reduction efforts and look to do more in this area. Our production remains strong, and we've been able to beat estimates and guidance without increasing our capital spending range. We expect more success in the A&D market and look forward to being able to talk more about these transactions later this year. That concludes my comments. I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions."

The Haynesville, again, with these new completion techniques, they've really transformed the assets for it it's just as competitive as the Eagle Ford is. One of the challenges that we've got is all the teams are doing very similar things, and they're fighting each other every day for every dollar in a good way, but they all have rate of returns that are in 40% to as high as 60% in every single play that we operate. So it's been an exciting time for us as our economics they are better than they were when we had $80 oil prices, and we continue to optimize each of these plays. So the longer laterals, when you look at Chesapeake's history, we really had -- we went in a lease capture mode very kind of had 1 well per 640 acres. So for us, we've seen advantage, and we're 1 of 2 companies that can go to these 10,000-foot wells in nearly every play that we operate we're not as overdeveloped. We're not focused on having to go to down spacing and increased density to add well count. We're adding these longer lateral wells across every field that we operate today, and we're not forced to just down space in order to add inventory."

We do have about 15 or so incremental in Eagle Ford of this year. Mid-Con saw a big jump in the till count as well. We had some of the curtailment issues that impacted as early in the year. We had shut down our Miss Lime completion program. We've been able to work through the water issues by recompleting into different disposal zones, which open up our water capacity later in the year so we'll be tilling a lot of Miss Lime inventory, which we don't talk a lot about that, but are making some fantastic wells in the Miss Lime that are very competitive in our portfolio as well."

I hope you've had the opportunity to review our press release and presentation from earlier this morning. 
We continue to make good progress on multiple fronts, including a meaningful reduction on our debt, stronger production, lower operating costs and optimization of our portfolio. While we still face a challenging commodity price environment, I think it's important to note the significant progress that Chesapeake Energy has made despite commodity prices. In the past 3 years, we've reduced our total leverage by approximately 50%. We've reduced our cash cost by roughly 50% and significantly improved our capital efficiency. This year's capital program is roughly 10% of the capital spend in 2012. 
And importantly, our production today is approximately equivalent to our 2012 production. We have sharpened our operational capability, technology, geoscience and engineering to drive further value for our shareholders for the long term. We have 3 major gas assets, each with a significant well inventory of new drilling opportunities that can produce in excess of 30 million cubic feet per day per well. 
I'd like to share a few examples of our continued progress. In the Haynesville, we have recognized transformational value improvements this quarter. We continue to lead the industry on long-lateral technology with 6 10,000-foot wells drilled to date. We have recently tested the largest completion in Chesapeake's history with over 30 million pounds of sand being pumped in the well. Results have been very impressive with a restricted initial rate of 38 million cubic feet per day and a flowing pressure of approximately 7,500 psi. We call this new era in completion technology proppant getting [ph] . We've not yet reached the point of diminishing returns in the Haynesville, and we plan additional tests up to 50 million pounds in the back half of the year. We look forward to sharing more results of the proppant getting [ph] program in the future.
In the Eagle Ford, similar to the Haynesville, we continue to optimize our drilling schedule with longer laterals. We moved from an average lateral length of 6,500 feet in 2015 to an average of 9,300 feet in the second quarter of 2016. We've slashed our cost to drill and complete an Eagle Ford well by more than 50% on a cost-per-foot basis. Total well cost for wells completed in the second quarter averaged just under $4 million with drill times reduced to 9.7 days even though we are drilling longer -- drilling wells with longer laterals. 
The move to longer laterals in all of our fields allows us to accelerate value capture as each rig is developing up to twice the rock volume compared to last year. These are just a few examples of our recent cost and technology improvements, and we believe these improvements directed at our high-quality assets provide our shareholders with competitive investment opportunities for years to come. We have in excess of 9,000 well locations across the portfolio that can generate greater than a 20% rate of return at $3 gas and $60 oil. 
Since June of 2015, we have reduced our total debt by over $3 billion, with $1 billion of that reduction being since the beginning of 2016. In addition, we are confident in our ability to completely retire and/or refinance our 2017 maturities. 
The complexity of our business has further improved in the second quarter with the repurchase of 4 volumetric production payment contracts, leaving the company with only 2 of the 9 VPPs that we had 3 years ago. You've also seen that we've increased our production guidance for the full year. This is driven primarily by gas volume increases from the Haynesville and Marcellus assets. Our operating teams have done a fantastic job in generating more value out of our capital program, primarily due to operating efficiencies and lower service costs, resulting in the opportunity for higher activity in the second half of 2016. 
For the last 6 months of the year, we plan to take the following actions, all of which will be completed within our previously estimated CapEx guidance range. First, we plan to drill 100 more wells, which is roughly twice the number of wells originally planned in 2016. Primarily, this will occur as we keep 3 rigs running in the Eagle Ford when we had previously expected to release those rigs earlier this summer. Second, we are projecting to place on production approximately 75 more wells than we originally planned. Third, in July, we took down a small property acquisition in the Haynesville for $87 million. I'm very proud of our team's ability to more than overcome the 35,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day sold in 2016 dispositions within the same calendar year. 
However, more important is the great momentum this additional activity provides to our 2017 production and cash-generating capabilities. You will note we've updated our oil production guidance as the majority of our announced divestiture transaction closed in the second quarter. Full year guidance has been reduced by 1 million barrels in the Mid-Continent area as a result of the Granite Wash divestiture to FourPoint and the STACK divestiture to Newfield. To a lesser extent, Mid-Continent oil production for the year was also impacted due to compliance with water-restriction directives established by the State of Oklahoma. 
The increased drilling and completion activity in the latter half of 2016, made possible through our efficiency gains, will greatly benefit 2017 oil volumes, offsetting decline and resulting in 2017 oil volumes being relatively flat year-over-year. As a very preliminary look to full year production guidance for 2017, our total production volumes are projected to be down by mid-single digit compared to 2016 production levels. 
We continue to focus on improving our gathering and transportation costs across the portfolio. We are actively working with Williams in all of our midstream and downstream service providers on win-win solutions in the current pricing environment. We're encouraged by the progress we have made to date, and we believe we will be able to announce additional meaningful improvements in the near future. 
Following on to my initial comments, we have used this period of reduced activity to perform an in-depth study of the resource position and potential of each one of our operating areas. In short, the oil and gas resource potential of Chesapeake Energy is stunning. Our asset value and portfolio of investment opportunities are being redefined through better operating efficiencies and cost structure improvements and also through the rapid evolution of the technologies we apply. The result of this work provides the foundation for competitive investment performance with significantly enhanced economics. 
We're working hard every day to apply these technologies to our extensive undeveloped acreage position and anticipate that these efforts will translate into incremental shareholder value. As an example and as noted, you can look at the Investor Relations slides posted to our website this morning. You can see the of in operational efficiencies and technology application we're having on the Haynesville asset. We look forward to sharing more about our value proposition and competitive portfolio in the near future. 
On the A&D front, we are increasing our target of gross proceeds from divestiture, either close or undersigned PSA, to over $2 billion for 2016. One of the select areas that we believe will contribute to the new divestiture target is certain acreage within our large Haynesville footprint. Nick will provide some additional detail regarding our recent A&D efforts, including the highly accretive acquisition that we closed last week in the Haynesville.
In closing, I am pleased with the significant progress we continue to make in reducing our debt, eliminating complexity, lowering our cost and high-grading our portfolio. We are beginning to see evidence that our differential leverage reduction and industry-leading operational capabilities are gaining traction with investors. However, we are just getting started. We believe the portfolio of high-quality economic opportunities within Chesapeake is unmatched in the unconventional oil and gas business. We are driven to succeed and will continue to work relentlessly to reduce our debt and improve our midstream contracts, and we will continue to share news about our progress on both fronts soon. 
The breadth and depth of our portfolio will continue to expand from a multiplier effect as we apply our leading-edge technologies to the development of our assets. This will result in unlocking more and more value. The momentum behind the transformation of Chesapeake is building and, with it, the realization of greater value throughout our portfolio. 
I'll now pass the call to Nick, and then we'll open the call for questions."

As Doug has stated, financial discipline across our entire business remains a priority at Chesapeake.

As Doug has stated, financial discipline across our entire business remains a priority at Chesapeake. It's not only about reducing our operating expenses or capital cost savings, although we've done very well in those areas. Our main focus is the reduction of our total debt and the improvement in our liquidity, specifically debt maturing in the next 6 to 24 months. While the debt capital markets have been constrained over the past 12 months, we are pleased with the recent increase in the pricing of our securities and believe our opportunities to enter the market are improving. 
As you're aware, in April, we've reaffirmed the $4 billion borrowing base for our revolving credit facility, and in return, we pledged additional properties. The recent improvements in our cost structure, along with our leverage to gas prices, has yielded a significant uplift in the value to our reserves. Using the same database, same type curves and same reserves but using June 30 strip pricing, our proved reserves increased to approximately $11.1 billion at June 30 compared to approximately $3.1 billion when using the SEC methodology of the average of commodity prices on the first day of the month over a trailing 12-month period. 
Using June 30 strip pricing at a 9% discount rate, similar to how our bank group values our reserves, the value increased to approximately $11.9 billion. We have ample reserves backing our liquidity position of approximately $3.1 billion at June 30. With this liquidity, we are well positioned to fully retire or refinance our pending 2017 debt maturities. 
On the expense side, our cash cost continue to decline, and we have moved our production expense guidance lower due to additional cost savings. During the quarter, our G&A ticked up a bit due to additional legal expenses related to the settlements of legacy lawsuits and some bad debt expense that we wrote off, impacting our EPS by about a $0.01. Overall, however, we expect our G&A to remain within our current guidance range at this time.
On the A&D front, we have closed on the announced sales to FourPoint and Newfield. We have also stated that we intend to put a select portion of our Haynesville assets on the market. These are lightly developed properties that we will not likely further develop for some time given the depth of our Haynesville drilling inventory. After the acquisition we completed in July, we currently have approximately 430,000 net acres in the Haynesville and are looking to sell approximately 150,000 net acres of that position. While we know there is substantial value to be created with the evolution towards longer laterals, higher frac density completions and cost efficiencies going forward, we will retain a position where we have hundreds of locations remaining to be drilled by Chesapeake after the planned disposition. The acreage we are looking to sell includes approximately 95 million cubic feet a day of production. 
In July, we acquired approximately 70,000 net acres in the Haynesville, primarily within our already existing operating units for approximately $87 million, pursuant to a pref right we had on the properties. Through the acquisition, we increased our average working interest in the area to approximately 83%, along with adding daily net production of approximately 60 million cubic feet a day of gas. The midstream contracts on the asset are the same as Chesapeake's, and the rates on those have decreased since our renegotiations with Williams last year and some of the downstream transport this year. Additionally, our operational efficiencies are allowing us to better utilize our transportation, which brings even more improvement to those contracts. 
Most importantly, we exercised our pref right on the purchase because we felt we were getting the assets for a fraction of the value using current pricing. Using June 30 strip pricing, we internally valued this incremental asset at approximately $200 million or more than double the cost. Additionally, the PV-10 of the PDP alone was higher than the purchase price. We are huge believers in the Haynesville, and with gas prices lifting and the current completion techniques being employed, we are very pleased to have increased our working interest in the play at an attractive price. 
We've been adding to our hedge position for the remainder of 2016 and '17 to help derisk our cash flow. For the remainder of 2016, we are hedged at approximately 75% of our projected production with approximately 373 Bcf of our remaining 2016 gas production hedged at $2.77 per Mcf and approximately 12.1 million barrels of our 2016 oil production hedged at approximately $46.60 per barrel. We have also started to add some 2017 hedges. For 2017, we currently have 290 Bcf hedged at $3 per Mcf and 7.7 million barrels hedged at approximately $47.79 per barrel. 
In closing, we are making meaningful strides in our debt reduction efforts and look to do more in this area. Our production remains strong, and we've been able to beat estimates and guidance without increasing our capital spending range. We expect more success in the A&D market and look forward to being able to talk more about these transactions later this year. 
That concludes my comments. I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions."

So the Haynesville, again, with these new completion techniques, they've really transformed the asset or it's just as competitive as the Eagle Ford is. One of the challenges that we've got is all the teams are doing very similar things, and they're fighting each other every day for every dollar in a good way. But they all have rate of returns that are in 40% to as high as 60% in every single play that we operate. So it's been an exciting time for us as our economics today are better than they were when we had $80 oil prices, and we continue to optimize each of these plays. So the longer laterals, when you look at Chesapeake's history, we really had -- we went in a lease capture mode where we kind of had 1 well per 640 acres. So for us, we see an advantage, and we're one of the few companies that can go to these 10,000-foot wells in nearly every play that we operate. We're not as overdeveloped. We're not focused on having to go to downspacing and increase density to add well count. We're adding these longer-lateral wells across every field that we operate today, and we're not forced to just downspace in order to add inventory."

The extensive portfolio that we have and the significant acreage position gives us a lot of flexibility as we look at our go-forward capital plans, the cash-generating capability of in the company and how we might accelerate value from some of these assets. The acreage positions are large, as you know. And as we look at the core positions, what may not be a primary core to Chesapeake is -- could be outstanding core acreage for another company, which drives that interest. And that's what we wanted to highlight for you today on the Haynesville, is we have literally hundreds of locations, a significant multiyear inventory of high-quality acreage for us to develop. But we also believe that, given the quality of the acreage and the opportunity there, that we can accelerate some value. So we know that there is what we'll call select areas that, whether it be inside of core or noncore, that we can accelerate value. And as we look across the portfolio, I'm not prepared to give you any further guidance other than the Haynesville, but there are several other areas that we're looking at. And we feel very good about achieving that divestiture target."

We had shut down our Miss Lime completion program.

I hope you've had the opportunity to review our press release and presentation from earlier this morning. 
We continue to make good progress on multiple fronts, including a meaningful reduction in our debt, stronger production, lower operating costs and optimization of our portfolio. While we still face a challenging commodity price environment, I think it's important to note the significant progress that Chesapeake Energy has made despite commodity prices. In the past 3 years, we've reduced our total leverage by approximately 50%. We've reduced our cash cost by roughly 50% and significantly improved our capital efficiency. This year's capital program is roughly 10% of the capital spend in 2012. 
And importantly, our production today is approximately equivalent to our 2012 production. We have sharpened our operational capability, technology, geoscience and engineering to drive further value for our shareholders for the long term. We have 3 major gas assets, each with a significant well inventory of new drilling opportunities that can produce in excess of 30 million cubic feet per day per well. 
I'd like to share a few examples of our continued progress. In the Haynesville, we have recognized transformational value improvements this quarter. We continue to lead the industry on long-lateral technology with 6 10,000-foot wells drilled to date. We have recently tested the largest completion in Chesapeake's history with over 30 million pounds of sand being pumped in the well. Results have been very impressive with a restricted initial rate of 38 million cubic feet per day and a flowing pressure of approximately 7,500 psi. We call this new era in completion technology proppant-geddon . We've not yet reached the point of diminishing returns in the Haynesville, and we plan additional tests up to 50 million pounds in the back half of the year. We look forward to sharing more results of the proppant-geddon program in the future.
In the Eagle Ford, similar to the Haynesville, we continue to optimize our drilling schedule with longer laterals. We moved from an average lateral length of 6,500 feet in 2015 to an average of 9,300 feet in the second quarter of 2016. We've slashed our cost to drill and complete an Eagle Ford well by more than 50% on a cost-per-foot basis. Total well cost for wells completed in the second quarter averaged just under $4 million with drill times reduced to 9.7 days even though we are drilling longer -- drilling wells with longer laterals. 
The move to longer laterals in all of our fields allows us to accelerate value capture as each rig is developing up to twice the rock volume compared to last year. These are just a few examples of our recent cost and technology improvements, and we believe these improvements directed at our high-quality assets provide our shareholders with competitive investment opportunities for years to come. We have in excess of 9,000 well locations across the portfolio that can generate greater than a 20% rate of return at $3 gas and $60 oil. 
Since June of 2015, we have reduced our total debt by over $3 billion, with $1 billion of that reduction being since the beginning of 2016. In addition, we are confident in our ability to completely retire and/or refinance our 2017 maturities. 
The complexity of our business has further improved in the second quarter with the repurchase of 4 volumetric production payment contracts, leaving the company with only 2 of the 9 VPPs that we had 3 years ago. You've also seen that we've increased our production guidance for the full year. This is driven primarily by gas volume increases from the Haynesville and Marcellus assets. Our operating teams have done a fantastic job in generating more value out of our capital program, primarily due to operating efficiencies and lower service costs, resulting in the opportunity for higher activity in the second half of 2016. 
For the last 6 months of the year, we plan to take the following actions, all of which will be completed within our previously estimated CapEx guidance range. First, we plan to drill 100 more wells, which is roughly twice the number of wells originally planned in 2016. Primarily, this will occur as we keep 3 rigs running in the Eagle Ford when we had previously expected to release those rigs earlier this summer. Second, we are projecting to place on production approximately 75 more wells than we originally planned. Third, in July, we took down a small property acquisition in the Haynesville for $87 million. I'm very proud of our team's ability to more than overcome the 35,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day sold in 2016 dispositions within the same calendar year. 
However, more important is the great momentum this additional activity provides to our 2017 production and cash-generating capabilities. You will note we've updated our oil production guidance as the majority of our announced divestiture transactions closed in the second quarter. Full year guidance has been reduced by 1 million barrels in the Mid-Continent area as a result of the Granite Wash divestiture to FourPoint and the STACK divestiture to Newfield. To a lesser extent, Mid-Continent oil production for the year was also impacted due to compliance with water-restriction directives established by the State of Oklahoma. 
The increased drilling and completion activity in the latter half of 2016, made possible through our efficiency gains, will greatly benefit 2017 oil volumes, offsetting decline and resulting in 2017 oil volumes being relatively flat year-over-year. As a very preliminary look to full year production guidance for 2017, our total production volumes are projected to be down by mid-single digit compared to 2016 production levels. 
We continue to focus on improving our gathering and transportation costs across the portfolio. We are actively working with Williams in all of our midstream and downstream service providers on win-win solutions in the current pricing environment. We're encouraged by the progress we have made to date, and we believe we will be able to announce additional meaningful improvements in the near future. 
Following on to my initial comments, we have used this period of reduced activity to perform an in-depth study of the resource position and potential of each one of our operating areas. In short, the oil and gas resource potential of Chesapeake Energy is stunning. Our asset value and portfolio of investment opportunities are being redefined through better operating efficiencies and cost structure improvements and also through the rapid evolution of the technologies we apply. The result of this work provides the foundation for competitive investment performance with significantly enhanced economics. 
We're working hard every day to apply these technologies to our extensive undeveloped acreage position and anticipate that these efforts will translate into incremental shareholder value. As an example and as noted, if you can look at the Investor Relations slides posted to our website this morning, you can see the of in operational efficiencies and technology application we're having on the Haynesville asset. We look forward to sharing more about our value proposition and competitive portfolio in the near future. 
On the A&D front, we are increasing our target of gross proceeds from divestiture, either closed or undersigned PSA, to over $2 billion for 2016. One of the select areas that we believe will contribute to the new divestiture target is certain acreage within our large Haynesville footprint. Nick will provide some additional detail regarding our recent A&D efforts, including the highly accretive acquisition that we closed last week in the Haynesville.
In closing, I am pleased with the significant progress we continue to make in reducing our debt, eliminating complexity, lowering our cost and high-grading our portfolio. We are beginning to see evidence that our differential leverage reduction and industry-leading operational capabilities are gaining traction with investors. However, we are just getting started. We believe the portfolio of high quality economic opportunities within Chesapeake is unmatched in the unconventional oil and gas business. We are driven to succeed and will continue to work relentlessly to reduce our debt and improve our midstream contracts, and we will continue to share news about our progress on both fronts soon. 
The breadth and depth of our portfolio will continue to expand from a multiplier effect as we apply our leading-edge technologies to the development of our assets. This will result in unlocking more and more value. The momentum behind the transformation of Chesapeake is building and, with it, the realization of greater value throughout our portfolio. 
I'll now pass the call to Nick, and then we'll open the call for questions."
323857,374877594,1025179,"Chesapeake Energy Corporation, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 04, 2016",2016-08-04,"Earnings Calls","Expand Energy Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Doug, and good morning, everyone. As Doug has stated, financial discipline across our entire business remains a priority at Chesapeake. It's not only about reducing our operating expenses or capital cost savings, although we've done very well i",880,"Thank you, Doug, and good morning, everyone. As Doug has stated, financial discipline across our entire business remains a priority at Chesapeake. It's not only about reducing our operating expenses or capital cost savings, although we've done very well in those areas, our main focus is the reduction of our total debt and the improvement in our liquidity, specifically debt maturing in the next 6 to 24 months. While the debt capital markets have been constrained over the past 12 months, we are pleased with the recent increase in the pricing of our securities and believe our opportunities to enter the market are improving. 
As you're aware, in April, we've reaffirmed the $4 billion borrowing base for our revolving credit facility, and in return, we pledged additional properties. The recent improvements in our cost structure, along with our leverage to gas prices, has yielded a significant uplift in the value to our reserves. Using the same database, same type curves and same reserves but using June 30 strip pricing, our proved reserves increased to approximately $11.1 billion at June 30 compared to approximately $3.1 billion when using the SEC methodology of the average of commodity prices on the first day of the month over a trailing 12-month period. 
Using June 30 strip pricing at a 9% discount rate, similar to how our bank group values our reserves, the value increased to approximately $11.9 billion. We have ample reserves backing our liquidity position of approximately $3.1 billion at June 30. With this liquidity, we are well positioned to fully retire or refinance our pending 2017 debt maturities. 
On the expense side, our cash costs continue to decline, and we have moved our production expense guidance lower due to additional cost savings. During the quarter, our G&A ticked up a bit due to additional legal expenses related to the settlements of legacy lawsuits and some bad debt expense that we wrote off, impacting our EPS by about a $0.01. Overall, however, we expect our G&A to remain within our current guidance range at this time.
On the A&D front, we have closed on the announced sales to FourPoint and Newfield. We have also stated that we intend to put a select portion of our Haynesville assets on the market. These are lightly developed properties that we will not likely further develop for some time given the depth of our Haynesville drilling inventory. After the acquisition we completed in July, we currently have approximately 430,000 net acres in the Haynesville and are looking to sell approximately 150,000 net acres of that position. While we know there is substantial value to be created with the evolution towards longer laterals, higher frac density completions and cost efficiencies going forward, we will retain a position where we have hundreds of locations remaining to be drilled by Chesapeake after the planned disposition. The acreage we are looking to sell includes approximately 95 million cubic feet a day of production. 
In July, we acquired approximately 70,000 net acres in the Haynesville, primarily within our already existing operating units for approximately $87 million, pursuant to a pref right we had on the properties. Through the acquisition, we increased our average working interest in the area to approximately 83%, along with adding daily net production of approximately 60 million cubic feet a day of gas. The midstream contracts on the asset are the same as Chesapeake's, and the rates on those have decreased since our renegotiations with Williams last year and some of the downstream transport this year. Additionally, our operational efficiencies are allowing us to better utilize our transportation, which brings even more improvement to those contracts. 
Most importantly, we exercised our pref right on the purchase because we felt we were getting the assets for a fraction of the value using current pricing. Using June 30 strip pricing, we internally valued this incremental asset at approximately $200 million or more than double the cost. Additionally, the PV-10 of the PDP alone was higher than the purchase price. We are huge believers in the Haynesville, and with gas prices lifting and the current completion techniques being employed, we are very pleased to have increased our working interest in the play at an attractive price. 
We've been adding to our hedge position for the remainder of 2016 and '17 to help derisk our cash flow. For the remainder of 2016, we are hedged at approximately 75% of our projected production with approximately 373 Bcf of our remaining 2016 gas production hedged at $2.77 per Mcf and approximately 12.1 million barrels of our 2016 oil production hedged at approximately $46.60 per barrel. We have also started to add some 2017 hedges. For 2017, we currently have 290 Bcf hedged at $3 per Mcf and 7.7 million barrels hedged at approximately $47.79 per barrel. 
In closing, we are making meaningful strides in our debt reduction efforts and look to do more in this area. Our production remains strong, and we've been able to beat estimates and guidance without increasing our capital spending range. We expect more success in the A&D market and look forward to being able to talk more about these transactions later this year. 
That concludes my comments. I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions."

Again, we're going through the budget process at the company right now, and we expect to kind of keep 3 rigs flat but run some sensitivities on that as we speak. So the Haynesville, again, with these new completion techniques, they've really transformed the asset for us. It's just as competitive as the Eagle Ford is. One of the challenges that we've got is all the teams are doing very similar things, and they're fighting each other every day for every dollar, in a good way. But they all have rate of returns that are in 40% to as high as 60% in every single play that we operate. So it's been an exciting time for us as our economics today are better than they were when we had $80 oil prices, and we continue to optimize each of these plays. So the longer laterals, when you look at Chesapeake's history, we really had -- we went in a lease capture mode where we kind of had 1 well per 640 acres. So for us, we see an advantage, and we're one of the few companies that can go to these 10,000-foot wells in nearly every play that we operate. We're not as overdeveloped. We're not focused on having to go to downspacing and increase density to add well count. We're adding these longer-lateral wells across every field that we operate today, and we're not forced to just downspace in order to add inventory."

The acreage positions are large, as you know. And as we look at the core positions, what may not be a primary core to Chesapeake is -- could be outstanding core acreage for another company, which drives that interest. And that's what we wanted to highlight for you today on the Haynesville, is we have literally hundreds of locations, a significant multiyear inventory of high-quality acreage for us to develop. But we also believe that, given the quality of the acreage and the opportunity there, that we can accelerate some value. So we know that there is what we'll call select areas that, whether it be inside of core or noncore, that we can accelerate value.

We decided with -- well, once we've seen the cost savings they've been able to achieve -- again, they've taken their well costs down to $4 million for wells that are 9,000 feet long. So that's an amazing transformation for them. Also, savings in areas like the Haynesville have allowed us to just keep that program going, so we're reinvesting there. So that's the biggest increase in our drill spuds. It's going to be in the Eagle Ford. I'd say we've gone -- I think we had 25 was our original plan, and we're now up to 100. So a lot of incremental spuds in the Eagle Ford. Those translate -- really are going to show up more in 2017 because their acceleration on the schedule and so the tills don't start to really come in until '17. So that's when you'll see those. We do have about 15 or so incremental tills in Eagle Ford of this year. Mid-Con saw a big jump in the till count as well. We had some of the curtailment issues that impacted us early in the year. We had shut down our Miss Lime completion program. We've been able to work through the water issues by recompleting into different disposal zones, which opened up our water capacity later in the year.

I hope you've had the opportunity to review our press release and presentation from earlier this morning. 
We continue to make good progress on multiple fronts, including a meaningful reduction in our debt, stronger production, lower operating costs and optimization of our portfolio. While we still face a challenging commodity price environment, I think it's important to note the significant progress that Chesapeake Energy has made despite commodity prices. In the past 3 years, we've reduced our total leverage by approximately 50%. We've reduced our cash cost by roughly 50% and significantly improved our capital efficiency. This year's capital program is roughly 10% of the capital spend in 2012. 
And importantly, our production today is approximately equivalent to our 2012 production. We have sharpened our operational capability, technology, geoscience and engineering to drive further value for our shareholders for the long term. We have 3 major gas assets, each with a significant well inventory of new drilling opportunities that can produce in excess of 30 million cubic feet per day per well. 
I'd like to share a few examples of our continued progress. In the Haynesville, we have recognized transformational value improvements this quarter. We continue to lead the industry on long-lateral technology with 6 10,000-foot wells drilled to date. We have recently tested the largest completion in Chesapeake's history with over 30 million pounds of sand being pumped in the well. Results have been very impressive with a restricted initial rate of 38 million cubic feet per day and a flowing pressure of approximately 7,500 psi. We call this new era in completion technology proppant-geddon . We've not yet reached the point of diminishing returns in the Haynesville, and we plan additional tests up to 50 million pounds in the back half of the year. We look forward to sharing more results of the proppant-geddon program in the future.
In the Eagle Ford, similar to the Haynesville, we continue to optimize our drilling schedule with longer laterals. We moved from an average lateral length of 6,500 feet in 2015 to an average of 9,300 feet in the second quarter of 2016. We've slashed our cost to drill and complete an Eagle Ford well by more than 50% on a cost-per-foot basis. Total well cost for wells completed in the second quarter averaged just under $4 million with drill times reduced to 9.7 days even though we are drilling longer -- drilling wells with longer laterals. 
The move to longer laterals in all of our fields allows us to accelerate value capture as each rig is developing up to twice the rock volume compared to last year. These are just a few examples of our recent cost and technology improvements, and we believe these improvements directed at our high-quality assets provide our shareholders with competitive investment opportunities for years to come. We have in excess of 9,000 well locations across the portfolio that can generate greater than a 20% rate of return at $3 gas and $60 oil. 
Since June of 2015, we have reduced our total debt by over $3 billion, with $1 billion of that reduction being since the beginning of 2016. In addition, we are confident in our ability to completely retire and/or refinance our 2017 maturities. 
The complexity of our business has further improved in the second quarter with the repurchase of 4 volumetric production payment contracts, leaving the company with only 2 of the 9 VPPs that we had 3 years ago. You've also seen that we've increased our production guidance for the full year. This is driven primarily by gas volume increases from the Haynesville and Marcellus assets. Our operating teams have done a fantastic job in generating more value out of our capital program, primarily due to operating efficiencies and lower service costs, resulting in the opportunity for higher activity in the second half of 2016. 
For the last 6 months of the year, we plan to take the following actions, all of which will be completed within our previously estimated CapEx guidance range. First, we plan to drill 100 more wells, which is roughly twice the number of wells originally planned in 2016. Primarily, this will occur as we keep 3 rigs running in the Eagle Ford when we had previously expected to release those rigs earlier this summer. Second, we are projecting to place on production approximately 75 more wells than we originally planned. Third, in July, we took down a small property acquisition in the Haynesville for $87 million. I'm very proud of our team's ability to more than overcome the 35,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day sold in 2016 dispositions within the same calendar year. 
However, more important is the great momentum this additional activity provides to our 2017 production and cash-generating capabilities. You will note we've updated our oil production guidance as the majority of our announced divestiture transactions closed in the second quarter. Full year guidance has been reduced by 1 million barrels in the Mid-Continent area as a result of the Granite Wash divestiture to FourPoint and the STACK divestiture to Newfield. To a lesser extent, Mid-Continent oil production for the year was also impacted due to compliance with water-restriction directives established by the State of Oklahoma. 
The increased drilling and completion activity in the latter half of 2016, made possible through our efficiency gains, will greatly benefit 2017 oil volumes, offsetting decline and resulting in 2017 oil volumes being relatively flat year-over-year. As a very preliminary look to full year production guidance for 2017, our total production volumes are projected to be down by mid-single digit compared to 2016 production levels. 
We continue to focus on improving our gathering and transportation costs across the portfolio. We are actively working with Williams in all of our midstream and downstream service providers on win-win solutions in the current pricing environment. We're encouraged by the progress we have made to date, and we believe we will be able to announce additional meaningful improvements in the near future. 
Following on to my initial comments, we have used this period of reduced activity to perform an in-depth study of the resource position and potential of each one of our operating areas. In short, the oil and gas resource potential of Chesapeake Energy is stunning. Our asset value and portfolio of investment opportunities are being redefined through better operating efficiencies and cost structure improvements and also through the rapid evolution of the technologies we apply. The result of this work provides the foundation for competitive investment performance with significantly enhanced economics. 
We're working hard every day to apply these technologies to our extensive undeveloped acreage position and anticipate that these efforts will translate into incremental shareholder value. As an example and as noted, if you can look at the Investor Relations slides posted to our website this morning, you can see the of in operational efficiencies and technology application we're having on the Haynesville asset. We look forward to sharing more about our value proposition and competitive portfolio in the near future. 
On the A&D front, we are increasing our target of gross proceeds from divestiture, either closed or undersigned PSA, to over $2 billion for 2016. One of the select areas that we believe will contribute to the new divestiture target is certain acreage within our large Haynesville footprint. Nick will provide some additional detail regarding our recent A&D efforts, including the highly accretive acquisition that we closed last week in the Haynesville.
In closing, I am pleased with the significant progress we continue to make in reducing our debt, eliminating complexity, lowering our cost and high-grading our portfolio. We are beginning to see evidence that our differential leverage reduction and industry-leading operational capabilities are gaining traction with investors. However, we are just getting started. We believe the portfolio of high quality economic opportunities within Chesapeake is unmatched in the unconventional oil and gas business. We are driven to succeed and will continue to work relentlessly to reduce our debt and improve our midstream contracts, and we will continue to share news about our progress on both fronts soon. 
The breadth and depth of our portfolio will continue to expand from a multiplier effect as we apply our leading-edge technologies to the development of our assets. This will result in unlocking more and more value. The momentum behind the transformation of Chesapeake is building and, with it, the realization of greater value throughout our portfolio. 
I'll now pass the call to Nick, and then we'll open the call for questions."

As Doug has stated, financial discipline across our entire business remains a priority at Chesapeake.

As Doug has stated, financial discipline across our entire business remains a priority at Chesapeake. It's not only about reducing our operating expenses or capital cost savings, although we've done very well in those areas, our main focus is the reduction of our total debt and the improvement in our liquidity, specifically debt maturing in the next 6 to 24 months. While the debt capital markets have been constrained over the past 12 months, we are pleased with the recent increase in the pricing of our securities and believe our opportunities to enter the market are improving. 
As you're aware, in April, we've reaffirmed the $4 billion borrowing base for our revolving credit facility, and in return, we pledged additional properties. The recent improvements in our cost structure, along with our leverage to gas prices, has yielded a significant uplift in the value to our reserves. Using the same database, same type curves and same reserves but using June 30 strip pricing, our proved reserves increased to approximately $11.1 billion at June 30 compared to approximately $3.1 billion when using the SEC methodology of the average of commodity prices on the first day of the month over a trailing 12-month period. 
Using June 30 strip pricing at a 9% discount rate, similar to how our bank group values our reserves, the value increased to approximately $11.9 billion. We have ample reserves backing our liquidity position of approximately $3.1 billion at June 30. With this liquidity, we are well positioned to fully retire or refinance our pending 2017 debt maturities. 
On the expense side, our cash costs continue to decline, and we have moved our production expense guidance lower due to additional cost savings. During the quarter, our G&A ticked up a bit due to additional legal expenses related to the settlements of legacy lawsuits and some bad debt expense that we wrote off, impacting our EPS by about a $0.01. Overall, however, we expect our G&A to remain within our current guidance range at this time.
On the A&D front, we have closed on the announced sales to FourPoint and Newfield. We have also stated that we intend to put a select portion of our Haynesville assets on the market. These are lightly developed properties that we will not likely further develop for some time given the depth of our Haynesville drilling inventory. After the acquisition we completed in July, we currently have approximately 430,000 net acres in the Haynesville and are looking to sell approximately 150,000 net acres of that position. While we know there is substantial value to be created with the evolution towards longer laterals, higher frac density completions and cost efficiencies going forward, we will retain a position where we have hundreds of locations remaining to be drilled by Chesapeake after the planned disposition. The acreage we are looking to sell includes approximately 95 million cubic feet a day of production. 
In July, we acquired approximately 70,000 net acres in the Haynesville, primarily within our already existing operating units for approximately $87 million, pursuant to a pref right we had on the properties. Through the acquisition, we increased our average working interest in the area to approximately 83%, along with adding daily net production of approximately 60 million cubic feet a day of gas. The midstream contracts on the asset are the same as Chesapeake's, and the rates on those have decreased since our renegotiations with Williams last year and some of the downstream transport this year. Additionally, our operational efficiencies are allowing us to better utilize our transportation, which brings even more improvement to those contracts. 
Most importantly, we exercised our pref right on the purchase because we felt we were getting the assets for a fraction of the value using current pricing. Using June 30 strip pricing, we internally valued this incremental asset at approximately $200 million or more than double the cost. Additionally, the PV-10 of the PDP alone was higher than the purchase price. We are huge believers in the Haynesville, and with gas prices lifting and the current completion techniques being employed, we are very pleased to have increased our working interest in the play at an attractive price. 
We've been adding to our hedge position for the remainder of 2016 and '17 to help derisk our cash flow. For the remainder of 2016, we are hedged at approximately 75% of our projected production with approximately 373 Bcf of our remaining 2016 gas production hedged at $2.77 per Mcf and approximately 12.1 million barrels of our 2016 oil production hedged at approximately $46.60 per barrel. We have also started to add some 2017 hedges. For 2017, we currently have 290 Bcf hedged at $3 per Mcf and 7.7 million barrels hedged at approximately $47.79 per barrel. 
In closing, we are making meaningful strides in our debt reduction efforts and look to do more in this area. Our production remains strong, and we've been able to beat estimates and guidance without increasing our capital spending range. We expect more success in the A&D market and look forward to being able to talk more about these transactions later this year. 
That concludes my comments. I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions."

Again, we're going through the budget process at the company right now, and we expect to kind of keep 3 rigs flat but run some sensitivities on that as we speak. So the Haynesville, again, with these new completion techniques, they've really transformed the asset for us. It's just as competitive as the Eagle Ford is. One of the challenges that we've got is all the teams are doing very similar things, and they're fighting each other every day for every dollar, in a good way. But they all have rate of returns that are in 40% to as high as 60% in every single play that we operate. So it's been an exciting time for us as our economics today are better than they were when we had $80 oil prices, and we continue to optimize each of these plays. So the longer laterals, when you look at Chesapeake's history, we really had -- we went in a lease capture mode where we kind of had 1 well per 640 acres. So for us, we see an advantage, and we're one of the few companies that can go to these 10,000-foot wells in nearly every play that we operate. We're not as overdeveloped. We're not focused on having to go to downspacing and increase density to add well count. We're adding these longer-lateral wells across every field that we operate today, and we're not forced to just downspace in order to add inventory."

Over the past year, we have continued to make significant progress in building a stronger Chesapeake for the future. During our Analyst Day held a few weeks back here in Oklahoma City, we highlighted the strength in our asset base, technology and expertise. 
To briefly summarize, the financial and operational improvements of the company over the past few years are foundational and differential. We've reduced our total leverage by $10.9 billion, reduced cash costs by roughly 15%, substantially improved capital efficiencies and productivity and materially improved midstream gathering costs, all to build a more competitive, profitable Chesapeake that we forecast in 2018 to achieve free cash flow neutrality and the ability to generate more than $3 billion in EBITDA. All this progress has been made despite depressed commodity prices. 
At our Analyst Day, we released significant technical detail regarding the potential of our oil and gas portfolio, notably the estimated net recoverable resources of 11.3 billion barrels of oil equivalent. We provided a road map that highlights the opportunity for profitable and efficient growth through our captured resources over time, along with projected financial results through the end of the decade under certain reasonable price assumptions. I'd like to update you today on a couple of operational results of interest since our Analyst Day. 
In the Haynesville, we are currently fracking a 10,000-foot lateral well with 50 million pounds of sand or roughly 5,000 pounds per lateral foot at ultra-tight cluster spacing. This completion will have the largest number of stages we have ever pumped in the Haynesville in a single well and the well should be placed to sales in the next few weeks. We are recognizing transformation value improvements in this asset, and we look forward to sharing more results of our progress in the Haynesville in the near future. 
In the Mid-Continent, we recently introduced a new concept area that we call the Wedge, in which Chesapeake has approximately 870,000 net acres under lease and where we are targeting several oil and gas-bearing stacked horizons. We have 2 recent step-out wells in the area that are currently producing 1,000 to 1,400 barrels of oil equivalent per day, 50% to 70% of which is oil from 1-mile appraisal well. We believe the development potential in this area utilizing 2-mile laterals is tremendous. 
We're excited about the potential from these assets and with our other operating areas as we look ahead to 2017. With an inventory of over 17,000 wells still to be drilled across 6 major operating areas with 5,600 of those wells currently having a rate of return greater than 40%, we are confident that the Chesapeake operating machine is stronger today than at any other time in our history. 
Turning to the results from the 2016 third quarter. Our total production was 638,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, an increase of over 2% compared to a year ago, adjusted for asset sales. In our IR slides we shared this morning, we detailed the production impact of our year-to-date divestitures to demonstrate the strength and resiliency of our production base even after those adjustments. Our total volumes for our divestitures in the Mid-Continent area, the Barnett, and now pending transactions in the Devonian and Haynesville, were primarily gas. The full impact of approximately 8,200 barrels of daily oil production divested since the beginning of the year was recognized in the 2016 third quarter. 
We have already started to replace these oil volumes with new volumes from the Eagle Ford and the Mid-Continent. And our total net oil production for October is projected to be approximately 91,000 barrels of oil per day. With our productivity and capital efficiency improvements and subject to final capital allocation and commodity prices, we currently forecast that we will replace the divested oil volumes in 2017 and begin a strong oil growth trajectory.
In the slides, we also highlight our forecasted production growth over the coming quarters. We are currently projecting an exit-to-exit increase in total production from the fourth quarter of 2016 to the fourth quarter of 2017 of approximately 7%, adjusted for asset sales. More importantly, we are projecting an exit-to-exit increase in our oil production from the fourth quarter of 2016 to the fourth quarter of 2017 of 10%. 
Looking further forward to 2018. The growth continues even stronger. We previously estimated that our 2018 year-over-year total production growth rate would be in the 10% to 15% range. However, when looking at exit rates from 2017 to 2018, we see a strong trajectory throughout the year. We are currently projecting an increase in our total production from the fourth quarter of 2017 through the fourth quarter of 2018 of approximately 15%, primarily driven by an exit-to-exit increase in our oil production from the fourth quarter of '17 to the fourth quarter of '18 of over 20%. We believe our Eagle Ford and Mid-Continent assets will be driving this growth and the Powder River Basin will be beginning to accelerate as well. These numbers are a reflection of our capital efficiency, productivity and the power of our portfolio.
Turning to our costs. Operational efficiencies are driving lower production expense. We see this trend continuing both in the fourth quarter of 2016 and for the full year of 2017. And as a result, we've reduced our production expense guidance for both time periods. We also believe these efficiency-related cost reductions are sustainable beyond 2017. Our G&A expenses for the 2016 third quarter were up year-over-year due to lower recoveries of G&A expenses due to asset sales and a slight increase in stock-based compensation and compensation related to achieving certain annual performance goals tied to capital efficiency improvements, cash cost reductions and gathering process and transportation expenses. 
On the A&D front, we currently have gross proceeds from divestitures either closed or undersigned PSA of approximately $1.3 billion in 2016 or about $1 billion net. We are on track to achieve our stated asset divestitures target of more than $2 billion in gross proceeds, all of which should be closed in the first quarter of 2017. We will continue to optimize our portfolio in 2017, accelerating value for our shareholders. 
In closing, I am pleased with the significant and foundational progress we have made in reducing our debt, eliminating complexity and lowering our costs. We will continue building on our record of performance in efficiency improvements and we will continue to drive for greater profitability and competitiveness. We remain committed to further improving our balance sheet and we are uniquely positioned to create value for our shareholders through our high-quality assets, our driven, talented employees and a liquidity runway built out for several years. We are excited about our opportunities and our progress. We have more to do and the momentum behind Chesapeake Energy will continue to build. 
I'll now pass the call to Nick, and then we'll follow up the questions on the call."
323857,404977092,1071660,"Chesapeake Energy Corporation, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2016",2016-11-03,"Earnings Calls","Expand Energy Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Doug, and good morning, everyone. Let me start out by saying that this has been an extremely busy quarter as we continue to recapitalize the balance sheet, improve operational efficiencies and flexibility and position the company for profitable",1336,"Thank you, Doug, and good morning, everyone. Let me start out by saying that this has been an extremely busy quarter as we continue to recapitalize the balance sheet, improve operational efficiencies and flexibility and position the company for profitable and efficient growth. We realized that there have been a tremendous amount of adjustments and moving parts to model recently with a lot of related explanations to cover, all of which highlight very positive trends in our underlying business. I will try to summarize the highlights here today. 
While there were several gives and takes this quarter related to LOE, G&A, gathering, processing and transportation and interest expense line items, the primary driver of lower EBITDA compared to what we had expected this quarter was found in our marketing segment, the impact of which was just under $30 million. This is primarily driven by the loss of margin due to the sale and acceleration of value of a long-term gas contract and some out-of-period charges related to assets we are selling in the Barnett and Devonian. 
We continue to focus on reducing our cash cost and balance sheet leverage. And we were able to make significant progress in these areas over the past several months. On the operating cost side, we have not only reduced our LOE expenses per unit of production, as Doug mentioned, but we have also achieved significant improvements in our midstream and downstream cost structure going forward. With the closing of the Barnett Shale transaction earlier this week, we are removing a significant amount of gathering, processing and transportation expenses. 
For the 2016 fourth quarter alone, we will be removing 2 months of GP&T costs, including the minimum volume commitment, settling approximately $235 million related to the asset. We also decreased our Mid-Continent gathering fees effective July 1 of this year and expect the same in our Powder River Basin area effective January 1, 2017. As a result, our total gathering, processing and transportation expenses -- we anticipate our total gathering, processing and transportation expenses to decrease by roughly 8% in 2017. These changes reduced our commitments and improved the economics of future drilling opportunities, leading to significantly improved operating flexibility as we continue to evaluate our capital allocation in pursuit of the projects that will maximize shareholder value. 
On the NGL side of our gathering, processing and treating costs, we have seen an increase this quarter due to higher-than-expected levels of ethane projections. This was offset by an increase in realized prices we receive for NGLs as our mix shifted to heavier liquids following our Granite Wash sale earlier this year. Note in 2017, we are guiding to higher NGL gathering, processing and treating costs due to revised contracts in the Mid-Continent area, where increasing volumes will be gathered under contracts structured with processing fees, allowing us to receive a greater uplift in net NGL revenues. Therefore, we believe we will continue to see improved net NGL revenues that will offset the increase in processing costs. 
Our primary financial focus has been the reduction of both our near-term and total debt and improvements to our near-term liquidity. Over the past 12 months, we have been able to reduce our debt maturing or puttable in 2017 through 2019 by $3 billion. In total, we have removed approximately $2.1 billion in principal amount of debt over the past 12 months, making good progress on our longer-term goal of $6 billion to $7 billion in total debt. 
As far as extending our maturities, we entered into a $1.5 billion secured 5-year term loan facility during the third quarter and used the net proceeds in a tender offer for maturities primarily in the near to mid-term of our debt maturity stack. Further, in October, we issued $1.25 billion principal amount of unsecured 5.5% convertible senior notes due 2026, which essentially prefunded our remaining 2017 and 2018 maturing and puttable debt. And we have already purchased approximately $100 million of 2017 and 2018 maturities at a discount to make-whole since closing on the convert. 
As a result of these steps, we sit with $3.7 billion of liquidity, including approximately $650 million of cash today after having closed on the Barnett Shale transaction earlier this week. I would note that we have formulaically reduced our availability under our revolver by a little over $200 million as a result of asset sales. As previously noted, our current reserves calculation is well in advance of the levels which support the full $4 billion. We are currently scheduled to redetermine our borrowing base next summer but do have the option to request the redetermination sooner. At the moment, we obviously have ample liquidity and do not anticipate our pending asset sales having any further impact on this calculation. 
Through all of these cost structure improvements, asset sales and balance sheet transactions, we've greatly improved our cash flow profile that have cleared the debt maturity runway, allowing us to focus on our operations instead of our obligations. Additionally, to further improve our capital structure, we exchanged an aggregate of approximately 110 million shares of common stock for approximately $1.2 billion of liquidation value of preferred stock at a discount of approximately 40%. 
On the A&D front, we have announced that a PSA has been signed for our Devonian assets and we intend to buy back the VPP related to that asset when consummated. We believe that cash to the company will be a nominal net positive as a result of these transactions. When these transactions are completed, we will have only one remaining VPP, that one being in Northern Oklahoma. We have also noted that we are looking to sell approximately 126,000 net acres of our Haynesville position in 2 separate sales packages. Bids are in for the first package, which has net production of approximately 30 million cubic feet of gas per day. We are pleased with the indications, which we expect to be at a substantial multiple over the EBITDA we projected on the PDP of this asset in 2017 of approximately $15 million. We expect to proceed the execution on the sale with an anticipated close in the first quarter of 2017. 
The data room for the second package has just been opened. This package has net production of approximately 45 million cubic feet of gas per day and was expected to contribute about $25 million in EBITDA from those PDP volumes in 2017. Based on the current interest and the need by buyers to digest the recent and upcoming strong well results, we continue to see with new wells in the area, we look forward to updating the market on the results of the second package in early 2017. 
As noted during our Analyst Day presentation, our 2017 projected production guidance reiterated today has been adjusted for both the expected Devonian and Haynesville divestitures. So we kept our 2017 projected production guidance the same as previously stated back in August despite the removal of expected net volumes of about 35 Bcf from these anticipated transactions. 
With the continued volatility of both gas and oil prices, we are pleased that our hedge position for both the remainder of 2016 and 2017 is already fairly robust, particularly on natural gas side. We will continue to monitor market conditions and may increase our positions in both gas and oil at the appropriate times.
Our current hedge position is detailed in the slides we posted to our website this morning. 
In closing, we are making meaningful strides in our debt reduction efforts and look to continue our progress in this area. We expect more success in the A&D market and expect to be able to discuss these transactions soon. As Doug noted, our production remains strong. When you look to start -- when you start to look through 2017 to 2018, our production rate only gets stronger, given our highly efficient capital program in 2017. 
That concludes my comments. I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions."

You were trailing off a little bit there, so I think I got the gist of the question. If I don't answer it fully, just come back with more. But we did sell a long-term gas supply contract during the quarter. We had announced that previously. That had with it a mark-to-market gain on future periods of $280 million that had been in the asset section of our balance sheet. You can think of that fairly consistent with the way you would account for hedge, where the future value of that contract was marked each quarter and was in the gain position. So it's an asset. So that came off, that was not included -- the removal of that gain was not included in our adjusted earnings. What we did include was the $146 million of actual cash proceeds we received from accelerating the value of that contract to the quarter, again, all received in cash. And we wanted to really highlight that. And so right in the paragraph, what we discussed are the things that we adjusted out. We highlighted that included that in. The reason we chose to included in is that the realized portion of that contract has been in now for several periods in a row. And if you didn't include the acceleration of value anywhere, you would likely have a miss of not seeing that contract trend continue. So we thought it was important to highlight for investors that, that value was accelerating when it came in. And then you should adjust your marketing margin going forward for the fact that we will not see the value of that contract continue to pay out in future periods, and again, it all accelerated into the third quarter of this year. I will note that the value of that contract was pretty high on a per-quarter basis in 2016 as, basically, it was a $4 floor gas delivery contract. And so during the periods of 2017 where gas was very low, the [indiscernible] on that contract was pretty high. Going into next year, of course, as the strip returned to the neighborhood of $3, the value of that contract would have been coming back in or little, but still obviously was a good contract that we replaced accelerate the value of almost $150 million in cash this quarter at a time when we can use it to apply to our balance sheet."

So we've better really good test going on there right now where we've got a 3,000-pound per foot job flowing right the cycle one of the 5,000-pound per for foot jobs. We kind of trying to manage them and keep them as equal as we can, but the 5,000-pound per foot job is flowing back at, I guess, a week later, 17 million cubic feet a day and 7,900 pounds, like the 3,000-pound job is 14.5 million and 7,500 pounds. And we've definitely seen a big gain from the -- going to 5,000 pounds per foot, and we're excited about it. We've updated our cost. The cost is about job-related this to make 10,000-foot well, it's about $600,000 more or to go $1.2 million if you go to 3,000 to 5000 pounds. So it's not a huge incremental investment considering the gain that we see already on this side-to-side test. But record well that we also highlighted was the 15 million pounds is that all its plugs drilled out and will be coming on line so we're really excited about that. It'll be the first 10,000-foot well with this bigger design on it. And then Doug highlighted in his notes, one that tested the limits of even tighter perf clusters with the big job that they're getting ready to do as well. We've got several exciting tests coming online. We are very encouraged by the incremental performance from the increased sand and perf cluster spacing. We've got several other tests with 4,000-pound jobs that kind of split the difference coming up. So very dynamic program in the Haynesville, but one we're very excited about and it seems that every bit extra we do with these wells is producing a very positive return to us."

Over the past year, we have continued to make significant progress in building a stronger Chesapeake for the future. During our Analyst Day held a few weeks back here in Oklahoma City, we highlighted the strength in our asset base, technology and expertise. 
To briefly summarize, the financial and operational improvements of the company over the past few years are foundational and differential. We've reduced our total leverage by $10.9 billion, reduced cash costs by roughly 15%, substantially improved capital efficiencies and productivity and materially improved midstream gathering costs, all to build a more competitive, profitable Chesapeake that we forecast in 2018 to achieve free cash flow neutrality and the ability to generate more than $3 billion in EBITDA. All this progress has been made despite depressed commodity prices. 
At our Analyst Day, we released significant technical detail regarding the potential of our oil and gas portfolio, notably the estimated net recoverable resources of 11.3 billion barrels of oil equivalent. We provided a road map that highlights the opportunity for profitable and efficient growth through our captured resources over time, along with projected financial results through the end of the decade under certain reasonable price assumptions. I'd like to update you today on a couple of operational results of interest since our Analyst Day. 
In the Haynesville, we are currently fracking a 10,000-foot lateral well with 50 million pounds of sand or roughly 5,000 pounds per lateral foot at ultra-tight cluster spacing. This completion will have the largest number of stages we have ever pumped in the Haynesville in a single well and the well should be placed to sales in the next few weeks. We are recognizing transformation value improvements in this asset, and we look forward to sharing more results of our progress in the Haynesville in the near future. 
In the Mid-Continent, we recently introduced a new concept area that we call the Wedge, in which Chesapeake has approximately 870,000 net acres under lease and where we are targeting several oil and gas-bearing stacked horizons. We have 2 recent step-out wells in the area that are currently producing 1,000 to 1,400 barrels of oil equivalent per day, 50% to 70% of which is oil from 1-mile appraisal well. We believe the development potential in this area utilizing 2-mile laterals is tremendous. 
We're excited about the potential from these assets and with our other operating areas as we look ahead to 2017. With an inventory of over 17,000 wells still to be drilled across 6 major operating areas with 5,600 of those wells currently having a rate of return greater than 40%, we are confident that the Chesapeake operating machine is stronger today than at any other time in our history. 
Turning to the results from the 2016 third quarter. Our total production was 638,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, an increase of over 2% compared to a year ago, adjusted for asset sales. In our IR slides we shared this morning, we detailed the production impact of our year-to-date divestitures to demonstrate the strength and resiliency of our production base even after those adjustments. Our total volumes for our divestitures in the Mid-Continent area, the Barnett, and now pending transactions in the Devonian and Haynesville, were primarily gas. The full impact of approximately 8,200 barrels of daily oil production divested since the beginning of the year was recognized in the 2016 third quarter. 
We have already started to replace these oil volumes with new volumes from the Eagle Ford and the Mid-Continent. And our total net oil production for October is projected to be approximately 91,000 barrels of oil per day. With our productivity and capital efficiency improvements and subject to final capital allocation and commodity prices, we currently forecast that we will replace the divested oil volumes in 2017 and begin a strong oil growth trajectory.
In the slides, we also highlight our forecasted production growth over the coming quarters. We are currently projecting an exit-to-exit increase in total production from the fourth quarter of 2016 to the fourth quarter of 2017 of approximately 7%, adjusted for asset sales. More importantly, we are projecting an exit-to-exit increase in our oil production from the fourth quarter of 2016 to the fourth quarter of 2017 of 10%. 
Looking further forward to 2018. The growth continues even stronger. We previously estimated that our 2018 year-over-year total production growth rate would be in the 10% to 15% range. However, when looking at exit rates from 2017 to 2018, we see a strong trajectory throughout the year. We are currently projecting an increase in our total production from the fourth quarter of 2017 through the fourth quarter of 2018 of approximately 15%, primarily driven by an exit-to-exit increase in our oil production from the fourth quarter of '17 to the fourth quarter of '18 of over 20%. We believe our Eagle Ford and Mid-Continent assets will be driving this growth and the Powder River Basin will be beginning to accelerate as well. These numbers are a reflection of our capital efficiency, productivity and the power of our portfolio.
Turning to our costs. Operational efficiencies are driving lower production expense. We see this trend continuing both in the fourth quarter of 2016 and for the full year of 2017. And as a result, we've reduced our production expense guidance for both time periods. We also believe these efficiency-related cost reductions are sustainable beyond 2017. Our G&A expenses for the 2016 third quarter were up year-over-year due to lower recoveries of G&A expenses due to asset sales and a slight increase in stock-based compensation and compensation related to achieving certain annual performance goals tied to capital efficiency improvements, cash cost reductions and gathering process and transportation expenses. 
On the A&D front, we currently have gross proceeds from divestitures either closed or undersigned PSA of approximately $1.3 billion in 2016 or about $1 billion net. We are on track to achieve our stated asset divestitures target of more than $2 billion in gross proceeds, all of which should be closed in the first quarter of 2017. We will continue to optimize our portfolio in 2017, accelerating value for our shareholders. 
In closing, I am pleased with the significant and foundational progress we have made in reducing our debt, eliminating complexity and lowering our costs. We will continue building on our record of performance in efficiency improvements and we will continue to drive for greater profitability and competitiveness. We remain committed to further improving our balance sheet and we are uniquely positioned to create value for our shareholders through our high-quality assets, our driven, talented employees and a liquidity runway built out for several years. We are excited about our opportunities and our progress. We have more to do and the momentum behind Chesapeake Energy will continue to build. 
I'll now pass the call to Nick, and then we'll follow up the questions on the call."
323857,404977092,1071826,"Chesapeake Energy Corporation, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2016",2016-11-03,"Earnings Calls","Expand Energy Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Doug, and good morning, everyone. Let me start out by saying that this has been an extremely busy quarter as we continue to recapitalize the balance sheet, improve operational efficiencies and flexibility and position the company for profitable",1337,"Thank you, Doug, and good morning, everyone. Let me start out by saying that this has been an extremely busy quarter as we continue to recapitalize the balance sheet, improve operational efficiencies and flexibility and position the company for profitable and efficient growth. We realized that there have been a tremendous amount of adjustments and moving parts to model recently with a lot of related explanations to cover, all of which highlight very positive trends in our underlying business. I will try to summarize the highlights here today. 
While there were several gives and takes this quarter related to LOE, G&A, gathering, processing and transportation and interest expense line items, the primary driver of lower EBITDA compared to what we had expected this quarter was found in our marketing segment, the impact of which was just under $30 million. This is primarily driven by the loss of margin due to the sale and acceleration of value of a long-term gas contract and some out-of-period charges related to assets we are selling in the Barnett and Devonian. 
We continue to focus on reducing our cash cost and balance sheet leverage. And we were able to make significant progress in these areas over the past several months. On the operating cost side, we have not only reduced our LOE expenses per unit of production, as Doug mentioned, but we have also achieved significant improvements in our midstream and downstream cost structure going forward. With the closing of the Barnett Shale transaction earlier this week, we are removing a significant amount of gathering, processing and transportation expenses. 
For the 2016 fourth quarter alone, we will be removing 2 months of GP&T costs, including the minimum volume commitment, settling approximately $235 million related to the asset. We also decreased our Mid-Continent gathering fees effective July 1 of this year and expect the same in our Powder River Basin area effective January 1, 2017. As a result, our total gathering, processing and transportation expenses -- we anticipate our total gathering, processing and transportation expenses to decrease by roughly 8% in 2017. These changes reduced our commitments and improved the economics of future drilling opportunities, leading to significantly improved operating flexibility as we continue to evaluate our capital allocation in pursuit of the projects that will maximize shareholder value. 
On the NGL side of our gathering, processing and treating costs, we have seen an increase this quarter due to higher-than-expected levels of ethane projections. This was offset by an increase in realized prices we receive for NGLs as our mix shifted to heavier liquids following our Granite Wash sale earlier this year. Note in 2017, we are guiding to higher NGL gathering, processing and treating costs due to revised contracts in the Mid-Continent area, where increasing volumes will be gathered under contracts structured with processing fees, allowing us to receive a greater uplift in net NGL revenues. Therefore, we believe we will continue to see improved net NGL revenues that will offset the increase in processing costs. 
Our primary financial focus has been the reduction of both our near-term and total debt and improvements to our near-term liquidity. Over the past 12 months, we have been able to reduce our debt maturing or puttable in 2017 through 2019 by $3 billion. In total, we have removed approximately $2.1 billion in principal amount of debt over the past 12 months, making good progress on our longer-term goal of $6 billion to $7 billion in total debt. 
As far as extending our maturities, we entered into a $1.5 billion secured 5-year term loan facility during the third quarter and used the net proceeds in a tender offer for maturities primarily in the near to mid-term of our debt maturity stack. Further, in October, we issued $1.25 billion principal amount of unsecured 5.5% convertible senior notes due 2026, which essentially prefunded our remaining 2017 and 2018 maturing and puttable debt. And we have already purchased approximately $100 million of 2017 and 2018 maturities at a discount to make-whole since closing on the convert. 
As a result of these steps, we sit with $3.7 billion of liquidity, including approximately $650 million of cash today after having closed on the Barnett Shale transaction earlier this week. I would note that we have formulaically reduced our availability under our revolver by a little over $200 million as a result of asset sales. As previously noted, our current reserves calculation is well in advance of the levels which support the full $4 billion. We are currently scheduled to redetermine our borrowing base next summer but do have the option to request the redetermination sooner. At the moment, we obviously have ample liquidity and do not anticipate our pending asset sales having any further impact on this calculation. 
Through all of these cost structure improvements, asset sales and balance sheet transactions, we've greatly improved our cash flow profile that have cleared the debt maturity runway, allowing us to focus on our operations instead of our obligations. Additionally, to further improve our capital structure, we exchanged an aggregate of approximately 110 million shares of common stock for approximately $1.2 billion of liquidation value of preferred stock at a discount of approximately 40%. 
On the A&D front, we have announced that a PSA has been signed for our Devonian assets and we intend to buy back the VPP related to that asset when consummated. We believe that cash to the company will be a nominal net positive as a result of these transactions. When these transactions are completed, we will have only one remaining VPP, that one being in Northern Oklahoma. We have also noted that we are looking to sell approximately 126,000 net acres of our Haynesville position in 2 separate sales packages. Bids are in for the first package, which has net production of approximately 30 million cubic feet of gas per day. We are pleased with the indications, which we expect to be at a substantial multiple over the EBITDA we projected on the PDP of this asset in 2017 of approximately $15 million. We expect to proceed the execution on the sale with an anticipated close in the first quarter of 2017. 
The data room for the second package has just been opened. This package has net production of approximately 45 million cubic feet of gas per day and was expected to contribute about $25 million in EBITDA from those PDP volumes in 2017. Based on the current interest and the need by buyers to digest the recent and upcoming strong well results we continue to see with new wells in the area, we look forward to updating the market on the results of the second package in early 2017. As noted during our Analyst Day presentation, our 2017 projected production guidance reiterated today has been adjusted for both the expected Devonian and Haynesville divestitures. So we kept our 2017 projected production guidance the same as previously stated back in August despite the removal of expected net volumes of about 35 Bcf from these anticipated transactions. 
With the continued volatility of both gas and oil prices, we are pleased that our hedge position for both the remainder of 2016 and 2017 is already fairly robust, particularly on the natural gas side. We will continue to monitor market conditions and may increase our positions in both gas and oil at the appropriate times. Our current hedge position is detailed in the slides we posted to our website this morning. 
In closing, we are making meaningful strides in our debt reduction efforts and look to continue our progress in this area. We expect more success in the A&D market and expect to be able to discuss these transactions soon. As Doug noted, our production remains strong. When you look to start -- when you start to look through 2017 to 2018, our production rate only gets stronger, given our highly efficient capital program in 2017. 
That concludes my comments. I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions."

You were trailing off a little bit there, so I think I got the gist of the question. If I don't answer it fully, just come back with more. But we did sell a long-term gas supply contract during the quarter. We had announced that previously. T",411,"Sure, James. You were trailing off a little bit there, so I think I got the gist of the question. If I don't answer it fully, just come back with more. But we did sell a long-term gas supply contract during the quarter. We had announced that previously. That had with it a mark-to-market gain on future periods of $280 million that had been in the asset section of our balance sheet. You can think of that fairly consistent with the way you would account for a hedge, where the future value of that contract was marked each quarter and was in a gain position, so it was an asset. So that came off, that was not included. The removal of that gain was not included in our adjusted earnings. What we did include was the $146 million of actual cash proceeds we received from accelerating the value of that contract to the quarter, again all received in cash. And we wanted to really highlight that. And so right in the paragraph, where we discuss the things that we adjusted out, we've highlighted that we included that in. The reason we chose to include it in is that the realized portion of that contract has been in now for several periods in a row. And if you didn't include the acceleration of value anywhere, you would likely have a miss of not seeing that contract trend continue. So we thought it was important to highlight for investors that, that value was accelerating and came in. And then you should adjust your marketing margin going forward for the fact that we will not see the value of that contract continue to pay out in future periods as again it all accelerated into the third quarter of this year. I will note that the value of that contract was pretty high on a per quarter basis in 2016 as basically it was a $4 floor gas delivery contract. And so during the periods of 2017, where gas is very low, the profit on that contract was pretty high. Going into next year, of course, as the strip return to the neighborhood of $3, the value of that contract would have been coming back in a little but still obviously was a good contract that we were pleased to accelerate the value of almost $150 million in cash this quarter at a time when we can use it to apply to our balance sheet."

We brought online and announced at our Analyst Day the first 5,000 pound per foot job. But that was on a shorter lateral. So we've got a really good test going on there right now, where we've got a 3,000 pound per foot job flowing right beside one of the 5,000 pound per foot jobs. We've kind of tried to manage them and keep them as equal as we can. But the 5,000 pound per foot job is flowing back at, I guess, a week later, 17 million cubic feet a day and 7,900 pounds, like the 3,000 pound job is 14.5 million and 7,500 pounds. So we've definitely seen a big gain from the -- going to 5,000 pounds per foot and we're excited about it. We've updated our cost. The cost is about -- if you extrapolated this to a 10,000-foot well, it's about $600,000 more to go to -- $1.2 million if you go to all the way from 3,000 to 5,000 pounds. So it's not a huge incremental investment considering the gain that we see already on the side-to-side test. The record well that we also highlighted was the 15 million pounds has got all its plugs drilled out and will be coming online Friday. So we're really excited about that. It will be the first 10,000-foot well with this bigger design on it. And then Doug highlighted in his notes, one that tested the limits of even tighter perf clusters with the big job that they're getting ready to do as well. We've got several exciting tests coming online. We're very encouraged by the incremental performance from the increased sand and perf cluster spacing. We've got several other tests with 4,000 pound jobs that kind of split the difference coming up. So very dynamic program in the Haynesville, but one we're very excited about. And it seems that every little bit extra we do with these wells is producing a very positive return to us."

Over the past year, we have continued to make significant progress in building a stronger Chesapeake for the future. During our Analyst Day held a few weeks back here in Oklahoma City, we highlighted the strength in our asset base, technology and expertise. 
To briefly summarize, the financial and operational improvements of the company over the past few years are foundational and differential. We've reduced our total leverage by $10.9 billion, reduced cash costs by roughly 50%, substantially improved capital efficiencies and productivity and materially improved midstream gathering costs, all to build a more competitive, profitable Chesapeake that we forecast in 2018 to achieve free cash flow neutrality and the ability to generate more than $3 billion in EBITDA. All this progress has been made despite depressed commodity prices. 
At our Analyst Day, we released significant technical detail regarding the potential of our oil and gas portfolio, notably the estimated net recoverable resources of 11.3 billion barrels of oil equivalent. We provided a road map that highlights the opportunity for profitable and efficient growth through our captured resources over time, along with projected financial results through the end of the decade under certain reasonable price assumptions. I'd like to update you today on a couple of operational results of interest since our Analyst Day. 
In the Haynesville, we are currently fracking a 10,000-foot lateral well with 50 million pounds of sand or roughly 5,000 pounds per lateral foot at ultra-tight cluster spacing. This completion will have the largest number of stages we have ever pumped in the Haynesville in a single well and the well should be placed to sales in the next few weeks. We are recognizing transformation value improvements in this asset, and we look forward to sharing more results of our progress in the Haynesville in the near future. 
In the Mid-Continent, we recently introduced a new concept area that we call the Wedge, in which Chesapeake has approximately 870,000 net acres under lease and where we are targeting several oil and gas-bearing stacked horizons. We have 2 recent step-out wells in the area that are currently producing 1,000 to 1,400 barrels of oil equivalent per day, 50% to 70% of which is oil from 1-mile appraisal wells. We believe the development potential in this area utilizing 2-mile laterals is tremendous. 
We're excited about the potential from these assets and with our other operating areas as we look ahead to 2017, with an inventory of over 17,000 wells still to be drilled across 6 major operating areas with 5,600 of those wells currently having a rate of return greater than 40%, we are confident that the Chesapeake operating machine is stronger today than at any other time in our history. 
Turning to the results from the 2016 third quarter. Our total production was 638,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, an increase of over 2% compared to a year ago, adjusted for asset sales. In our IR slides we shared this morning, we detailed the production impact of our year-to-date divestitures to demonstrate the strength and resiliency of our production base even after those adjustments. Our total volumes for our divestitures in the Mid-Continent area, the Barnett, and now pending transactions in the Devonian and Haynesville, were primarily gas. The full impact of approximately 8,200 barrels of daily oil production divested since the beginning of the year was recognized in the 2016 third quarter. 
We have already started to replace these oil volumes with new volumes from the Eagle Ford and the Mid-Continent. And our total net oil production for October is projected to be approximately 91,000 barrels of oil per day. With our productivity and capital efficiency improvements and subject to final capital allocation and commodity prices, we currently forecast that we will replace the divested oil volumes in 2017 and begin a strong oil growth trajectory.
In the slides, we also highlight our forecasted production growth over the coming quarters. We are currently projecting an exit-to-exit increase in total production from the fourth quarter of 2016 to the fourth quarter of 2017 of approximately 7%, adjusted for asset sales. More importantly, we are projecting an exit-to-exit increase in our oil production from the fourth quarter of 2016 to the fourth quarter of 2017 of 10%. 
Looking further forward to 2018. The growth continues even stronger. We previously estimated that our 2018 year-over-year total production growth rate would be in the 10% to 15% range. However, when looking at exit rates from 2017 to 2018, we see a strong trajectory throughout the year. We are currently projecting an increase in our total production from the fourth quarter of 2017 through the fourth quarter of 2018 of approximately 15%, primarily driven by an exit-to-exit increase in our oil production from the fourth quarter of '17 to the fourth quarter of '18 of over 20%. We believe our Eagle Ford and Mid-Continent assets will be driving this growth and the Powder River Basin will be beginning to accelerate as well. These numbers are a reflection of our capital efficiency, productivity and the power of our portfolio.
Turning to our costs. Operational efficiencies are driving lower production expense. We see this trend continuing both in the fourth quarter of 2016 and for the full year of 2017. And as a result, we've reduced our production expense guidance for both time periods. We also believe these efficiency-related cost reductions are sustainable beyond 2017. Our G&A expenses for the 2016 third quarter were up year-over-year due to lower recoveries of G&A expenses due to asset sales and a slight increase in stock-based compensation and compensation related to achieving certain annual performance goals tied to capital efficiency improvements, cash cost reductions and gathering process and transportation expenses. 
On the A&D front, we currently have gross proceeds from divestitures either closed or under signed PSA of approximately $1.3 billion in 2016 or about $1 billion net. We are on track to achieve our stated asset divestitures target of more than $2 billion in gross proceeds, all of which should be closed in the first quarter of 2017. We will continue to optimize our portfolio in 2017, accelerating value for our shareholders. 
In closing, I am pleased with the significant and foundational progress we have made in reducing our debt, eliminating complexity and lowering our costs. We will continue building on our record of performance in efficiency improvements and we will continue to drive for greater profitability and competitiveness. We remain committed to further improving our balance sheet and we are uniquely positioned to create value for our shareholders through our high-quality assets, our driven, talented employees and a liquidity runway built out for several years. We are excited about our opportunities and our progress. We have more to do and the momentum behind Chesapeake Energy will continue to build. 
I'll now pass the call to Nick, and then we'll follow up with questions on the call."
323857,404977092,1072071,"Chesapeake Energy Corporation, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2016",2016-11-03,"Earnings Calls","Expand Energy Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Doug, and good morning, everyone. Let me start out by saying that this has been an extremely busy quarter as we continue to recapitalize the balance sheet, improve operational efficiencies and flexibility and position the company for profitable",1337,"Thank you, Doug, and good morning, everyone. Let me start out by saying that this has been an extremely busy quarter as we continue to recapitalize the balance sheet, improve operational efficiencies and flexibility and position the company for profitable and efficient growth. We realized that there have been a tremendous amount of adjustments and moving parts to model recently with a lot of related explanations to cover, all of which highlight very positive trends in our underlying business. I will try to summarize the highlights here today. 
While there were several gives and takes this quarter related to LOE, G&A, gathering, processing and transportation and interest expense line items, the primary driver of lower EBITDA compared to what we had expected this quarter was found in our marketing segment, the impact of which was just under $30 million. This is primarily driven by the loss of margin due to the sale and acceleration of value of a long-term gas contract and some out-of-period charges related to assets we are selling in the Barnett and Devonian. 
We continue to focus on reducing our cash cost and balance sheet leverage. And we were able to make significant progress in these areas over the past several months. On the operating cost side, we have not only reduced our LOE expenses per unit of production, as Doug mentioned, but we have also achieved significant improvements in our midstream and downstream cost structure going forward. With the closing of the Barnett Shale transaction earlier this week, we are removing a significant amount of gathering, processing and transportation expenses. 
For the 2016 fourth quarter alone, we will be removing 2 months of GP&T costs, including the minimum volume commitment, settling approximately $235 million related to the asset. We also decreased our Mid-Continent gathering fees effective July 1 of this year and expect the same in our Powder River Basin area effective January 1, 2017. As a result, our total gathering, processing and transportation expenses -- we anticipate our total gathering, processing and transportation expenses to decrease by roughly 8% in 2017. These changes reduced our commitments and improved the economics of future drilling opportunities, leading to significantly improved operating flexibility as we continue to evaluate our capital allocation in pursuit of the projects that will maximize shareholder value. 
On the NGL side of our gathering, processing and treating costs, we have seen an increase this quarter due to higher-than-expected levels of ethane rejections. This was offset by an increase in realized prices we receive for NGLs as our mix shifted to heavier liquids following our Granite Wash sale earlier this year. Note in 2017, we are guiding to higher NGL gathering, processing and treating costs due to revised contracts in the Mid-Continent area, where increasing volumes will be gathered under contracts structured with processing fees, allowing us to receive a greater uplift in net NGL revenues. Therefore, we believe we will continue to see improved net NGL revenues that will offset the increase in processing costs. 
Our primary financial focus has been the reduction of both our near-term and total debt and improvements to our near-term liquidity. Over the past 12 months, we have been able to reduce our debt, maturing or puttable in 2017 through 2019 by $3 billion. In total, we have removed approximately $2.1 billion in principal amount of debt over the past 12 months, making good progress on our longer-term goal of $6 billion to $7 billion in total debt. 
As far as extending our maturities, we entered into a $1.5 billion secured 5-year term loan facility during the third quarter and used the net proceeds in a tender offer for maturities primarily in the near to mid-term of our debt maturity stack. Further, in October, we issued $1.25 billion principal amount of unsecured 5.5% convertible senior notes due 2026, which essentially prefunded our remaining 2017 and 2018 maturing and puttable debt. And we have already purchased approximately $100 million of 2017 and 2018 maturities at a discount to make-whole since closing on the convert. 
As a result of these steps, we sit with $3.7 billion of liquidity, including approximately $650 million of cash today after having closed on the Barnett Shale transaction earlier this week. I would note that we have formulaically reduced our availability under our revolver by a little over $200 million as a result of asset sales. As previously noted, our current reserves calculation is well in advance of the levels which support the full $4 billion. We are currently scheduled to redetermine our borrowing base next summer but do have the option to request the redetermination sooner. At the moment, we obviously have ample liquidity and do not anticipate our pending asset sales having any further impact on this calculation. 
Through all of these cost structure improvements, asset sales and balance sheet transactions, we've greatly improved our cash flow profile and have cleared the debt maturity runway, allowing us to focus on our operations instead of our obligations. Additionally, to further improve our capital structure, we exchanged an aggregate of approximately 110 million shares of common stock for approximately $1.2 billion of liquidation value of preferred stock at a discount of approximately 40%. 
On the A&D front, we have announced that a PSA has been signed for our Devonian assets and we intend to buy back the VPP related to that asset when consummated. We believe that cash to the company will be a nominal net positive as a result of these transactions. When these transactions are completed, we will have only one remaining VPP, that one being in Northern Oklahoma. We have also noted that we are looking to sell approximately 126,000 net acres of our Haynesville position in 2 separate sales packages. Bids are in for the first package, which has net production of approximately 30 million cubic feet of gas per day. We are pleased with the indications, which we expect to be at a substantial multiple over the EBITDA we projected on the PDP of this asset in 2017 of approximately $15 million. We expect to proceed to execution on the sale with an anticipated close in the first quarter of 2017. 
The data room for the second package has just been opened. This package has net production of approximately 45 million cubic feet of gas per day and was expected to contribute about $25 million in EBITDA from those PDP volumes in 2017. Based on the current interest and the need by buyers to digest the recent and upcoming strong well results we continue to see with new wells in the area, we look forward to updating the market on the results of the second package in early 2017. As noted during our Analyst Day presentation, our 2017 projected production guidance reiterated today has been adjusted for both the expected Devonian and Haynesville divestitures. So we kept our 2017 projected production guidance the same as previously stated back in August despite the removal of expected net volumes of about 35 Bcf from these anticipated transactions. 
With the continued volatility of both gas and oil prices, we are pleased that our hedge position for both the remainder of 2016 and 2017 is already fairly robust, particularly on the natural gas side. We will continue to monitor market conditions and may increase our positions in both gas and oil at the appropriate times. Our current hedge position is detailed in the slides we posted to our website this morning. 
In closing, we are making meaningful strides in our debt reduction efforts and look to continue our progress in this area. We expect more success in the A&D market and expect to be able to discuss these transactions soon. As Doug noted, our production remains strong. When you look to start -- when you start to look through 2017 to 2018, our production rate only gets stronger, given our highly efficient capital program in 2017. 
That concludes my comments. I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions."

You were trailing off a little bit there, so I think I got the gist of the question. If I don't answer it fully, just come back with more. But we did sell a long-term gas supply contract during the quarter. We had announced that previously. That had with it a mark-to-market gain on future periods of $280 million that had been in the asset section of our balance sheet. You can think of that fairly consistent with the way you would account for a hedge, where the future value of that contract was marked each quarter and was in a gain position, so it was an asset. So that came off, that was not included. The removal of that gain was not included in our adjusted earnings. What we did include was the $146 million of actual cash proceeds we received from accelerating the value of that contract to the quarter, again all received in cash. And we wanted to really highlight that. And so right in the paragraph, where we discuss the things that we adjusted out, we've highlighted that we included that in. The reason we chose to include it in is that the realized portion of that contract has been in now for several periods in a row. And if you didn't include the acceleration of value anywhere, you would likely have a miss of not seeing that contract trend continue. So we thought it was important to highlight for investors that, that value was accelerating and came in. And then you should adjust your marketing margin going forward for the fact that we will not see the value of that contract continue to pay out in future periods as again it all accelerated into the third quarter of this year. I will note that the value of that contract was pretty high on a per quarter basis in 2016 as basically it was a $4 floor gas delivery contract. And so during the periods of 2017, where gas is very low, the profit on that contract was pretty high. Going into next year, of course, as the strip returned to the neighborhood of $3, the value of that contract would have been coming back in a little but still obviously was a good contract that we were pleased to accelerate the value of almost $150 million in cash this quarter at a time when we can use it to apply to our balance sheet."

We've kind of tried to manage them and keep them as equal as we can. But the 5,000 pound per foot job is flowing back at, I guess, a week later, 17 million cubic feet a day and 7,900 pounds, like the 3,000 pound job is 14.5 million and 7,500 pounds. So we've definitely seen a big gain from the -- going to 5,000 pounds per foot and we're excited about it. We've updated our cost. The cost is about -- if you extrapolated this to a 10,000-foot well, it's about $600,000 more to go to -- well $1.2 million if you go to all the way from 3,000 to 5,000 pounds. So it's not a huge incremental investment considering the gain that we see already on the side-to-side test. The record well that we also highlighted with the 50 million pounds has got all its plugs drilled out and will be coming online Friday. So we're really excited about that. It will be the first 10,000-foot well with this bigger design on it. And then Doug highlighted in his notes, one that tested the limits of even tighter perf clusters with the big job that they're getting ready to do as well. We've got several exciting tests coming online. We're very encouraged by the incremental performance from the increased sand and perf cluster spacing. We've got several other tests with 4,000 pound jobs that kind of split the difference coming up. So very dynamic program in the Haynesville, but one we're very excited about.

Over the past year, we have continued to make significant progress in building a stronger Chesapeake for the future. During our Analyst Day held a few weeks back here in Oklahoma City, we highlighted the strength in our asset base, technology and expertise. 
To briefly summarize, the financial and operational improvements of the company over the past few years are foundational and differential. We've reduced our total leverage by $10.9 billion, reduced cash costs by roughly 50%, substantially improved capital efficiencies and productivity and materially improved midstream gathering costs, all to build a more competitive, profitable Chesapeake that we forecast in 2018 to achieve free cash flow neutrality and the ability to generate more than $3 billion in EBITDA. All this progress has been made despite depressed commodity prices. 
At our Analyst Day, we released significant technical detail regarding the potential of our oil and gas portfolio, notably the estimated net recoverable resources of 11.3 billion barrels of oil equivalent. We provided a road map that highlights the opportunity for profitable and efficient growth through our captured resources over time, along with projected financial results through the end of the decade under certain reasonable price assumptions. I'd like to update you today on a couple of operational results of interest since our Analyst Day. 
In the Haynesville, we are currently fracking a 10,000-foot lateral well with 50 million pounds of sand or roughly 5,000 pounds per lateral foot at ultra-tight cluster spacing. This completion will have the largest number of stages we have ever pumped in the Haynesville in a single well and the well should be placed to sales in the next few weeks. We are recognizing transformation value improvements in this asset, and we look forward to sharing more results of our progress in the Haynesville in the near future. 
In the Mid-Continent, we recently introduced a new concept area that we call the Wedge, in which Chesapeake has approximately 870,000 net acres under lease and where we are targeting several oil and gas-bearing stacked horizons. We have 2 recent step-out wells in the area that are currently producing 1,000 to 1,400 barrels of oil equivalent per day, 50% to 70% of which is oil from 1-mile appraisal wells. We believe the development potential in this area utilizing 2-mile laterals is tremendous. 
We're excited about the potential from these assets and with our other operating areas as we look ahead to 2017, with an inventory of over 17,000 wells still to be drilled across 6 major operating areas with 5,600 of those wells currently having a rate of return greater than 40%, we are confident that the Chesapeake operating machine is stronger today than at any other time in our history. 
Turning to the results from the 2016 third quarter. Our total production was 638,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, an increase of over 2% compared to a year ago, adjusted for asset sales. In our IR slides we shared this morning, we detailed the production impact of our year-to-date divestitures to demonstrate the strength and resiliency of our production base even after those adjustments. Our total volumes for our divestitures in the Mid-Continent area, the Barnett, and now pending transactions in the Devonian and Haynesville, were primarily gas. The full impact of approximately 8,200 barrels of daily oil production divested since the beginning of the year was recognized in the 2016 third quarter. 
We have already started to replace these oil volumes with new volumes from the Eagle Ford and the Mid-Continent. And our total net oil production for October is projected to be approximately 91,000 barrels of oil per day. With our productivity and capital efficiency improvements and subject to final capital allocation and commodity prices, we currently forecast that we will replace the divested oil volumes in 2017 and begin a strong oil growth trajectory.
In the slides, we also highlight our forecasted production growth over the coming quarters. We are currently projecting an exit-to-exit increase in total production from the fourth quarter of 2016 to the fourth quarter of 2017 of approximately 7%, adjusted for asset sales. More importantly, we are projecting an exit-to-exit increase in our oil production from the fourth quarter of 2016 to the fourth quarter of 2017 of 10%. 
Looking further forward to 2018. The growth continues even stronger. We previously estimated that our 2018 year-over-year total production growth rate would be in the 10% to 15% range. However, when looking at exit rates from 2017 to 2018, we see a strong trajectory throughout the year. We are currently projecting an increase in our total production from the fourth quarter of 2017 through the fourth quarter of 2018 of approximately 15%, primarily driven by an exit-to-exit increase in our oil production from the fourth quarter of '17 to the fourth quarter of '18 of over 20%. We believe our Eagle Ford and Mid-Continent assets will be driving this growth and the Powder River Basin will be beginning to accelerate as well. These numbers are a reflection of our capital efficiency, productivity and the power of our portfolio.
Turning to our costs. Operational efficiencies are driving lower production expense. We see this trend continuing both in the fourth quarter of 2016 and for the full year of 2017. And as a result, we've reduced our production expense guidance for both time periods. We also believe these efficiency-related cost reductions are sustainable beyond 2017. Our G&A expenses for the 2016 third quarter were up year-over-year due to lower recoveries of G&A expenses due to asset sales and a slight increase in stock-based compensation and compensation related to achieving certain annual performance goals tied to capital efficiency improvements, cash cost reductions and gathering process and transportation expenses. 
On the A&D front, we currently have gross proceeds from divestitures either closed or under signed PSA of approximately $1.3 billion in 2016 or about $1 billion net. We are on track to achieve our stated asset divestitures target of more than $2 billion in gross proceeds, all of which should be closed in the first quarter of 2017. We will continue to optimize our portfolio in 2017, accelerating value for our shareholders. 
In closing, I am pleased with the significant and foundational progress we have made in reducing our debt, eliminating complexity and lowering our costs. We will continue building on our record of performance in efficiency improvements and we will continue to drive for greater profitability and competitiveness. We remain committed to further improving our balance sheet and we are uniquely positioned to create value for our shareholders through our high-quality assets, our driven, talented employees and a liquidity runway built out for several years. We are excited about our opportunities and our progress. We have more to do and the momentum behind Chesapeake Energy will continue to build. 
I'll now pass the call to Nick, and then we'll follow up with questions on the call."
323857,404977092,1075046,"Chesapeake Energy Corporation, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2016",2016-11-03,"Earnings Calls","Expand Energy Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Doug, and good morning, everyone. Let me start out by saying that this has been an extremely busy quarter as we continue to recapitalize the balance sheet, improve operational efficiencies and flexibility and position the company for profitable",1337,"Thank you, Doug, and good morning, everyone. Let me start out by saying that this has been an extremely busy quarter as we continue to recapitalize the balance sheet, improve operational efficiencies and flexibility and position the company for profitable and efficient growth. We realized that there have been a tremendous amount of adjustments and moving parts to model recently with a lot of related explanations to cover, all of which highlight very positive trends in our underlying business. I will try to summarize the highlights here today. 
While there were several gives and takes this quarter related to LOE, G&A, gathering, processing and transportation and interest expense line items, the primary driver of lower EBITDA compared to what we had expected this quarter was found in our marketing segment, the impact of which was just under $30 million. This is primarily driven by the loss of margin due to the sale and acceleration of value of a long-term gas contract and some out-of-period charges related to assets we are selling in the Barnett and Devonian. 
We continue to focus on reducing our cash cost and balance sheet leverage. And we were able to make significant progress in these areas over the past several months. On the operating cost side, we have not only reduced our LOE expenses per unit of production, as Doug mentioned, but we have also achieved significant improvements in our midstream and downstream cost structure going forward. With the closing of the Barnett Shale transaction earlier this week, we are removing a significant amount of gathering, processing and transportation expenses. 
For the 2016 fourth quarter alone, we will be removing 2 months of GP&T costs, including the minimum volume commitment, settling approximately $235 million related to the asset. We also decreased our Mid-Continent gathering fees effective July 1 of this year and expect the same in our Powder River Basin area effective January 1, 2017. As a result, our total gathering, processing and transportation expenses -- we anticipate our total gathering, processing and transportation expenses to decrease by roughly 8% in 2017. These changes reduced our commitments and improved the economics of future drilling opportunities, leading to significantly improved operating flexibility as we continue to evaluate our capital allocation in pursuit of the projects that will maximize shareholder value. 
On the NGL side of our gathering, processing and treating costs, we have seen an increase this quarter due to higher-than-expected levels of ethane rejections. This was offset by an increase in realized prices we receive for NGLs as our mix shifted to heavier liquids following our Granite Wash sale earlier this year. Note in 2017, we are guiding to higher NGL gathering, processing and treating costs due to revised contracts in the Mid-Continent area, where increasing volumes will be gathered under contracts structured with processing fees, allowing us to receive a greater uplift in net NGL revenues. Therefore, we believe we will continue to see improved net NGL revenues that will offset the increase in processing costs. 
Our primary financial focus has been the reduction of both our near-term and total debt and improvements to our near-term liquidity. Over the past 12 months, we have been able to reduce our debt, maturing or puttable in 2017 through 2019 by $3 billion. In total, we have removed approximately $2.1 billion in principal amount of debt over the past 12 months, making good progress on our longer-term goal of $6 billion to $7 billion in total debt. 
As far as extending our maturities, we entered into a $1.5 billion secured 5-year term loan facility during the third quarter and used the net proceeds in a tender offer for maturities primarily in the near to mid-term of our debt maturity stack. Further, in October, we issued $1.25 billion principal amount of unsecured 5.5% convertible senior notes due 2026, which essentially prefunded our remaining 2017 and 2018 maturing and puttable debt. And we have already purchased approximately $100 million of 2017 and 2018 maturities at a discount to make-whole since closing on the convert. 
As a result of these steps, we sit with $3.7 billion of liquidity, including approximately $650 million of cash today after having closed on the Barnett Shale transaction earlier this week. I would note that we have formulaically reduced our availability under our revolver by a little over $200 million as a result of asset sales. As previously noted, our current reserves calculation is well in advance of the levels which support the full $4 billion. We are currently scheduled to redetermine our borrowing base next summer but do have the option to request the redetermination sooner. At the moment, we obviously have ample liquidity and do not anticipate our pending asset sales having any further impact on this calculation. 
Through all of these cost structure improvements, asset sales and balance sheet transactions, we've greatly improved our cash flow profile and have cleared the debt maturity runway, allowing us to focus on our operations instead of our obligations. Additionally, to further improve our capital structure, we exchanged an aggregate of approximately 110 million shares of common stock for approximately $1.2 billion of liquidation value of preferred stock at a discount of approximately 40%. 
On the A&D front, we have announced that a PSA has been signed for our Devonian assets and we intend to buy back the VPP related to that asset when consummated. We believe that cash to the company will be a nominal net positive as a result of these transactions. When these transactions are completed, we will have only one remaining VPP, that one being in Northern Oklahoma. We have also noted that we are looking to sell approximately 126,000 net acres of our Haynesville position in 2 separate sales packages. Bids are in for the first package, which has net production of approximately 30 million cubic feet of gas per day. We are pleased with the indications, which we expect to be at a substantial multiple over the EBITDA we projected on the PDP of this asset in 2017 of approximately $15 million. We expect to proceed to execution on the sale with an anticipated close in the first quarter of 2017. 
The data room for the second package has just been opened. This package has net production of approximately 45 million cubic feet of gas per day and was expected to contribute about $25 million in EBITDA from those PDP volumes in 2017. Based on the current interest and the need by buyers to digest the recent and upcoming strong well results we continue to see with new wells in the area, we look forward to updating the market on the results of the second package in early 2017. As noted during our Analyst Day presentation, our 2017 projected production guidance reiterated today has been adjusted for both the expected Devonian and Haynesville divestitures. So we kept our 2017 projected production guidance the same as previously stated back in August despite the removal of expected net volumes of about 35 Bcf from these anticipated transactions. 
With the continued volatility of both gas and oil prices, we are pleased that our hedge position for both the remainder of 2016 and 2017 is already fairly robust, particularly on the natural gas side. We will continue to monitor market conditions and may increase our positions in both gas and oil at the appropriate times. Our current hedge position is detailed in the slides we posted to our website this morning. 
In closing, we are making meaningful strides in our debt reduction efforts and look to continue our progress in this area. We expect more success in the A&D market and expect to be able to discuss these transactions soon. As Doug noted, our production remains strong. When you look to start -- when you start to look through 2017 to 2018, our production rate only gets stronger, given our highly efficient capital program in 2017.

You were trailing off a little bit there, so I think I got the gist of the question. If I don't answer it fully, just come back with more. But we did sell a long-term gas supply contract during the quarter. We had announced that previously. That had with it a mark-to-market gain on future periods of $280 million that had been in the asset section of our balance sheet. You can think of that fairly consistent with the way you would account for a hedge, where the future value of that contract was marked each quarter and was in a gain position, so it was an asset. So that came off, that was not included. The removal of that gain was not included in our adjusted earnings. What we did include was the $146 million of actual cash proceeds we received from accelerating the value of that contract to the quarter, again all received in cash. And we wanted to really highlight that. And so right in the paragraph, where we discuss the things that we adjusted out, we've highlighted that we included that in. The reason we chose to include it in is that the realized portion of that contract has been in now for several periods in a row. And if you didn't include the acceleration of value anywhere, you would likely have a miss of not seeing that contract trend continue. So we thought it was important to highlight for investors that, that value was accelerating and came in. And then you should adjust your marketing margin going forward for the fact that we will not see the value of that contract continue to pay out in future periods as again it all accelerated into the third quarter of this year. I will note that the value of that contract was pretty high on a per quarter basis in 2016 as basically it was a $4 floor gas delivery contract. And so during the periods of 2017, where gas is very low, the profit on that contract was pretty high. Going into next year, of course, as the strip returned to the neighborhood of $3, the value of that contract would have been coming back in a little but still obviously was a good contract that we were pleased to accelerate the value of almost $150 million in cash this quarter at a time when we can use it to apply to our balance sheet."

We brought online and announced at our Analyst Day the first 5,000 pound per foot job. But that was on a shorter lateral. So we've got a really good test going on there right now, where we've got a 3,000 pound per foot job flowing right beside 1 of the 5,000 pound per foot jobs. We've kind of tried to manage them and keep them as equal as we can. But the 5,000 pound per foot job is flowing back at, I guess, a week later, 17 million cubic feet a day and 7,900 pounds, like the 3,000 pound job is 14.5 million and 7,500 pounds. So we've definitely seen a big gain from the -- going to 5,000 pounds per foot and we're excited about it. We've updated our cost. The cost is about -- if you extrapolated this to a 10,000-foot well, it's about $600,000 more to go to -- well $1.2 million if you go to all the way from 3,000 to 5,000 pounds. So it's not a huge incremental investment considering the gain that we see already on the side-to-side test. The record well that we also highlighted with the 50 million pounds has got all its plugs drilled out and will be coming online Friday. So we're really excited about that. It will be the first 10,000-foot well with this bigger design on it. And then Doug highlighted in his notes, one that tested the limits of even tighter perf clusters with the big job that they're getting ready to do as well. We've got several exciting tests coming online. We're very encouraged by the incremental performance from the increased sand and perf cluster spacing. We've got several other tests with 4,000 pound jobs that kind of split the difference coming up. So very dynamic program in the Haynesville, but one we're very excited about.
