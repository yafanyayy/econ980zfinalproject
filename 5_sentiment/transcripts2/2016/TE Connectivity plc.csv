We've begun fiscal 2016 with a quarter of solid execution, delivering $0.84 in adjusted EPS, $0.08 above the high end of guidance with sales slightly above our midpoint. This w",1142,"Thanks for joining us today, and here are the key takeaways from today's call. We've begun fiscal 2016 with a quarter of solid execution, delivering $0.84 in adjusted EPS, $0.08 above the high end of guidance with sales slightly above our midpoint. This was driven by strong performance in our Transportation segment and SubCom business in combination with tight cost management in light of the macroenvironment. Excluding the impact of currency exchange rates, we want adjusted EPS was flat year-over-year and adjusted operating margins of 15.7% were ahead of expectations. For the full year 2016, we are reiterating our adjusted EPS guidance of $4. This is 11% year-over-year growth and 15% growth in constant currency. Relative to our view last quarter, the Transportation segment is a little stronger. Global auto production expectation is improving. In industrial, our direct business with OEMs developed as expected and appears to be stabilizing, but sales through our distribution channel were weaker than expected, and the recovery is taking longer than anticipated. The oil and gas market remains very weak, with derivative effects impacting some other industrial markets. The midpoint of our annual guidance assumes 2% global auto production growth in our fiscal year. We're also assuming sequential improvements in industrial sales and orders in the second quarter and into the second half. 
For the full year in communications, we assume double-digit growth in SubCom, second half growth in Appliances and continued declines in Data and Devices. By region, we assume that the overall U.S. and European economies continue to grow slowly and China returns to growth in our markets in the second half. We continue to take a balanced approach with our capital strategy and over time expect to return approximately 2/3 of our free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and buybacks, with 1/3 of free cash being used for acquisitions and we'll talk more about this later in the call. 
We're very pleased with the performance of the businesses we acquired last year, and we'll continue to look for acquisition opportunities that broaden our ability to address harsh environment applications and provide integrated solutions to our customers. We believe that integration is another emerging secular trend for our business, and we are well positioned to capitalize with our broad portfolio of products. 
In Sensors, our unmatched presence across virtually every industry, coupled with the broad technology and product portfolio we acquired, is enabling us to expand our design win pipeline across market verticals and provide integrated solutions in certain applications. In Medical, we have increased our presence in the high-growth, minimally invasive market and are well positioned to provide integrated solutions to our customers that incorporate our connectors, sensors, fine wire technology and material science know-how. 
While we can't control the macroenvironment and inevitable economic cycles, we have positioned TE around harsh environment applications and continued to benefit directly from the secular trends of electronic content growth. We believe TE is uniquely positioned to provide highly engineered solutions that integrate connectors, sensors and other technologies to improve reliability, lower cost and increase performance, making the company an increasingly valued partner to our customers. And we have secured several key integrated solutions design wins, particularly with major auto OEMs over the last several months throughout this point. 
Now please turn to Slide 3 for a summary of Q1 results. While we continue to have the backdrop of a challenging macroenvironment, we generated adjusted EPS above the high end of the guidance with sales slightly above the midpoint of guidance. Sales of $2.8 billion were down 7% year-over-year but down only 1% in constant currency. Adjusted EPS was down 6% year-over-year and flat in constant currency. Performance of our guidance in the quarter was driven in the strength of our Transportation segment and higher sales in SubCom as a key program moved to the completion earlier than expected. This, coupled with tight cost control, more than offset industrial being a little weaker than expected in the quarter. 
We generated adjusted operating margins of 15.7% in Q1, which were ahead of expectations, and our adjusted EBITDA margins were 21%. During the quarter, we returned $1.4 billion to shareholders, including $1.3 billion in share buybacks. The Board of Directors also approved a recommendation to raise our dividend by 12% to an annual rate of $1.48 per share. We expect this to be approved by shareholders in March and be effective in June. We also paid $127 million in dividend in the quarter. In addition, we returned approximately $1.3 billion of cash to shareholders through the share buyback. 
While down year-over-year due primarily to weakness in China, our Transportation segment sales were above expectations with better-than-expected demand in China. Though China was weak, but it was not as weak as we thought. In the industrial segment, our direct business with OEMs performed about as expected, but we did see lower sales through the distribution channel. Overall, we continued to perform well in harsh environment applications. Last year's acquisition in Sensors and Medical gaining momentum. And during the quarter, we announced the sale of our Circuit Protection business, which is on track to close later this quarter. 
Before we get into the segment update, I'd like to provide a brief insight into the order pattern, which will help provide a baseline for our results and expectations. Now please turn to Slide 4. 
Organic orders were down 3% from the prior year but were better than our expectations 90 days ago. Orders were up 3% sequentially excluding SubCom, and our book-to-bill was 1.04. Orders were up 11% sequentially on an organic basis and better than expected. These data points re positive indicators for our expectations of second half sales growth. One area that doesn't remain weak is the distribution channel where expectations of sales and orders recovery has pushed out slightly versus our prior year. Distribution accounts for about 15% of our total sales. Transportation orders improved 7% sequentially, reflecting incremental growth in global auto production expectations. During the quarter, we saw our industrial orders stabilizing growth slightly sequentially, with direct orders improving in line with expectations and weakness in the channel that I previously mentioned. Communications orders x SubCom declined 9% sequentially, driven by previously announced product exits and weakness in the distribution channel. 
To provide a little additional color on China, while both orders and sales were down year-over-year in aggregate in Q1, we are seeing improvement in auto production and saw a year-over-year organic growth in orders of Transportation. We continue to see China weakness in the industrial and communications segment but are expecting growth in the second half as inventories become more imbalanced. Excluding SubCom, our book-to-bill ratio was 1.04 in Q1 with all segments book-to-bill exceeding 1.0. 
With that backdrop, I'll now turn it over to Terrence to cover each of our segments in more detail."
8106523,321566662,919464,"TE Connectivity Ltd., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Jan 20, 2016",2016-01-20,"Earnings Calls","TE Connectivity plc","Executives","Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. If you could please turn to Slide 5 and we'll start with Transportation Solutions. Sales grew 1% organically in the quarter, above our guidance expectations due to China sales being stronger than we anticipated.",1061,"Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. If you could please turn to Slide 5 and we'll start with Transportation Solutions. 
Sales grew 1% organically in the quarter, above our guidance expectations due to China sales being stronger than we anticipated. Overall, segment organic growth of 1% was driven by Automotive and Sensors. Our auto sales organic growth of 1% in the quarter was driven by Europe growing 6% and North America growth of 3% offsetting the expected reductions in China that Tom talked about. With the orders that we experienced, along with production schedules, we expect China to return to growth in the second quarter, reflecting the positive demand impacts from the government tax incentives that are driving increased production levels. 
For fiscal 2016, we now expect global auto production to be up 2% to just under 88 million vehicles, with China production up 6% compared to 2015. This compares favorably to our view last quarter when we expected global auto production with China production growth of only 2%. We continue to be confident that our auto business can grow well ahead of production as its included in our annual guidance, and this is driven by electronic content growth and a rich pipeline of platform ramps from design wins generated over the past several years. 
As expected, our Commercial Transportation business was down year-over-year, driven by a weak global construction in agriculture market and weakness in the North America heavy truck area. While our sales declined versus last year, our organic orders were up 10% sequentially as we're seeing signs of this business stabilizing, and we expect to be up to flat low single digits on an organic basis for the year. 
Turning to Sensors. Our business continue to show strong momentum in the quarter in both sales and design wins. Along with our acquisition rationale, we are using the existing TE go-to-market teams to take new products and system-level solutions to our customers. These results in new sensor program awards across multiple market verticals. TE is uniquely positioned with the world's broadest portfolio of connector and sensors solutions, and we have recently been awarded design wins in the automotive space and integrate multiple components to provide a complete solution to our customers. In this segment, adjusted operating income was $280 million in the first quarter. This was down year-over-year due to currency, a change in product mix and our continuous investment for growth in Automotive and Sensors businesses. Adjusted operating margins came in higher than we expected, and we anticipate the second half margin to be at 20% or above. 
Please if you could turn to Page 6 to discuss our Industrial Solutions segment. Aligned with our expectation, revenue in the segment declined 6% organically year-over-year in the first quarter. As Tom mentioned, we are being impacted by weakness in the distribution channel, which is almost 30% of the segment sales organically. Distribution sales were down 6% organically in the quarter as we see broad-based supply chain corrections occurring that we highlighted last quarter. Our direct sales to OEMs are improving in line with our expectations, and we saw our OEM orders improve sequentially by nearly 3% while orders through the channel partners remained flat sequentially. We currently expect that our distribution partners will continue to work through the second quarter to get in line with OEM demand. In addition to the distribution channel, we continue to be impacted by the oil and gas market. You can see on the slide, we broke this out separately this quarter, and it shows the 44% organic reduction in sales year-over-year in this market and the impact that's having on the segment. With the weakness in the oil and gas market, our business is now running at approximately $30 million per quarter, down from approximately $60 million per quarter a year ago. We have seen order rates stabilize around the $30 million level, and we expect a more favorable year-over-year compare in the second half. I also want to highlight that the low oil and gas prices are also having some derivative effect in other areas of the industrial segment, impacting sales in our Industrial Equipment business and areas like factory equipment and rail and also in helicopter demand, which affects our Aerospace business. These derivative effects are all reflected in our guidance in our results. 
In the commercial Aerospace and Defense business, our momentum remain strong, with the slight year-over-year decline driven by the defense business due to program timing. We remain very well positioned with our program wins in the Aerospace and expect to benefit from growth in the Commercial Aerospace and as the defense market continues to improve. 
Our Energy business grew 4% organically, with strengths in Europe and the Americas more than offsetting softness in China. From an adjusted operating income perspective, it was $78 million in the first quarter, down year-over-year as expected due to the impact of currency, declines in our higher-margin oil and gas business and 6% organic decline in the channel. If you exclude the oil and gas business and FX impacts, our operating margins remained constant year-over-year, reflecting the benefit of our TOA program as well as cost management. 
If you could turn to Slide 7, please, so I can talk about Communications Solutions. In the first quarter, the segment revenue of $617 million was down 6% and 3% organically as expected. Our SubCom business saw strong year-over-year growth as we successfully completed the America, Europe connect program earlier than our original plan. We now expect SubCom to grow low double digits for the full year, which is slightly better than our expectations 90 days ago. 
Our Data and Devices and Appliances businesses were impacted by the slowing in China as well as the supply chain adjustments by our distribution partner that I talked about in industrial. We expect this to be largely behind us as we head into the second half to the year. And just to remind you, Data and Devices growth is also impacted by the product exits that we initiated late in 2015 as part of our repositioning effort. From a margin perspective, adjusted operating margins expanded 380 basis points year-over-year, which was above expectations, driven by the early completion of the program in SubCom that we highlighted. 
Now let me turn it over to Bob, who'll cover the financials."

Please turn to Slide 8 where I'll provide more details on earnings. 
Adjusted operating income was $444 million, down 5% in constant currency due to investments in Transportation, impacts of oil and gas weakness and the distribution inventory corrections impacting our industrial segment that Terrence covered. Including $30 million of foreign currency headwinds, operating income was down 11% in the prior year. GAAP operating income was $298 [ph] million and included $6 million of acquisition-related charges as well as $40 million of restructuring other charges related to Data and Devices product exits, elimination of corporate stranded cost from the BNS divestiture and general cost reductions. Our adjusted EPS was $0.84 for the quarter, down $0.05 from the prior year with reduced volume from higher-margin products and negative impacts from foreign currency exchange rates offsetting incremental benefits from the share buyback. Excluding the $0.05 impact from foreign currency, adjusted EPS was flat to the prior year. GAAP EPS was $0.83 for the quarter and included acquisition-related charges of $0.01, restructuring and other charges of $0.07 and $0.07 from tax-related income. I now expect approximately $85 million of restructuring charges for the full year 2016, a $10 million increase from our prior guidance 90 days ago. 
Now please turn to Slide 9. While we remain in a challenging environment, the progress we've made with TEOA and productivity initiatives enabled the business to demonstrate resiliency as reflected in our margins. Our adjusted gross margin in the quarter was 33.4%. While this was down from last year due to lower sales in higher-margin products, it's up 90 basis points sequentially from Q4. As Terrence discussed in the industrial section, we're seeing softness in some higher-margin businesses like oil and gas and lower sales in the distribution channel. 
Adjusted operating margins declined 70 basis points, driven by lower volume in product mix but benefiting from the early completion of the SubCom program in the quarter. Total operating expenses were $502 million in the quarter, down 8% from the prior year. We continue to technically manage discretionary spending but are also continuing to invest in our harsh businesses. In the quarter, cash from continuing operations was $367 million, and our free cash flow was $237 million, up from prior year levels due to lower capital -- working capital and reduced revenue and timing of SubCom payments. 
We continue to have a balanced capital allocation strategy. In Q1, we returned at $1.4 billion to shareholders, including $1.3 billion in buybacks. In the quarter, we bought back nearly 21 million shares, executing against our commitment to returning the proceeds in broadband networks divestiture. We're also introducing a chart on EBITDA margins, which better shows the profitability performance of our businesses, including acquisitions. EBITDA margins in Q1 were 21% and shows our margin resiliency despite lower sales levels. We continue to be pleased with the operating performance of our business, especially in light of the challenging macro backdrop. 
Also, you may have seen in the 8-K filed yesterday, Tyco International on behalf of TE Connectivity, has entered into an agreement with the Internal Revenue Service to resolve all disputes related to the previously disclosed intercompany debt issues. The resolution would result in a total cash payment to the IRS from TE Connectivity of between $147 million and $163 million, which includes all interest and penalties. We're pleased with the proposed settlement and look forward to having this behind us in the near future. Of course, we've also added a balance sheet and cash flow summary in the Appendix for additional details. 
Now I'll turn it back to Tom."

Please turn to Slide 10, and I will cover Q2 guidance at a high level with additional details provided in the slide deck. We expect Q2 revenue your $2.88 billion to $3.08 million, down 3% or 1% organically; and adjusted EPS of $0.84 to $0.92,",614,"Thanks, Bob. Please turn to Slide 10, and I will cover Q2 guidance at a high level with additional details provided in the slide deck. We expect Q2 revenue your $2.88 billion to $3.08 million, down 3% or 1% organically; and adjusted EPS of $0.84 to $0.92, down approximately 3% year-over-year at the midpoint or flat in constant currency. Versus our view last quarter, we expect Transportation to be a bit stronger, industrial will be a bit weaker and communications to be impacted by the early completion of the SubCom program we discussed earlier. Most of that was in Q2 when we guided last time. For the full year, we expect revenue of $12.3 billion at the midpoint, up 1% versus the prior year and reflecting 4% organic growth at midpoint. We are reducing top line by about $100 million, reflecting the sale of our Circuit Protection business that we expect to complete this quarter. Our adjusted EPS guidance remained at $4 and represents year-over-year growth of 11% at midpoint. On a constant currency basis, revenue is expected to grow over 3%, and adjusted EPS is expected to grow by 15% year-over-year. Versus our prior view, Transportation is expected to have higher growth, industrial is a little weaker and communications is weaker, factoring the impact of the sale of the Circuit Protection business. I think you've heard the Constantine or Transportation a little better; industrial, a little weaker; but overall, no big change from the prior guidance. Our full year outlook is based on the following market and regional assumptions: in Transportation, we expect mid-single-digit actual and high single-digit organic growth. We're assuming that global auto production is up 2% year-over-year, which is an improvement from our prior view of flat production. We're anticipating China auto production to grow 6% year-over-year. We expect the year -- another strong -- another year of strong growth in our Sensors business. In industrial, we are assuming flat actual and low single-digit organic growth. We have seen orders stabilize in some industrial end markets and assume inventories come into balance by the end of Q2, ending the negative supply chain effect on our business. We continue to assume a weak oil and gas market, and we'll continue to see the signs of the negative impact in other adjacent markets in the industrial space. This is also factored into our guidance. 
In communications, we assume high single-digit actual and low single-digit organic declines, with growth in SubCom and Appliances being more than offset by product exits and the sale of the Circuit Protection business in Data and Devices. By region, we assume Europe and the U.S. to continue to improve, with China markets rebounding in the second half. Outside of auto, China markets are as expected 90 days ago. 
Our guidance does assume a 53rd week and currency exchange rates. As the year progresses, we have much less of a headwind from FX translation and an increased earnings tailwind from our share repurchase program. We remain positive on our outlook and have several levers to drive growth in a very challenging macroenvironment. As a result of the transformation of our portfolio and increased focus on harsh applications, we are well positioned with differentiated solutions for our customers. Secular trend of content growth is increasingly apparent in our served markets, and our ability to produce integrated solutions at all system-level challenges for our customers will enable TE to continue to become an even more valuable strategic partner for our customers in the future. These factors, combined with our TEOA initiatives and capital strategy, are expected to drive consistent double-digit earnings growth.

That's not particularly directed at industrial. It's more directed at Data and Devices where we got the product exits in corporate spending overall, which impacts all of our segments from the BNS stranded cost. There's some additional activity and additional benefit in oil and gas that will obviously benefit industrial. Overall, as we see volume recover and, in particular, as we work through the final implications of the distribution inventory channel recovery in the second half of the year, you'll see margins lift obviously at 11% in the current quarter with revenue down and, in particular, oil and gas high margin and channel, distribution channel very high margin.

Our goal is to continue to plug in technology and products like we've been doing because with all this engineering presence and all the sales and marketing presence in front of the customer, it's just think of is adding more fools into our tool bag and that's what customers want.

The U.S., while calendar '15 was a record level, it's still slightly the average age of a vehicle is slightly higher than normal. That did change dramatically, we might get worried. And of course, China is naturally slowing down but still going to be a pretty nice growth business, and that's 5% or 6% long term. And if you just look at the emerging markets and how many people are coming into the middle class, I mean the trends show it's a nice place to live and buy a car. So we think those trends are pretty good. And auto production last year slowed a little bit from the prior year this year. It's in the 2% range. So it feels very hot when you're in the U.S, but globally, it's still a little bit below. The fiscal '16 production rate is a little bit below its historical growth rate. And then on top of that, to your other point, the content growth is just consistent in every part of the vehicle, and we don't see that slowing. And then on top of that, the point I made in the comments about this integration, and it doesn't happen overnight, but it's real. I mean, we're being pulled into dozens of opportunities to do this, and this broad product range of ours enables that. There's multiple drivers. And then, of course, if the push stays on green, which I think it will even though will prices are very lower right now, the content in the hybrid vehicle or electric vehicle is a multiple of an internal combustion engine. So I think the positive drivers far outweigh the negative drivers. And I mean, there'll be cycles, but it's not like we've been in a boom cycle. It's been, over the last 5 years, a little bit higher than normal coming off the prior 5 years being lower than normal."

We're really seeing a negative mix on oil and gas in the distribution channel, in particular, with a positive lift on the SubCom. The SubCom benefit in Q1 is a direct timing out of largely Q2 but also Q3. Oil and gas, really, assuming will continue really through the end of the second quarter and when we start getting easier year-over-year compares. And the distribution channel, as Terrence pointed out, we've got one more quarter of this inventory correction and lower point-of-sale to work through. So you'll see that improve in the second half of the year. You also see lower FX impacts as we saw significant strengthening of the dollar really starting Q2 of last year, and so that year-over-year impact diminishes. And of course, you get the benefit of more restructuring savings and lower middle cost into the second half of the year that help lift the overall gross margin going forward."

We do have business in Latin America and India, but it's kind of the big one. China was down as we said year-over-year in revenue. It was up sequentially, flat in orders, up sequentially in orders, which is a good sign. And it was -- it came back faster than we thought. Now it's one data point we have to see that continue, but we have the first sequential improvement in orders in a year. So that was -- that feels like a pretty good sign. I mean, we expected that to happen in the second quarter and happening in the first quarter is encouraging. So that was a little better. If you go around the rest of the world, I think the U.S. in a way was a little worse because of the industrial and the channel. And oil and gas continues to be down, and as Terrence talked quite in detail about the channel. And then Europe continues to be steady, another I think it 6 or 7 quarters of growth in a row now. In Europe, we don't see any signs of that backing off yet. So versus 90 days ago, the outlook feels slightly better because of this industrial OEMs orders increasing sequentially and China orders increasing sequentially. And of course, this is, I mean, it's a key quarter for that to continue and to set up -- we'll get normal seasonal growth in the second half. So we've been seeing our orders trend naturally the way they always do seasonally as we get towards the second half of the year, but we expect them to pick up from the run rate because of the correction primarily in the channel. And secondarily, if China continues where it was in Q1 orders, it will be a good shape in China for the balance of the year even if it doesn't raise from there and stayed at that level.

We've begun fiscal 2016 with a quarter of solid execution, delivering $0.84 in adjusted EPS, $0.08 above the high end of guidance, with sales slightly above our midpoint. This",1137,"Thanks for joining us today, and here are the key takeaways from today's call. We've begun fiscal 2016 with a quarter of solid execution, delivering $0.84 in adjusted EPS, $0.08 above the high end of guidance, with sales slightly above our midpoint. This was driven by strong performance in our Transportation segment and SubCom business, in combination with tight cost management in light of the macro environment. Excluding the impact of currency exchange rates, Q1 adjusted EPS was flat year-over-year, and adjusted operating margins of 15.7% were ahead of expectations. For the full year 2016, we are reiterating our adjusted EPS guidance of $4. This is 11% year-over-year growth and 15% growth in constant currency. 
Relative to our view last quarter, the Transportation segment is a little stronger. Global auto production expectation is improving. In industrial, our direct business with OEMs developed as expected and appears to be stabilizing, but sales through our distribution channel were weaker than expected, and the recovery is taking longer than anticipated. The oil and gas market remains very weak, with derivative effects impacting some other industrial markets. 
The midpoint of our annual guidance assumes 2% global auto production growth in our fiscal year. We're also assuming sequential improvements in industrial sales and orders in the second quarter and into the second half. 
For the full year, in communications, we assume double-digit growth in SubCom, second half growth in Appliances and continued declines in Data and Devices. By region, we assume that the overall U.S. and European economies continue to grow slowly and China returns to growth in our markets in the second half. We continue to take a balanced approach with our capital strategy and, over time, expect to return approximately 2/3 of our free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and buybacks, with 1/3 of free cash being used for acquisitions. And we'll talk more about this later in the call. 
We are very pleased with the performance of the businesses we acquired last year, and we'll continue to look for acquisition opportunities that broaden our ability to address harsh-environment applications and provide integrated solutions to our customers. We believe that integration is another emerging secular trend for our business, and we are well positioned to capitalize with our broad portfolio of products. 
In Sensors, our unmatched presence across virtually every industry, coupled with the broad technology and product portfolio we acquired, is enabling us to expand our design win pipeline across market verticals and provide integrated solutions in certain applications. In Medical, we have increased our presence in the high-growth, minimally invasive market and are well positioned to provide integrated solutions to our customers that incorporate our connectors, sensors, fine-wire technology and material science know-how. 
While we can't control the macro environment and inevitable economic cycles, we have positioned TE around harsh-environment applications and continue to benefit directly from the secular trends of electronic content growth. We believe TE is uniquely positioned to provide highly engineered solutions that integrate connectors, sensors and other technologies to improve reliability, lower cost and increase performance, making the company an increasingly valued partner to our customers. And we have secured several key integrated solution design wins, particularly with major auto OEMs, over the last several months to prove out this point. 
Please turn to Slide 3 for a summary of Q1 results. While we continue to have the backdrop of a challenging macro environment, we generated adjusted EPS above the high end of guidance, with sales slightly above the midpoint of guidance. Sales of $2.8 billion were down 7% year-over-year but down only 1% in constant currency. Adjusted EPS was down 6% year-over-year but flat in constant currency. Performance above guidance in the quarter was driven by strength in our Transportation segment and higher sales in SubCom as a key program moved to completion earlier than expected. This, coupled with tight cost control, more than offset industrial being a little weaker than expected in the quarter. 
We generated adjusted operating margins of 15.7% in Q1, which were ahead of expectation, and our adjusted EBITDA margins were 21%. During the quarter, we returned $1.4 billion to shareholders, including $1.3 billion in share buybacks. The Board of Directors also approved a recommendation to raise our dividend by 12% to an annual rate of $1.48 per share. We expect this to be approved by shareholders in March and be effective in June. We also paid $127 million in dividends in the quarter. In addition, we returned approximately $1.3 billion of cash to shareholders through the share buybacks. 
While down year-over-year due primarily to weakness in China, our Transportation segment sales were above expectations with better-than-expected demand in China. China was weak, but it was not as weak as we thought. In the industrial segment, our direct business with OEMs performed about as expected, but we did see lower sales through the distribution channel. Overall, we continue to perform well in harsh-environment applications, last year's acquisitions in Sensors and Medical gaining momentum. And during the quarter, we announced the sale of our circuit protection business, which is on track to close later this quarter. 
Before we get into the segment update, I'd like to provide a brief insight into order patterns, which will help provide a baseline for our results and expectations. Please turn to Slide 4. Organic orders were down 3% from the prior year but were better than our expectations 90 days ago. Orders were up 3% sequentially excluding SubCom, and our book-to-bill was 1.04. China orders were up 11% sequentially on an organic basis and better than expected. These data points are positive indicators for our expectations of second half sales growth. One area that does remain weak is the distribution channel, where expectations of sales and orders recovery has pushed out slightly versus our prior view. Distribution accounts for about 15% of our total sales. 
Transportation orders improved 7% sequentially, reflecting incremental growth in global auto production expectations. During the quarter, we saw our industrial orders stabilize and grow slightly sequentially, with direct orders improving in line with expectations and weakness in the channel that I previously mentioned. Communications orders ex-SubCom declined 9% sequentially, driven by previously announced product exits and weakness in the distribution channel. 
To provide a little additional color on China, while both orders and sales were down year-over-year in aggregate in Q1, we are seeing improvement in auto production and saw a year-over-year organic growth in orders in Transportation. We continue to see China weakness in the industrial and communications segment but are expecting growth in the second half as inventories come more in balance. Excluding SubCom, our book-to-bill ratio was 1.04 in Q1, with all segments book-to-bill exceeding 1.0. 
With that backdrop, I'll now turn it over to Terrence to cover each of our segments in more detail."

If you could please turn to Slide 5, and we'll start with Transportation Solutions. Sales grew 1% organically in the quarter, above our guidance expectations due to China sales being stronger than we anticipated.",1064,"Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. If you could please turn to Slide 5, and we'll start with Transportation Solutions. 
Sales grew 1% organically in the quarter, above our guidance expectations due to China sales being stronger than we anticipated. Overall segment organic growth of 1% was driven by Automotive and Sensors. Our auto sales organic growth of 1% in the quarter was driven by Europe growing 6% and North America growth of 3% offsetting the expected reductions in China that Tom talked about. With the orders that we experienced, along with production schedules, we expect China to return to growth in the second quarter, reflecting the positive demand impacts from the government tax incentives that are driving increased production levels. 
For fiscal 2016, we now expect global auto production to be up 2% to just under 88 million vehicles, with China production up 6% compared to 2015. This compares favorably to our view last quarter when we expected flat global auto production with China production growth of only 2%. We continue to be confident that our auto business can grow well ahead of production, as is included in our annual guidance, and this is driven by electronic content growth and a rich pipeline of platform ramps from design wins generated over the past several years. 
As expected, our Commercial Transportation business was down year-over-year, driven by a weak global construction and agriculture market and weakness in the North America heavy truck area. While our sales declined versus last year, our organic orders were up 10% sequentially as we're seeing signs of this business stabilizing, and we expect to be up to flat low single digits on an organic basis for the year. 
Turning to Sensors. Our business continue to show strong momentum in the quarter in both sales and design wins. Along with our acquisition rationale, we are using the existing TE go-to-market teams to take new products and system-level solutions to our customers. These results in new sensor program awards across multiple market verticals. TE is uniquely positioned with the world's broadest portfolio of connector and sensors solutions, and we have recently been awarded design wins in the automotive space that integrate multiple components to provide a complete solution to our customers. 
In this segment, adjusted operating income was $280 million in the first quarter. This was down year-over-year due to currency, a change in product mix and our continuous investment for growth in Automotive and Sensors businesses. Adjusted operating margins came in higher than we expected, and we anticipate the second half margin to be at 20% or above. 
Please, if you could turn to Page 6 to discuss our Industrial Solutions segment. Aligned with our expectation, revenue in the segment declined 6% organically year-over-year in the first quarter. As Tom mentioned, we are being impacted by weakness in the distribution channel, which is almost 30% of the segment sales organically. Distribution sales were down 6% organically in the quarter as we see broad-based supply chain corrections occurring that we highlighted last quarter. Our direct sales to OEMs are improving in line with our expectations, and we saw our OEM orders improve sequentially by nearly 3% while orders through the channel partners remained flat sequentially. We currently expect that our distribution partners will continue to work through the second quarter to get in line with OEM demand. 
In addition to the distribution channel, we continue to be impacted by the oil and gas market. You can see on the slide, we broke this out separately this quarter, and it shows a 44% organic reduction in sales year-over-year in this market and the impact that's having on the segment. With the weakness in the oil and gas market, our business is now running at approximately $30 million per quarter, down from approximately $60 million per quarter a year ago. We have seen order rates stabilize around the $30 million level, and we expect a more favorable year-over-year compare in the second half. 
I also want to highlight that the low oil and gas prices are also having some derivative effect in other areas of the industrial segment, impacting sales in our Industrial Equipment business, in areas like factory equipment and rail, and also, in helicopter demand, which affects our Aerospace business. These derivative effects are all reflected in our guidance and our results. 
In the commercial Aerospace and defense business, our momentum remained strong, with the slight year-over-year decline driven by the defense business due to program timing. We remain very well positioned with our program wins in this space and expect to benefit from growth in the commercial Aerospace and as the defense market continues to improve. 
Our Energy business grew 4% organically, with strengths in Europe and the Americas more than offsetting softness in China. From an adjusted operating income perspective, it was $78 million in the first quarter, down year-over-year as expected due to the impact of currency, declines in our higher-margin oil and gas business and 6% organic decline in the channel. If you exclude the oil and gas business and FX impacts, our operating margins remained constant year-over-year, reflecting the benefit of our TEOA program as well as cost management. 
If you could turn to Slide 7, please, so I can talk about Communications Solutions. In the first quarter, the segment revenue of $617 million was down 6% and 3% organically as expected. Our SubCom business saw strong year-over-year growth as we successfully completed the America Europe Connect program earlier than our original plan. We now expect SubCom to grow low double digits for the full year, which is slightly better than our expectations 90 days ago. 
Our Data and Devices and Appliance businesses were impacted by the slowing in China as well as the supply chain adjustments by our distribution partner, SIMO, that I talked about in industrial. We expect this to be largely behind us as we head into the second half to the year. And just to remind you, Data and Devices growth is also impacted by the product exits that we initiated late in 2015 as part of our repositioning effort. From a margin perspective, adjusted operating margins expanded 380 basis points year-over-year, which was above expectations, driven by the early completion of the program in SubCom that we highlighted. 
Now let me turn it over to Bob, who will cover the financials."

Our adjusted operating income was $444 million, down 5% in constant currency due to investments in Transportation, impacts of oil and gas",605,"Thanks, Terrence, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 8, where I'll provide more details on earnings. 
Our adjusted operating income was $444 million, down 5% in constant currency due to investments in Transportation, impacts of oil and gas weakness and the distribution inventory corrections impacting our industrial segment that Terrence covered. Including $30 million of foreign currency headwinds, operating income was down 11% from the prior year. GAAP operating income was $398 million and included $6 million of acquisition-related charges as well as $40 million of restructuring and other charges related to Data and Devices product exits, elimination of corporate stranded costs from the BNS divestiture and general cost reductions. 
Our adjusted EPS was $0.84 for the quarter, down $0.05 from the prior year, with reduced volume from higher-margin products and negative impacts from foreign currency exchange rates offsetting incremental benefits from the share buyback. Excluding the $0.05 impact from foreign currency, adjusted EPS was flat to the prior year. GAAP EPS was $0.83 for the quarter and included acquisition-related charges of $0.01, restructuring and other charges of $0.07 and $0.07 from tax-related income. I now expect approximately $85 million of restructuring charges for the full year 2016, a $10 million increase from our prior guidance 90 days ago. 
Please turn to Slide 9. While we remain in a challenging environment, the progress we've made with TEOA and productivity initiatives enabled the business to demonstrate resiliency as reflected in our margins. Our adjusted gross margin in the quarter was 33.4%. While this was down from last year due to lower sales on higher-margin products, it's up 90 basis points sequentially from Q4. As Terrence discussed in the industrial section, we're seeing softness in some higher-margin businesses like oil and gas and lower sales in the distribution channel. 
Adjusted operating margins declined 70 basis points, driven by lower volume and product mix but benefiting from the early completion of the SubCom program in the quarter. Total operating expenses were $502 million in the quarter, down 8% from the prior year. We continue to tightly manage discretionary spending but are also continuing to invest in our harsh businesses. 
In the quarter, cash from continuing operations was $367 million, and our free cash flow was $237 million, up from prior year levels due to lower capital -- working capital and reduced revenue and timing of SubCom payments. We continue to have a balanced capital allocation strategy. In Q1, we returned $1.4 billion to shareholders, including $1.3 billion in buybacks. In the quarter, we bought back nearly 21 million shares, executing against our commitment of returning the proceeds from the broadband networks divestiture. 
We're also introducing a chart on EBITDA margins which better shows the profitability performance of our businesses, including acquisitions. EBITDA margins in Q1 were 21% and shows our margin resiliency despite lower sales levels. We continue to be pleased with the operating performance of our business, especially in light of the challenging macro backdrop. 
Also, you may have seen in the 8-K filed yesterday, Tyco International, on behalf of TE Connectivity, has entered into an agreement with the Internal Revenue Service to resolve all disputes related to the previously disclosed intercompany debt issues. The resolution would result in a total cash payment to the IRS from TE Connectivity of between $147 million and $163 million, which includes all interest and penalties. We're pleased with the proposed settlement and look forward to having this behind us in the near future. Of course, we've also added a balance sheet and cash flow summary in the appendix for additional details. 
Now I'll turn it back to Tom."

Please turn to Slide 10, and I will cover Q2 guidance at a high level with additional details provided in the slide deck. We expect Q2 revenue of $2.88 billion to $3.08 billion, down 3% or 1% organically; and adjusted EPS of $0.84 to $0.92, d",616,"Thanks, Bob. Please turn to Slide 10, and I will cover Q2 guidance at a high level with additional details provided in the slide deck. We expect Q2 revenue of $2.88 billion to $3.08 billion, down 3% or 1% organically; and adjusted EPS of $0.84 to $0.92, down approximately 3% year-over-year at the midpoint but flat in constant currency. Versus our view last quarter, we expect Transportation to be a bit stronger, industrial to be a bit weaker and communications to be impacted by the early completion of the SubCom program we discussed earlier. Most of that was in Q2 when we guided last time. 
For the full year, we expect revenue of $12.3 billion at the midpoint, up 1% versus the prior year and reflecting 4% organic growth at midpoint. We are reducing top line by about $100 million, reflecting the sale of our circuit protection business that we expect to complete this quarter. Our adjusted EPS guidance remains at $4 and represents year-over-year growth of 11% at midpoint. On a constant-currency basis, revenue is expected to grow over 3%, and adjusted EPS is expected to grow by 15% year-over-year. Versus our prior view, Transportation is expected to have higher growth, industrial is a little weaker and communications is weaker, factoring the impact of the sale of the circuit protection business. I think you've heard a constant theme here: Transportation, a little better; industrial, a little weaker; but overall, no big change from the prior guidance. 
Our full year outlook is based on the following market and regional assumptions. In Transportation, we expect mid-single-digit actual and high single-digit organic growth. We're assuming that global auto production is up 2% year-over-year, which is an improvement from our prior view of flat production. We are anticipating China auto production to grow 6% year-over-year. We expect the year of -- another strong -- another year of strong growth in our Sensors business. 
In industrial, we are assuming flat actual and low single-digit organic growth. We have seen orders stabilize in some industrial end markets and assume inventories come into balance by the end of Q2, ending the negative supply chain effect on our business. We continue to assume a weak oil and gas market, and we'll continue to see the signs of the negative impact in other adjacent markets in the industrial space. This is also factored into our guidance. 
In communications, we assume high single-digit actual and low single-digit organic declines, with growth in SubCom and Appliances being more than offset by product exits and the sale of the circuit protection business in Data and Devices. By region, we assume Europe and the U.S. to continue to improve, with China markets rebounding in the second half. Outside of auto, China markets are as expected 90 days ago. 
Our guidance does assume a 53rd week and currency exchange rates. As the year progresses, we have much less of a headwind from FX translation and an increased earnings tailwind from our share repurchase program. 
We remain positive on our outlook and have several levers to drive growth in a very challenging macro environment. As a result of the transformation of our portfolio and increased focus on harsh applications, we are well positioned with differentiated solutions for our customers. Secular trend of content growth is increasingly apparent in our served markets, and our ability to produce integrated solutions that solve system-level challenges for our customers will enable TE to continue to become an even more valuable strategic partner for our customers in the future. These factors, combined with our TEOA initiatives and capital strategy, are expected to drive consistent double-digit earnings growth.

So the actions that we did have planned for the year we pulled the trigger a little bit faster, so we'll see some benefit of that in the latter part of the year as well as the increased spending. That's not particularly directed at industrial. It's more directed at Data and Devices, where we got the product exits, and corporate spending overall, which impacts all of our segments, from the BNS stranded costs. There is some additional activity and additional benefit in oil and gas that will obviously benefit industrial. Overall, as we see volume recover and, in particular, as we work through the final implications of the distribution inventory channel recovery in the second half of the year, you'll see margins lift. Obviously at 11% in the current quarter, with revenue down and, in particular, oil and gas high margin and channel -- distribution channel very high margin, you're seeing a negative impact that improves into the second half of the year."

So -- and that's supported by almost 2,000 engineers facing the customer, so you have this tremendous presence at every customer with a wide range of connectivity products. But we also, of course, now have sensors and a broad range of sensor technology. We have sealing and protecting products. We have relays. We've been doing integration on a very small scale for many years. And with the advent of the Sensors in the product line, the ability to go into certain applications, not every application, but the more complex applications and pull 3 or 4 different products together which might have been handled by 3 or 4 suppliers before and integrate them into a subsystem, takes out cost, space, wait, and from a customer's perspective, it's 1 supplier to deal with. So we've had -- we've been doing this in the past, but the addition of sensors into the product line has really opened up much more for us, and we've had some very nice design-in wins, I mean significant design-in wins in the last 6 months that they won't start shipping probably for about 1.5 years to 2 years. It's this broad range of products and it's all these engineers we have sitting in front of the customer. And we know the architectures almost as well as our customers.

What we look at is also the direct order patterns that we see, and what we see, the direct order patterns that have turned that Tom talked about as well as what we're seeing elsewhere, it does look like it's going to be another quarter or so where we're going to have our partners and expect that sell-through to improve.

And you really got to do it almost by region, right, because Europe is still not that back -- quite back to pre-financial crisis demand levels. The U.S., while calendar '15 was a record level, is still slightly -- the average age of a vehicle is slightly higher than normal. If that did change dramatically, we might get worried. And of course, China is naturally slowing down but still going to be a pretty nice growth business, and it's 5% or 6% long term. And if you just look at the emerging markets and how many people are coming into the middle class, I mean the trends show ""get a nicer place to live and buy a car."" So we think those trends are pretty good. And auto production last year slowed a little bit from the prior year. This year, it's in the 2% range. So it feels very hot when you're in the U.S, but globally, it's still a little bit below. The fiscal '16 production rate is a little bit below its historical growth rate. And then on top of that, to your other point, the content growth is just consistent in every part of the vehicle, and we don't see that slowing. And then on top of that, the point I made in the comments about this integration, and it doesn't happen overnight, but it's real. I mean we are being pulled into dozens of opportunities to do this, and this broad product range of ours enables that. There's multiple drivers. And then, of course, if the push stays on green, which I think it will even though oil prices are very low right now, the content in a hybrid vehicle or electric vehicle is a multiple of an internal combustion engine. So I think the positive drivers far outweigh the negative drivers. And I mean, there'll be cycles, but it's not like we've been in a boom cycle. It's been, over the last 5 years, a little bit higher than normal coming off the prior 5 years being lower than normal."

We do have com air programs that are launching, which is an uptick, as well as some things in Medical that are launches due to the Medical side and the program wins there.

We do have business in Latin America and India, but it -- China is the big one. China was down, as we said, year-over-year in revenue. It was up sequentially, flat in orders -- up sequentially in orders, which is a good sign, and it was -- it came back faster than we thought. Now it's one data point we have to see that continue, but it -- we have the first sequential improvement in orders in a year. So that was -- that feels like a pretty good sign. I mean we expected that to happen in the second quarter, and happening in the first quarter is encouraging. So that was a little better. If you go around the rest of the world, I think the U.S., in a way, was a little worse because of the industrial and the channel. And oil and gas continues to be down, and Terrence talked quite in detail about the channel. And then Europe continues to be steady. Another -- I think it's 6 or 7 quarters of growth in a row now in Europe, and we don't see any signs of that backing off yet. So versus 90 days ago, the outlook feels slightly better because of this industrial OEM orders increasing sequentially and China orders increasing sequentially. And of course, this is -- I mean it's a key quarter for that to continue and to set up -- we'll get normal seasonal growth in the second half. So we're -- we've been seeing our orders trend naturally, the way they always do seasonally as we get towards the second half of the year, but we expect them to pick up from the run rate because of the correction primarily in the channel. And secondarily, if China continues where it was in Q1 orders, we'd be in good shape for China for the balance of the year even if it doesn't raise from there, if it stays at that level.

We're seeing a lot of large projects obviously not happening and there's not being a lot of large projects being bid. The $30 million per quarter level that we have right now is sort of a maintenance-type revenue level for us. There's not big project build, so whether it's 25, 35, 40, I do actually think that's a floor that we're going to be pretty close to, plus or minus a little bit.

We've begun fiscal 2016 with a quarter of solid execution, delivering $0.84 in adjusted EPS, $0.08 above the high end of guidance, with sales slightly above our midpoint. This",1137,"Thanks for joining us today, and here are the key takeaways from today's call. We've begun fiscal 2016 with a quarter of solid execution, delivering $0.84 in adjusted EPS, $0.08 above the high end of guidance, with sales slightly above our midpoint. This was driven by strong performance in our Transportation segment and SubCom business, in combination with tight cost management in light of the macro environment. Excluding the impact of currency exchange rates, Q1 adjusted EPS was flat year-over-year, and adjusted operating margins of 15.7% were ahead of expectations. For the full year 2016, we are reiterating our adjusted EPS guidance of $4. This is 11% year-over-year growth and 15% growth in constant currency. 
Relative to our view last quarter, the Transportation segment is a little stronger. Global auto production expectation is improving. In industrial, our direct business with OEMs developed as expected and appears to be stabilizing, but sales through our distribution channel were weaker than expected, and the recovery is taking longer than anticipated. The oil and gas market remains very weak, with derivative effects impacting some other industrial markets.  The midpoint of our annual guidance assumes 2% global auto production growth in our fiscal year. We're also assuming sequential improvements in industrial sales and orders in the second quarter and into the second half. 
For the full year, in communications, we assume double-digit growth in SubCom, second half growth in Appliances and continued declines in Data and Devices. By region, we assume that the overall U.S. and European economies continue to grow slowly and China returns to growth in our markets in the second half. We continue to take a balanced approach with our capital strategy and, over time, expect to return approximately 2/3 of our free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and buybacks, with 1/3 of free cash being used for acquisitions. And we'll talk more about this later in the call. 
We're very pleased with the performance of the businesses we acquired last year, and we'll continue to look for acquisition opportunities that broaden our ability to address harsh-environment applications and provide integrated solutions to our customers. We believe that integration is another emerging secular trend for our business, and we are well positioned to capitalize with our broad portfolio of products. 
In Sensors, our unmatched presence across virtually every industry, coupled with the broad technology and product portfolio we acquired, is enabling us to expand our design win pipeline across market verticals and provide integrated solutions in certain applications. In Medical, we have increased our presence in the high-growth, minimally invasive market and are well positioned to provide integrated solutions to our customers that incorporate our connectors, sensors, fine-wire technology and material science know-how. 
While we can't control the macro environment and inevitable economic cycles, we have positioned TE around harsh-environment applications and continue to benefit directly from the secular trends of electronic content growth. We believe TE is uniquely positioned to provide highly engineered solutions that integrate connectors, sensors and other technologies to improve reliability, lower cost and increase performance, making the company an increasingly valued partner to our customers. And we have secured several key integrated solution design wins, particularly with major auto OEMs, over the last several months to prove out this point. 
Please turn to Slide 3 for a summary of Q1 results. While we continue to have the backdrop of a challenging macro environment, we generated adjusted EPS above the high end of guidance, with sales slightly above the midpoint of guidance. Sales of $2.8 billion were down 7% year-over-year but down only 1% in constant currency. Adjusted EPS was down 6% year-over-year but flat in constant currency. Performance above guidance in the quarter was driven by strength in our Transportation segment and higher sales in SubCom as a key program moved to completion earlier than expected. This, coupled with tight cost control, more than offset industrial being a little weaker than expected in the quarter. 
We generated adjusted operating margins of 15.7% in Q1, which were ahead of expectation, and our adjusted EBITDA margins were 21%. During the quarter, we returned $1.4 billion to shareholders, including $1.3 billion in share buybacks. The Board of Directors also approved a recommendation to raise our dividend by 12% to an annual rate of $1.48 per share. We expect this to be approved by shareholders in March and be effective in June. We also paid $127 million in dividends in the quarter. In addition, we returned approximately $1.3 billion of cash to shareholders through the share buybacks. 
While down year-over-year due primarily to weakness in China, our Transportation segment sales were above expectations with better-than-expected demand in China. China was weak, but it was not as weak as we thought. In the industrial segment, our direct business with OEMs performed about as expected, but we did see lower sales through the distribution channel. Overall, we continue to perform well in harsh-environment applications, last year's acquisitions in Sensors and Medical gaining momentum. And during the quarter, we announced the sale of our circuit protection business, which is on track to close later this quarter. 
Before we get into the segment update, I'd like to provide a brief insight into order patterns, which will help provide a baseline for our results and expectations. Please turn to Slide 4. Organic orders were down 3% from the prior year but were better than our expectations 90 days ago. Orders were up 3% sequentially excluding SubCom, and our book-to-bill was 1.04. China orders were up 11% sequentially on an organic basis and better than expected. These data points are positive indicators for our expectations of second half sales growth. One area that does remain weak is the distribution channel, where our expectations of sales and orders recovery has pushed out slightly versus our prior view. Distribution accounts for about 15% of our total sales. 
Transportation orders improved 7% sequentially, reflecting incremental growth in global auto production expectations. During the quarter, we saw our industrial orders stabilize and grow slightly sequentially, with direct orders improving in line with expectations and weakness in the channel that I previously mentioned. Communications orders ex-SubCom declined 9% sequentially, driven by previously announced product exits and weakness in the distribution channel. 
To provide a little additional color on China, while both orders and sales were down year-over-year in aggregate in Q1, we are seeing improvement in auto production and saw a year-over-year organic growth in orders in Transportation. We continue to see China weakness in the industrial and communications segment but are expecting growth in the second half as inventories come more in balance. Excluding SubCom, our book-to-bill ratio was 1.04 in Q1, with all segments book-to-bill exceeding 1.0. 
With that backdrop, I'll now turn it over to Terrence to cover each of our segments in more detail."
8106523,321566662,919561,"TE Connectivity Ltd., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Jan 20, 2016",2016-01-20,"Earnings Calls","TE Connectivity plc","Executives","Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. If you could please turn to Slide 5, and we'll start with Transportation Solutions. Sales grew 1% organically in the quarter, above our guidance expectations due to China sales being stronger than we anticipated.",1064,"Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. If you could please turn to Slide 5, and we'll start with Transportation Solutions. 
Sales grew 1% organically in the quarter, above our guidance expectations due to China sales being stronger than we anticipated. Overall segment organic growth of 1% was driven by Automotive and Sensors. Our auto sales organic growth of 1% in the quarter was driven by Europe growing 6% and North America growth of 3% offsetting the expected reductions in China that Tom talked about. With the orders that we experienced, along with production schedules, we expect China to return to growth in the second quarter, reflecting the positive demand impacts from the government tax incentives that are driving increased production levels. 
For fiscal 2016, we now expect global auto production to be up 2% to just under 88 million vehicles, with China production up 6% compared to 2015. This compares favorably to our view last quarter when we expected flat global auto production with China production growth of only 2%. We continue to be confident that our auto business can grow well ahead of production, as is included in our annual guidance, and this is driven by electronic content growth and a rich pipeline of platform ramps from design wins generated over the past several years. 
As expected, our Commercial Transportation business was down year-over-year, driven by a weak global construction and agriculture market and weakness in the North America heavy truck area. While our sales declined versus last year, our organic orders were up 10% sequentially as we're seeing signs of this business stabilizing, and we expect to be up to flat low single digits on an organic basis for the year. 
Turning to Sensors. Our business continued to show strong momentum in the quarter in both sales and design wins. Along with our acquisition rationale, we are using the existing TE go-to-market teams to take new products and system-level solutions to our customers. This results in new sensor program awards across multiple market verticals. TE is uniquely positioned with the world's broadest portfolio of connector and sensors solutions, and we have recently been awarded design wins in the automotive space that integrate multiple components to provide a complete solution to our customers. 
In this segment, adjusted operating income was $280 million in the first quarter. This was down year-over-year due to currency, a change in product mix and our continuous investment for growth in Automotive and Sensors businesses. Adjusted operating margins came in higher than we expected, and we anticipate the second half margin to be at 20% or above. 
Please, if you could turn to Page 6 to discuss our Industrial Solutions segment. Aligned with our expectation, revenue in the segment declined 6% organically year-over-year in the first quarter. As Tom mentioned, we are being impacted by weakness in the distribution channel, which is almost 30% of the segment sales organically. Distribution sales were down 6% organically in the quarter as we see broad-based supply chain corrections occurring that we highlighted last quarter. Our direct sales to OEMs are improving in line with our expectations, and we saw our OEM orders improve sequentially by nearly 3%, while orders through the channel partners remained flat sequentially. We currently expect that our distribution partners will continue to work through the second quarter to get in line with OEM demand. 
In addition to the distribution channel, we continue to be impacted by the oil and gas market. You can see on the slide, we broke this out separately this quarter, and it shows a 44% organic reduction in sales year-over-year in this market and the impact that's having on the segment. With the weakness in the oil and gas market, our business is now running at approximately $30 million per quarter, down from approximately $60 million per quarter a year ago. We have seen order rates stabilize around the $30 million level, and we expect a more favorable year-over-year compare in the second half. 
I also want to highlight that the low oil and gas prices are also having some derivative effect in other areas of the industrial segment, impacting sales in our Industrial Equipment business, in areas like factory equipment and rail, and also, in helicopter demand, which affects our Aerospace business. These derivative effects are all reflected in our guidance and our results.  In the commercial Aerospace and defense business, our momentum remained strong, with the slight year-over-year decline driven by the defense business due to program timing. We remain very well positioned with our program wins in the space and expect to benefit from growth in the commercial Aerospace and as the defense market continues to improve. 
Our Energy business grew 4% organically, with strength in Europe and the Americas more than offsetting softness in China. From an adjusted operating income perspective, it was $78 million in the first quarter, down year-over-year as expected due to the impact of currency, declines in our higher-margin oil and gas business and 6% organic decline in the channel. If you exclude the oil and gas business and FX impacts, our operating margins remained constant year-over-year, reflecting the benefit of our TEOA program as well as cost management. 
If you could turn to Slide 7, please, so I can talk about Communications Solutions. In the first quarter, the segment revenue of $617 million was down 6% and 3% organically as expected. Our SubCom business saw strong year-over-year growth as we successfully completed the America Europe Connect program earlier than our original plan. We now expect SubCom to grow low double digits for the full year, which is slightly better than our expectations 90 days ago. 
Our Data and Devices and Appliance businesses were impacted by the slowing in China as well as the supply chain adjustments by our distribution partner, SIMO, that I talked about in industrial. We expect this to be largely behind us as we head into the second half of the year. And just to remind you, Data and Devices growth is also impacted by the product exits that we initiated late in 2015 as part of our repositioning effort. From a margin perspective, adjusted operating margins expanded 380 basis points year-over-year, which was above expectations, driven by the early completion of the program in SubCom that we highlighted.

Our adjusted operating income was $444 million, down 5% in constant currency due to investments in Transportation, impacts of oil and gas",607,"Thanks, Terrence, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 8, where I'll provide more details on earnings. 
Our adjusted operating income was $444 million, down 5% in constant currency due to investments in Transportation, impacts of oil and gas weakness and the distribution of inventory corrections impacting our industrial segment that Terrence covered. Including $30 million of foreign currency headwinds, operating income was down 11% from the prior year. GAAP operating income was $398 million and included $6 million of acquisition-related charges as well as $40 million of restructuring and other charges related to Data and Devices product exits, elimination of corporate stranded costs from the BNS divestiture and general cost reductions. 
Our adjusted EPS was $0.84 for the quarter, down $0.05 from the prior year, with reduced volume from higher-margin products and negative impacts from foreign currency exchange rates offsetting incremental benefits from the share buyback. Excluding the $0.05 impact from foreign currency, adjusted EPS was flat to the prior year. GAAP EPS was $0.83 for the quarter and included acquisition-related charges of $0.01, restructuring and other charges of $0.07 and $0.07 from tax-related income. I now expect approximately $85 million of restructuring charges for the full year 2016, a $10 million increase from our prior guidance 90 days ago. 
Please turn to Slide 9. While we remain in a challenging environment, the progress we've made with TEOA and productivity initiatives enabled the business to demonstrate resiliency as reflected in our margins. Our adjusted gross margin in the quarter was 33.4%. While this was down from last year due to lower sales on higher-margin products, it's up 90 basis points sequentially from Q4. As Terrence discussed in the industrial section, we're seeing softness in some higher-margin businesses like oil and gas and lower sales in the distribution channel. Adjusted operating margins declined 70 basis points, driven by lower volume and product mix but benefiting from the early completion of the SubCom program in the quarter. Total operating expenses were $502 million in the quarter, down 8% from the prior year. We continue to tightly manage discretionary spending but are also continuing to invest in our harsh businesses. 
In the quarter, cash from continuing operations was $367 million, and our free cash flow was $237 million, up from prior year levels due to lower capital -- working capital and reduced revenue and timing of SubCom payments. We continue to have a balanced capital allocation strategy. In Q1, we returned $1.4 billion to shareholders, including $1.3 billion in buybacks. In the quarter, we bought back nearly 21 million shares, executing against our commitment of returning the proceeds from the broadband networks divestiture. 
We're also introducing a chart on EBITDA margins which better shows the profitability performance of our businesses, including acquisitions. EBITDA margins in Q1 were 21% and shows our margin resiliency despite lower sales levels. We continue to be pleased with the operating performance of our business, especially in light of the challenging macro backdrop. 
Also, you may have seen in the 8-K filed yesterday, Tyco International, on behalf of TE Connectivity, has entered into an agreement with the Internal Revenue Service to resolve all disputes related to their previously disclosed intercompany debt issues. The resolution would result in a total cash payment to the IRS from TE Connectivity of between $147 million and $163 million, which includes all interest and penalties. We are pleased with the proposed settlement and look forward to having this behind us in the near future. Of course, we've also added a balance sheet and cash flow summary in the appendix for additional details. 
Now I'll turn it back to Tom."

Please turn to Slide 10, and I will cover Q2 guidance at a high level with additional details provided in the slide deck. We expect Q2 revenue of $2.88 billion to $3.08 billion, down 3% or 1% organically; and adjusted EPS of $0.84 to $0.92, d",617,"Thanks, Bob. Please turn to Slide 10, and I will cover Q2 guidance at a high level with additional details provided in the slide deck. We expect Q2 revenue of $2.88 billion to $3.08 billion, down 3% or 1% organically; and adjusted EPS of $0.84 to $0.92, down approximately 3% year-over-year at the midpoint but flat in constant currency. Versus our view last quarter, we expect Transportation to be a bit stronger, industrial to be a bit weaker and communications to be impacted by the early completion of the SubCom program we discussed earlier. Most of that was in Q2 when we guided last time. 
For the full year, we expect revenue of $12.3 billion at the midpoint, up 1% versus the prior year and reflecting 4% organic growth at midpoint. We are reducing top line by about $100 million, reflecting the sale of our circuit protection business that we expect to complete this quarter. Our adjusted EPS guidance remains at $4 and represents year-over-year growth of 11% at midpoint. On a constant-currency basis, revenue is expected to grow over 3%, and adjusted EPS is expected to grow by 15% year-over-year. Versus our prior view, Transportation is expected to have higher growth, industrial is a little weaker and communications is weaker, factoring the impact of the sale of the circuit protection business. I think you've heard a constant theme here: Transportation, a little better; industrial, a little weaker; but overall, no big change from the prior guidance. 
Our full year outlook is based on the following market and regional assumptions. In Transportation, we expect mid-single-digit actual and high single-digit organic growth. We are assuming that global auto production is up 2% year-over-year, which is an improvement from our prior view of flat production. We are anticipating China auto production to grow 6% year-over-year. We expect a year of -- another strong -- another year of strong growth in our Sensors business. 
In industrial, we are assuming flat actual and low single-digit organic growth. We have seen orders stabilize in some industrial end markets and assume inventories come into balance by the end of Q2, ending the negative supply chain effect on our business. We continue to assume a weak oil and gas market, and we'll continue to see the signs of the negative impact in other adjacent markets in the industrial space. This is also factored into our guidance. 
In communications, we assume high single-digit actual and low single-digit organic declines, with growth in SubCom and Appliances being more than offset by product exit and the sale of the circuit protection business in Data and Devices. By region, we assume Europe and the U.S. to continue to improve, with China markets rebounding in the second half. Outside of auto, China markets are as expected 90 days ago. Our guidance does assume a 53rd week and currency exchange rates. As the year progresses, we have much less of a headwind from FX translation and an increased earnings tailwind from our share repurchase program. 
We remain positive on our outlook and have several levers to drive growth in a very challenging macro environment. As a result of the transformation of our portfolio and increased focus on harsh applications, we are well positioned with differentiated solutions for our customers. Secular trend of content growth is increasingly apparent in our served markets, and our ability to produce integrated solutions that solve system-level challenges for our customers will enable TE to continue to become an even more valuable strategic partner for our customers in the future. These factors, combined with our TEOA initiatives and capital strategy, are expected to drive consistent double-digit earnings growth. 
Now Sujal, let's open it up for questions."

We've now raised that to $85 million. In the first quarter, we spent $35 million. So the actions that we did have planned for the year, we pulled the trigger a little bit faster, so we'll see some benefit of that in the latter part of the year as well as the increased spending. That's not particularly directed at industrial. It's more directed at Data and Devices, where we got the product exits, in corporate spending overall, which impacts all of our segments from the BNS stranded costs. There is some additional activity and additional benefit in oil and gas that will obviously benefit industrial. Overall, as we see volume recover and, in particular, as we work through the final implications of the distribution inventory channel recovery in the second half of the year, you'll see margins lift. Obviously at 11% in the current quarter, with revenue down and, in particular, oil and gas high margin and channel -- distribution channel very high margin, you're seeing a negative impact that improves into the second half of the year."

So and that's supported by almost 2,000 engineers facing the customer. So you have this tremendous presence at every customer with a wide range of connectivity products. But we also, of course, now have sensors and a broad range of sensor technology. We have sealing and protecting products. We have relays. We've been doing integration on a very small scale for many years. And with the advent of the Sensors in the product line, the ability to go into certain applications, not every application, but the more complex applications and pull 3 or 4 different products together which might have been handled by 3 or 4 suppliers before and integrate them into a subsystem, takes out cost, space, weight and from a customer's perspective, it's 1 supplier to deal with. So we've had -- we've been doing this in the past, but the addition of sensors into the product line has really opened up much more for us, and we've had some very nice design-in wins, I mean significant design-in wins in the last 6 months that, they won't start shipping probably for about 1.5 years to 2 years. So it's this broad range of products and it's all these engineers we have sitting in front of the customer. And we know the architectures almost as well as our customers. We've been doing this for so long, and we have that many engineers. We have this deep knowledge, and they share with us what they're trying to accomplish. They're not just asking us for spec.

And you really got to do it almost by region, right, because Europe has still not got back -- quite back to pre-financial crisis demand levels. The U.S., while calendar '15 was a record level, is still slightly -- the average age of a vehicle is slightly higher than normal. If that had changed dramatically, might get worried. And of course, China is naturally slowing down but still going to be a pretty nice growth business, and it's 5% or 6% long term. And if you just look at the emerging markets and how many people are coming into the middle class, I mean the trends show ""get a nicer place to live and buy a car."" So we think those trends are pretty good. And auto production last year slowed a little bit from the prior year. This year, it's in the 2% range. So it feels very hot when you're in the U.S, but globally, it's still a little bit below. The fiscal '16 production rate is a little bit below its historical growth rate. And then on top of that, to your other point, the content growth is just consistent in every part of the vehicle, and we don't see that slowing. And then on top of that, the point I made in the comments about this integration, and it doesn't happen overnight, but it's real. I mean we are being pulled into dozens of opportunities to do this, and this broad product range of ours enables that. So there's multiple drivers. And then, of course, if the push stays on green, which I think it will even though oil prices are very low right now, the content in a hybrid vehicle or electric vehicle is a multiple of an internal combustion engine. So I think the positive drivers far outweigh the negative drivers. And I mean, there'll be cycles, but it's not like we've been in a boom cycle. It's been, over the last 5 years, a little bit higher than normal coming off the prior 5 years being lower than normal."

We do assume that our channel business will get back to parity where it ran last year in the latter half, so there is a little bit of a restock that happens in quarter 4 due to quarter 4 being very weak, that we talked about last fourth quarter. So there is a little bit of that effect that helps you get closer to flat. We do have com air programs that are launching, which is an uptick, as well as some things in Medical that are launches due to the Medical side and the program wins there. So there are some things that are a little bit of uppers in Medical and com air that help make it a little bit rich as well as the distribution channel getting back to more normalized level, more of like it was in the middle of last year than where it was in the quarter 4 time, quarter 1 time and, certainly, the quarter 2 time that we're in right now."

Another, I think it's 6 or 7 quarters of growth in a row now in Europe, and we don't see any signs of that backing off yet.

I understand the inventory and distribution issues, but what if oil stays at $30? I'm not smart enough to know if it's going to go higher or lower. But if it stays at $30, is that supportive of your second half recovery view? Does that pose a risk? Or does that impact it at all? And then my follow-up is on the timing of the stock buyback given the BNS sale, can you help us understand the cadence that we should expect about that? I mean, in one hand, you've been very diligent at always buying back stock each quarter. On the other hand, one would say, ""Well, why not do a big accelerated program so you get a bigger EPS benefit sooner, especially given the recent stock price volatility?"""

On oil and gas, one of the things that we have seen, certainly the program element of the oil and gas market, we've seen in our step-down of revenue. So like I said, last year early in the year as well as the year before, we would run about $60 million a quarter. Our business, as it's come down, and oil has been impacted, we're seeing a lot of large projects obviously not happening and there's not being a lot of large projects being bid. The $30 million per quarter level that we have right now is sort of a maintenance-type revenue level for us. There's not big project build, so whether it's $25, $35, $40, I do actually think that's a floor that we're going to be pretty close to, plus or minus a little bit. So I do think that element that we have in our forecast reflects current oil prices."

Q2 was another quarter of good execution and what continues to remain a sluggish global economic environment. Adjusted earnings per share of $0.90 was $0.02 better than the midpoint of our guidance of sales of $2.95 billion, which was slightly below the midpoint of the guidance. Strong operating performance across the company more than offset continued market softness across our industrial businesses.
Our adjusted earnings per share was down 1 penny versus the prior year with foreign exchange headwinds of approximately, $0.02. On a constant currency basis, adjusted EPS was up 1% year-over-year. Adjusted operating margins were 14.9% in line with our expectation, with adjusted EBITDA margins of approximately 20% in the quarter. For the full year, we are reiterating the midpoint of our guidance of $12.3 billion in revenue and $4 in adjusted earnings per share, representing an increase of 11% over prior year EPS. We expect to return to revenue growth in second half and to generate double-digit EPS growth.
Our outlook for organic growth is 3%, down slightly compared to our guidance of 90 days ago. Our auto business remains solid, industrial inventory correction is largely behind us, and SubCom continues to build momentum. Our recent acquisition of is in our guidance as well. These positive factors are offsetting lower-than-expected growth in most industrial markets and slow growth in our non-transportation business in China.
Our EPS growth is benefiting from cost controls, the benefits of our share buyback and suitable lower tax rate. We have developed multiple levers to drive earnings growth in a slow economy. During the quarter, we returned $1.2 billion to shareholders, including $1.1 billion in share buybacks. We expect to continue to take a balanced approach with our capital strategy, returning approximately 2/3 of our free cash flow to shareholders of our time with 1/3 of free cash being used for acquisitions. We generated $165 million of free cash flow in the quarter and $400 million in first half of the year. We expect our normal strong second half cash generation to continue. We also continue to strengthen the company's harsh-environment portfolio.
In March, we completed the sale of our Circuit Protection business. Earlier this month, we completed the acquisition of Creganna, doubling the size of our medical business to about $500 million in revenue and establishing TE as a leading provider of solutions for the high growth minimally invasive medical market.
This morning, we also announced a small sensor activation, which will strengthen our portfolio of sensor technologies serving the transportation market. In our SubCom business, we continue to gain momentum with the recently announced award of a project called Hawaiki, which is a new trend specific cable system linking Australia and New Zealand with the mainland United States. This award will generate over $200 million in revenue over the life of the project. And this business as a backdrop of awarded projects of $1 billion. I will turn it over to Terrence Curtin, who will cover our performance in more detail"

Before we get to the segment updates, I want to provide brief insights into our order patterns, which will help provide baseline for our results as well as the expectations. If you turn to Slide 4 please and this s",1180,"Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. Before we get to the segment updates, I want to provide brief insights into our order patterns, which will help provide baseline for our results as well as the expectations. If you turn to Slide 4 please and this shows order trends extending our SubCom business. Overall, orders improved sequentially and are above the low levels of approximately $2.6 billion that we experienced in the fourth quarter of 2015 and if you remember in the fourth quarter of last year, when we began to experience the supply chain impact related to the slowing in China as well as markets. We have seen recovery in orders in both of these areas and feel that the supply chain correction effects has completed in our second quarter as we expected. Certainly, we're pleased with the recovery in the orders, however, the slope of the recovery is running behind original expectations in certain areas.
Specifically in China, we previously thought that orders would continue to accelerate through the rest of the year. While we believe the auto orders in China will continue to recover, we are now expecting orders outside of auto just so to remain current levels that we experienced in the second quarter.
Let me now to talk about the orders by segment. Overall, transportation orders remain solid and in auto, our orders were impacted by near-term customer backlog adjustment that related to a change in their schedule. I want to highlight this does not impact demand, it's really just a change in one of our customers' process. We continue to experience strong order trends both in Europe and in Asia in automotive. In industrial, orders grew 5% sequentially with growth in both our direct customer orders as well as growth through our channel partner distribution.
As I stated earlier, the industrial inventory correction that is now behind us. And in communications excluding SubCom, our orders grew 4% sequentially with the book-to-bill of 105, this improvement in both our appliances and data and device business. As Tom mentioned, in SubCom, we continue this momentum with the new Hawaiki program and we will support that order as working in order. 
If you could please turn to Slide 5, I'll discuss Transportation Solutions results in the second quarter. Overall, sales grew 3% in the segment organically in the quarter, with growth across all of our businesses. Our order of sales growth in the quarter was driven by strength in China as well as in Europe. For fiscal 2016, we continue to expect global auto production to be up 2% to 2.5%, with growth in all regions as strong growth in China. We remain confident that our auto business can grow ahead of auto production driven by electronic content growth as well as platform from design wins that were generated over a couple of years. 
In commercial transportation, sales grew 1% organically year-over-year, driven by the heavy truck sector in both China and Europe. North America heavy truck markets continue to remain weak along with continued weakness in global construction and ag markets. We're pleased that organic orders were up both year-over-year as well as sequentially as we continue to perform very well in this business in the tough economic backdrop. 
Turning to Sensors, we saw 2% organic growth as we did begin to feel the impact of weakness in the industrial markets in our Sensors business and just to highlight for you about 40% of our sensor sales go into the industry markets. We do continue to see strong design momentum in long cycle transportation and industrial applications that we expect will draw future growth. 
From a margin viewpoint, adjusted operating margin in the segment were 19% and were in line with our expectations and were up sequentially. The decline year-over-year was driven by currency impacts as well as investments for growth. We anticipate adjusted operating margins for the second half to continue to improve and should be at similar levels as the second half of last year. 
If you could please turn to Slide 6 and I'll discuss the Industrial Solutions segment. Revenues in the segment declined 7% organically year-over-year in the second quarter. Geographically, we continue to see trends across our businesses that are consistent. Europe is stable and growing in many markets, North America continue to see weakness due to oil and gas as well as supply-chain correction that impacted us in the last couple of quarters and China remains sluggish. 
We continue to be impacted by the oil and gas market which saw 42% organic reduction in sales year-over-year and the decline in oil and gas drives half of the organic decline in the segment in the second quarter. Low oil and gas prices continue to have derivative fact other areas of the industrial segment including factory equipment as well as demand, which affects our Aerospace business. We have included the impacts in the results as well as our guidance. 
In Aerospace and Defense, our Commercial Aerospace business grew year-over-year and this was more than offset by declines in the defense business due to the supply-chain affects that were current in the distribution channel. Our Energy business was down 2% organically, with declines in Asia and Europe, partially offset by the growth. As we look forward, we expect the industrial segment to grow sequentially and we expect it to be essentially flat organically year-over-year in the third quarter, and we expect it to return the growth in the fourth quarter now that the inventory corrections are behind us. 
Adjusted operating margins were down year-over-year, driven primarily by declines in the higher-margin oil and gas business, but they were up sequentially. We do expect adjusted operating margins to continue to improve in the second half, benefiting from the increased volumes as well as the cost actions that we have initiated. 
If you could please turn to Page 7 to talk about the communication medications segment. In the second quarter, the segment had revenue of $606 million, which was down 10% and 8% organically year-over-year. And it was slightly ahead of our expectations. Our SubCom business saw solid year-over-year growth driven by strong execution from multiple projects in force and as Tom mentioned earlier, the total value of programs, of course, is approximately $1 million. We now expect SubCom to grow approximately 20% year-over-year and this is an improvement versus our expectation in 90 days ago. 
Our Data and Devices and Appliances business were impacted by distribution inventory corrections as I mentioned earlier, and we believe these are behind us that we had in the second half of the year. Additionally, Data and Device growth is impacted by the exits we're highlighted all year as far as the repositioning effort and as discussed will impact our growth rate throughout this year. 
Adjusted operating margins in the segment declined 60 basis points year-over-year in line with our expectations and we do expect improvements to adjusted operating margins as we continue through the second half. Now let me turn it over to Mario, who will cover the financials"

Please turn to Slide 8 while I'll provide more details on earnings. Adjusted operating income of $440 million was in line with guidance and down 13% over year-over-year, due to currency impact investments in transportation and the lower volume impacts as Dennis mentioned earlier. GAAP operating income was $535 million and included $4 million of acquisition-related charges and net restructuring and other credit of $99 million, primarily driven by a gain on the sale of our production business. 
Adjusted EPS was $0.90 for the quarter, down $0.01 from the prior year with the reduced volume from higher-margin profits and negative impacts from currency exchange rate, offsetting incremental benefits from share buyback. Excluding impacts from foreign currency, adjusted EPS was up $0.01 from the prior year. GAAP EPS was $1.06 for the quarter, driven by net restructuring and other credits of $0.17, primarily due to the production sale I just mentioned. 
We expect approximately $100 million of restructuring charges for the full year, a $15 million increase from prior guidance. Regarding tax, you should continue obtain long-term adjustment tax rate as approximately 23% to 24%. Due to the mix of profitability in different jurisdictions, we now expect our adjusted tax rate to slightly lower this year. 
As we mentioned last quarter, international on behalf entered into the agreement with IRS to resolve all disputes related to the previously disclosed intercompany debt issues. During the quarter, we made net pre-separation tax payments to the IRS of approximately $140 million, to prevent further accrual of interest and hope to add this sale and behind us in the near future. As you may know, the Treasury Department issued tax regulations earlier this month. addresses the tax characterizations of intercompany financing arrangements by multinational companies, it utilizes in the company financing more efficient capital deployment. We are in the process of finalizing this proposed regulations for any potential prospective impact. 
Turning to Slide 9, while we remain in a challenging environment, our performance was in line with our guidance and we expect improvement across our operating metrics in the second half. Our adjusted gross margin in the quarter was 32.6%, the decline from last year is mostly driven by lower volume in areas like oil and gas and distribution, which have higher margin in the company average. Adjusted operating margins declined 150 basis points consistently with our gross margin performance. 
Total operating expenses were $523 million in the quarter, down 5% from the previous year, reflecting strong spending controls. We continue to tightly manage discretionary spending, while balancing our continuing investment into our harsh business. 
Moving to cash flow and capital deployment. In the quarter, cash from continuing operations was $155 million and our free cash flow was $165 million, down from prior year levels due to timing of certain tax payments, but still up in the first half versus last year. We expect full year free cash flow to approximate net income. We continue to have a balanced capital allocation. In the second quarter, we returned $1.2 billion to our shareholders, including $1.1 billion in buybacks. In the quarter, we bought back 19 million shares, executing against our commitment of returning the proceed from the broadband networks divestiture. 
Over the past 18 months, we have returned approximately, $4.3 billion to our shareholders through buybacks and dividends. As Tom mentioned earlier, we expect to continue to take a balance approach with our capital strategy going forward. We are also including a chart on adjusted EBITDA margins, which have explained the profitability performance of our businesses including acquisitions. 
Adjusted EBITDA margins in Q2 were 20%, which show our margin resiliency despite lower sales levels. Continued to be pleased with the operating performance of our business, especially in line of the challenging macro environment. We've also added the balance sheet and cash flow summary in the appendix for additional details.
Now let me turn back to Tom."

Before I get into Q3 guidance on Slide 10, let me provide some perspective on why we will return to growth in the second half.

Before I get into Q3 guidance on Slide 10, let me provide some perspective on why we will return to growth in the second half. As you know, our first half was characterized by several year-over-year macro headwind, unfavorable foreign exchange due to the significant strengthening of the dollar against most major currencies, the significant decline in year-over-year oil prices, which resulted in over 40% decline in our higher-margin oil and gas business, overall industrial markets we can leading to a supply chain connection with OEM than our challenge partners, which we believe are now behind us and weakness across most China markets. 
In the first half, these factors impacted us significantly, and in the second half, most of these headwinds were reduced. As a result, we expect to return the revenue growth and strong double-digit adjusted EPS growth, driven by our harsh strategy and the many levers in our operating model. 
Now I'll cover the Q3 outlook. We expect Q3 revenue of $3 billion to $3.2 billion, up 1% on an actual basis and flat organically and adjusted earnings per share of $1 to $1.06, up 14% year-over-year at the midpoint. We expect growth in transportation and industrial, which includes approximately, $60 million from the Creganna acquisition. This is offset by decline in communications from the sale of the Circuit Protection business and the continuation of our strategy to exit certain product line in Data and Devices. We do expect continued growth in our SubCom.
Now please turn to Slide 11. We are reiterating our full year guidance of $12.3 billion in revenue and $4 in adjusted EPS at the midpoint. On a full year basis, continued strong performance of our transportation segment, addition of the Creganna acquisition and growth in our SubCom business, more than offsetting the negative impact of exchange rates softer industry markets, especially oil and gas in China. As mentioned earlier, the full year and fourth quarter includes the 53rd week, which contributes approximately $200 million of revenue. 
Now this full year outlook includes an unusually high Q4 revenue and EPS level compared to Q3, so I'll walk you through that. As previously mentioned, this year's fourth quarter includes an extra week, which contributes approximately $200 million of revenue and approximately $0.10 per share in our earnings. Excluding the 53rd week, revenue is increasing approximately $40 million from Q3 to Q4. But the way to think about this is the $240 million revenue will flow through the earnings at a 25% to 30% rate and this coupled with our typical productivity accounts for the significant sequential increase in EPS. 
Let me just to wrap up with a few comments. As we mentioned earlier, the global economic environment continues to be sluggish. Despite this, we expect to generate another solid performance. Our focus on harsh environment, driving TE with organization, strong cash flow and a consistent return of capital policy continues to enable us significantly, strengthen our earnings leverage. $1 of revenue today generates about 40% more EPS than 5 years ago. This is serving us very well in the slow growth economy and will deliver accelerated earnings growth with the global economic improves. Now let's open it up for questions."

So that's really the different accounting for us, a slight sequential improvement [indiscernible] we could say over time a time, and the same kind of applies [indiscernible] We also pick up. When you add $240 million in revenue sequentially a lot of leverage comes with that, [indiscernible] I think [indiscernible] 25% to 30%, restructuring has been going on through the year continues to slow in aggregate, so there'll be a better benefit in Q4 and Q3 and then our normal productivity momentum, which marches through the year. So when you had all that up and that's how you get to which looks like a pretty significant you feel us back, let's say, it's a small"

On China stimulus, I think that's a little bit more of a complicated question that when you look at it, we began impact in our first quarter as China's overall production adjusted, so we talked about that. What we have seen is China coming back to about a 6% production environment, opposed that, which is pretty much in line with GDP. I don't think we know whether the China stimulus accelerated some production or demand, but we do sort of view that China production long term will stay around GDP of China.

So now we expect what's going to happen in the second half of the year in the industrial connectivity business, flat and then a little bit growth in Q4. But Sensors is a different story. It just really grow slowing, reflecting some certainty out there. Terrence, you want to talk more about transportation?"

We expect to grow mid- to high-single digits on 2% to 3% -- 2.5% production growth margins there remain Sensors is below the transportation averages. As you know, with the acquisition, tremendous opportunity to move those margins up. And we are investing at -- we are increasing our R&D investment at a faster rate and our sales growth and Sensors because the opportunity is so great. And customers absolutely like another strong resilient technology, which company providing sensors into the transportation market and we are getting significant design and that requires engineers. It's been our plan from day 1 when we made the acquisition. And then in the industrial transportation business, which is the highest margin business in the group, we are -- I think we're navigating very well, maintaining our margins in a very -- almost really negative growth environment. Our growth is up because of our strong position in China and Europe which is offsetting North America. So we really within segment, we manage those businesses separately based on the dynamics and the opportunity. And as Terrence said in his comments, we're pretty confident that you'll see the margins that improve sequentially. It went up 40 or 50 basis points Q1 versus Q2. We expect that margin to continue in the second half of the year with a little bit of volume growth over the first half of the year because there's a lot of operating leverage in this business."

That scheduling came out and they're going to hit us with orders more frequently. That does create a debooking in our world. It does not impact programs that we won with our customer throughout the world. So when you look at it, it is something that is very process centric.

And with our presence in our range of technology, it's becoming more and more important. So we have a significant share in the connectivity business. But over the last 5 years, we believe we increased at 5 points, that is quite an accomplishment and it really is as these solutions get more complex and all you have to do is kind of look under the hood to see how different it is over the last 5 or 6 years. The connectivity in the sensing solutions are more complex. On the connectivity side, we continue to win at a rate faster than we have in the past, which is why I think we said a few times if you go back 5 years and we talked about 2% production environment, we would have talked about a 3% -- 3% to 4% revenue to TE environment. Now we believe that's 5% to 6%. And that's really more market share than it is content. So I expect we'll continue to up our market share because of the range of capability we have and just for example, hydroelectric vehicle, the difference in our designing in rate in the last 3 years versus the first -- the prior 5 years is 2 to 3x. So that market now continues to pick up with high content and we're extremely well positioned with all the leading platforms. So we feel good about that.

Q2 was another quarter of good execution and what continues to remain a sluggish global economic environment. Adjusted earnings per share of $0.90",525,"Thanks for joining us today, and please turn to Slide 3 and we will review the highlights from today's call. Q2 was another quarter of good execution and what continues to remain a sluggish global economic environment. Adjusted earnings per share of $0.90, was $0.02 better than the midpoint of our guidance on sales of $2.95 billion, which was slightly below the midpoint of the guidance. Strong operating performance across the company more than offset continued market softness across our Industrial businesses.
Our adjusted earnings per share was down 1 penny versus the prior year with foreign exchange headwinds of approximately, $0.02. On a constant currency basis, adjusted EPS was up 1% year-over-year. Adjusted operating margins were 14.9% in line with our expectation, with adjusted EBITDA margins of approximately 20% in the quarter. For the full year, we are reiterating the midpoint of our guidance of $12.3 billion in revenue and $4 in adjusted earnings per share, representing an increase of 11% over prior year EPS. We expect to return to revenue growth in the second half and to generate double-digit EPS growth.
Our outlook for organic growth is 3%, down slightly compared to our guidance of 90 days ago. Our auto business remains solid, industrial inventory correction is largely behind us, and SubCom continues to build momentum. Our recent acquisition of Creganna is now in our guidance as well. These positive factors are offsetting lower-than-expected growth in most industrial markets and slow growth in our non-transportation business in China.
Our EPS growth is benefiting from cost controls, the benefits of our share buyback and a suitable lower tax rate. We have developed multiple levers to drive earnings growth in a slow economy. During the quarter, we returned $1.2 billion to shareholders, including $1.1 billion in share buybacks. We expect to continue to take a balanced approach with our capital strategy, returning approximately 2/3 of our free cash flow to shareholders over time with 1/3 of free cash being used for acquisitions. We generated $165 million of free cash flow in the quarter and $400 million in the first half of the year. We expect our normal strong second half cash generation to continue. We also continue to strengthen the company's Harsh environment portfolio.
In March, we completed the sale of our Circuit Protection business. Earlier this month, we completed the acquisition of Creganna, doubling the size of our medical business to about $500 million in revenue and establishing TE as a leading provider of solutions for the high growth minimally invasive medical market.
This morning, we also announced a small sensor activation, which will strengthen our portfolio of sensor technologies serving the Transportation market. In our SubCom business, we continue to gain momentum with the recently announced award of a project called Hawaiki, which is a new trans-pacific cable system linking Australia and New Zealand with the mainland United States. This award will generate over $200 million in revenue over the life of the project. And this business has a backlog of awarded projects of $1 billion. I will now turn it over to Terrence Curtin, who will cover our performance in more detail."

Before we get into the segment updates, I want to provide brief insights into our order patterns, which will help provide a baseline for our results as well as the expectations. If you turn to Slide 4 please and th",1204,"Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. Before we get into the segment updates, I want to provide brief insights into our order patterns, which will help provide a baseline for our results as well as the expectations. If you turn to Slide 4 please and this shows order trends excluding our SubCom business. Overall, orders improved again sequentially and are above the low levels of approximately $2.6 billion that we experienced in the fourth quarter of 2015, and if you remember in the fourth quarter of last year is when we began to experience the supply chain impact related to the slowing in China as well as the industrial markets. We have seen recovery in orders in both of these areas and feel that the supply chain correction effects have completed in our second quarter as we expected. Certainly, we're pleased with the recovery in the orders, however, the slope with recovery is running behind original expectations in certain areas.
Specifically in China, we previously thought that orders would continue to accelerate through the rest of the year. While we believe the auto orders in China will continue to recover, we are now expecting orders outside of auto just so to remain at the current levels that were experienced in the second quarter.
Let me now talk about the orders by segment. Overall, Transportation orders remain solid and in auto, our orders were basically impacted by near-term customer backlog adjustment that related to a change in their scheduling. I want to highlight this does not impact demand, it's really just a change in one of our customers' processes. We continue to experience strong order trends both in Europe and in Asia in automotive. In industrial, orders grew 5% sequentially with growth in both our direct customer orders as well as those that go through our channel partners and distribution.
As I stated earlier, the industrial inventory correction is now behind us. And in Communications excluding SubCom, our orders grew 4% sequentially with a book-to-bill of 105, with improvements in both our appliances and data and device businesses. As Tom mentioned, in SubCom, it continues its momentum with the new Hawaiki program, and we will record that order as a booking in our third quarter. 
If you could please turn to Slide 5, I'll discuss Transportation Solutions results in the second quarter. Overall, sales grew 3% in the segment organically in the quarter, with growth across all of our businesses. Our auto sales growth in the quarter was driven by strength in China as well as in Europe. For fiscal 2016, we continue to expect global auto production to be up 2% to 2.5%, with growth in all regions, had strong growth in China. We remain confident that our auto business can grow ahead of auto production driven by electronic content growth as well as a rich pipeline of platform ramps from design wins that were generated over the past several years. 
In commercial transportation, sales grew 1% organically year-over-year, driven by the heavy truck sector in both China and Europe. North America heavy truck markets continue to remain weak along with continued weakness in global construction and ag markets. We're pleased that organic orders were up both year-over-year as well as sequentially as we continue to perform very well in this business in a tough economic backdrop. 
Turning to Sensors, we saw 2% organic growth as we did begin to feel the impact of weakness in the industrial markets in our Sensor business and just to highlight for you about 40% of our sensor sales go into the industrial markets. We do continue to see strong design momentum in long cycle transportation and industrial applications that we expect will drive future growth. 
From a margin viewpoint, adjusted operating margins in the segment were 19% and were in line with our expectations and were up sequentially. The decline year-over-year was driven by currency impacts as well as investments for growth. We anticipate adjusted operating margins for the second half to continue to improve and should be at similar levels as the second half of last year. 
If you could please turn to Slide 6 and I'll discuss the Industrial Solutions segment. Revenues in the segment declined 7% organically year-over-year in the second quarter. Geographically, we continue to see trends across our businesses that are consistent. Europe is stable and growing in many markets. North America continued to see weakness due to oil and gas as well as the supply-chain corrections that impacted us the past couple of quarters and China remains sluggish. 
We continue to be impacted by the oil and gas market which saw a 42% organic reduction in sales year-over-year and the decline in oil and gas drives half of the organic decline in the segment in the second quarter. Low oil and gas prices continue to have a derivative affect in other areas of the Industrial segment including factory equipment as well as in helicopter demand, which affects our Aerospace business. We have included the impacts in the auto results as well as in our guidance. 
In Aerospace and Defense, our Commercial Aerospace business grew year-over-year and this was more than offset by declines in the defense business due to the supply-chain affects that were occurring in the distribution channel. Our Energy business was down 2% organically, with declines in Asia and in Europe, partially offset by growth in U.S. As we look forward, we expect the Industrial segment to grow sequentially and we expect it to be essentially flat organically year-over-year in the third quarter, and we expect it to return to growth in the fourth quarter now that the inventory corrections are behind us. 
Adjusted operating margins were down year-over-year, driven primarily by declines in the higher-margin oil and gas business, but they were up sequentially. We do expect adjusted operating margins to continue to improve in the second half, benefiting from the increased volumes as well as the cost actions that we have initiated. 
If you could please turn to Page 7 to talk about the Communications segment. In the second quarter, the segment had revenue of $606 million, which was down 10% and 8% organically year-over-year. And it was slightly ahead of our expectations. Our SubCom business saw solid year-over-year growth driven by strong execution from multiple projects in force and as Tom mentioned earlier, the total value of programs, of course, is approximately $1 million. We now expect SubCom to grow approximately 20% year-over-year and this is an improvement versus our expectation 90 days ago. 
Our Data and Devices and Appliances business were impacted by distribution inventory corrections as I mentioned earlier, and we believe these are behind us that we had in the second half of the year. Additionally, Data and Devices growth is impacted by the product exits we've been highlighting all year as far as the repositioning effort and as discussed will impact our growth rate throughout this year. 
Adjusted operating margins in the segment declined 60 basis points year-over-year in line with our expectations and we do expect improvements to adjusted operating margins as we continue through the second half. Now let me turn it over to Mario, who will cover the financials"

Please turn to Slide 8 where I'll provide more details on earnings. Adjusted operating income of $440 million was in line with guidance and down 13% over year-over-year, due to currency impact investments in Transportation and the lower volume impacts that Terrence mentioned earlier. GAAP operating income was $535 million and included $4 million of acquisition-related charges and net restructuring and other credit of $99 million, primarily driven by a gain on the sale of our Circuit
Protection business. 
Adjusted EPS was $0.90 for the quarter, down $0.01 from the prior year with reduced volume from higher-margin profits and negative impacts from currency exchange rates, offsetting incremental benefits from share buyback. Excluding the $0.02 impacts from foreign currency, adjusted EPS was up $0.01 from the prior year. GAAP EPS was $1.06 for the quarter, driven by net restructuring and other credits of $0.17, primarily due to the Circuit Protection sale I just mentioned. 
We expect approximately $100 million of restructuring charges for the full year, a $15 million increase from prior guidance. Regarding tax, you should continue to obtain [indiscernible] long-term adjusted tax rate as approximately 23% to 24%. Due to the mix of profitability in different jurisdictions, we now expect our adjusted tax rate to be slightly lower this year. 
As we mentioned last quarter, Tyco International on behalf of TE entered into an agreement with the IRS to resolve all disputes related to the previously disclosed intercompany debt issues. During the quarter, we made net pre-separation tax payments to the IRS of approximately $140 million, to prevent further accrual of interest and penalties and hope to have this resolved and behind us in the near future. As you may know, the Treasury Department issued proposed tax regulations earlier this month. One proposal addresses the tax characterizations of certain intercompany financing arrangements by most multinational companies, who utilizes in the company financing for efficient capital deployment. We are in the process of analyzing this proposed regulations for any potential prospective impact on TE.
Turning to Slide 9, while we remain in a challenging environment, our performance was in line with our guidance and we expect improvement across our operating metrics in the second half. Our adjusted gross margin in the quarter was 32.6%, a decline from last year and mostly driven by lower volume in areas like oil and gas and distribution, which have higher margin than company average. Adjusted operating margins declined 150 basis points consistently with our gross margin performance. 
Total operating expenses were $523 million in the quarter, down 5% from the previous year, reflecting strong spending controls. We continue to tightly manage discretionary spending, while balancing our continuing investment into our Harsh businesses. 
Moving to cash flow and capital deployment. In the quarter, cash from continuing operations was $155 million and our free cash flow was $165 million, down from prior year levels due to timing of certain tax payments, but still up in the first half versus last year. We expect full year free cash flow to approximate net income. We continue to have a balanced capital allocation. In the second quarter, we returned $1.2 billion to our shareholders, including $1.1 billion in buybacks. In the quarter, we bought back 19 million shares, executing against our commitment of returning the proceed from the Broadband Networks divestiture. 
Over the past 18 months, we have returned approximately, $4.3 billion to our shareholders through buybacks and dividends. As Tom mentioned earlier, we expect to continue to take a balanced approach with our capital strategy going forward. We are also including a chart on adjusted EBITDA margins, which have explained the profitability performance of our businesses including acquisitions. 
Adjusted EBITDA margins in Q2 were 20% and show our margin resiliency despite lower sales levels. Continue to be pleased with the operating performance of our business, especially in light of the challenging macro backdrop. We've also added the balance sheet and cash flow summary in the appendix for additional details.
Now let me turn it back to Tom."
8106523,330367755,960072,"TE Connectivity Ltd., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 20, 2016",2016-04-20,"Earnings Calls","TE Connectivity plc","Executives","Thanks, Mario.

Before I get into Q3 guidance on Slide 10, let me provide some perspective on why we will return to growth in the second half. As you know, our first half was characterized by several year-over-year macro headwinds, unfavorable foreign exchange due to the significant strengthening of the dollar against most major currencies, the significant decline in year-over-year oil prices, which resulted in an over 40% decline in our higher-margin oil and gas business, overall industrial markets weakened leading to a supply chain corrections with OEMs and our channel partners, which we believe are now behind us and weakness across most China markets. 
In the first half, these factors impacted us significantly, and in the second half, most of these headwinds are reduced. As a result, we expect to return to revenue growth and strong double-digit adjusted EPS growth, driven by our Harsh strategy and the many levers in our operating model. 
Now I'll cover the Q3 outlook. We expect Q3 revenue of $3 billion to $3.2 billion, up 1% on an actual basis and flat organically and adjusted earnings per share of $1 to $1.06, up 14% year-over-year at the midpoint. We expect growth in Transportation and Industrial, which includes approximately, $60 million from the Creganna acquisition. This is offset by declines in Communications from the sale of the Circuit Protection business and the continuation of our strategy to exit certain product lines in Data and Devices. We do expect continued growth in our SubCom.
Now please turn to Slide 11. We are reiterating our full year guidance of $12.3 billion in revenue and $4 in adjusted EPS at the midpoint. On a full year basis, continued strong performance of our Transportation segment, the addition of the Creganna acquisition and growth in our SubCom business, more than offsetting the negative impact of exchange rates and softer industrial markets, especially oil and gas in China. As mentioned earlier, the full year and fourth quarter includes the 53rd week, which contributes approximately $200 million of revenue. 
Now this full year outlook includes an unusually high Q4 revenue and EPS level compared to Q3, so I'll walk you through that. As previously mentioned, this year's fourth quarter includes an extra week, which contributes approximately $200 million of revenue and approximately $0.10 per share in earnings. Excluding the 53rd week, revenue is increasing approximately $40 million from Q3 to Q4. But the way to think about this is the $240 million revenue will flow through to earnings at a 25% to 30% rate and this coupled with our typical productivity accounts for the significant sequential increase in EPS. 
Let me just wrap up with a few comments. As we mentioned earlier, the global economic environment continues to be sluggish. Despite this, we expect to generate another year of solid performance. Our focus on Harsh environments, driving TEOA through the organization, strong cash flow and a consistent return of capital policy continues to enable us to significantly strengthen our earnings leverage. $1 of revenue today generates about 40% more EPS than 5 years ago. This is serving us very well in a slow growth economy and will deliver accelerated earnings growth as the global economy improves. Now let's open it up for questions."

Normally, if you go back over to many years, we've had a few years where we're up slightly in the fourth quarter, a few years where we're down slightly. I mean, last year was a pretty unusual year because that is where China and the industrial -- industry correction began to occur. This year, the pattern coming into the fourth quarter is different. You have industrial markets improving. We have China, while not quite as much as we thought improving, for sure the auto market is improving as we expected. So that's really the difference in accounting for us, a slight sequential improvement as opposed to with what we could say over time has been kind of a back to the [Technical Difficulty] quarter. We also pick up, when you add $240 million in revenue sequentially a lot of leverage comes with that, and that's how you -- I think we'll for sure be in that 25% to 30%. The restructuring that has been going on through the year continues to slow in and aggregate, so there'll be a better benefit in Q4 than Q3 and then our normal productivity momentum, which marches through the year. So when you add all that up and that's how you get to what looks like a pretty significant hockey stick but when you feel the pack, you'd say, it's a small hockey stick."

So that's sort of a positive. I think secondly as we talked about, to the second part of your question, around what does it do, what's really nice about what Creganna does for us is really round out the portfolio. So just to remind everyone, it gets us about 90% of that integrated solution we'll have internally. I think the other thing that is very powerful, not only their position and their engineering, but where it's positioned in the world, really balances out our medical platforms and they fill it not only with manufacturing but with the engineering and fill the gap we had around Europe with their strong Irish presence, and then clearly bringing in 225 engineers that know that space, know that per patients, really doubled our engineering capability.

On China stimulus, I think that's a little bit more of a complicated question that when you look at it, we took an impact in our first quarter as China's overall production adjusted, so we talked about that. What we have seen is China coming back to about a 6% production environment a year post that, which is pretty much in line with GDP. I don't think we know whether the China stimulus accelerated some production or demand, but we do sort of view that China production long term will stay around GDP of China. So I don't think we're far off right now. I think we'll have to see as the stimulus works off, if there is any timing effects.

As you know, with the acquisition, with tremendous opportunity to move those margins up. And we are investing at a -- we are increasing our R&D investment at a faster rate and our sales growth in Sensors because the opportunity is so great. And customers absolutely like another strong resilient technology-rich company providing sensors into the Transportation market, and we are getting significant design wins and that requires engineers. It's been our plan from day 1 when we made the acquisition. And then in the Industrial Transportation business, which is the highest margin business in the group, we are -- I think we're navigating very well, maintaining our margins in a very -- almost really negative growth environment. Our growth is up because of our strong position in China and Europe which is offsetting North America. So we really within the segment, we manage those businesses separately based on the dynamics and the opportunity.

And I would expect in the next couple of months, we'll be making some announcements."

Do you, then in the future, recoup that weakness, because it seems like at the end of the day the supply chain has to all connect itself. And was that change, I assume led by the customer, and it is then going to be rolled out globally to them or already has it. It was centered around petroleum or diesel or electric or HV or how should we think about kind of what's going on there? And is this a rippling change to the industry? Then my second question or the follow-up would be on the intercompany debt. I know you mentioned that the past historical IRS settlement is in the works and you're accruing the interest for it and so on and so forth. Am I also correct to say that the new regulations also potentially end or do impact your current debt structure amongst the company? And if, if so, can you quantify or let us know about anything around that? Or was it all just simply backward stating and going forward there are no considerations?"

Number one, its in fact the customer, so when you look at programs and things like that, Jim, you can't really look at them. They change their process. So certainly, this was something that built up over time. It's why they did the process. They gave us very forward-looking orders that we recorded as orders and backlogs. Now they've moved to be a more current JIT with the way I would articulate it. That scheduling came out and they're going to hit us with orders more frequently. That does create a debooking in our world. It does not impact the programs that we won with that customer throughout the world. So when you look at it, it is something that is very process-centric. It does not impact programs and you can't get it into individual diesel versus electric versus combustion engine. It isn't there. And over time, we'll just get those orders in more frequently than having it scheduled back. Now, I'll let Mario turn over to the second one, the tax question."

And with our presence and our range of technology, it's becoming more and more important. So we have a significant share in the Connectivity business. But over the last 5 years, we believe we increased that 5 points, that is quite an accomplishment and it really is as these solutions get more complex and all you have to do is kind of look under the hood to see how different it is over the last 5 or 6 years. The connectivity and the sensing solutions are more complex. On the connectivity side, we continue to win at a rate faster than we have in the past, which is why I think we said a few times if you go back 5 years and we talked about a 2% production environment, we would have talked about a 3% -- 3% to 4% revenue to TE environment. Now we believe that's 5% or 6%. And that's really more market share than it is content. So I expect we'll continue to inch up our market share because of the range of capability we have and just for example, in hydroelectric vehicle, the difference in our design win rate in the last 3 years versus the first -- the prior 5 years is 2 to 3x. So as that market now continues to pick up we've -- with high content and we're extremely well positioned with all the leading platforms. So we feel good about that. On the Sensor side, we have one significant design ends with MEAS technology and our go-to-market and the strength we bring and the credibility we bring to auto customer. We're an auto supplier through and through and we're doing that for over 50 years. And -- so they like the technology and they trust us and we're winning important awards, they're not showing up in revenue yet, and that will be in the next couple of years, but that's why when we talked earlier incredibly enthusiastic and feel that actually ahead of the hypothesis we had with MEAS about our ability to bring their technology into the auto market, which is the best market for Sensors. Terrence, will you add anything to do that?"

Q2 was another quarter of good execution in what continues to remain a sluggish global economic environment. Adjusted earnings per share of $0.90,",529,"Thanks for joining us today, and please turn to Slide 3 and we will review the highlights from today's call. Q2 was another quarter of good execution in what continues to remain a sluggish global economic environment. Adjusted earnings per share of $0.90, was $0.02 better than the midpoint of our guidance on sales of $2.95 billion, which was slightly below the midpoint of the guidance. Strong operating performance across the company more than offset the continued market softness across our Industrial businesses.
Our adjusted earnings per share was down 1 penny versus the prior year with foreign exchange headwinds of approximately, $0.02. On a constant currency basis, adjusted EPS was up 1% year-over-year. Adjusted operating margins were 14.9% in line with our expectations, with adjusted EBITDA margins of approximately 20% in the quarter. For the full year, we are reiterating the midpoint of our guidance of $12.3 billion in revenue and $4 in adjusted earnings per share, representing an increase of 11% over prior year EPS. We expect to return to revenue growth in the second half and to generate double-digit EPS growth.
Our outlook for organic growth is 3%, down slightly compared to our guidance of 90 days ago. Our auto business remains solid, the industrial inventory correction is largely behind us, and SubCom continues to build momentum. Our recent acquisition of Creganna is now in our guidance as well. These positive factors are offsetting lower-than-expected growth in most industrial markets and slow growth in our non-transportation business in China.
Our EPS growth is benefiting from cost controls, the benefits of our share buyback and a bit of a lower tax rate. We have developed multiple levers to drive earnings growth in a slow economy. During the quarter, we returned $1.2 billion to shareholders, including $1.1 billion in share buybacks. We expect to continue to take a balanced approach with our capital strategy, returning approximately 2/3 of our free cash flow to shareholders over time with 1/3 of free cash being used for acquisitions. We generated $165 million of free cash flow in the quarter and $400 million in the first half of the year. We expect our normal strong second half cash generation to continue. We also continue to strengthen the company's Harsh environment portfolio.
In March, we completed the sale of our Circuit Protection business. Earlier this month, we completed the acquisition of Creganna, doubling the size of our medical business to about $500 million in revenue and establishing TE as a leading provider of solutions to the high growth minimally invasive medical market.
This morning, we also announced a small sensor acquisition, which will strengthen our portfolio of sensor technologies serving the Transportation markets. In our SubCom business, we continue to gain momentum with the recently announced award of a project called Hawaiki, which is a new trans-pacific cable system linking Australia and New Zealand with the mainland United States. This award will generate over $200 million in revenue over the life of the project. And this business has a backlog of awarded projects of $1 billion. I will now turn it over to Terrence Curtin, who will cover our performance in more detail."

Before we get into the segment updates, I want to provide brief insights into our order patterns, which will help provide a baseline for our results as well as the expectations. If you turn to Slide 4 please and th",1206,"Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. Before we get into the segment updates, I want to provide brief insights into our order patterns, which will help provide a baseline for our results as well as the expectations. If you turn to Slide 4 please and this shows order trends excluding our SubCom business. Overall, orders improved again sequentially and are above the low levels of approximately $2.6 billion that we experienced in the fourth quarter of 2015, and if you remember in the fourth quarter of last year is when we began to experience the supply chain impacts related to the slowing in China as well as the industrial markets. We have seen recovery in orders in both of these areas and feel that the supply chain correction effects have completed in our second quarter as we expected. Certainly, we're pleased with the recovery in the orders; however, the slope of the [ph] recovery is running behind original expectations in certain areas.
Specifically in China, we previously thought that orders would continue to accelerate through the rest of the year. While we believe the auto orders in China will continue to recover, we are now expecting orders outside of auto to sort of remain at the current levels that were experienced in the second quarter.
Let me now talk about the orders by segment. Overall, Transportation orders remain solid and in auto, our orders were negatively impacted by a near-term customer backlog adjustment that related to a change in their scheduling. I want to highlight this does not impact demand, it's really just a change in one of our customers' processes. We continue to experience strong order trends both in Europe and in Asia in automotive. In industrial, orders grew 5% sequentially with growth in both our direct customer orders as well as those that go through our channel partners in distribution.
As I stated earlier, the industrial inventory correction is now behind us. And in Communications excluding SubCom, our orders grew 4% sequentially with a book-to-bill of 1.05, with improvement in both our appliances and data and device businesses. As Tom mentioned, in SubCom, it continues its momentum with the new Hawaiki program, and we will record that order as a booking in our third quarter. 
If you could please turn to Slide 5, I'll discuss Transportation Solutions results in the second quarter. Overall, sales grew 3% in the segment organically in the quarter, with growth across all of our businesses. Our auto sales growth in the quarter was driven by strength in China as well as in Europe. For fiscal 2016, we continue to expect global auto production to be up 2% to 2.5%, with growth in all regions, and strong growth in China. We remain confident that our auto business can grow ahead of auto production driven by electronic content growth as well as a rich pipeline of platform ramps from design wins that were generated over the past several years. 
In commercial transportation, sales grew 1% organically year-over-year, driven by the heavy truck sector in both China and Europe. North America heavy truck markets continue to remain weak along with continued weakness in global construction and ag markets. We're pleased that organic orders were up both year-over-year as well as sequentially as we continue to perform very well in this business in a tough economic backdrop. 
Turning to Sensors, we saw 2% organic growth as we did begin to feel the impact of weakness in the industrial markets in our Sensor business and just to highlight for you about 40% of our sensor sales go into the industrial markets. We do continue to see strong design momentum in long cycle transportation and industrial applications that we expect will drive future growth. 
From a margin viewpoint, adjusted operating margins in the segment were 19% and were in line with our expectations and were up sequentially. The decline year-over-year was driven by currency impacts as well as investments for growth. We anticipate adjusted operating margins for the second half to continue to improve and should be at similar levels as the second half of last year. 
If you could please turn to Slide 6 and I'll discuss the Industrial Solutions segment. Revenue in the segment declined 7% organically year-over-year in the second quarter. Geographically, we continue to see trends across our businesses that are consistent. Europe is stable and growing in many markets. North America continued to see weakness due to oil and gas as well as the supply-chain corrections that impacted us the past couple of quarters and China remains sluggish. 
We continue to be impacted by the oil and gas market which saw a 42% organic reduction in sales year-over-year and the decline in oil and gas drives half of the organic decline in the segment in the second quarter. Low oil and gas prices continue to have a derivative affect in other areas of the Industrial segment including factory equipment as well as in helicopter demand, which affects our Aerospace business. We have included the impacts in our results as well as in our guidance. 
In Aerospace and Defense, our Commercial Aerospace business grew year-over-year and this was more than offset by declines in the defense business due to the supply-chain effects that were occurring in the distribution channel. Our Energy business was down 2% organically, with declines in Asia and in Europe, partially offset by growth in U.S. As we look forward, we expect the Industrial segment to grow sequentially and we expect it to be essentially flat organically year-over-year in the third quarter, and we expect it to return to growth in the fourth quarter now that the inventory corrections are behind us. 
Adjusted operating margins were down year-over-year, driven primarily by declines in the higher-margin oil and gas business, but they were up sequentially. We do expect adjusted operating margins to continue to improve in the second half, benefiting from the increased volumes as well as the cost actions that we have initiated. 
If you could please turn to Page 7 to talk about the Communications segment. In the second quarter, the segment had revenue of $606 million, which was down 10% and 8% organically year-over-year. And it was slightly ahead of our expectations. Our SubCom business saw solid year-over-year growth driven by strong execution from multiple projects in force and as Tom mentioned earlier, the total value of programs in force is approximately $1 million. We now expect SubCom to grow approximately 20% year-over-year and this is an improvement versus our expectations 90 days ago. 
Our Data and Devices and Appliances business were impacted by distribution inventory corrections as I mentioned earlier, and we believe these are behind us that we head into the second half of the year. Additionally, Data and Devices growth is impacted by the product exits we've been highlighting all year as part of the repositioning effort and as discussed will impact our growth rate throughout this year. 
Adjusted operating margins in the segment declined 60 basis points year-over-year in line with our expectations and we do expect improvements to adjusted operating margins as we continue through the second half. Now let me turn it over to Mario, who will cover the financials"

Please turn to Slide 8 where I'll provide more details on earnings. Adjusted operating income of $440 million was in line with guidance and down 13% over year-over-year, due to currency impacts, investments in Transportation and the lower volume impacts that Terrence mentioned earlier. GAAP operating income was $535 million and included $4 million of acquisition-related charges and net restructuring and other credit of $99 million, primarily driven by a gain on the sale of our Circuit
Protection business. 
Adjusted EPS was $0.90 for the quarter, down $0.01 from the prior year with reduced volume from higher-margin products and negative impacts from currency exchange rates, offsetting incremental benefits from share buyback. Excluding the $0.02 impacts from foreign currency, adjusted EPS was up $0.01 from the prior year. GAAP EPS was $1.06 for the quarter, driven by net restructuring and other credits of $0.17, primarily due to the Circuit Protection sale I just mentioned. 
We expect approximately $100 million of restructuring charges for the full year, a $15 million increase from prior guidance. Regarding tax, you should continue to think of TE's long-term adjusted tax rate as approximately 23% to 24%. Due to the mix of profitability in different jurisdictions, we now expect our adjusted tax rate to be slightly lower this year. 
As we mentioned last quarter, Tyco International on behalf of TE entered into an agreement with the IRS to resolve all disputes related to the previously disclosed intercompany debt issues. During the quarter, we made net pre-separation tax payments to the IRS of approximately $140 million, to prevent further accrual of interest and penalties and hope to have this settled and behind us in the near future. As you may know, the Treasury Department issued proposed tax regulations earlier this month. One proposal addresses the tax characterizations of certain intercompany financing arrangements. Like most multinational companies, TE utilizes intercompany financing for efficient capital deployment. We are in the process of analyzing these proposed regulations for any potential prospective impact on TE.
Turning to Slide 9. While we remain in a challenging environment, our performance was in line with our guidance and we expect improvement across our operating metrics in the second half. Our adjusted gross margin in the quarter was 32.6%, a decline from last year and mostly driven by lower volume in areas like oil and gas and distribution, which have higher margin than company average. Adjusted operating margins declined 150 basis points, consistent with our gross margin performance. 
Total operating expenses were $523 million in the quarter, down 5% from the previous year, reflecting strong spending controls. We continue to tightly manage discretionary spending, while balancing our continuing investment into our Harsh businesses. 
Moving to cash flow and capital deployment. In the quarter, cash from continuing operations was $155 million and our free cash flow was $165 million, down from prior year levels due to timing of certain tax payments, but still up in the first half versus last year. We expect full year free cash flow to approximate net income. We continue to have a balanced capital allocation. In the second quarter, we returned $1.2 billion to our shareholders, including $1.1 billion in buybacks. In the quarter, we bought back 19 million shares, executing against our commitment of returning the proceeds from the Broadband Networks divestiture. 
Over the past 18 months, we have returned approximately, $4.3 billion to our shareholders through buybacks and dividends. As Tom mentioned earlier, we expect to continue to take a balanced approach with our capital strategy going forward. We are also including a chart on adjusted EBITDA margins, which helps explain the profitability performance of our businesses, including acquisitions. 
Adjusted EBITDA margins in Q2 were 20% and show our margin resiliency despite lower sales levels. Continue to be pleased with the operating performance of our business, especially in light of the challenging macro backdrop. We've also added the balance sheet and cash flow summary in the appendix for additional details.
Now let me turn it back to Tom."
8106523,330367755,960182,"TE Connectivity Ltd., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 20, 2016",2016-04-20,"Earnings Calls","TE Connectivity plc","Executives","Thanks, Mario. Before I get into Q3 guidance on Slide 10, let me provide some perspective on why we will return to growth in the second half.

Before I get into Q3 guidance on Slide 10, let me provide some perspective on why we will return to growth in the second half. As you know, our first half was characterized by several year-over-year macro headwinds, unfavorable foreign exchange due to the significant strengthening of the dollar against most major currencies, the significant decline in year-over-year oil prices, which resulted in an over 40% decline in our higher-margin oil and gas business, overall industrial markets weakened, leading to a supply chain corrections with OEMs and our channel partners, which we believe are now behind us and weakness across most China markets. 
In the first half, these factors impacted us significantly, and in the second half, most of these headwinds are reduced. As a result, we expect to return to revenue growth and strong double-digit adjusted EPS growth, driven by our Harsh strategy and the many levers in our operating model. 
Now I'll cover the Q3 outlook. We expect Q3 revenue of $3 billion to $3.2 billion, up 1% on an actual basis and flat organically and adjusted earnings per share of $1 to $1.06, up 14% year-over-year at the midpoint. We expect growth in Transportation and Industrial, which includes approximately, $60 million from the Creganna acquisition. This is offset by declines in Communications from the sale of the Circuit Protection business and the continuation of our strategy to exit certain product lines in Data and Devices. We do expect continued growth in our SubCom business.
Now please turn to Slide 11. We are reiterating our full year guidance of $12.3 billion in revenue and $4 in adjusted EPS at the midpoint. On a full year basis, continued strong performance of our Transportation segment, the addition of the Creganna acquisition and growth in our SubCom business, more than offsetting the negative impact of exchange rates and softer industrial markets, especially in oil and gas in China. As mentioned earlier, the full year and fourth quarter includes the 53rd week, which contributes approximately $200 million of revenue. 
Now this full year outlook includes an unusually high Q4 revenue and EPS level compared to Q3, so I'll walk you through that. As previously mentioned, this year's fourth quarter includes an extra week, which contributes approximately $200 million of revenue and approximately $0.10 per share in earnings. Excluding the 53rd week, revenue is increasing approximately $40 million from Q3 to Q4. But the way to think about this is the $240 million revenue will flow through to earnings at a 25% to 30% rate and this coupled with our typical productivity accounts for the significant sequential increase in EPS. 
Let me just wrap up with a few comments. As we mentioned earlier, the global economic environment continues to be sluggish. Despite this, we expect to generate another year of solid performance. Our focus on Harsh environments, driving TEOA through the organization, strong cash flow and a consistent return of capital policy continues to enable us to significantly strengthen our earnings leverage. $1 of revenue today generates about 40% more EPS than 5 years ago. This is serving us very well in a slow growth economy and will deliver accelerated earnings growth as the global economy improves. Now let's open it up for questions."

Normally, if you go back over many years, we've had a few years where we're up slightly in the fourth quarter, a few years where we're down slightly. I mean, last year was a pretty unusual year because that is where China and the industrial -- industry correction began to occur. This year, the pattern coming into the fourth quarter is different. You have industrial markets improving. We have China, while not quite as much as we thought improving, for sure the auto market is improving as we expected. So that's really the difference accounting for a slight sequential improvement as opposed to with what we could say over time has been kind of a back to the [Technical Difficulty] quarter. We also pick up, when you add $240 million in revenue sequentially a lot of leverage comes with that, and that's how you -- I think we'll for sure be in that 25% to 30%. The restructuring that has been going on through the year continues to flow in and aggregate, so there'll be a better benefit in Q4 than Q3 and then our normal productivity momentum, which marches through the year. So when you add all that up,  that's how you get to what looks like a pretty significant hockey stick but when you peel it back, I'd say, it's a small hockey stick."

I don't think we know whether the China stimulus accelerated some production or demand, but we do sort of view that China production long term will stay around GDP of China. So I don't think we're far off right now. I think we'll have to see as the stimulus works off, if there is any timing effects. But right now, we feel pretty good as production has restimulated post the first quarter being very slow."

Seeing POS in line, with increasing demand and reflecting inventory levels and the channel back in line. So those are all positive indicators. And if you recall at this time, last year, those indicators were starting to -- they were raising caution flags. They were going the other way. So that's what has given us some  optimism. Again, we're not expecting a boom from Q3 to Q4. I think it's just where the cycle is this time versus prior years. And of course, got to  always keep reminding you of that extra week.

The 3 pieces of our Transportation segment, Automotive, as Terrence said, very strong business. We expect to grow mid- to high single digits on 2% to 3% -- 2.5% production growth margins there, remain strong. Sensors is below the Transportation averages. As you know, with the acquisition, with tremendous opportunity to move those margins up. And we are investing at a -- we are increasing our R&D investment at a faster rate than our sales growth in Sensors because the opportunity is so great. And customers absolutely like another strong resilient technology-rich company providing sensors into the Transportation market, and we are getting significant design-ins, and that requires engineers. It's been our plan from day 1 when we made the acquisition. And then in the Industrial Transportation business, which is the highest margin business in the group, we are -- I think we're navigating very well, maintaining our margins in a very -- almost really negative growth environment. Our growth is up because of our strong position in China and Europe which is offsetting North America. So we really within the segment, we manage those businesses separately based on the dynamics and the opportunity. And as Terrence said in his comments, we're pretty confident that you'll see the margins improve again sequentially. They went up 40 or 50 basis points Q1 to Q2. We expect that march to continue in the second half of the year with a little bit of volume growth over the first half of the year because there's a lot of operating leverage in this business."

Now they've moved to be a more current JIT was the way I would articulate it. That as scheduling came out and they're going to hit us with orders more frequently. That does create a debooking in our world. It does not impact the programs that we won with that customer throughout the world. So when you look at it, it is something that is very process-centric. It does not impact programs and you can't get it into individual diesel versus electric versus combustion engine. It isn't there.

And with our presence and our range of technology, it's becoming more and more important. So we have a significant share in the Connectivity business. But over the last 5 years, we believe we increased that 5 points, that is quite an accomplishment and it really is as these solutions get more complex and all you have to do is kind of look under the hood to see how different it is over the last 5 or 6 years. The connectivity and the sensing solutions are more complex. On the connectivity side, we continue to win at a rate faster than we have in the past, which is why I think we said a few times if you go back 5 years and we talked about a 2% production environment, we would have talked about a 3% -- 3% to 4% revenue to TE environment. Now we believe that's 5% or 6%. And that's just  really more market share than it is content. So I expect we'll continue to inch up our market share because of the range of capability we have and just for example, hybrid electric vehicles, the difference in our design-in rate in the last 3 years versus the first -- the prior 5 years is 2 to 3x. So as that market now continues to pick up we have -- with high content and we're extremely well positioned with all the leading platforms. So we feel good about that. On the Sensor side, we have won significant design-ins with MEAS technology and our go-to-market and the strength we bring and the credibility we bring to an auto customer. We're an auto supplier through and through and we've been doing that for over 50 years. And -- so they like the technology and they trust us and we're winning important awards, they're not showing up in revenue yet, and that will be in the next couple of years, but that's why when we talked earlier incredibly enthusiastic and feel that actually ahead of the hypothesis we had with MEAS about our ability to bring their technology into the auto market, which is the best market for Sensors.

So it's not only our order patterns and as we talk to our channel partners, they have also seen their book-to-bill go back above 1 as well as positive POS. So it's a combination of those factors that we see."

Q2 was another quarter of good execution in what continues to remain a sluggish global economic environment. Adjusted earnings per share of $0.90,",529,"Thanks for joining us today, and please turn to Slide 3 and we will review the highlights from today's call. Q2 was another quarter of good execution in what continues to remain a sluggish global economic environment. Adjusted earnings per share of $0.90, was $0.02 better than the midpoint of our guidance on sales of $2.95 billion, which was slightly below the midpoint of the guidance. Strong operating performance across the company more than offset the continued market softness across our Industrial businesses.
Our adjusted earnings per share was down 1 penny versus the prior year with foreign exchange headwinds of approximately, $0.02. On a constant currency basis, adjusted EPS was up 1% year-over-year. Adjusted operating margins were 14.9% in line with our expectations, with adjusted EBITDA margins of approximately 20% in the quarter. For the full year, we are reiterating the midpoint of our guidance of $12.3 billion in revenue and $4 in adjusted earnings per share, representing an increase of 11% over prior year EPS. We expect to return to revenue growth in the second half and to generate double-digit EPS growth.
Our outlook for organic growth is 3%, down slightly compared to our guidance of 90 days ago. Our auto business remains solid, the industrial inventory correction is largely behind us, and SubCom continues to build momentum. Our recent acquisition of Creganna is now in our guidance as well. These positive factors are offsetting lower-than-expected growth in most industrial markets and slow growth in our non-transportation business in China.
Our EPS growth is benefiting from cost controls, the benefits of our share buyback and a bit of a lower tax rate. We have developed multiple levers to drive earnings growth in a slow economy. During the quarter, we returned $1.2 billion to shareholders, including $1.1 billion in share buybacks. We expect to continue to take a balanced approach with our capital strategy, returning approximately 2/3 of our free cash flow to shareholders over time with 1/3 of free cash being used for acquisitions. We generated $165 million of free cash flow in the quarter and $400 million in the first half of the year. We expect our normal strong second half cash generation to continue. We also continue to strengthen the company's Harsh environment portfolio.
In March, we completed the sale of our Circuit Protection business. Earlier this month, we completed the acquisition of Creganna, doubling the size of our medical business to about $500 million in revenue and establishing TE as a leading provider of solutions to the high growth minimally invasive medical market.
This morning, we also announced a small sensor acquisition, which will strengthen our portfolio of sensor technologies serving the Transportation markets. In our SubCom business, we continue to gain momentum with the recently announced award of a project called Hawaiki, which is a new trans-pacific cable system linking Australia and New Zealand with the mainland United States. This award will generate over $200 million in revenue over the life of the project. And this business has a backlog of awarded projects of $1 billion. I will now turn it over to Terrence Curtin, who will cover our performance in more detail."

Before we get into the segment updates, I want to provide brief insights into our order patterns, which will help provide a baseline for our results as well as the expectations. If you turn to Slide 4 please and th",1206,"Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. Before we get into the segment updates, I want to provide brief insights into our order patterns, which will help provide a baseline for our results as well as the expectations. If you turn to Slide 4 please and this shows order trends excluding our SubCom business. Overall, orders improved again sequentially and are above the low levels of approximately $2.6 billion that we experienced in the fourth quarter of 2015, and if you remember in the fourth quarter of last year is when we began to experience the supply chain impacts related to the slowing in China as well as the industrial markets. We have seen recovery in orders in both of these areas and feel that the supply chain correction effects have completed in our second quarter as we expected. Certainly, we're pleased with the recovery in the orders; however, the slope of the [ph] recovery is running behind original expectations in certain areas.
Specifically in China, we previously thought that orders would continue to accelerate through the rest of the year. While we believe the auto orders in China will continue to recover, we are now expecting orders outside of auto to sort of remain at the current levels that were experienced in the second quarter.
Let me now talk about the orders by segment. Overall, Transportation orders remain solid and in auto, our orders were negatively impacted by a near-term customer backlog adjustment that related to a change in their scheduling. I want to highlight this does not impact demand, it's really just a change in one of our customers' processes. We continue to experience strong order trends both in Europe and in Asia in automotive. In industrial, orders grew 5% sequentially with growth in both our direct customer orders as well as those that go through our channel partners in distribution.
As I stated earlier, the industrial inventory correction is now behind us. And in Communications excluding SubCom, our orders grew 4% sequentially with a book-to-bill of 1.05, with improvement in both our appliances and data and device businesses. As Tom mentioned, in SubCom, it continues its momentum with the new Hawaiki program, and we will record that order as a booking in our third quarter. 
If you could please turn to Slide 5, I'll discuss Transportation Solutions results in the second quarter. Overall, sales grew 3% in the segment organically in the quarter, with growth across all of our businesses. Our auto sales growth in the quarter was driven by strength in China as well as in Europe. For fiscal 2016, we continue to expect global auto production to be up 2% to 2.5%, with growth in all regions, and strong growth in China. We remain confident that our auto business can grow ahead of auto production driven by electronic content growth as well as a rich pipeline of platform ramps from design wins that were generated over the past several years. 
In commercial transportation, sales grew 1% organically year-over-year, driven by the heavy truck sector in both China and Europe. North America heavy truck markets continue to remain weak along with continued weakness in global construction and ag markets. We're pleased that organic orders were up both year-over-year as well as sequentially as we continue to perform very well in this business in a tough economic backdrop. 
Turning to Sensors, we saw 2% organic growth as we did begin to feel the impact of weakness in the industrial markets in our Sensor business and just to highlight for you about 40% of our sensor sales go into the industrial markets. We do continue to see strong design momentum in long cycle transportation and industrial applications that we expect will drive future growth. 
From a margin viewpoint, adjusted operating margins in the segment were 19% and were in line with our expectations and were up sequentially. The decline year-over-year was driven by currency impacts as well as investments for growth. We anticipate adjusted operating margins for the second half to continue to improve and should be at similar levels as the second half of last year. 
If you could please turn to Slide 6 and I'll discuss the Industrial Solutions segment. Revenue in the segment declined 7% organically year-over-year in the second quarter. Geographically, we continue to see trends across our businesses that are consistent. Europe is stable and growing in many markets. North America continued to see weakness due to oil and gas as well as the supply-chain corrections that impacted us the past couple of quarters and China remains sluggish. 
We continue to be impacted by the oil and gas market which saw a 42% organic reduction in sales year-over-year and the decline in oil and gas drives half of the organic decline in the segment in the second quarter. Low oil and gas prices continue to have a derivative affect in other areas of the Industrial segment including factory equipment as well as in helicopter demand, which affects our Aerospace business. We have included the impacts in our results as well as in our guidance. 
In Aerospace and Defense, our Commercial Aerospace business grew year-over-year and this was more than offset by declines in the defense business due to the supply-chain effects that were occurring in the distribution channel. Our Energy business was down 2% organically, with declines in Asia and in Europe, partially offset by growth in U.S. As we look forward, we expect the Industrial segment to grow sequentially and we expect it to be essentially flat organically year-over-year in the third quarter, and we expect it to return to growth in the fourth quarter now that the inventory corrections are behind us. 
Adjusted operating margins were down year-over-year, driven primarily by declines in the higher-margin oil and gas business, but they were up sequentially. We do expect adjusted operating margins to continue to improve in the second half, benefiting from the increased volumes as well as the cost actions that we have initiated. 
If you could please turn to Page 7 to talk about the Communications segment. In the second quarter, the segment had revenue of $606 million, which was down 10% and 8% organically year-over-year. And it was slightly ahead of our expectations. Our SubCom business saw solid year-over-year growth driven by strong execution from multiple projects in force and as Tom mentioned earlier, the total value of programs in force is approximately $1 million. We now expect SubCom to grow approximately 20% year-over-year and this is an improvement versus our expectations 90 days ago. 
Our Data and Devices and Appliances business were impacted by distribution inventory corrections as I mentioned earlier, and we believe these are behind us that we head into the second half of the year. Additionally, Data and Devices growth is impacted by the product exits we've been highlighting all year as part of the repositioning effort and as discussed will impact our growth rate throughout this year. 
Adjusted operating margins in the segment declined 60 basis points year-over-year in line with our expectations and we do expect improvements to adjusted operating margins as we continue through the second half. Now let me turn it over to Mario, who will cover the financials"

Please turn to Slide 8 where I'll provide more details on earnings. Adjusted operating income of $440 million was in line with guidance and down 13% over year-over-year, due to currency impacts, investments in Transportation and the lower volume impacts that Terrence mentioned earlier. GAAP operating income was $535 million and included $4 million of acquisition-related charges and net restructuring and other credit of $99 million, primarily driven by a gain on the sale of our Circuit
Protection business. 
Adjusted EPS was $0.90 for the quarter, down $0.01 from the prior year with reduced volume from higher-margin products and negative impacts from currency exchange rates, offsetting incremental benefits from share buyback. Excluding the $0.02 impacts from foreign currency, adjusted EPS was up $0.01 from the prior year. GAAP EPS was $1.06 for the quarter, driven by net restructuring and other credits of $0.17, primarily due to the Circuit Protection sale I just mentioned. 
We expect approximately $100 million of restructuring charges for the full year, a $15 million increase from prior guidance. Regarding tax, you should continue to think of TE's long-term adjusted tax rate as approximately 23% to 24%. Due to the mix of profitability in different jurisdictions, we now expect our adjusted tax rate to be slightly lower this year. 
As we mentioned last quarter, Tyco International on behalf of TE entered into an agreement with the IRS to resolve all disputes related to the previously disclosed intercompany debt issues. During the quarter, we made net pre-separation tax payments to the IRS of approximately $140 million, to prevent further accrual of interest and penalties and hope to have this settled and behind us in the near future. As you may know, the Treasury Department issued proposed tax regulations earlier this month. One proposal addresses the tax characterizations of certain intercompany financing arrangements. Like most multinational companies, TE utilizes intercompany financing for efficient capital deployment. We are in the process of analyzing these proposed regulations for any potential prospective impact on TE.
Turning to Slide 9. While we remain in a challenging environment, our performance was in line with our guidance and we expect improvement across our operating metrics in the second half. Our adjusted gross margin in the quarter was 32.6%, a decline from last year and mostly driven by lower volume in areas like oil and gas and distribution, which have higher margin than company average. Adjusted operating margins declined 150 basis points, consistent with our gross margin performance. 
Total operating expenses were $523 million in the quarter, down 5% from the previous year, reflecting strong spending controls. We continue to tightly manage discretionary spending, while balancing our continuing investment into our Harsh businesses. 
Moving to cash flow and capital deployment. In the quarter, cash from continuing operations was $155 million and our free cash flow was $165 million, down from prior year levels due to timing of certain tax payments, but still up in the first half versus last year. We expect full year free cash flow to approximate net income. We continue to have a balanced capital allocation. In the second quarter, we returned $1.2 billion to our shareholders, including $1.1 billion in buybacks. In the quarter, we bought back 19 million shares, executing against our commitment of returning the proceeds from the Broadband Networks divestiture. 
Over the past 18 months, we have returned approximately, $4.3 billion to our shareholders through buybacks and dividends. As Tom mentioned earlier, we expect to continue to take a balanced approach with our capital strategy going forward. We are also including a chart on adjusted EBITDA margins, which helps explain the profitability performance of our businesses, including acquisitions. 
Adjusted EBITDA margins in Q2 were 20% and show our margin resiliency despite lower sales levels. Continue to be pleased with the operating performance of our business, especially in light of the challenging macro backdrop. We've also added the balance sheet and cash flow summary in the appendix for additional details.
Now let me turn it back to Tom."
8106523,330367755,960772,"TE Connectivity Ltd., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 20, 2016",2016-04-20,"Earnings Calls","TE Connectivity plc","Executives","Thanks, Mario. Before I get into Q3 guidance on Slide 10, let me provide some perspective on why we will return to growth in the second half.

Before I get into Q3 guidance on Slide 10, let me provide some perspective on why we will return to growth in the second half. As you know, our first half was characterized by several year-over-year macro headwinds, unfavorable foreign exchange due to the significant strengthening of the dollar against most major currencies, the significant decline in year-over-year oil prices, which resulted in an over 40% decline in our higher-margin oil and gas business, overall industrial markets weakened, leading to a supply chain corrections with OEMs and our channel partners, which we believe are now behind us and weakness across most China markets. 
In the first half, these factors impacted us significantly, and in the second half, most of these headwinds are reduced. As a result, we expect to return to revenue growth and strong double-digit adjusted EPS growth, driven by our Harsh strategy and the many levers in our operating model. 
Now I'll cover the Q3 outlook. We expect Q3 revenue of $3 billion to $3.2 billion, up 1% on an actual basis and flat organically and adjusted earnings per share of $1 to $1.06, up 14% year-over-year at the midpoint. We expect growth in Transportation and Industrial, which includes approximately, $60 million from the Creganna acquisition. This is offset by declines in Communications from the sale of the Circuit Protection business and the continuation of our strategy to exit certain product lines in Data and Devices. We do expect continued growth in our SubCom business.
Now please turn to Slide 11. We are reiterating our full year guidance of $12.3 billion in revenue and $4 in adjusted EPS at the midpoint. On a full year basis, continued strong performance of our Transportation segment, the addition of the Creganna acquisition and growth in our SubCom business, more than offsetting the negative impact of exchange rates and softer industrial markets, especially in oil and gas in China. As mentioned earlier, the full year and fourth quarter includes the 53rd week, which contributes approximately $200 million of revenue. 
Now this full year outlook includes an unusually high Q4 revenue and EPS level compared to Q3, so I'll walk you through that. As previously mentioned, this year's fourth quarter includes an extra week, which contributes approximately $200 million of revenue and approximately $0.10 per share in earnings. Excluding the 53rd week, revenue is increasing approximately $40 million from Q3 to Q4. But the way to think about this is the $240 million revenue will flow through to earnings at a 25% to 30% rate and this coupled with our typical productivity accounts for the significant sequential increase in EPS. 
Let me just wrap up with a few comments. As we mentioned earlier, the global economic environment continues to be sluggish. Despite this, we expect to generate another year of solid performance. Our focus on Harsh environments, driving TEOA through the organization, strong cash flow and a consistent return of capital policy continues to enable us to significantly strengthen our earnings leverage. $1 of revenue today generates about 40% more EPS than 5 years ago. This is serving us very well in a slow growth economy and will deliver accelerated earnings growth as the global economy improves. Now let's open it up for questions."

Normally, if you go back over many years, we've had a few years where we're up slightly in the fourth quarter, a few years where we're down slightly. I mean, last year was a pretty unusual year because that is where China and the industrial -- industry correction began to occur. This year, the pattern coming into the fourth quarter is different. You have industrial markets improving. We have China, while not quite as much as we thought improving, for sure the auto market is improving as we expected. So that's really the difference accounting for a slight sequential improvement as opposed to with what we could say over time has been kind of a back to the [Technical Difficulty] quarter. We also pick up, when you add $240 million in revenue sequentially a lot of leverage comes with that, and that's how you -- I think we'll for sure be in that 25% to 30%. The restructuring that has been going on through the year continues to flow in and aggregate, so there'll be a better benefit in Q4 than Q3 and then our normal productivity momentum, which marches through the year. So when you add all that up, that's how you get to what looks like a pretty significant hockey stick but when you peel it back, I'd say, it's a small hockey stick."

On China stimulus, I think that's a little bit more of a complicated question that when you look at it, we did get an act [ph] in our first quarter as China's overall production adjusted, so we talked about that. What we have seen is China coming back to about a 6% production environment a year post that, which is pretty much in line with GDP. I don't think we know whether the China stimulus accelerated some production or demand, but we do sort of view that China production long term will stay around GDP of China.

The 3 pieces of our Transportation segment, Automotive, as Terrence said, very strong business. We expect to grow mid- to high single digits on 2% to 3% -- 2.5% production growth margins there, remain strong. Sensors is below the Transportation averages. As you know, with the acquisition, with tremendous opportunity to move those margins up. And we are investing at a -- we are increasing our R&D investment at a faster rate than our sales growth in Sensors because the opportunity is so great. And customers absolutely like another strong resilient technology-rich company providing sensors into the Transportation market, and we are getting significant design-ins, and that requires engineers. It's been our plan from day 1 when we made the acquisition. And then in the Industrial Transportation business, which is the highest margin business in the group, we are -- I think we're navigating very well, maintaining our margins in a very -- almost really negative growth environment. Our growth is up because of our strong position in China and Europe which is offsetting North America. So we really within the segment, we manage those businesses separately based on the dynamics and the opportunity. And as Terrence said in his comments, we're pretty confident that you'll see the margins improve again sequentially. They went up 40 or 50 basis points Q1 to Q2. We expect that march to continue in the second half of the year with a little bit of volume growth over the first half of the year because there's a lot of operating leverage in this business."

And -- so yes, we have decided not to really change our strategy there given that we have all these other levers to drive the earnings growth that we set up 6 months ago, $3 billion, $12 billion, $4 billion in revenue and $4 in EPS.

Number one, it's at a customer, so when you look at programs and things like that, Jim, you can't really look at them. They change their process. So certainly, this was something that built up over time. It's why they did the process. They gave us very forward-looking orders that we recorded as orders and backlogs. Now they've moved to be a more current JIT was the way I would articulate it. That as scheduling came out and they're going to hit us with orders more frequently. That does create a debooking in our world. It does not impact the programs that we won with that customer throughout the world. So when you look at it, it is something that is very process-centric. It does not impact programs and you can't get it into individual diesel versus electric versus combustion engine. It isn't there.

And with our presence and our range of technology, it's becoming more and more important. So we have a significant share in the Connectivity business. But over the last 5 years, we believe we increased that 5 points, that is quite an accomplishment and it really is as these solutions get more complex and all you have to do is kind of look under the hood to see how different it is over the last 5 or 6 years. The connectivity and the sensing solutions are more complex. On the connectivity side, we continue to win at a rate faster than we have in the past, which is why I think we said a few times if you go back 5 years and we talked about a 2% production environment, we would have talked about a 3% -- 3% to 4% revenue to TE environment. Now we believe that's 5% or 6%. And that's just really more market share than it is content. So I expect we'll continue to inch up our market share because of the range of capability we have and just for example, hybrid electric vehicles, the difference in our design-in rate in the last 3 years versus the first -- the prior 5 years is 2 to 3x. So as that market now continues to pick up we have -- with high content and we're extremely well positioned with all the leading platforms. So we feel good about that. On the Sensor side, we have won significant design-ins with MEAS technology and our go-to-market and the strength we bring and the credibility we bring to an auto customer. We're an auto supplier through and through and we've been doing that for over 50 years. And -- so they like the technology and they trust us and we're winning important awards, they're not showing up in revenue yet, and that will be in the next couple of years, but that's why when we talked earlier incredibly enthusiastic and feel that actually ahead of the hypothesis we had with MEAS about our ability to bring their technology into the auto market, which is the best market for Sensors.

Please turn to Slide 3, and we will cover the highlights from today's call. Q3 was another quarter of solid execution in what continues to remain a challenging global economic environment. Our adjusted EPS was $1.08, represe",514,"Thanks for joining us today. Please turn to Slide 3, and we will cover the highlights from today's call. 
Q3 was another quarter of solid execution in what continues to remain a challenging global economic environment. Our adjusted EPS was $1.08, represents a new company record, and was up 20% on a year-over-year basis. 
Sales of $3.12 billion were essentially flat with last year and in line with our guidance midpoint.  Sales and orders were up sequentially, with sales up 6%; and orders up 7%, excluding SubCom.
Adjusted operating margins were strong at 16%, with adjusted EBITDA margins of 21% in the quarter. 
For the fourth quarter, we expect the midpoint of our revenue and earnings per share to be $3 --  $3.35 billion and $1.20 respectively. Note that these features include the benefit of approximately $200 million in revenue and $0.10 in EPS from the extra week in Q4 that we've been communicating all year.  If we exclude the extra week, we would expect revenue to be up about 3% organically year-over-year and adjusted EPS growth to be 22% year-over-year.
Also, if you exclude the extra week, we expect our transportation business to have the best growth quarter in Q4 and our industrial segment to grow slightly for the first time this year.
For the full year, we are reiterating our adjusted EPS midpoint of $4, representing an 11% increase over the prior year.
Continued growth in most of our businesses, cost controls, share buybacks and a lower tax rates are more than offsetting the first of currency headwinds and supply chain correction.
This has enabled us to reiterate our original guidance that we provided in October 2015, delivering double-digit earnings growth in a slower economy.
As I mentioned earlier, we expect to return year-over-year organic growth in Q4, excluding the extra week.
During the quarter, we continue to strengthen our large portfolio through acquisition. In April, we announced the acquisition of Jaquet, which bolstered our portfolio of sensors for the auto market.
This morning, we announced an agreement to acquire the Intercontec Group, a German-based manufacturer of high-quality industrial metric circular connectors. This acquisition strengthens the position of harsh connectivity applications for factory automation and will be reported in the industrial segment.
In addition, we're pleased to say our recent acquisition of Creganna is performing very well and ahead of expectations and positions TE as a leader in the high-growth, minimally invasive market.
We had a very strong cash generation quarter, with free cash flow of almost $600 million. This brings our year-to-date free cash flow to just about $1 billion.
During the quarter, we returned approximately $230 million to shareholders, including about $100 million in share buybacks. Year-to-date, we have returned nearly $2.9 billion to shareholders, including $2.5 billion in share buybacks.
We expect to continue to take a balanced approach with our capital strategy, returning approximately 2/3 of our free cash flow to shareholders over time, with 1/3 free cash flow being through acquisition. 
I'll now turn it over to Terrence Curtin, who will cover our performance in more detail."

And this shows ou",1134,"Thanks, Tom and good morning, everyone. Before we get to the segment updates, I'd like to cover our orders for the quarter, which will help provide the foundation for our results and expectations.
So if you could please turn to Slide 4. And this shows our order trends, excluding our SubCom business. 
Overall, orders were essentially flat year-over-year and improved again sequentially by 7%. As the supply chain correction that impact us from the first half are behind us. Our book-to-bill was 1.01, and we also had slight growth year-over-year, reflecting the recovery and stability of our end markets.
The transportation, orders remain solid with 7% sequential growth, industrial orders grew 15% sequentially. And I do want to highlight about 60% of the industrial order growth was due to the acquisition of Creganna, with remainder of the growth made growth based across our industrial businesses.
In industrial, we saw order growth in each region as the inventory supply chain is now back in line, and we expect sales growth in the second half over the first half across each of our Industrial business.
In communications, excluding the impact of the sale of our Circuit Protection business last quarter, we saw sequential growth of 3%, driven by both our appliances and data and devices business. 
Now to talk to SubCom, that business continues its strong momentum. We were recently named as the supplier of the New Marias [ph] Transatlantic Program and with this award, we have approximately $1 billion of programs in force in our SubCom business.
Please turn to Slide 5 so I can discuss our transportation solutions segment results.
Segment sales grew 2% organically in the quarter, with growth in auto and in Commercial Transportation, offset by weakness in sensors that we highlighted last quarter.
Our auto sales growth in the quarter was in line with our expectations, and growth was driven by strength in Europe and China, partially offset by the year-over-year decline in North America.
For fiscal 2016, we continue to expect mid-single-digit organic revenue growth in auto on a 2% to 2.5% global auto production growth environment. While we are maintaining our view of global auto production, the regional profile is slightly different versus our prior view.
We now expect slightly higher growth in Europe and China, offset by slower growth in North America. We do remain confident that our Auto business will continue to grow ahead of auto production, driven by the electronic content growth as well as the rich plate line of platform ranch from the design wins, generated over the past several years.
In the fourth quarter, we expect our Auto business to have mid-teen organic growth, including the extra week. If you exclude the extra week, we expect our growth to be about half of that mid-teen growth in the mid-single digits.
We were also very pleased with our Commercial Transportation organic growth of 3% year-over-year, in what continues to be a challenging backdrop. The growth we experienced was driven by the heavy truck sector in China and Europe, while in North America, heavy truck market did continue to remain weak as well as weakness in the global construction and Ag markets.
Turning to sensors, we saw a 2% organic decline as we continue to be impacted by the weakness in industrial-related markets which make up more than half of our sensors sales. We continue to see strong design momentum especially in the automotive space and we expect future growth.
For the segment, adjusted operating margins were 19.4%, and were in line with our expectations, and we saw sequential expansion of 40 basis points.
Now let me turn to Industrial Solutions, if you could please turn to Slide 6.
Overall segment sales were up 5% year-over-year due to the acquisition of Creganna. If you remove the impact of Creganna, organic sales declined 4%. About half of the organic decline is driven by the impact of the oil and gas downturn, which has resulted in our oil and gas sales being down 31%. 
On a geographic basis, we continue to see trends across the segment that are consistent. Europe is stable and growing in many markets, North America continues to be weak and China remains sluggish.
When we started the year, we expect this further market improvement in China and North America and what we're actually seeing currently.
Now turning to the markets within the segment. In the industrial equipment area, we saw a 14% growth driven by the Creganna acquisition, which as Tom mentioned is performing ahead of our expectations. 
We are very excited about the growth potential in the minimally invasive medical market. If you exclude Creganna, the industrial equipment area, we did see a decline of 7% organically due to softness in North America and in China, but we did see a sequential growth of 4% on an organic basis as we see markets coming back in long.
In the aerospace and defense area, our sales grew 4% organically, with strong performance both in the commercial air and in the defense markets.
And in energy, our business was flat organically, with growth in the Americas and Europe, offset by declines in Asia.
As we look forward, we expect first half to second half growth of approximately 12%, with growth in each of the business units now that the inventory corrections are behind us.
From a margin perspective, adjusted operating margins were slightly down year-over-year, driven entirely by the declines in our higher-margin Oil and Gas business, which impacted segment operating margins by partially 100 basis points year-over-year.
Segment operating margins expanded 180 basis points sequentially as we expected, driven by both the benefit of increased volumes and cost management.
Now let me turn over to communication solutions. And if you could please turn to Page 7 of the slides.
During the quarter, the communication solutions segment revenue was down 4% organically year-over-year, but grew 8% sequentially on an organic basis, if you exclude the impact of the Circuit Protection divestiture. Our SubCom business saw 10% year-over-year growth, driven by strong execution from the multiples project it has in force. And as I stated earlier, the value of the programs in force with the new program we just launched is approximately $1 billion.  And we continue to expect SubCom to grow approximately 20% year-over-year in 2016.
Our appliance business sales grew 2% organically, while our data and devices business declined 17% organically due to both the Circuit Protection sale as well as product exits.
We did experience sequential sales growth in the data and devices area, if you exclude the Circuit Protection divestiture.
For the segment, adjusted operating margins expanded 80 basis points year-over-year, as well as 270 basis point sequentially.
Now with that, I'll turn it back over to Mario to cover the financials."

Adjusted operating income of $501 million was essentially flat prior year of flat sales. Adjusted operating margin of 16.1%. Net [ph] operating income was $452 million and included $80 million of acquisition-related charges. And net restructuring and other charges of $31 million.
Adjusted EPS was $1.08 for the quarter, up 20% from the prior year, with balances from share buybacks and a lower tax rate of 17%.
The tax rate was lower than we expected, resulting in an incremental benefit of $0.04 in the quarter. We expect the fourth quarter tax rate to be at a similar level as Q3. Note that the Q3 and Q4 tax rates are lower than our run rate. We now expect the full year 2016 tax rate to be approximately 20%.
GAAP EPS was $2.19 for the quarter, driven by a $1.21 expense benefit, primarily from the settlement of all pre-separation tax disputes with Internal Revenue Service. As we previously disclosed, Tyco International [ph] entered into an agreement with the IRS to resolve all disputes related to the previously disclosed with the company issues.
As a result, we recognized a reduction of tax results of $1.1 billion as well as an expense of $604 million, representing a reduction in receivables from our tax sharing agreements with Tyco International in the median. We're happy to report that all of our IRS legacy tax disputes are now closed. As a result of the IRS settlement, we wanted to give you some color in our tax rate and income going forward.
The IRS settlement benefit tax rate, however, [indiscernible] essentially offset by the reduction income, generated by the tax sharing agreement with Tyco and Comedan [ph] . We now assume that these long-term adjusted tax rate declines to approximately 20%, versus our previously communicated range of 23% to 24%.
At the same time, going forward, we should assume that the IRS settlement will be essentially neutral to EPS.
We now expect approximately $110 million of restructuring charges for the full year, $10 million increase from the prior guidance as we accelerate certain actions due to slightly weaker and overall economic conditions.
I'll now turn into Slide 9. Our business is executing well in an uncertain macro environment. We're pleased to report sequential improvement in all of the operating markets from the prior quarter. Our adjusted gross margin in the quarter was 33%, in line with our expectations. Adjusted operating margins expanded 30 basis points year-over-year, with a strong and spending control and improvement of such decline with higher-margin business.
Total operating expenses were $528 million in the quarter, down 4% from the prior year. We continue to tightly manage discretionary spending while balancing our continuing investment in our harsh businesses.
Moving to cash flow. In the quarter, cash from continuing operations was $750 million, and our free cash flow was $589 million, up from prior year levels due to strong working capital improvements.
We saw year-over-year improvement in DSOs and inventory days of [indiscernible].
We have generated nearly $1 billion in free cash flow for the year to date, bringing [indiscernible]. And we continue to expect full year to cash flow with approximate [indiscernible].
Adjusted EBITDA margin have explained the profitability performance of our businesses with acquisitions. And adjusted EBITDA margins in Q3 were 20.7% [ph] , 460 basis points above adjusted operating margins over prior year.
Continue to be pleased with the operating performance of our business, especially given the challenging macro backdrop. Tom mentioned earlier, we announced the agreement to acquire Intercontec, expanding our harsh connectivity portfolio in the industrial sector. We expect Intercontec to add approximately $75 million of sales and $32 million of EBITDA on an annual basis. Transaction is a cash deal of $340 million that is expected to close in September 2016, and be accretive to adjusted EPS next year.
We have added a balance sheet and cash flow summary in the appendix for additional details.  And now let me turn it back to Tom."

We expect Q4 revenue of $3.25 billion to $3.45 billion and adjusted EPS of $1.17 to $1.23.  This guidance includes the extra week we have discussed throughout the year, which adds approximately $200 million of revenue and $0.10 of EPS. Excluding this extra week, we expect revenue to be up about 3% organically at the midpoint and adjusted EPS to be up 22%, a very good finish to our year.
Slide 10 provides details on actual and organic growth by segment. The extra week results in total growth of 11% in the quarter. We expect strong performance in our harsh businesses including automotive, Commercial Transportation, commercial aerospace, medical and appliances. In addition, the Creganna acquisition adds revenue from a high-growth interventional medical market and SubCom continues to remain robust, with multiple programs in force. 
Communications continue to be impacted year-on-year by the sale of the Circuit Protection business and product exits in data and devices.
Now please turn to Slide 11.
For the full year, we expect revenue of $12.25 billion, and our reiterating our full year adjusted EPS guidance of $4 at the midpoint, about 11% during year-on-year. This adjusted EPS output is the same guidance we provided back in October. 
I feel very good about our ability to drive this performance in a slow economy. 
In transportation, we continue to expect auto growth to grow -- we continue to expect Auto to grow in the mid-single-digit to organically on a 2% to 2.5% vehicle production growth. 
In industrial, while organic growth is expected to be down year-over-year for the full year due to the impact of the oil and gas downturn and supply chain corrections in the first half, we do expect strong growth on the first half to the second half across all of our business units in the industrial sector. 
In communications, our SubCom business continues to be the primary driver of growth, but we do expect both our appliance and data and devices business to grow in the second half. This is especially for our data and devices segment.
This past quarter was an important threshold for TE, and reflects the strength of our model, namely focus our investments in harsh environment applications, relentlessly drive GEOA [ph] through the organization to deliver a strong productivity and as you can see, strong working capital and cash flows results; and consistently execute our capital allocation plan. 
On a normalized 13-week per quarter basis, in a low growth world, we are delivering second half revenue growth, 16% [ph] adjusted operating margins, strong double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth and outstanding cash flow.
And with that, let's open it up for questions."

Industrial is an important obviously, an incredibly important segment for us, where we're well-positioned and as you can see with the Intercontec acquisition, this is an important area to add in organically as well. It has been a pretty sluggish environment, with the exception of commercial aerospace for the last several years. But it's fundamentally very good business. We still believe this is the business with high teen operating margins, if you get to a normalized growth over time. And you saw the leverage with a little bit of growth sequentially on our operating margin. So it fits right into the sweet spot of a harsh environment, highly-engineered products, but we have a tremendous range of products, we have expanded that product range not only in connectors with the recent acquisition, but with our sensor acquisition over a couple of years ago. While those markets are a little soft right now, we continue to be very bullish. So important market, well-positioned in the market, in every market, so wherever the industrial leaders of the world are, we are there close to them. Terrence, you want to add to that?"

And then in aerospace, I think, we've had some negative data points from Boeing and Airbus under wide-body jets, and I'm wondering if that's a weather results and outlook are doing well despite that because of growth elsewhere or you're just not seeing that weakness yet?"

I think, in defense, it's been nice that as we see some of the budgetary things, we start to see some pickup in defense. I think you saw at our quarterly results, where we grew 4%. And I think, that's creating a little bit more of a constructive backdrop in the sense that we've had a quite some time with the whole sequesters on it.

Everybody is designing faster these days. But I would say '18. That's when these nice wins are really going to start to come in, in fact you'll see it in the auto revenue line. In the industrial line, I think, it will follow kind of industrial production. The design win nature there is very different, it's like the industrial market in general, much more fragmented, smaller revenue per design. So in there, it's continue to build scale in the non-auto products, and make sure that we are growing with our slightly better than the market. But auto is where you can get significant chunks of business for design. So we really feel good about that. And we are a little disappointed in the industrial market side of it, but still very, very excited about the prospects of that expenses in the portfolio. What it does for us is every customer, every big OEM, we always have a nice seat at the table. But it's like you get a bigger seat, sometimes a bigger table because it brings in the integrated solution opportunities. You've heard us talk about that, we've had some tremendous design wins in automotive with that. And it's starting to lend itself, I think, in the aerospace market.

Q3 was another quarter of solid execution in what continues to remain a challenging global economic environment. Our adjusted EPS of $1.08 represents a new company record and was up 20% on a year-over-year basis. 
Sales of $3.12 billion were essentially flat with last year and in line with our guidance midpoint.  Sales and orders were up sequentially with sales up 6% and orders up 7%, excluding SubCom.
Adjusted operating margins were strong at 16% with adjusted EBITDA margins of 21% in the quarter. 
For the fourth quarter, we expect the midpoint of our revenue and earnings per share to be $3 --  $3.35 billion and $1.20 respectively. Note that these features include the benefit of approximately $200 million in revenue and $0.10 in EPS from the extra week in Q4 that we've been communicating all year. If we exclude the extra week, we would expect revenue to be up about 3% organically year-over-year and adjusted EPS growth to be 22% year-over-year. Also, if you exclude the extra week, we expect our Transportation business to have the best growth quarter in Q4 in our industrial segment to grow slightly for the first time this year.
For the full year, we are reiterating our adjusted EPS midpoint of $4, representing an 11% increase over the prior year.
Continued growth in most of our harsh businesses, cost controls, share buybacks and a lower tax rate are more than offsetting the first half currency headwinds and supply chain correction. This has enabled us to reiterate our original guidance that we provided in October 2015, delivering double-digit earnings growth in a slower economy.
As I mentioned earlier, we expect to return the year-over-year organic growth in Q4, excluding the extra week.
During the quarter, we continued to strengthen our harsh portfolio through acquisition. In April, we announced the acquisition of Jaquet, which bolstered our portfolio of sensors for the auto market.
This morning, we announced an agreement to acquire the Intercontec Group, a German-based manufacturer of high-quality industrial metric circular connectors. This acquisition strengthens the position in harsh connectivity applications for factory automation and will be reported in the industrial segment.
In addition, we're pleased to say our recent acquisition of Creganna is performing very well and ahead of expectations and positions TE as a leader in the high-growth, minimally invasive market.
We had a very strong cash generation quarter with free cash flow of almost $600 million. This brings our year-to-date free cash flow to just about $1 billion.
During the quarter, we've returned approximately $230 million to shareholders, including about $100 million in share buybacks. Year-to-date, we have returned nearly $2.9 billion to shareholders, including $2.5 billion in share buybacks.
We expect to continue to take a balanced approach with our capital strategy, returning approximately 2/3 of our free cash flow to shareholders over time with 1/3 free cash flow being used for acquisition.
I'll now turn it over to Terrence Curtin, who will cover our performance in more detail."

Before we get to the segment updates, I'd like to cover our orders for the quarter, which will help provide the foundation for our results and expectations. So if you could please turn to Slide 4. And this shows ou",1134,"Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. Before we get to the segment updates, I'd like to cover our orders for the quarter, which will help provide the foundation for our results and expectations. So if you could please turn to Slide 4. And this shows our order trends, excluding our SubCom business. 
Overall, orders were essentially flat year-over-year and improved again sequentially by 7%. As the supply chain corrections that impact us from the first half are behind us. Our book-to-bill was 1.01, and we also had slight growth year-over-year, reflecting the recovery and stability of our end markets.
The Transportation. Orders remain solid with 7% sequential growth. Industrial orders grew 15% sequentially. And I do want to highlight about 60% of the industrial order growth was due to the acquisition of Creganna, with remainder of the growth being broad-based across our industrial businesses.
In industrial, we saw order growth in each region as the inventory supply chain is now back in line, and we expect sales growth in the second half over the first half across each of our industrial businesses.
In Communications, excluding the impact of the sale of our Circuit Protection business last quarter, we saw sequential growth of 3%, driven by both our Appliances and Data and Devices businesses. 
Now to talk to SubCom, that business continues its strong momentum. We were recently named as the supplier of the new Marea's trans-atlantic program. And with this award, we have approximately $1 billion of programs in force in our SubCom business.
Please turn to Slide 5 so I can discuss our Transportation Solutions segment results. Segment sales grew 2% organically in the quarter with growth in Auto and in Commercial Transportation, offset by weakness in sensors that we highlighted last quarter.
Our Auto sales growth in the quarter was in line with our expectations, and growth was driven by strength in Europe and China, partially offset by the year-over-year decline in North America.
For fiscal 2016, we continue to expect mid-single-digit organic revenue growth in auto on a 2% to 2.5% global auto production growth environment. While we are maintaining our view of global auto production, the regional profile is slightly different versus our prior view. We now expect slightly higher growth in Europe and China, offset by slower growth in North America. We do remain confident that our Auto business will continue to grow ahead of Auto production, driven by the electronic content growth as well as the rich plate line of platform ranch from the design wins generated over the past several years.
In the fourth quarter, we expect our Auto business to have mid-teen organic growth, including the extra week. If you exclude the extra week, we expect our growth to be about half of that mid-teen growth in the mid-single digits.
We were also very pleased with our Commercial Transportation organic growth of 3% year-over-year in what continues to be a challenging backdrop. The growth we experienced was driven by the heavy truck sector in China and Europe. While in North America, heavy truck market did continue to remain weak as well as weakness in the global construction and ag markets.
Turning to sensors. We saw a 2% organic decline as we continue to be impacted by the weakness in industrial-related markets, which make up more than half of our sensors sales. We continue to see strong design momentum, especially in the automotive space that we expect to fuel future growth.
For the segment, adjusted operating margins were 19.4%, and we're in line with our expectations and we saw sequential expansion of 40 basis points.
Now let me turn to Industrial Solutions, if you could please turn to Slide 6. Overall segment sales were up 5% year-over-year due to the acquisition of Creganna. If you remove the impact of Creganna, organic sales declined 4%. About half of the organic decline is driven by the impact of the oil and gas downturn, which has resulted in our oil and gas sales being down 31%.
On a geographic basis, we continue to see trends across the segment that are consistent. Europe is stable and growing in many markets, North America continues to be weak and China remains sluggish. When we started the year, we expect this further market improvement in China and North America and what we're actually seeing currently.
Now turning to the markets within the segment. In the industrial equipment area, we saw a 14% growth driven by the Creganna acquisition, which, as Tom mentioned, is performing ahead of our expectations. We are very excited about the growth potential in the minimally invasive medical market. If you exclude Creganna, the Industrial Equipment area, we did see a decline of 7% organically due to softness in North America and in China, but we did see a sequential growth of 4% on an organic basis as we see markets coming back in long.
In the Aerospace and Defense area, our sales grew 4% organically with strong performance both in the commercial air and in the defense markets.
And in energy, our business was flat organically with growth in the Americas and Europe, offset by declines in Asia.
As we look forward, we expect first half to second half growth of approximately 12% with growth in each of the business units, now that the inventory corrections are behind us.
From a margin perspective, adjusted operating margins were slightly down year-over-year, driven entirely by the declines in our higher-margin Oil & Gas business, which impacted segment operating margins by partially 100 basis points year-over-year.
Segment operating margins expanded 180 basis points sequentially as we expected, driven by both the benefit of increased volumes and cost management.
Now let me turn over to Communications Solutions, and if you could please turn to Page 7 of the slides. During the quarter, the Communications Solutions segment revenue was down 4% organically year-over-year, but grew 8% sequentially on an organic basis if you exclude the impact of the Circuit Protection divestiture. Our SubCom business saw 10% year-over-year growth, driven by strong execution from the multiple project it has in force. And as I stated earlier, the value of the programs in force with the new program we just won is approximately $1 billion. And we continue to expect SubCom to grow approximately 20% year-over-year in 2016.
Our Appliance business sales grew 2% organically, while our Data and Devices business declined 17% organically due to both the Circuit Protection sale as well as product exits. We did experience sequential sales growth in the Data and Devices area, if you exclude the Circuit Protection divestiture.
For the segment, adjusted operating margins expanded 80 basis points year-over-year as well as 270 basis point sequentially.
Now with that, I'll turn it back over to Mario to cover the financials."

Adjusted operating income of $501 million was essentially flat prior year on flat sales. Adjusted operating margin of 16.1%. GAAP operating income was $452 million and included $80 million of acquisition-related charges and net restructuring and other charges of $31 million.
Adjusted EPS was $1.08 for the quarter, up 20% from the prior year, with balances from the share buyback and a lower tax rate of 17%.
The tax rate was lower than we expected, resulting in an incremental benefit of $0.04 in the quarter. We expect the fourth quarter tax rate to be at a similar level as Q3. Note that the Q3 and Q4 tax rates are lower than our run rate. We now expect the full year 2016 tax rate to be approximately 20%.
GAAP EPS was $2.19 for the quarter, driven by a $1.21 expense benefit, primarily from the settlement of all pre-separation tax disputes with Internal Revenue Service. As we've previously disclosed, Tyco International entered into an agreement with the IRS to resolve all disputes related to the previously disclosed with the company's debt issues.
As a result, we recognized a reduction of tax results of $1.1 billion as well as an expense of $604 million, representing a reduction in receivables from our tax sharing agreements with Tyco International and Covidien. We're happy to report that all of our IRS legacy tax disputes are now closed. As a result of the IRS settlement, we want to give you some color on our tax rate and other income going forward.
The IRS settlement benefits of tax rate, however, this time, it is essentially offset by the reduction in other income, generated by the tax sharing agreement with Tyco and Covidien. We now assume that this long-term adjusted tax rate declines to approximately 20% versus our previously communicated range of 23% to 24%. At the same time, going forward, we should assume that the IRS settlement will be essentially neutral to EPS.
We now expect approximately $110 million of restructuring charges for the full year, $10 million increase from the prior guidance as we accelerate certain actions due to slightly weaker and overall economic conditions.
Now turn it to Slide 9. Our business is executing well in an uncertain macro environment. We are pleased to report sequential improvements in all of the operating metrics in the prior quarter. Our adjusted gross margin in the quarter was 33%, in line with our expectations. 
Adjusted operating margins expanded 30 basis points year-over-year with a strong focus in spending control and as rotating [ph] improvements of such decline in higher-margin business.
Total operating expenses were $528 million in the quarter, down 4% in the prior year. We continue to tightly manage discretionary spending while balancing our continuing investment in our harsh businesses.
Moving to cash flow. In the quarter, cash from continuing operations was $750 million and our free cash flow was $589 million, up from prior year levels due to strong working capital improvements.
We saw year-over-year improvement in DSOs and inventory days on hand in [indiscernible]. We have generated nearly $1 billion in free cash flow for the year to date, reinforced with the help of our business. And we continue to expect full year to cash flow with approximate net income.
Adjusted EBITDA margin have explained the profitability performance of our businesses with the acquisitions. And adjusted EBITDA margins in Q3 were 20.7%, 460 basis points above adjusted operating margins and flat prior year.
We continue to be pleased with the operating performance of our business, especially given the challenging macro backdrops. Tom mentioned earlier, we announced the agreement to acquire Intercontec, expanding our harsh connectivity portfolio in the industrial sector. We expect Intercontec to add approximately $75 million of sales and $32 million of EBITDA on an annual basis. Transaction with cash deal, $340 million that is expected to close in September 2016 and be accretive to adjusted EPS next year.
We have added a balance sheet and cash flow summary in the appendix for additional details. And now let me turn it back to Tom."

We expect Q4 revenue of $3.25 billion to $3.45 billion and adjusted EPS of $1.17 to $1.23. This guidance includes the extra week we have discussed throughout the year, which adds approximately $200 million of revenue and $0.10 of EPS. Excluding this extra week, we expect revenue to be up about 3% organically at the midpoint and adjusted EPS to be up 22%, a very good finish to our year.
Slide 10 provides details on actual and organic growth by segment. The extra week results in total growth of 11% in the quarter. We expect strong performance in our harsh businesses including Automotive, Commercial Transportation, Commercial Aerospace, Medical and Appliances. In addition, the Creganna acquisition adds revenue from a high-growth interventional medical market, and SubCom continues to remain robust with multiple programs in force. 
Communications continues to be impacted year-on-year by the sale of the Circuit Protection business and product exits in Data and Devices.
Now please turn to Slide 11. For the full year, we expect revenue of $12.25 billion and are reiterating our full year adjusted EPS guidance of $4 at the midpoint, about 11% year-on-year. This adjusted EPS outlook is the same guidance we provided back in October. I feel very good about our ability to drive this performance in a slow economy.
In Transportation, we continue to expect Auto growth to grow -- we continue to expect Auto to grow in the mid-single digits organically on a 2% to 2.5% vehicle production growth. 
In Industrial, while organic growth is expected to be down year-over-year for the full year due to the impact of the oil and gas downturn and supply chain corrections in the first half, we do expect strong growth from the first half to the second half across all of our business units in the industrial segment.
In Communications, our SubCom business continues to be the primary driver of growth, but we do expect both our Appliances and Data and Devices business to grow in the second half. This is especially for our Data and Devices segment.
This past quarter was an important threshold for TE and reflects the strength of our model, namely focus our investments in harsh environment applications, relentlessly drive TEOA through the organization to deliver strong productivity. And as you can see, strong working capital and cash flow results, but it consistently execute our capital allocation plan. 
On a normalized 13-week per-quarter basis in a low-growth world, we are delivering second half revenue growth, 16% adjusted operating margins, strong double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth and outstanding cash flow.
And with that, let's open it up for questions."

Industrial is an important -- obviously and incredibly important segment for us, where we're well positioned. And as you can see with the Intercontec acquisition, this is an important area to add in organically as well. It has been a pretty sluggish environment with the exception of Commercial Aerospace for the last several years, but it's fundamentally very good business. We still believe this is the business with high-teen operating margins, if you get kind of normalized growth over time. And you saw the leverage with a little bit of growth sequentially on our operating margin. So it fits right into the sweet spot of harsh environment, highly engineered products. We have a tremendous range of products. We have expanded that product range not only in connectors with the recent acquisition, but with our sensor acquisition of a couple of years ago. And while those markets are a little soft right now, we continue to be very bullish. So important market, well positioned in the market -- in every market. So wherever the industrial leaders of the world are, we are there close to them. Terrence, you want to add to that?"

So clearly, that is something that when you look the margin, it has impacted us and that has come down. I think, also, we still have an industrial equipment space that I talked about in the call that still I would say was probably the other sluggish areas, just trying to get momentum. I do think as the volume comes in and saw a great improvement we have about 100 basis point sequentially, you see the volume through. But I do think we're doing a good job balancing it. So good growth in relationship to ComAir [ph] and Defense, 4%, I think. We're performing very well there. So overall, I think, we continue at the same margin expectation we've had as higher teen.

And in this case, we actually did some market experiments, I would say, over a couple of years to prove to both of us, both parties, that there was synergy. And it was great. So that's been in the works for a while. Jaquet, the sensor is a fragmented market and there's always small sensor companies, most of which we're not interested in. That was a much shorter train. And I would say Creganna was shorter than normal, but part of the plan once we have done AdvancedCath, so that they happen to come into these 3 months way ahead of druthers [ph], Intercontec would have been a couple of years ago. But sometimes, that's how they work out. So I don't think the universe of properties or the availability has changed that much. Terrence, you want to add some color to that?"

And then in Intercontec, it was a journey of with the owner about also once he's comfortable selling and making sure he sees how his company is going to go on. And I think that takes time. So I do think it's a little bit of 3 things at once, so it's -- just to add, Shawn, I think when you look at the environment, I think the environment -- you said it very well. I think things are still -- you have to pay for good assets and I think we have 3 good assets here. And that's a lot of our strategy. Our strategy, we talked about interventional a lot over the past 6 months. But I think when you also look here, Jaquet in the Sensors, how we strengthen those in Automotive especially in turbo sensor applications. And I think, when you look at Intercontec, what's great about Intercontec is it gets us closer to the factory floor, they're a leader in that space that really relates into how do you hook up servomotors on the factory floor and -- which is a very harsh application that you make sure you're powering your signal into the application's control, not to -- make sure you never have downtime. And the company has some exceptional product line and technology that we're bringing in that was a gap for TE. So I think each one of these show how our thought about the portfolio continues to evolve around harshness as well as how do we serve our customers better with a more complete portfolio. So I think that's what -- really, the 3 of these being together at the same time is you get to see how we're thinking. So hopefully, that helps."

But if you really look at what we've been experiencing and we've been experiencing a very robust U.S. and Europe production environment. So I think we're seeing nice growth there. That's been the backdrop. What we have had in appliance is that the China OEMs, that has slowed in China. So the appliance production in China has come off a little bit. So while we're growing 2%, it's really been driven by the U.S. and Europe. We see it again here in the quarter we just guided to. You go into the next, we probably expect a similar picture. On Creganna, certainly we didn't owe it -- own it a year ago, but in this first quarter, if we did own it, it would have grown about 11%. So when we look at that interventional market as we've talked here, we see a market that we like it very much because of the trends that support mid to higher single-digit market environment and that interventional space of $3 billion [ph] market that Creganna helps us get a leadership position in.

Restructuring getting behind us, the margin's moving up. We definitely see this business is getting on the improvement path, so encouraged about that. We have to earn that one quarter at a time, so we're not getting carried away here.

There's no market, really, that we've seen in 10 years to sell it, but it's an exceptionally well-run business, it's a clear world leader in what it does, and it's especially interesting these days because the customer base is different. And with cloud computing and mega data centers and fiber security and all those things driving what we think is going to lead to more transcontinental connectivity, SubCom can hold its own in our portfolio. But when you get past that, everything else is related. So more of what you see is tweaking the product lines, which you always have in a business. You decide, hey, here's a product line and maybe it's commoditized, we don't have any unique value, let's price ourselves out of it or maybe sell it. But for the most part, the most recent one being circuit protection, kind of the big chunks that are available, never say never, but really like the portfolio, I think. You can see it in the margins, the harsh businesses, if you look at those businesses, above company average margin, nicely, very dependable, highly engineered, really played to our strength at the engineering and manufacturing company. And as Terrence pointed out, with the acquisitions we just made, we just added $1.5 billion of harsh revenue into the portfolio over the last 90 days and at EBITDA margins well above the company average.

Q3 was another quarter of solid execution in what continues to remain a challenging global economic environment. Our adjusted EPS of $1.08 represents a new company record and was up 20% on a year-over-year basis. 
Sales of $3.12 billion were essentially flat with last year and in line with our guidance midpoint.  Sales and orders were up sequentially with sales up 6% and orders up 7%, excluding SubCom.
Adjusted operating margins were strong at 16% with adjusted EBITDA margins of 21% in the quarter. 
For the fourth quarter, we expect the midpoint of our revenue and earnings per share to be $3 --  $3.35 billion and $1.20 respectively. Note that these features include the benefit of approximately $200 million in revenue and $0.10 in EPS from the extra week in Q4 that we've been communicating all year. If we exclude the extra week, we would expect revenue to be up about 3% organically year-over-year and adjusted EPS growth to be 22% year-over-year. Also, if you exclude the extra week, we expect our Transportation business to have the best growth quarter in Q4 in our industrial segment to grow slightly for the first time this year.
For the full year, we are reiterating our adjusted EPS midpoint of $4, representing an 11% increase over the prior year.
Continued growth in most of our harsh businesses, cost controls, share buybacks and a lower tax rate are more than offsetting the first half currency headwinds and supply chain correction. This has enabled us to reiterate our original guidance that we provided in October 2015, delivering double-digit earnings growth in a slower economy.
As I mentioned earlier, we expect to return the year-over-year organic growth in Q4, excluding the extra week.
During the quarter, we continued to strengthen our harsh portfolio through acquisition. In April, we announced the acquisition of Jaquet, which bolstered our portfolio of sensors for the auto market.
This morning, we announced an agreement to acquire the Intercontec Group, a German based manufacturer of high-quality industrial metric circular connectors. This acquisition strengthens TE's position in harsh connectivity applications for factory automation and will be reported in the industrial segment.
In addition, we're pleased to say our recent acquisition of Creganna is performing very well and ahead of expectations and positions TE as a leader in the high-growth, minimally invasive medical market.
We had a very strong cash generation quarter with free cash flow of almost $600 million. This brings our year-to-date free cash flow to just about $1 billion.
During the quarter, we've returned approximately $230 million to shareholders, including about $100 million in share buybacks. Year-to-date, we have returned nearly $2.9 billion to shareholders, including $2.5 billion in share buybacks.
We expect to continue to take a balanced approach with our capital strategy, returning approximately 2/3 of our free cash flow to shareholders over time with 1/3 free cash flow being used for acquisition.
I'll now turn it over to Terrence Curtin, who will cover our performance in more detail."

And this shows ou",1140,"Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. Before we get to the segment updates, I'd like to cover our orders for the quarter, which will help provide the foundation for our results and expectations. So if you could please turn to Slide 4. And this shows our order trends, excluding our SubCom business. 
Overall, orders were essentially flat year-over-year and improved again sequentially by 7%. As the supply chain corrections that impact us from the first half are behind us. Our book-to-bill was 1.01, and we also had slight growth year-over-year, reflecting the recovery and stability of our end markets.
In Transportation. Orders remain solid with 7% sequential growth. Industrial orders grew 15% sequentially. And I do want to highlight about 60% of the industrial order growth was due to the acquisition of Creganna, with remainder of the growth being broad-based across our industrial businesses.
In industrial, we saw order growth in each region as the inventory supply chain is now back in line, and we expect sales growth in the second half over the first half across each of our industrial businesses.
In Communications, excluding the impact of the sale of our Circuit Protection business last quarter, we saw sequential growth of 3%, driven by both our Appliances and Data and Devices businesses. 
Now to talk to SubCom, that business continues its strong momentum. We were recently named as the supplier of the new Marea's trans-atlantic program. And with this award, we have approximately $1 billion of programs in force in our SubCom business.
Please turn to Slide 5 so I can discuss our Transportation Solutions segment results. Segment sales grew 2% organically in the quarter with growth in Auto and in Commercial Transportation, offset by weakness in sensors that we highlighted last quarter.
Our Auto sales growth in the quarter was in line with our expectations, and growth was driven by strength in Europe and China, partially offset by the year-over-year decline in North America.
For fiscal 2016, we continue to expect mid single digit organic revenue growth in auto on a 2% to 2.5% global auto production growth environment. While we are maintaining our view of global auto production, the regional profile is slightly different versus our prior view. We now expect slightly higher growth in Europe and China, offset by slower growth in North America. We do remain confident that our Auto business will continue to grow ahead of Auto production, driven by the electronic content growth as well as the rich plate line of platform ranch from the design wins generated over the past several years.
In the fourth quarter, we expect our Auto business to have mid teen organic growth, including the extra week. If you exclude the extra week, we expect our growth to be about half of that mid teen growth in the mid single digits.
We were also very pleased with our Commercial Transportation organic growth of 3% year-over-year in what continues to be a challenging backdrop. The growth we experienced was driven by the heavy truck sector in China and Europe. While in North America, heavy truck market did continue to remain weak as well as weakness in the global construction and ag markets.
Turning to sensors. We saw a 2% organic decline as we continue to be impacted by the weakness in industrial related markets, which make up more than half of our sensors sales. We continue to see strong design momentum, especially in the automotive space that we expect to fuel future growth.
For the segment, adjusted operating margins were 19.4%, and we're in line with our expectations and we saw sequential expansion of 40 basis points.
Now let me turn to Industrial Solutions, if you could please turn to Slide 6. Overall segment sales were up 5% year-over-year due to the acquisition of Creganna. If you remove the impact of Creganna, organic sales declined 4%. About half of the organic decline is driven by the impact of the oil and gas downturn, which has resulted in our oil and gas sales being down 31%.
On a geographic basis, we continue to see trends across the segment that are consistent. Europe is stable and growing in many markets, North America continues to be weak and China remains sluggish. When we started the year, we expected further market improvement in China and North America then what we're actually seeing currently.
Now turning to the markets within the segment. In the industrial equipment area, we saw a 14% growth driven by the Creganna acquisition, which, as Tom mentioned, is performing ahead of our expectations. We are very excited about the growth potential in the minimally invasive medical market. If you exclude Creganna, the Industrial Equipment area, we did see a decline of 7% organically due to softness in North America and in China, but we did see a sequential growth of 4% on an organic basis as we see markets coming back in long.
In the Aerospace and Defense area, our sales grew 4% organically with strong performance both in the commercial air and in the defense markets.
And in energy, our business was flat organically with growth in the Americas and Europe, offset by declines in Asia.
As we look forward, we expect first half to second half growth of approximately 12% with growth in each of the business units, now that the inventory corrections are behind us.
From a margin perspective, adjusted operating margins were slightly down year-over-year, driven entirely by the declines in our higher margin Oil & Gas business, which impacted segment operating margins by partially 100 basis points year-over-year.
Segment operating margins expanded 180 basis points sequentially as we expected, driven by both the benefit of increased volumes and cost management.
Now let me turn over to Communications Solutions, and if you could please turn to Page 7 of the slides. During the quarter, the Communications Solutions segment revenue was down 4% organically year-over-year, but grew 8% sequentially on an organic basis if you exclude the impact of the Circuit Protection divestiture. Our SubCom business saw 10% year-over-year growth, driven by strong execution from the multiple project it has in force. And as I stated earlier, the value of the programs in force with the new program we just won is approximately $1 billion. And we continue to expect SubCom to grow approximately 20% year-over-year in 2016.
Our Appliance business sales grew 2% organically, while our Data and Devices business declined 17% organically due to both the Circuit Protection sale as well as product exits. We did experience sequential sales growth in the Data and Devices area, if you exclude the Circuit Protection divestiture.
For the segment, adjusted operating margins expanded 80 basis points year-over-year as well as 270 basis point sequentially.
Now with that, I'll turn it back over to Mario to cover the financials."

Adjusted operating income of $501 million was essentially flat prior year on flat sales. Adjusted operating margin of 16.1%. GAAP operating income was $452 million and included $80 million of acquisition related charges and net restructuring and other charges of $31 million.
Adjusted EPS was $1.08 for the quarter, up 20% from the prior year, with [ph] from the share buyback and a lower tax rate of 17%.
The tax rate was lower than we expected, resulting in an incremental benefit of $0.04 in the quarter. We expect the fourth quarter tax rate to be at a similar level as Q3. Note that the Q3 and Q4 tax rates are lower than our run rate. We now expect the full year 2016 tax rate to be approximately 20%.
GAAP EPS was $2.19 for the quarter, driven by a $1.21 expense benefit, primarily from the settlement of all pre-separation tax disputes with Internal Revenue Service. As we've previously disclosed, Tyco International entered into an agreement with the IRS to resolve all disputes related to the previously disclosed with the company's debt issues.
As a result, we recognized a reduction of tax results of $1.1 billion as well as an expense of $604 million, representing a reduction in receivables from our tax sharing agreements with Tyco International and Covidien. We're happy to report that all of our IRS legacy tax disputes are now closed. As a result of the IRS settlement, we want to give you some color on our tax rate and other income going forward.
The IRS settlement benefits of tax rate, however, this time, it is essentially offset by the reduction in other income, generated by the tax sharing agreement with Tyco and Covidien. We now assume that this long-term adjusted tax rate declines to approximately 20% versus our previously communicated range of 23% to 24%. At the same time, going forward, we should assume that the IRS settlement will be essentially neutral to EPS.
We now expect approximately $110 million of restructuring charges for the full year, $10 million increase from the prior guidance as we accelerate certain actions due to slightly weaker  overall economic conditions.
Now turn it to Slide 9. Our business is executing well in an uncertain macro environment. We are pleased to report sequential improvements in all of the operating metrics in the prior quarter. Our adjusted gross margin in the quarter was 33%, in line with our expectations. 
Adjusted operating margins expanded 30 basis points year-over-year with a strong focus in spending control and as rotating improvements of such decline in higher margin business.
Total operating expenses were $528 million in the quarter, down 4% in the prior year. We continue to tightly manage discretionary spending while balancing our continuing investment in our harsh businesses.
Moving to cash flow. In the quarter, cash from continuing operations was $750 million and our free cash flow was $589 million, up from prior year levels due to strong working capital improvements.
We saw year-over-year improvement in DSOs and inventory days on hand in [indiscernible]. We have generated nearly $1 billion in free cash flow for the year to date, reinforced with the help of our business. And we continue to expect full year to cash flow with approximate net income.
Adjusted EBITDA margin have explained the profitability performance of our businesses with the acquisitions. And adjusted EBITDA margins in Q3 were 20.7%, 460 basis points above adjusted operating margins and flat prior year.
We continue to be pleased with the operating performance of our business, especially given the challenging macro backdrops. Tom mentioned earlier, we announced the agreement to acquire Intercontec, expanding our harsh connectivity portfolio in the industrial sector. We expect Intercontec to add approximately $75 million of sales and $32 million of EBITDA on an annual basis. Transaction with cash deal, $340 million that is expected to close in September 2016 and be accretive to adjusted EPS next year.
We have added a balance sheet and cash flow summary in the appendix for additional details. And now let me turn it back to Tom."

In addition, the Creganna acquisition adds revenue from a high-growth interventional medical market, and SubCom continues to remain robust with multiple programs in force. 
Communications continues to be impacted year-on-year by the sale of the Circuit Protection business and product exits in Data and Devices.
Now please turn to Slide 11. For the full year, we expect revenue of $12.25 billion and are reiterating our full year adjusted EPS guidance of $4 at the midpoint, about 11% year-on-year. This adjusted EPS outlook is the same guidance we provided back in October. I feel very good about our ability to drive this performance in a slow economy.
In Transportation, we continue to expect Auto growth to grow -- we continue to expect Auto to grow in the mid-single digits organically on a 2% to 2.5% vehicle production growth. 
In Industrial, while organic growth is expected to be down year-over-year for the full year due to the impact of the oil and gas downturn and supply chain corrections in the first half, we do expect strong growth from the first half to the second half across all of our business units in the industrial segment.
In Communications, our SubCom business continues to be the primary driver of growth, but we do expect both our Appliances and Data and Devices business to grow in the second half. This is especially for our Data and Devices segment.
This past quarter was an important threshold for TE and reflects the strength of our model, namely focus our investments in harsh environment applications, relentlessly drive TEOA through the organization to deliver strong productivity. And as you can see, strong working capital and cash flow results, but it consistently execute our capital allocation plan. 
On a normalized 13 week per quarter basis in a low growth world, we are delivering second half revenue growth, 16% adjusted operating margins, strong double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth and outstanding cash flow.
And with that, let's open it up for questions."

Industrial is an important -- obviously and incredibly important segment for us, where we're well positioned. And as you can see with the Intercontec acquisition, this is an important area to add in organically as well. It has been a pretty sluggish environment with the exception of Commercial Aerospace for the last several years, but it's fundamentally very good business. We still believe this is the business with high teen operating margins, if you get kind of normalized growth over time. And you saw the leverage with a little bit of growth sequentially on our operating margin. So it fits right into the sweet spot of harsh environment, highly engineered products. We have a tremendous range of products. We have expanded that product range not only in connectors with the recent acquisition, but with our sensor acquisition of a couple of years ago. And while those markets are a little soft right now, we continue to be very bullish. So important market, well positioned in the market -- in every market. So wherever the industrial leaders of the world are, we are there close to them. Terrence, you want to add to that?"

So clearly, that is something that when you look the margin, it has impacted us and that has come down. I think, also, we still have an industrial equipment space that I talked about in the call that still I would say was probably the other sluggish areas, just trying to get momentum. I do think as the volume comes in and saw a great improvement we have about 100 basis point sequentially, you see the volume through. But I do think we're doing a good job balancing it. So good growth in relationship to Comair and Defense, 4%, I think. We're performing very well there. So overall, I think, we continue at the same margin expectation we've had as higher teen.

Now when you deal with more integration and really as how do we bring the portfolio we had and what they did so well together, and we're early stages on that. But I think that's where you'll get some of the value creation on the growth side, it's how we'll be able to do further integration and get to a higher content per unit opportunity that neither companies had together.

Good question. I think this 3 in this short period of time is more coincidence than anything else, honestly, because -- just to give you a little of the history, Intercontec, we've been, like we often do, and is often the case with a really nice privately held company, it takes a while to work through it. And in this case, we actually did some market experiments, I would say, over a couple of years to prove to both of us, both parties, that there was synergy. And it was great. So that's been in the works for a while. Jaquet, the sensor is a fragmented market and there's always small sensor companies, most of which we're not interested in. That was a much shorter train. And I would say Creganna was shorter than normal, but part of the plan once we have done AdvancedCath, so that they happen to come into these 3 months, would we had our druthers, Intercontec would have been a couple of years ago. But sometimes, that's how they work out. So I don't think the universe of properties or the availability has changed that much. Terrence, you want to add some color to that?"

If something gets auctioned, like in Creganna, we don't control that hotbox. And then in Intercontec, it was a journey of with the owner about also once he's comfortable selling and making sure he sees how his company is going to go on. And I think that takes time. So I do think it's a little bit of 3 things at once, so it's -- just to add, Shawn, I think when you look at the environment, I think the environment -- you said it very well. I think things are still -- you have to pay for good assets and I think we have 3 good assets here. And that's a lot of our strategy. Our strategy, we talked about interventional a lot over the past 6 months. But I think when you also look here, Jaquet in the Sensors, how we strengthen those in Automotive especially in turbo sensor applications. And I think, when you look at Intercontec, what's great about Intercontec is it gets us closer to the factory floor, they're a leader in that space that really relates into how do you hook up servomotors on the factory floor and -- which is a very harsh application that you make sure you're powering your signal into the application's control, not to -- make sure you never have downtime. And the company has some exceptional product line and technology that we're bringing in that was a gap for TE. So I think each one of these show how our thought about the portfolio continues to evolve around harshness as well as how do we serve our customers better with a more complete portfolio. So I think that's what -- really, the 3 of these being together at the same time is you get to see how we're thinking. So hopefully, that helps."

Appliance has been -- it got impacted a little bit around the inventory correction with our channel partners because they do have -- a part of their business goes through there. But if you really look at what we've been experiencing and we've been experiencing a very robust U.S. and Europe production environment. So I think we're seeing nice growth there. That's been the backdrop. What we have had in appliance is that the China OEMs, that has slowed in China. So the appliance production in China has come off a little bit. So while we're growing 2%, it's really been driven by the U.S. and Europe. We see it again here in the quarter we just guided to. You go into the next, we probably expect a similar picture. On Creganna, certainly we didn't owe it -- own it a year ago, but in this first quarter, if we did own it, it would have grown about 11%. So when we look at that interventional market as we've talked here, we see a market that we like it very much because of the trends that support mid to higher single-digit market environment and that interventional space of $3 billion market that Creganna helps us get a leadership position in.

There's no market, really, that we've seen in 10 years to sell it, but it's an exceptionally well-run business, it's a clear world leader in what it does, and it's especially interesting these days because the customer base is different. And with cloud computing and mega data centers and fiber security and all those things driving what we think is going to lead to more transcontinental connectivity, SubCom can hold its own in our portfolio. But when you get past that, everything else is related. So more of what you see is tweaking the product lines, which you always have in a business. You decide, hey, here's a product line and maybe it's commoditized, we don't have any unique value, let's price ourselves out of it or maybe sell it. But for the most part, the most recent one being circuit protection, kind of the big chunks that are available, never say never, but really like the portfolio, I think. You can see it in the margins, the harsh businesses, if you look at those businesses, above company average margin, nicely, very dependable, highly engineered, really played to our strength at the engineering and manufacturing company. And as Terrence pointed out, with the acquisitions we just made, we just added $.5 billion of harsh revenue into the portfolio over the last 90 days and at EBITDA margins well above the company average.

Q3 was another quarter of solid execution in what continues to remain a challenging global economic environment. Our adjusted EPS of $1.08 represents a new company record and was up 20% on a year-over-year basis. 
Sales of $3.12 billion were essentially flat with last year and in line with our guidance midpoint.  Sales and orders were up sequentially with sales up 6% and orders up 7%, excluding SubCom.
Adjusted operating margins were strong at 16% with adjusted EBITDA margins of 21% in the quarter. 
For the fourth quarter, we expect the midpoint of our revenue and earnings per share to be $3 --  $3.35 billion and $1.20 respectively. Note that these features include the benefit of approximately $200 million in revenue and $0.10 in EPS from the extra week in Q4 that we've been communicating all year. If we exclude the extra week, we would expect revenue to be up about 3% organically year-over-year and adjusted EPS growth to be 22% year-over-year. Also, if you exclude the extra week, we expect our Transportation business to have the best growth quarter in Q4 in our industrial segment to grow slightly for the first time this year.
For the full year, we are reiterating our adjusted EPS midpoint of $4, representing an 11% increase over the prior year.
Continued growth in most of our harsh businesses, cost controls, share buybacks and a lower tax rate are more than offsetting the first half currency headwinds and supply chain correction. This has enabled us to reiterate our original guidance that we provided in October 2015, delivering double-digit earnings growth in a slower economy.
As I mentioned earlier, we expect to return the year-over-year organic growth in Q4, excluding the extra week.
During the quarter, we continued to strengthen our harsh portfolio through acquisition. In April, we announced the acquisition of Jaquet, which bolstered our portfolio of sensors for the auto market.
This morning, we announced an agreement to acquire the Intercontec Group, a German based manufacturer of high-quality industrial metric circular connectors. This acquisition strengthens TE's position in harsh connectivity applications for factory automation and will be reported in the industrial segment.
In addition, we're pleased to say our recent acquisition of Creganna is performing very well and ahead of expectations and positions TE as a leader in the high-growth, minimally invasive medical market.
We had a very strong cash generation quarter with free cash flow of almost $600 million. This brings our year-to-date free cash flow to just about $1 billion.
During the quarter, we've returned approximately $230 million to shareholders, including about $100 million in share buybacks. Year-to-date, we have returned nearly $2.9 billion to shareholders, including $2.5 billion in share buybacks.
We expect to continue to take a balanced approach with our capital strategy, returning approximately 2/3 of our free cash flow to shareholders over time with 1/3 free cash flow being used for acquisition.
I'll now turn it over to Terrence Curtin, who will cover our performance in more detail."

And this shows ou",1140,"Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. Before we get to the segment updates, I'd like to cover our orders for the quarter, which will help provide the foundation for our results and expectations. So if you could please turn to Slide 4. And this shows our order trends, excluding our SubCom business. 
Overall, orders were essentially flat year-over-year and improved again sequentially by 7%. As the supply chain corrections that impact us from the first half are behind us. Our book-to-bill was 1.01, and we also had slight growth year-over-year, reflecting the recovery and stability of our end markets.
In Transportation. Orders remain solid with 7% sequential growth. Industrial orders grew 15% sequentially. And I do want to highlight about 60% of the industrial order growth was due to the acquisition of Creganna, with remainder of the growth being broad-based across our industrial businesses.
In industrial, we saw order growth in each region as the inventory supply chain is now back in line, and we expect sales growth in the second half over the first half across each of our industrial businesses.
In Communications, excluding the impact of the sale of our Circuit Protection business last quarter, we saw sequential growth of 3%, driven by both our Appliances and Data and Devices businesses. 
Now to talk to SubCom, that business continues its strong momentum. We were recently named as the supplier of the new Marea's trans-atlantic program. And with this award, we have approximately $1 billion of programs in force in our SubCom business.
Please turn to Slide 5 so I can discuss our Transportation Solutions segment results. Segment sales grew 2% organically in the quarter with growth in Auto and in Commercial Transportation, offset by weakness in sensors that we highlighted last quarter.
Our Auto sales growth in the quarter was in line with our expectations, and growth was driven by strength in Europe and China, partially offset by the year-over-year decline in North America.
For fiscal 2016, we continue to expect mid single digit organic revenue growth in auto on a 2% to 2.5% global auto production growth environment. While we are maintaining our view of global auto production, the regional profile is slightly different versus our prior view. We now expect slightly higher growth in Europe and China, offset by slower growth in North America. We do remain confident that our Auto business will continue to grow ahead of Auto production, driven by the electronic content growth as well as the rich plate line of platform ranch from the design wins generated over the past several years.
In the fourth quarter, we expect our Auto business to have mid teen organic growth, including the extra week. If you exclude the extra week, we expect our growth to be about half of that mid teen growth in the mid single digits.
We were also very pleased with our Commercial Transportation organic growth of 3% year-over-year in what continues to be a challenging backdrop. The growth we experienced was driven by the heavy truck sector in China and Europe. While in North America, heavy truck market did continue to remain weak as well as weakness in the global construction and ag markets.
Turning to sensors. We saw a 2% organic decline as we continue to be impacted by the weakness in industrial related markets, which make up more than half of our sensors sales. We continue to see strong design momentum, especially in the automotive space that we expect to fuel future growth.
For the segment, adjusted operating margins were 19.4%, and we're in line with our expectations and we saw sequential expansion of 40 basis points.
Now let me turn to Industrial Solutions, if you could please turn to Slide 6. Overall segment sales were up 5% year-over-year due to the acquisition of Creganna. If you remove the impact of Creganna, organic sales declined 4%. About half of the organic decline is driven by the impact of the oil and gas downturn, which has resulted in our oil and gas sales being down 31%.
On a geographic basis, we continue to see trends across the segment that are consistent. Europe is stable and growing in many markets, North America continues to be weak and China remains sluggish. When we started the year, we expected further market improvement in China and North America then what we're actually seeing currently.
Now turning to the markets within the segment. In the industrial equipment area, we saw a 14% growth driven by the Creganna acquisition, which, as Tom mentioned, is performing ahead of our expectations. We are very excited about the growth potential in the minimally invasive medical market. If you exclude Creganna, the Industrial Equipment area, we did see a decline of 7% organically due to softness in North America and in China, but we did see a sequential growth of 4% on an organic basis as we see markets coming back in long.
In the Aerospace and Defense area, our sales grew 4% organically with strong performance both in the commercial air and in the defense markets.
And in energy, our business was flat organically with growth in the Americas and Europe, offset by declines in Asia.
As we look forward, we expect first half to second half growth of approximately 12% with growth in each of the business units, now that the inventory corrections are behind us.
From a margin perspective, adjusted operating margins were slightly down year-over-year, driven entirely by the declines in our higher margin Oil & Gas business, which impacted segment operating margins by partially 100 basis points year-over-year.
Segment operating margins expanded 180 basis points sequentially as we expected, driven by both the benefit of increased volumes and cost management.
Now let me turn over to Communications Solutions, and if you could please turn to Page 7 of the slides. During the quarter, the Communications Solutions segment revenue was down 4% organically year-over-year, but grew 8% sequentially on an organic basis if you exclude the impact of the Circuit Protection divestiture. Our SubCom business saw 10% year-over-year growth, driven by strong execution from the multiple project it has in force. And as I stated earlier, the value of the programs in force with the new program we just won is approximately $1 billion. And we continue to expect SubCom to grow approximately 20% year-over-year in 2016.
Our Appliance business sales grew 2% organically, while our Data and Devices business declined 17% organically due to both the Circuit Protection sale as well as product exits. We did experience sequential sales growth in the Data and Devices area, if you exclude the Circuit Protection divestiture.
For the segment, adjusted operating margins expanded 80 basis points year-over-year as well as 270 basis point sequentially.
Now with that, I'll turn it back over to Mario to cover the financials."

Adjusted operating income of $501 million was essentially flat prior year on flat sales. Adjusted operating margin of 16.1%. GAAP operating income was $452 million and included $80 million of acquisition related charges and net restructuring and other charges of $31 million.
Adjusted EPS was $1.08 for the quarter, up 20% from the prior year, with [ph] from the share buyback and a lower tax rate of 17%.
The tax rate was lower than we expected, resulting in an incremental benefit of $0.04 in the quarter. We expect the fourth quarter tax rate to be at a similar level as Q3. Note that the Q3 and Q4 tax rates are lower than our run rate. We now expect the full year 2016 tax rate to be approximately 20%.
GAAP EPS was $2.19 for the quarter, driven by a $1.21 expense benefit, primarily from the settlement of all pre-separation tax disputes with Internal Revenue Service. As we've previously disclosed, Tyco International entered into an agreement with the IRS to resolve all disputes related to the previously disclosed with the company's debt issues.
As a result, we recognized a reduction of tax results of $1.1 billion as well as an expense of $604 million, representing a reduction in receivables from our tax sharing agreements with Tyco International and Covidien. We're happy to report that all of our IRS legacy tax disputes are now closed. As a result of the IRS settlement, we want to give you some color on our tax rate and other income going forward.
The IRS settlement benefits of tax rate, however, this time, it is essentially offset by the reduction in other income, generated by the tax sharing agreement with Tyco and Covidien. We now assume that this long-term adjusted tax rate declines to approximately 20% versus our previously communicated range of 23% to 24%. At the same time, going forward, we should assume that the IRS settlement will be essentially neutral to EPS.
We now expect approximately $110 million of restructuring charges for the full year, $10 million increase from the prior guidance as we accelerate certain actions due to slightly weaker  overall economic conditions.
Now turn it to Slide 9. Our business is executing well in an uncertain macro environment. We are pleased to report sequential improvements in all of the operating metrics in the prior quarter. Our adjusted gross margin in the quarter was 33%, in line with our expectations. 
Adjusted operating margins expanded 30 basis points year-over-year with a strong focus in spending control and as rotating improvements of such decline in higher margin business.
Total operating expenses were $528 million in the quarter, down 4% in the prior year. We continue to tightly manage discretionary spending while balancing our continuing investment in our harsh businesses.
Moving to cash flow. In the quarter, cash from continuing operations was $750 million and our free cash flow was $589 million, up from prior year levels due to strong working capital improvements.
We saw year-over-year improvement in DSOs and inventory days on hand in [indiscernible]. We have generated nearly $1 billion in free cash flow for the year to date, reinforced with the help of our business. And we continue to expect full year to cash flow with approximate net income.
Adjusted EBITDA margin have explained the profitability performance of our businesses with the acquisitions. And adjusted EBITDA margins in Q3 were 20.7%, 460 basis points above adjusted operating margins and flat prior year.
We continue to be pleased with the operating performance of our business, especially given the challenging macro backdrops. Tom mentioned earlier, we announced the agreement to acquire Intercontec, expanding our harsh connectivity portfolio in the industrial sector. We expect Intercontec to add approximately $75 million of sales and $32 million of EBITDA on an annual basis. Transaction with cash deal, $340 million that is expected to close in September 2016 and be accretive to adjusted EPS next year.
We have added a balance sheet and cash flow summary in the appendix for additional details. And now let me turn it back to Tom."

We expect Q4 revenue of $3.25 billion to $3.45 billion and adjusted EPS of $1.17 to $1.23. This guidance includes the extra week we have discussed throughout the year, which adds approximately $200 million of revenue and $0.10 of EPS. Excluding this extra week, we expect revenue to be up about 3% organically at the midpoint and adjusted EPS to be up 22%, a very good finish to our year.
Slide 10 provides details on actual and organic growth by segment. The extra week results in total growth of 11% in the quarter. We expect strong performance in our harsh businesses including Automotive, Commercial Transportation, Commercial Aerospace, Medical and Appliances. In addition, the Creganna acquisition adds revenue from a high-growth interventional medical market, and SubCom continues to remain robust with multiple programs in force. 
Communications continues to be impacted year-on-year by the sale of the Circuit Protection business and product exits in Data and Devices.
Now please turn to Slide 11. For the full year, we expect revenue of $12.25 billion and are reiterating our full year adjusted EPS guidance of $4 at the midpoint, about 11% year-on-year. This adjusted EPS outlook is the same guidance we provided back in October. I feel very good about our ability to drive this performance in a slow economy.
In Transportation, we continue to expect Auto growth to grow -- we continue to expect Auto to grow in the mid-single digits organically on a 2% to 2.5% vehicle production growth. 
In Industrial, while organic growth is expected to be down year-over-year for the full year due to the impact of the oil and gas downturn and supply chain corrections in the first half, we do expect strong growth from the first half to the second half across all of our business units in the industrial segment.
In Communications, our SubCom business continues to be the primary driver of growth, but we do expect both our Appliances and Data and Devices business to grow in the second half. This is especially for our Data and Devices segment.
This past quarter was an important threshold for TE and reflects the strength of our model, namely focus our investments in harsh environment applications, relentlessly drive TEOA through the organization to deliver strong productivity. And as you can see, strong working capital and cash flow results, but it consistently execute our capital allocation plan. 
On a normalized 13 week per quarter basis in a low growth world, we are delivering second half revenue growth, 16% adjusted operating margins, strong double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth and outstanding cash flow.

We still believe this is the business with high teen operating margins, if you get kind of normalized growth over time. And you saw the leverage with a little bit of growth sequentially on our operating margin. So it fits right into the sweet spot of harsh environment, highly engineered products. We have a tremendous range of products. We have expanded that product range not only in connectors with the recent acquisition, but with our sensor acquisition of a couple of years ago.

So clearly, that is something that when you look the margin, it has impacted us and that has come down. I think, also, we still have an industrial equipment space that I talked about in the call that still I would say was probably the other sluggish areas, just trying to get momentum. I do think as the volume comes in and saw a great improvement we have about 100 basis point sequentially, you see the volume through. But I do think we're doing a good job balancing it. So good growth in relationship to Comair and Defense, 4%, I think. We're performing very well there. So overall, I think, we continue at the same margin expectation we've had as higher teen. But clearly, I think, we battled through the oil and gas downturn pretty well from a margin perspective."

Now when you deal with more integration and really as how do we bring the portfolio we had and what they did so well together, and we're early stages on that. But I think that's where you'll get some of the value creation on the growth side, it's how we'll be able to do further integration and get to a higher content per unit opportunity that neither companies had together. So I think it's much more around bringing the product set together. The go to market is how do you make sure you cover a large player in that space and what we've had.

I think things are still -- you have to pay for good assets and I think we have 3 good assets here. And that's a lot of our strategy. Our strategy, we talked about interventional a lot over the past 6 months. But I think when you also look here, Jaquet in the Sensors, how we strengthen those in Automotive especially in turbo sensor applications. And I think, when you look at Intercontec, what's great about Intercontec is it gets us closer to the factory floor, they're a leader in that space that really relates into how do you hook up servomotors on the factory floor and -- which is a very harsh application that you make sure you're powering your signal into the application's control, not to -- make sure you never have downtime. And the company has some exceptional product line and technology that we're bringing in that was a gap for TE. So I think each one of these show how our thought about the portfolio continues to evolve around harshness as well as how do we serve our customers better with a more complete portfolio.

Thanks for the question. First of all, on appliance, what we've seen in appliance. Appliance has been -- it got impacted a little bit around the inventory correction with our channel partners because they do have -- a part of their business goes through there. But if you really look at what we've been experiencing and we've been experiencing a very robust U.S. and Europe production environment. So I think we're seeing nice growth there. That's been the backdrop. What we have had in appliance is that the China OEMs, that has slowed in China. So the appliance production in China has come off a little bit. So while we're growing 2%, it's really been driven by the U.S. and Europe. We see it again here in the quarter we just guided to. You go into the next, we probably expect a similar picture. On Creganna, certainly we didn't owe it -- own it a year ago, but in this first quarter, if we did own it, it would have grown about 11%. So when we look at that interventional market as we've talked here, we see a market that we like it very much because of the trends that support mid to higher single-digit market environment and that interventional space of $3 billion market that Creganna helps us get a leadership position in. But really a good first quarter that on a pro forma, if we owned them a year ago, it would have been up about 11%."

The consumer markets in China and the consumer in China continues to be pretty healthy and the growth in the China economy is in the consumer market, which is a good thing over -- in general because that's what fuels economic growth and then eventually feed the industrial part of the economy. So I think -- we don't have a crystal ball for sure, Will, but right now, what we're seeing is we would expect reasonable growth in China, definitely down from what it's run over. Take fiscal -- our fiscal '16 out of it because growth in fiscal '16 is pretty modest. I think we kind of see another modest growth in fiscal '17, it's below the historical growth rate. And that's how you get to this 1.5%, 2% production growth in '17. But I think this will play out. But generally, we're not hearing or seeing anything from our customers, from our pattern that would say differently right now.

I think in defense, it's been nice that as we see some of the budgetary things happen, we're starting to see some pickup in defense. I think you saw it at our quarterly results, where we grew 4%.

That's when these nice wins are going to really start to come in, and so that you'll see it in the auto revenue line. In the industrial line, I think, it will follow kind of industrial production. The design win nature there is very different. It's like the industrial market in general, much more fragmented, smaller revenue per design. So in there, it continues to build scale in the nonauto products, and make sure that we're growing with or slightly better than the market. But auto is where you can get significant chunks of business for design. So we really feel good about that. We're a little disappointed in the industrial market side of it, but still very, very excited about the prospects of having sensors in the portfolio. And what it does for us and every customer, every big OEM, we always have a nice seat at the table.

You've heard us talk about that, we've had some tremendous design wins in Automotive with that. And it's starting to lend itself, I think, in the aerospace market.

I'm going to review the highlights of Q4 and the full year and preview fiscal 2017 guidance, then I will turn it over to Terrence to cover our performance in more detail. Before I get started, one more reminder that our fourth quarter included 14 weeks this year. 
Please turn to Slide 3. Fiscal 2016 was a very good year for TE. I'm especially pleased with our Q4 results, which included record adjusted earnings per share above the high end of our guidance and record free cash flow. We also finished the year with strong orders, setting us up for a good start to our 2017 fiscal year. A key takeaway is that on both the 13-week and 14-week basis, the company had a very good fourth quarter, exceeding our guidance and earnings and expectations in cash flow. Sales for the full 14-week quarter were $3.3 billion, essentially at the midpoint of our guidance. Excluding the extra week, sales grew 4% and 2% organically. Adjusted EPS was $1.27 on a 14-week basis, $0.07 better than the midpoint of our guidance. On a 13-week basis, adjusted EPS was $1.14, up 27% over the prior year, and as I mentioned, a new record for us. Orders of $2.95 billion were up 11% year-over-year and up 1% sequentially, excluding the extra week and our SubCom business. Adjusted operating margin was 16.5% and free cash flow was approximately $600 million. 
We continue to execute our harsh strategy, with the completion of the acquisition of Intercontec at the end of the quarter, adding a very nice range of connectivity products to our Industrial Solutions product portfolio. We also continue to execute very well in the SubCom business, with the October announcement that TE was awarded the new pacific light cable network, a trans-pacific system, where TE is working with Google and Facebook. Q4 was a very good quarter and momentum is strong as we enter fiscal 2017. 
Now please turn to Slide 4. We were able to beat our guidance and deliver double-digit adjusted EPS growth despite a slower-than-expected economic environment. This is a good indicator of the multiple levers we have to drive performance. Our harsh businesses continued to perform well. SubCom had an excellent year, and we made several key acquisitions, including Creganna, which established us as a leader in the market from minimally invasive medical solutions. Jaquet, which expanded our sensor position in the transportation market and Intercontec, which I mentioned earlier. We also sold our Circuit Protection business and narrow our focus in the communications segment. From a financial perspective, sales were $12.24 billion. Adjusted EPS was $4.08, $0.08 above our original guidance, and free cash flow exceeded our expectations at $1.6 billion. We maintain strong operating margins of 15.8% for the full year, with operating margins in the 16%-plus range in the second half. Adjusted EBITDA margins remain strong at 20.6% in a very low growth market. We also returned $3.1 billion to shareholders in dividends and stock buyback. 
Now I'll take a minute to highlight our fiscal 2017 guidance. We expect revenue of $12.3 billion to $12.9 billion, which represent total growth of 5% and organic growth of 3% at midpoint, using a 52-week baseline in fiscal 2016. We expect adjusted EPS of $4.19 to $4.49, representing 10% growth at midpoint and another year of double-digit EPS growth when compared to the 52-week base of $3.95 in 2016. 
Before we move on, I wanted to recognize that this is the first earnings call since our announcement that Terrence Curtin will become CEO in March. I couldn't be more confident about the choice of Terrence. I also want to welcome Heath Mitts, who joined us as CFO a couple of months ago. Heath is getting up to speed very quickly and will be a strong partner for Terrence. 
Now I'll pass it over to Terrence and he will review our performance in more detail."

Before we get into the segment results and updates, I'd like to cover our orders for the quarter, which will help provide the foundation for the trends that we're seeing in our business as well as our expectations for 2017. 
If you could please turn to Slide 5. And this shows our order trends on both a 13- and 14-week basis excluding our SubCom business. I'll speak to our orders on a 13-week basis, so you have an apples-to-apples comparison versus last year and last quarter. Orders were up 11% year-over-year and our book-to-bill was 1.03. On a sequential basis, we saw 1% growth, which is stronger than normal seasonality as we typically experience a slight sequential decline. So we're clearly pleased with the order momentum as we enter into 2017. 
Geographically, we saw order growth in all regions on an organic basis. The strength overall was driven by Asia, both in China as well as outside of China with order growth of 22%. Europe and the America's orders grew approximately 3% and those regions remain stay [ph] with continued growth in orders. From a segment perspective, in transportation, orders increased 15% year-over-year and were up 3% sequentially. As China Auto OEMs increase production ahead of the expiration of government incentives at the end of the calendar year. Industrial segment orders grew 15% year-over-year due to the Creganna acquisition and on an organic order basis, they grew 4%, with growth across each of our 3 industrial businesses. Sequentially, industrial orders declined in line with typical seasonality. In the communications segment, excluding SubCom, we saw sequential growth of 4% driven by both our Appliances and data device businesses. And Data and Devices, we are seeing increasing momentum in the business as products exits are largely behind us and year-over-year orders were up, if you exclude the impact on the sale of our Circuit Protection business. 
Now let me spend a minute on SubCom. As this business continues its strong momentum. As Tom mentioned, we were recently named as the supplier of trans-pacific system with Google and Facebook, and with $1 billion of backlog, we expect SubCom to grow again in 2017. 
Please turn to Slide 6 to discuss the segment results and let me kick it off with our transportation segment. Segment sales grew 5% organically in the quarter on a 13-week basis, with strong growth in Auto and Commercial Transportation. This was offset by weakness in Sensors that was driven by industrial-related markets like we talked about the past few quarters. Our Auto sales in the quarter were up 6% in line with our expectations and ahead of auto production growth of 3% during the quarter due to content gains. Growth was driven by strength in Asia and in Europe, partially offset by declines in North America. Going forward, we continue to expect our Auto business to grow ahead of Auto production, driven by electronic content growth and a rich pipeline of platform ramps and design wins that we generated over the past several years. In our commercial and transportation business, we delivered very strong performance, with organic growth of 4% year-over-year despite a very challenging end market in North America. Our performance was driven by strength in China and Europe, and this was partially offset by declines in North America. 
Turning to Sensors, we saw overall growth of 4% that was driven by the acquisition of the Jaquet. We did see a 2% organic decline as we continue to be impacted by the weaknesses in industrial-related markets, which make up more than half of our Sensors sales. We continue to see strong design win momentum in the Automotive space for sensor applications and expect to begin to see meaningful revenue from these programs beginning of fiscal 2018. Adjusted operating margins in the segment were 19.6% and were in line with our expectations and were up sequentially 20 basis points. For the full year, the segment delivered 5% organic growth and 19.2% adjusted operating margins. 
If you could please turn to Slide 7, let me move over to the Industrial Solutions segment. On an overall basis, segment sales were up 16% year-over-year due to the acquisition of Creganna. On a 13-week organic basis, revenue in the segment declined 2% driven by weakness in the oil and gas and an overall slow Industrial Equipment environment. Geographically, we continue to see North America as weak, Europe as stable and China improving. 
I'll provide some color now on sales growth and our industrial businesses and this will be on a 13-week basis. In the Industrial Equipment area, we saw 15% growth, driven by the Creganna activation, which is performing ahead of our expectations. We continue to be excited about the growth potential in this minimally invasive medical market. On a pro forma basis, if we had owned Creganna this time, last year, our growth would've been greater than 10%. Excluding Creganna, the Industrial Equipment business declined 7% organically, with softness in all regions, but did show first half to second half growth of 7% as markets recovered from the first half inventory correction that we talked about earlier in the year. In the Aerospace and Defense area, we had strong growth of 6% organically, driven by share gains in both commercial air platforms and defense applications. In oil and gas, similar to prior quarters, our sales declined by 27% due to the end market conditions in that area. And finally, our Energy business had a very nice growth of 6% organically, with growth both in China as well as in the Americas. From a margin perspective, adjusted operating margins were in line with expectations, but down year-over-year. The year-over-year decline is due entirely to the Oil and Gas business, which impacted segment operating margin by approximately 100 basis points year-over-year due to the revenue declines that we saw in that business. We do expect the oil and gas impact to our margins to affect our comparisons through the first quarter of 2017, but then they'll be anniversary-ed as we get in later into the year. For the full year, the Industrial Solution segment delivered 1% actual growth and 12.3% adjusted operating margins. Organically, the segment sales declined 3% for the full year, but did grow 11% from the first half to second half, following the inventory corrections that I mentioned that we experienced in the first 2 quarters. 
So if you could please turn to Slide 8, let me cover Communications Solutions. During the quarter, the Communications segment revenue was down 1% organically on a 13-week basis. The SubCom business saw 13% year-over-year growth, driven by strong execution from multiple projects that we have in [ph] force. For the full year, SubCom grew 25% in fiscal 2016. In Appliances, on a 13-week basis, our business grew 3% organically, while Data and Devices declined 13% organically due to the effects of product exits. What was nice about Data and Devices, we did experience another quarter of sequential sales growth in the business in quarter 4 as the product exits are largely behind us. Adjusted operating margins for the segment expanded 180 basis points sequentially [ph] [ph] and 240 basis points year-over-year due to the productivity improvements and restructuring actions we've taken in the segment. For the full year, 2016, Communications Solutions declined 2% organically, driven by Data and Devices and generated 11.6% adjusted operating margins. 
Now let me hand it over to Heath, who e'ill cover the financials."

To start off, I'm excited to join the team here and I look forward to getting to know the investor and analyst community over the coming quarters. 
Now I'll be -- please turn to Slide 9, I'll provide more details on our Q4 earnings. Adjusted operating income was $551 million, with an adjusted operating margin of 16.5%. Excluding the extra week, our adjusted operating margin was 16%. Note that the operating income impact from the additional week was $55 million. GAAP operating income was $517 million and included $30 million of restructuring charges driven primarily by Data and Devices and $4 million of acquisition-related charges. Adjusted EPS was $1.27 for the quarter. If you exclude the $0.13 contribution from the additional week, adjusted EPS was $1.14 and up 27% year-on-year, a new company record. The growth of prior year was driven by an increase in operating income, incremental benefits from share buyback and a lower adjusted effective tax rate of 13%. The adjusted tax rate was lower than prior guidance due to the mix of profitability by region and [ph] expirations in certain jurisdictions. GAAP EPS was $1.22 for the quarter and included restructuring and acquisition-related charges of $0.05. For the full year, 2016, restructuring charges were $125 million and I expect similar levels for 2017 driven primarily by activity in our industrial-related and acquired businesses. Due to the benefit from the settlement of all pre-separation tax disputes with the Internal Revenue Service that was discussed last quarter. We ended 2016 with a full year GAAP income tax benefit of $779 million and an adjusted effective tax rate of 18.5% for the full year. I expect the full year adjusted effective tax rate of 20% for 2017. 
Now, if you'll turn to Slide 10, our business is performing well in a challenging economic environment, driven by the resiliency of our harsh portfolio and the execution of the TE operating advantage program or TEOA. Adjusted gross margins in the quarter was 33.2%, a 70% improvement from the prior year driven by productivity improvements across the segments. Adjusted operating margins were 16.5% in the quarter and going forward into 2017, we continue to manage our business tightly and will continue to invest for future growth in our harsh businesses. Adjusted EBITDA margins help explain the profitability performance of our business including acquisitions. Adjusted EBITDA margins in Q4 were strong at 20.9%, which was up 20 basis points sequentially. In the quarter, we had strong performance, with cash flow from continuing operations of $782 million and free cash flow of $594 million, up a strong 53% from prior year. The growth was driven by significant improvements in working capital, and again, as reflective of the teams solid execution. 
For the full year, I'm pleased to report that we generated nearly $1.6 billion of free cash flow, signaling a very healthy business. Looking ahead, we continue to expect free cash flow to approximate net income and capital expenditures to be approximately 5% of revenue. We're very committed to our disciplined long-term capital strategy of a balanced return of free cash flow to shareholders, while still having ample free cash flow available for acquisitions. In 2016, we returned $3.1 billion to our shareholders through dividend and share repurchases. Our balance sheet remained strong, with reasonable debt levels and an ability to continue to support the return of capital and acquisitions going forward. We have added a balance sheet and cash flow summary in the appendix for additional details. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Terrence."

So if you could please turn to Slide 11 for the first quarter outlook. We expect first quarter revenue of $2.95 billion to $3.05 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $0.98 to $1.02, representing sales growth of 6% and 3% on an organic basis and 19% adjusted EPS growth at the midpoint. Following record adjusted EPS and strong orders in the fourth quarter, our guidance represents a strong start to our fiscal 2017. By segment, we expect Transportation Solutions to grow mid-single digits both organically and on an actual basis. This was above expected Auto production growth levels of 2% in the first quarter, driven by China as well as Europe. Commercial Transportation growth, we expect to be driven by Asia. In the industrial segment, we expect it to grow double digits overall due to the Creganna and Intercontec acquisition, and we'll be flat organically, with the weakness in oil and gas market offsetting growth in our Aerospace and Defense business. We expect low single-digit organic growth in the Communication segment, driven by Appliances and SubCom. 
If you could now turn to Slide 12 and I'll cover the full year guidance. For the full year, we expect revenue in the range of $12.3 billion to $12.9 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $4.19 to $4.49. This represents 5% overall growth, 3% organic growth and 10% adjusted earnings per share growth at the midpoint versus 52 weeks fiscal 2016 results. I feel very good about our ability to drive 3% organic growth and double-digit adjusted EPS growth in this challenging economic environment. This is in line with our overall business model and proves that our harsh strategy is delivering, while we continue to benefit from the secular trend of content growth across our harsh businesses. We expect our Transportation segment to be up mid-single digits organically on 1% global Auto production growth, next year, and this reflects content growth trends as well as share gains from the programs we've won in the past. Commercial Transportation, we expect to outperform at the end market again this year, benefiting from content expansion and the heavy truck market. And we expect our Sensors business to grow 7% in total year-over-year. In the industrial segment, we expect it to be up low single digits organically, with continued gains in Commercial Aerospace and defense, momentum in interventional medical applications, driving the growth and also stabilization in our Oil and Gas business. In the Communication segment, we expect to be up low single digits organically, with growth given by Appliances and SubCom. As I said, momentum in SubCom remain very strong with the $1 billion that we've in backlog, benefiting from the build-out of the and we expect growth in the mid-single digits in SubCom in 2017.

To reiterate, 2016 was a very good year for TE and we're expecting another very good year in 2017 with 5% overall sales growth, 3% organic growth, operating margin expansion and double-digit adjusted EPS growth, excluding the additional week in 2016. Our hearts strategies definitely delivering with 80% of revenue driven by harsh-environment applications. These products are highly engineered and developed at the application architecture level, providing a wide around our solution. Over the past 5 years, we've averaged mid-single digit growth across our harsh businesses and had multiple levers to continue to drive margin expansion. We remain active in shaping our portfolio to focus on harsh applications. Over the past year, our acquisitions have given TE a leading position and solutions for a minimally invasive medical markets, expanded our portfolio of industrial connectors and bolstered our offering of Sensors for the Auto market. At the same time, we returned over $3 billion to shareholders through buyback and dividends. Over time, we're maintain consistency with our capital strategy, returning nearly $12 billion to shareholders since we became a public company nearly 10 years ago. Moving forward, we expect free cash flow to approximate net income and continue to expect to return 2/3 of our free cash flow to our shareholders and 1/3 for acquisition. While there will be cyclicality, the market for TE has strong underlying secular trends driven by the megatrends of Using Auto as an example, these trends are driving the need for more Sensors and connectors to support increased safety features, autonomous driving system, higher emission standards and infotainment. TE benefits directly from these trends and this is reflected in our transportation guidance for fiscal 2017, where we expect to grow mid-single digits on 1% Auto production growth. We see similar drivers in our industry and Communications businesses, which will enable us to grow content. TE has multiple levers to drive revenue and EPS growth. As a world leader in connectors and Sensors, we have unmatched technology and global presence with over 7,000 engineers, we're setting the pace for new products and technology development and the driving our customers road maps with integrated solutions, which TE is uniquely positioned to provide. And all the work we've done over the last several years is translated into each dollar of revenue today is delivering 40% more EPS than 5 years ago. These are very exciting times for a TE and I'm proud of what we've accomplished this year. I'm also very happy that Terrence is exceeding been instrumental on establishing TE's global leadership position in connectivity and Sensor solutions and strengthening the company's financial position to drive value for our shareholders.

So we did have a pretty short decline and that was high margin business that has impacted the overall segment. So I do feel good we've improved the margin net of that affect if you would that affect and we do expect margin expansion next year in the segments. I don't think we're going to get up to 15% next year to your question, because we still have a pretty low organic growth in that segment and that growth is going to be driven by Aerospace and Defense, certainly in the medical space and we're also going to need some more volume to get up towards that 15%, but we've been big cost actions and do expect the margins to improve next year and to be a contributor for total TE margin expansion."

You've seen that separation come back from our growth rate and a pretty stable production environment and also in our first quarter guidance, where we're getting mid-single digits on 2% production. So I think, there's proof around our business model and our business model, as we told you, in a low growth production environment, you can have 6% of content and a little bit of price get back that sort of gets to single-digit around this 1%  production environment.

And there's no question that as the mission standards increase and you see more of a push for hybrid and electric vehicle, the content gets an upward. That's a tailwind for content. And no, it's been relatively slower than people had expected. But in China, for example, there's a huge push by the government there to transition to electric vehicle. So that's a positive trend for us and we're very, very well-positioned in the electric vehicle and the hybrid electric vehicle with our content. So yes, I think over time as the penetration of ATV vehicle increases, we're going to be seeing more content growth. We're also -- just in general, we expect to grow content to grow about 6% over the next 4 to 5 years in the vechile.

And if I missed because there was about 4 questions in there. Overall, I think when you look at the cycle we're in, one of the things that really nice about the cycle, I don't think it changes the visibility much, but the customer base is different. It is not your traditional carriers. It Is the actually the cloud operators. It is those cloud operators had a very concerned how do they make sure they had capacity as they come out with their service offering. And that has changed the customer profile than what it was 5 or 10 years ago. So they are much more active in owning the systems. Clearly from a financing perspective, it creates a different financing cycle because they do have the capital versus, in the past, that would be a part of a Telco operating budget or somebody have to go to raise financing for the project. So I think it helps accelerate the cycle a little bit, but it does come down to their offerings in the cloud. And I think what's great that you're seeing in the programs we've won, we had programs in the Atlantic, also the Pacific here and activity all around the cloud demand and the service offerings they have. So when you look at the cycle, it's very good that it's a different customer base. I think we've done a good job to a different customer base. And I think that's why you're seeing strong wins, coupled with the technology we bring, are being very strong. And I think when you look at profitability, the profitability sort of where we expect it to be at this point of cycles. At these levels and we'll have these levels again next year. You're going to be around company average, margins, maybe a little bit less, but excellent return on capital versus companies and feel good that we've the backlog in place that secure '17, and now we have to continue projects to secure '18."

Measurement really do not have an Automotive business and that's when of the reasons we like their portfolios, so we could build that up. So the program wins that we have, really when it comes to Auto, they won't be kicking in into 2018. So we're not getting the benefit of the growth, certainly as Tom talked, we're spending ahead to industrialize programs and win those programs. What's great about those programs, there're among various technologies we got with measurement as well as their multiple regions of the world. So it's not concentrated in 1 area. So we'd really like winning as coming to '18. When we look at the market conditions, because Measurement was very much focused on the industrial markets, they're getting some of the impacts of the industrial markets that I talked about in our industrial segment. So anything around general, industrial Measurement has slowed, that's when you see the organic impact that we've had. We have seen some pick up across those industrial businesses similar to what we've seen in our industrial segment, that has given us the confidence for the 3.4%, 4% organic growth next year, that's implied in our guidance.

I'm going to review the highlights of Q4 and the full year and preview fiscal 2017 guidance, then I will turn it over to Terrence to cover our performance in more detail. Before I get started, one more reminder that our fourth quarter included 14 weeks this year. 
Please turn to Slide 3. Fiscal 2016 was a very good year for TE. I'm especially pleased with our Q4 results, which included record adjusted earnings per share above the high end of our guidance and record free cash flow. We also finished the year with strong orders, setting us up for a good start to our 2017 fiscal year. A key takeaway is that on both the 13-week and 14-week basis, the company had a very good fourth quarter, exceeding our guidance and earnings and expectations in cash flow. Sales for the full 14-week quarter were $3.3 billion, essentially at the midpoint of our guidance. Excluding the extra week, sales grew 4% and 2% organically. Adjusted EPS was $1.27 on a 14-week basis, $0.07 better than the midpoint of our guidance. On a 13-week basis, adjusted EPS was $1.14, up 27% over the prior year, and as I mentioned, a new record for us. Orders of $2.95 billion were up 11% year-over-year and up 1% sequentially, excluding the extra week and our SubCom business. Adjusted operating margin was 16.5% and free cash flow was approximately $600 million. 
We continue to execute our harsh strategy, with the completion of the acquisition of Intercontec at the end of the quarter, adding a very nice range of connectivity products to our Industrial Solutions product portfolio. We also continue to execute very well in the SubCom business, with the October announcement that TE was awarded the new pacific light cable network, a trans-Pacific system, where TE is working with Google and Facebook. Q4 was a very good quarter and momentum is strong as we enter fiscal 2017. 
Now please turn to Slide 4. We were able to beat our guidance and deliver double-digit adjusted EPS growth despite a slower-than-expected economic environment. This is a good indicator of the multiple levers we have to drive performance. Our harsh businesses continued to perform well. SubCom had an excellent year, and we made several key acquisitions, including Creganna, which established us as a leader in the market from minimally invasive medical solutions. Jaquet, which expanded our sensor position in the transportation market and Intercontec, which I mentioned earlier. We also sold our Circuit Protection business and narrow our focus in the communications segment. From a financial perspective, sales were $12.24 billion. Adjusted EPS was $4.08, $0.08 above our original guidance, and free cash flow exceeded our expectations at $1.6 billion. We maintain strong operating margins of 15.8% for the full year, with operating margins in the 16%-plus range in the second half. Adjusted EBITDA margins remain strong at 20.6% in a very low growth market. We also returned $3.1 billion to shareholders in dividends and stock buyback. 
Now I'll take a minute to highlight our fiscal 2017 guidance. We expect revenue of $12.3 billion to $12.9 billion, which represent total growth of 5% and organic growth of 3% at midpoint, using a 52-week baseline in fiscal 2016. We expect adjusted EPS of $4.19 to $4.49, representing 10% growth at midpoint and another year of double-digit EPS growth when compared to the 52-week base of $3.95 in 2016. 
Before we move on, I wanted to recognize that this is the first earnings call since our announcement that Terrence Curtin will become CEO in March. I couldn't be more confident about the choice of Terrence. I also want to welcome Heath Mitts, who joined us as CFO a couple of months ago. Heath is getting up to speed very quickly and will be a strong partner for Terrence. 
Now I'll pass it over to Terrence and he will review our performance in more detail."

Before we get into the segment results and updates, I'd like to cover our orders for the quarter, which will help provide the foundation for the trends that we're seeing in our business as well as our expectations for 2017. 
If you could please turn to Slide 5. And this shows our order trends on both a 13- and 14-week basis excluding our SubCom business. I'll speak to our orders on a 13-week basis, so you have an apples-to-apples comparison versus last year and last quarter. Orders were up 11% year-over-year and our book-to-bill was 1.03. On a sequential basis, we saw 1% growth, which is stronger than normal seasonality as we typically experience a slight sequential decline. So we're clearly pleased with the order momentum as we enter into 2017. 
Geographically, we saw order growth in all regions on an organic basis. The strength overall was driven by Asia, both in China as well as outside of China with order growth of 22%. Europe and the America's orders grew approximately 3% and those regions remain stay, with continued growth in orders. From a segment perspective, in transportation, orders increased 15% year-over-year and were up 3% sequentially. As China Auto OEMs increase production ahead of the expiration of government incentives at the end of the calendar year. Industrial segment orders grew 15% year-over-year due to the Creganna acquisition and on an organic order basis, they grew 4%, with growth across each of our 3 industrial businesses. Sequentially, industrial orders declined in line with typical seasonality. In the communications segment, excluding SubCom, we saw sequential growth of 4% driven by both our Appliances and data device businesses. And Data and Devices, we are seeing increasing momentum in the business as products exits are largely behind us and year-over-year orders were up, if you exclude the impact on the sale of our Circuit Protection business. 
Now let me spend a minute on SubCom. As this business continues its strong momentum. As Tom mentioned, we were recently named as the supplier of trans-Pacific system with Google and Facebook, and with $1 billion of backlog, we expect SubCom to grow again in 2017. 
Please turn to Slide 6 to discuss the segment results and let me kick it off with our transportation segment. Segment sales grew 5% organically in the quarter on a 13-week basis, with strong growth in Auto and Commercial Transportation. This was offset by weakness in Sensors that was driven by industrial-related markets like we talked about the past few quarters. Our Auto sales in the quarter were up 6% in line with our expectations and ahead of auto production growth of 3% during the quarter due to content gains. Growth was driven by strength in Asia and in Europe, partially offset by declines in North America. Going forward, we continue to expect our Auto business to grow ahead of Auto production, driven by electronic content growth and a rich pipeline of platform ramps and design wins that we generated over the past several years. In our commercial and transportation business, we delivered very strong performance, with organic growth of 4% year-over-year despite a very challenging end market in North America. Our performance was driven by strength in China and Europe, and this was partially offset by declines in North America. 
Turning to Sensors, we saw overall growth of 4% that was driven by the acquisition of the Jaquet. We did see a 2% organic decline as we continue to be impacted by the weaknesses in industrial-related markets, which make up more than half of our Sensors sales. We continue to see strong design win momentum in the Automotive space for sensor applications and expect to begin to see meaningful revenue from these programs beginning of fiscal 2018. Adjusted operating margins in the segment were 19.6% and were in line with our expectations and were up sequentially 20 basis points. For the full year, the segment delivered 5% organic growth and 19.2% adjusted operating margins. 
If you could please turn to Slide 7, let me move over to the Industrial Solutions segment. On an overall basis, segment sales were up 16% year-over-year due to the acquisition of Creganna. On a 13-week organic basis, revenue in the segment declined 2% driven by weakness in the oil and gas and an overall slow Industrial Equipment environment. Geographically, we continue to see North America as weak, Europe as stable and China improving. 
I'll provide some color now on sales growth and our industrial businesses and this will be on a 13-week basis. In the Industrial Equipment area, we saw 15% growth, driven by the Creganna activation, which is performing ahead of our expectations. We continue to be excited about the growth potential in this minimally invasive medical market. On a pro forma basis, if we had owned Creganna this time, last year, our growth would've been greater than 10%. Excluding Creganna, the Industrial Equipment business declined 7% organically, with softness in all regions, but did show first half to second half growth of 7% as markets recovered from the first half inventory correction that we talked about earlier in the year. In the Aerospace and Defense area, we had strong growth of 6% organically, driven by share gains in both commercial air platforms and defense applications. In oil and gas, similar to prior quarters, our sales declined by 27% due to the end market conditions in that area. And finally, our Energy business had a very nice growth of 6% organically, with growth both in China as well as in the Americas. From a margin perspective, adjusted operating margins were in line with expectations, but down year-over-year. The year-over-year decline is due entirely to the Oil and Gas business, which impacted segment operating margin by approximately 100 basis points year-over-year due to the revenue declines that we saw in that business. We do expect the oil and gas impact to our margins to affect our comparisons through the first quarter of 2017, but then they'll be anniversary-ed as we get in later into the year. For the full year, the Industrial Solution segment delivered 1% actual growth and 12.3% adjusted operating margins. Organically, the segment sales declined 3% for the full year but did grow 11% from the first half to second half, following the inventory corrections that I mentioned that we experienced in the first 2 quarters. 
So if you could please turn to Slide 8, let me cover Communications Solutions. During the quarter, the Communications segment revenue was down 1% organically on a 13-week basis. The SubCom business saw 13% year-over-year growth, driven by strong execution from multiple projects that we have in for us. For the full year, SubCom grew 25% in fiscal 2016. In Appliances, on a 13-week basis, our business grew 3% organically, while Data and Devices declined 13% organically due to the effects of product exits. What was nice about Data and Devices, we did experience another quarter of sequential sales growth in the business in quarter 4 as the product exits are largely behind us. Adjusted operating margins for the segment expanded 180 basis points sequentially and 240 basis points year-over-year due to the productivity improvements and restructuring actions we've taken in the segment. For the full year, 2016, Communications Solutions declined 2% organically, driven by Data and Devices and generated 11.6% adjusted operating margins. 
Now let me hand it over to Heath, who'll cover the financials."

To start off, I'm excited to join the team here and I look forward to getting to know the investor and analyst community over the coming quarters. 
Now I'll be -- please turn to Slide 9, I'll provide more details on our Q4 earnings. Adjusted operating income was $551 million, with an adjusted operating margin of 16.5%. Excluding the extra week, our adjusted operating margin was 16%. Note that the operating income impact from the additional week was $55 million. GAAP operating income was $517 million and included $30 million of restructuring charges driven primarily by Data and Devices and $4 million of acquisition-related charges. Adjusted EPS was $1.27 for the quarter. If you exclude the $0.13 contribution from the additional week, adjusted EPS was $1.14 and up 27% year-on-year, a new company record. The growth of prior year was driven by an increase in operating income, incremental benefits from share buyback and a lower adjusted effective tax rate of 13%. The adjusted tax rate was lower than prior guidance due to the mix of profitability by region and stature expirations in certain jurisdictions. GAAP EPS was $1.22 for the quarter and included restructuring and acquisition-related charges of $0.05. For the full year, 2016, restructuring charges were $125 million and I expect similar levels for 2017 driven primarily by activity in our industrial-related and acquired businesses. Due to the benefit from the settlement of all pre-separation tax disputes with the Internal Revenue Service, that was discussed last quarter. We ended 2016 with a full year GAAP income tax benefit of $779 million and an adjusted effective tax rate of 18.5% for the full year. I expect the full year adjusted effective tax rate of 20% for 2017. 
Now, if you'll turn to Slide 10, our business is performing well in a challenging economic environment, driven by the resiliency of our harsh portfolio and the execution of the TE operating advantage program or TEOA. Adjusted gross margins in the quarter was 33.2%, a 70% improvement from the prior year driven by productivity improvements across the segments. Adjusted operating margins were 16.5% in the quarter and going forward into 2017, we continue to manage our business tightly and will continue to invest for future growth in our harsh businesses. Adjusted EBITDA margins help explain the profitability performance of our business including acquisitions. Adjusted EBITDA margins in Q4 were strong at 20.9%, which was up 20 basis points sequentially. In the quarter, we had strong performance, with cash flow from continuing operations of $782 million and free cash flow of $594 million, up a strong 53% from prior year. The growth was driven by significant improvements in working capital, and again, as reflective of the team's solid execution. 
For the full year, I'm pleased to report that we generated nearly $1.6 billion of free cash flow, signaling a very healthy business. Looking ahead, we continue to expect free cash flow to approximate net income and capital expenditures to be approximately 5% of revenue. We're very committed to our disciplined long-term capital strategy of a balanced return of free cash flow to shareholders, while still having ample free cash flow available for acquisitions. In 2016, we returned $3.1 billion to our shareholders through dividend and share repurchases. Our balance sheet remained strong, with reasonable debt levels and an ability to continue to support the return of capital and acquisitions going forward. We have added a balance sheet and cash flow summary in the appendix for additional details. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Terrence."

And now, I'll cover our guidance for the first quarter and the full year 2017. So if you could please turn to Slide 11 for the first quarter outlook.

So if you could please turn to Slide 11 for the first quarter outlook. We expect first quarter revenue of $2.95 billion to $3.05 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $0.98 to $1.02, representing sales growth of 6% and 3% on an organic basis and 19% adjusted EPS growth at the midpoint. Following record adjusted EPS and strong orders in the fourth quarter, our guidance represents a strong start to our fiscal 2017. By segment, we expect Transportation Solutions to grow mid-single digits both organically and on an actual basis. This was above expected Auto production growth levels of 2% in the first quarter, driven by China as well as Europe. Commercial Transportation growth, we expect to be driven by Asia. In the industrial segment, we expect it to grow double digits overall due to the Creganna and Intercontec acquisition, and we'll be flat organically, with the weakness in oil and gas market offsetting growth in our Aerospace and Defense business. We expect low single-digit organic growth in the Communication segment, driven by Appliances and SubCom. 
If you could now turn to Slide 12 and I'll cover the full year guidance. For the full year, we expect revenue in the range of $12.3 billion to $12.9 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $4.19 to $4.49. This represents 5% overall growth, 3% organic growth and 10% adjusted earnings per share growth at the midpoint versus 52 weeks fiscal 2016 results. I feel very good about our ability to drive 3% organic growth and double-digit adjusted EPS growth in this challenging economic environment. This is in line with our overall business model and proves that our harsh strategy is delivering, while we continue to benefit from the secular trend of content growth across our harsh businesses. We expect our Transportation segment to be up mid-single digits organically on 1% global Auto production growth, next year, and this reflects content growth trends as well as share gains from the programs we've won in the past. Commercial Transportation, we expect to outperform at the end market again, this year, benefiting from content expansion in the heavy truck market. And we expect our Sensors business to grow 7% in total year-over-year. In the Industrial segment, we expect it to be up low single digits organically, with continued gains in Commercial Aerospace and Defense, momentum in interventional medical ad publications, driving the growth and also stabilization in our Oil and Gas business. In the Communication segment, we expect to be up low single digits organically, with growth given by Appliances and SubCom. As I said, momentum in SubCom remains very strong, with the $1 billion that we have in backlog, benefiting from the build out of the cloud, and we expect growth in the mid-single digits in SubCom in 2017. 
Now let me turn it back over to Tom for some closing comments"

To reiterate, 2016 was a very good year for TE and we're expecting another very good year in 2017, with 5% overall sales growth, 3% organic growth, operating margin expansion and double-digit adjusted EPS growth, excluding the additional week in 2016. Our harsh strategy is definitely delivering, with 80% of our revenue driven by harsh environment applications. These products are highly engineered and developed at the application architecture level, providing a wide mode around our solution. Over the past 5 years, we've averaged mid-single-digit growth across our harsh businesses and have multiple levers to continue to drive margin expansion. We have remained active in shaping our portfolio to focus on harsh applications. Over the past year, our acquisitions have given TE a leading position and solutions for the minimally invasive medical markets, expanded our portfolio of industrial connectors and bolstered our offering of Sensors for the Auto market. At the same time, we returned over $3 billion to shareholders through buybacks and dividend. Over time, we have maintained consistency with our capital strategy, returning nearly $12 billion to shareholders since we became a public company, nearly 10 years ago. 
Moving forward, we expect free cash flow to approximate net income and continue to expect to return 2/3 of our free cash flow to shareholders and use 1/3 for acquisitions. While there will be cyclicality, the market for TE serves a strong underlying secular trends driven by the megatrends of safe, green and connected. Using Auto as an example, these trends are driving the need for more Sensors and connectors to support increased safety features, autonomous driving system, higher emission standards and infotainment. TE benefits directly from these trends and this is reflected in our transportation guidance for fiscal 2017, where we expect to grow mid-single digits on 1% Auto production growth. We see similar drivers in our Industrial and Communications businesses, which will enable us to grow content. TE has multiple levers to drive revenue and EPS growth. As a world leader in connectors and Sensors, we have unmatched technology and global presence. With over 7,000 engineers, we are setting the pace for new products and technology development and are driving our customer's road maps with integrated solutions, which TE is uniquely positioned to provide. And all the work we've done over the last several years is translated into each dollar of revenue today, delivering 40% more EPS than 5 years ago. These are very exciting times for TE and I'm proud of what we have accomplished this year. 
I'm also very happy that Terrence is succeeding as he's been instrumental in establishing TE's global leadership position in connectivity and Sensor solutions and strengthening the company's financial performance to drive value for our shareholders. We prepared Terrence for this role over several years and I will continue on as Executive Chairman of the Board, making sure this is a seamless transition.

We do think China, when we look at the 1% is going to be about 3% production growth for the overall year in that 1%. We do expect Europe to sort of be low single-digit production growth and North America to be flat when we sort of look at it through the next year.

So I do feel good we've improved the margin net of that effect, if you remove that effect, and we do expect margin expansion next year in the segments. I don't think we're going to get up to 15% next year and to your question, because we still have a pretty low organic growth in that segment and that growth is going to be driven by Aerospace and Defense, certainly, in the medical space, and we're also going to need some more volume to get up towards that 15%, but we have been doing cost actions and do expect the margins to improve next year and to be a contributor for total TE margin expansion."

And it is around both content and share gains. Wamsi, it's not one or the other. And I think you've seen that both in our fourth quarter. You've seen that separation come back from our growth rate in a pretty stable production environment and also in our first quarter guidance, where we're guiding mid-single digits on 2% production. So I think, there's proof around our business model and our business model, as we told you, in a low growth production environment, you can have 6% of content and then a little bit of price get back that sort of gets to that mid-single digit around this 1% production environment.

Is there anything different with this round, or the terms and covenants, such as better visibility or worse or similar profitability or worse or better?

Today, we're guiding 1%. We're guiding 4% to 5% revenue growth. So that combination of content and designing -- continued designing for us. And there's no question that as the mission standards increase and you see more of a push for hybrid and electric vehicle, the content -- that's an upward. That's a tailwind for content. And no, it's been relatively slower than people expected. But in China, for example, there's a huge push by the government there to transition to electric vehicle. So that's a real positive trend for us and we're very, very well positioned in the electric vehicle and the hybrid electric vehicle with our content. So yes, I think over time as the penetration of ATV vehicles increases, we're going to be seeing more content growth. We'd also -- just in general, we expect content to grow about 6% over the next 4 to 5 years in the vehicle. So it's a really good sustainable long-term trend that we're well positioned to take advantage of."

And if I missed any of it just hit me at the end because there was about 4 questions in there I think. Overall, I think when you look at the cycle we're in, one of the things that's really nice about the cycle, I don't think it changes the visibility much, but the customer base is different. It is not your traditional carriers. It is the -- actually, the cloud operators. So it is -- those cloud operators are very concerned how do they make sure they have capacity as they come out with their service offering. And that has changed the customer profile than what it was 5, 10 years ago. So they are much more active in owning the systems. Clearly from a financing perspective, it creates a different financing cycle because they do have the capital versus, in the past that would be a part of a Telco operating budget or somebody had to go raise financing for the project. So I think it helps accelerate the cycle a little bit, but it does come down to their offerings in the cloud. And I think what's great that you're seeing in the programs we've won, we had programs in the Atlantic, also the Pacific here and there were activities all around the cloud demand and the service offerings they have. So when you look at the cycle, it's very good that it's a different customer base. I think we've done a good job adapting to a different customer base. And I think that's why you're seeing the strong wins, coupled with the technology we bring that being very strong. And I think when you look at profitability, the profitability is sort of where we expect it to be at this point of the cycle. At these levels and we'll have these levels again next year. You're going to be around company average, margins, maybe a little bit less, but excellent return on capital versus companies whack and feel good that we had the backlog in place that secure '17, and now we have to continue in projects to secure '18."

Measurement really did not have an Automotive business and that's one of the reasons we like their portfolios, so that we could build that up. So the program wins that we have, really, when it comes to Auto, they won't be kicking in into 2018. So we're not getting the benefit of the growth, certainly as Tom talked. We're spending ahead to industrialize all the programs and win those programs. What's great about those programs. They're among various technologies we got with Measurement as well as they're in multiple regions of the world. So it's not concentrated in one area. So we really like the breadth of the winning as that'll coming into '18. When we look at the market conditions, because Measurement was very much focused on the industrial markets, they were getting some of the impacts of the industrial markets that I've talked about in our industrial segment. So anything around general, industrial because the Measurement has been slowing. And that's what you see in the organic impact that we had. We have seen some pick up across those industrial businesses similar to what we've seen in our industrial segment. That has given us the confidence for the 3.4%, 4% organic growth next year, that's implied in our guidance. But the Auto program still will not be coming in meaningfully until 2018."

I'm going to review the highlights of Q4 and the full year and preview fiscal 2017 guidance, then I will turn it over to Terrence to cover our performance in more detail. Before I get started, one more reminder that our fourth quarter included 14 weeks this year. 
Please turn to Slide 3. Fiscal 2016 was a very good year for TE. I'm especially pleased with our Q4 results, which included record adjusted earnings per share above the high end of our guidance and record free cash flow. We also finished the year with strong orders, setting us up for a good start to our 2017 fiscal year. A key takeaway is that on both a 13-week and 14-week basis, the company had a very good fourth quarter, exceeding our guidance and earnings and expectations in cash flow. Sales for the full 14-week quarter were $3.3 billion, essentially at the midpoint of our guidance. Excluding the extra week, sales grew 4%, and 2% organically. Adjusted EPS was $1.27 on a 14-week basis, $0.07 better than the midpoint of our guidance. On a 13-week basis, adjusted EPS was $1.14, up 27% over the prior year, and as I mentioned, a new record for us. Orders of $2.95 billion were up 11% year-over-year and up 1% sequentially excluding the extra week and our SubCom business. Adjusted operating margin was 16.5% and free cash flow was approximately $600 million. 
We continue to execute our harsh strategy, with the completion of the acquisition of Intercontec at the end of the quarter adding a very nice range of connectivity products to our Industrial Solutions product portfolio. We also continued to execute very well in the SubCom business with the October announcement that TE was awarded the new Pacific Light Cable Network, a trans-Pacific system, where TE is working with Google and Facebook. Q4 was a very good quarter, and momentum is strong as we enter fiscal 2017. 
Now please turn to Slide 4. We were able to beat our guidance and deliver double-digit adjusted EPS growth despite a slower-than-expected economic environment. This is a good indicator of the multiple levers we have to drive performance. Our harsh businesses continued to perform well. SubCom had an excellent year, and we made several key acquisitions, including Creganna, which established us as a leader in the market for minimally invasive medical solutions; Jaquet, which expanded our sensor position in the transportation market; and Intercontec, which I mentioned earlier. We also sold our Circuit Protection business to narrow our focus in the communications segment. From a financial perspective, sales were $12.24 billion. Adjusted EPS was $4.08, $0.08 above our original guidance, and free cash flow exceeded our expectations at $1.6 billion. We maintain strong operating margins of 15.8% for the full year, with operating margins in the 16%-plus range in the second half. Adjusted EBITDA margins remain strong at 20.6% in a very low growth market. We also returned $3.1 billion to shareholders in dividends and stock buybacks. 
Now I'll take a minute to highlight our fiscal 2017 guidance. We expect revenue of $12.3 billion to $12.9 billion, which represent total growth of 5% and organic growth of 3% at midpoint using a 52-week baseline in fiscal 2016. We expect adjusted EPS of $4.19 to $4.49, representing 10% growth at midpoint and another year of double-digit EPS growth when compared to the 52-week base of $3.95 in 2016. 
Before we move on, I wanted to recognize that this is the first earnings call since our announcement that Terrence Curtin will become CEO in March. I couldn't be more confident about the choice of Terrence. I also want to welcome Heath Mitts, who joined us as CFO a couple of months ago. Heath is getting up to speed very quickly and will be a strong partner for Terrence. 
Now I'll pass it over to Terrence, and he will review our performance in more detail."

Before we get into the segment results and updates, I'd like to cover our orders for the quarter, which will help provide the foundation for the trends that we're seeing in our business as well as our expectations for 2017. 
If you could please turn to Slide 5. And this shows our order trends on both a 13- and 14-week basis excluding our SubCom business. I'll speak to our orders on a 13-week basis so you have an apples-to-apples comparison versus last year and last quarter. Orders were up 11% year-over-year, and our book-to-bill was 1.03. On a sequential basis, we saw 1% growth, which is stronger than normal seasonality as we typically experience a slight sequential decline. So we're clearly pleased with the order momentum as we enter into 2017. 
Geographically, we saw order growth in all regions on an organic basis. The strength overall was driven by Asia, both in China as well as outside of China with order growth of 22%. Europe and the America's orders grew approximately 3% and those regions remain steady with continued growth in orders. From a segment perspective, in transportation, orders increased 15% year-over-year and were up 3% sequentially as China auto OEMs increased production ahead of the expiration of government incentives at the end of the calendar year.
Industrial segment orders grew 15% year-over-year due to the Creganna acquisition and on an organic order basis, they grew 4%, with growth across each of our 3 industrial businesses. Sequentially, industrial orders declined in line with typical seasonality.
In the communications segment, excluding SubCom, we saw sequential growth of 4% driven by both our Appliances and data device businesses. In Data and Devices, we are seeing increasing momentum in the business as product exits are largely behind us, and year-over-year orders were up, if you exclude the impact on the sale of our Circuit Protection business. 
Now let me spend a minute on SubCom, as this business continues its strong momentum. As Tom mentioned, we were recently named as the supplier of trans-Pacific system with Google and Facebook, and with $1 billion of backlog, we expect SubCom to grow again in 2017. 
Please turn to Slide 6 to discuss the segment results, and let me kick it off with our transportation segment. Segment sales grew 5% organically in the quarter on a 13-week basis, with strong growth in Auto and Commercial Transportation. This was offset by weakness in Sensors that was driven by industrial-related markets like we talked about the past few quarters. Our Auto sales in the quarter were up 6%, in line with our expectations and ahead of auto production growth of 3% during the quarter, due to content gains. Growth was driven by strength in Asia and in Europe, partially offset by declines in North America. Going forward, we continue to expect our Auto business to grow ahead of Auto production, driven by electronic content growth and a rich pipeline of platform ramps and design wins that we generated over the past several years. In our commercial and transportation business, we delivered very strong performance, with organic growth of 4% year-over-year despite a very challenging end market in North America. Our performance was driven by strength in China and Europe, and this was partially offset by declines in North America. 
Turning to Sensors, we saw overall growth of 4% that was driven by the acquisition of the Jaquet. We did see a 2% organic decline as we continue to be impacted by the weaknesses in the industrial-related markets, which make up more than half of our Sensors sales. We continue to see strong design win momentum in the Automotive space for sensor applications and expect to begin to see meaningful revenue from these programs beginning in fiscal 2018. Adjusted operating margins in the segment were 19.6% and were in line with our expectations and were up sequentially 20 basis points. For the full year, the segment delivered 5% organic growth and 19.2% adjusted operating margins. 
If you could please turn to Slide 7, let me move over to the Industrial Solutions segment. On an overall basis, segment sales were up 16% year-over-year due to the acquisition of Creganna. On a 13-week organic basis, revenue in the segment declined 2%, driven by weakness in the oil and gas and an overall slow Industrial Equipment environment. Geographically, we continue to see North America as weak, Europe as stable and China improving. 
I'll provide some color now on sales growth and our industrial businesses, and this will be on a 13-week basis. In the Industrial Equipment area, we saw 15% growth, driven by the Creganna acquisition, which is performing ahead of our expectations. We continue to be excited about the growth potential in this minimally invasive medical market. On a pro forma basis, if we had owned Creganna this time last year, our growth would've been greater than 10%. Excluding Creganna, the Industrial Equipment business declined 7% organically, with softness in all regions, but did show first half to second half growth of 7% as markets recovered from the first half inventory correction that we talked about earlier in the year. In the Aerospace and Defense area, we had strong growth of 6% organically, driven by share gains in both commercial air platforms and defense applications. In oil and gas, similar to prior quarters, our sales declined by 27% due to the end market conditions in that area. And finally, our Energy business had a very nice growth of 6% organically, with growth both in China as well as in the Americas. From a margin perspective, adjusted operating margins were in line with expectations, but down year-over-year. The year-over-year decline is due entirely to the Oil and Gas business, which impacted segment operating margin by approximately 100 basis points year-over-year due to the revenue declines that we saw in that business. We do expect the oil and gas impact to our margins to affect our comparisons through the first quarter of 2017, but then they'll be anniversary-ed as we get in later into the year. For the full year, the Industrial Solution segment delivered 1% actual growth and 12.3% adjusted operating margins. Organically, the segment sales declined 3% for the full year but did grow 11% from the first half to second half, following the inventory corrections that I mentioned that we experienced in the first 2 quarters. 
So if you could please turn to Slide 8, let me cover Communications Solutions. During the quarter, the Communications segment revenue was down 1% organically on a 13-week basis. The SubCom business saw 13% year-over-year growth, driven by strong execution from multiple projects that we have in for us. For the full year, SubCom grew 25% in fiscal 2016. In Appliances, on a 13-week basis, our business grew 3% organically, while Data and Devices declined 13% organically due to the effects of product exits. What was nice about Data and Devices, we did experience another quarter of sequential sales growth in the business in quarter 4 as the product exits are largely behind us. Adjusted operating margins for the segment expanded 180 basis points sequentially and 240 basis points year-over-year due to the productivity improvements and restructuring actions we've taken in the segment. For the full year, 2016, Communications Solutions declined 2% organically, driven by Data and Devices, and generated 11.6% adjusted operating margins. 
Now let me hand it over to Heath, who'll cover the financials."

To start off, I'm excited to join the team here and I look forward to getting to know the investor and analyst community over the coming quarters. 
Now if you’d please turn to Slide 9, I'll provide more details on our Q4 earnings. Adjusted operating income was $551 million, with an adjusted operating margin of 16.5%. Excluding the extra week, our adjusted operating margin was 16%. Note that the operating income impact from the additional week was $55 million. GAAP operating income was $517 million and included $30 million of restructuring charges driven primarily by Data and Devices and $4 million of acquisition-related charges. Adjusted EPS was $1.27 for the quarter. If you exclude the $0.13 contribution from the additional week, adjusted EPS was $1.14 and up 27% year-on-year, a new company record. The growth above prior year was driven by an increase in operating income, incremental benefits from share buyback and a lower adjusted effective tax rate of 13%. The adjusted tax rate was lower than prior guidance due to the mix of profitability by region and statute expirations in certain jurisdictions. GAAP EPS was $1.22 for the quarter and included restructuring and acquisition-related charges of $0.05. For the full year 2016, restructuring charges were $125 million, and I expect similar levels for 2017 driven primarily by activity in our industrial-related and acquired businesses. Due to the benefit from the settlement of all pre-separation tax disputes with the Internal Revenue Service that was discussed last quarter, we ended 2016 with a full year GAAP income tax benefit of $779 million and an adjusted effective tax rate of 18.5% for the full year. I expect a full year adjusted effective tax rate of 20% for 2017. 
Now, if you'll turn to Slide 10. Our business is performing well in a challenging economic environment, driven by the resiliency of our harsh portfolio and the execution of the TE Operating Advantage program, or TEOA. Adjusted gross margins in the quarter was 33.2%, a 70% improvement from the prior year driven by productivity improvements across the segments. Adjusted operating margins were 16.5% in the quarter and going forward into 2017, we continue to manage our business tightly and will continue to invest for future growth in our harsh businesses. Adjusted EBITDA margins help explain the profitability performance of our business including acquisitions. Adjusted EBITDA margins in Q4 were strong at 20.9%, which was up 20 basis points sequentially. In the quarter, we had strong performance, with cash flow from continuing operations of $782 million and free cash flow of $594 million, up a strong 53% from prior year. The growth was driven by significant improvements in working capital, and again, is reflective of the team's solid execution. 
For the full year, I'm pleased to report that we generated nearly $1.6 billion of free cash flow, signaling a very healthy business. Looking ahead, we continue to expect free cash flow to approximate net income and capital expenditures to be approximately 5% of revenue. We're very committed to our disciplined long-term capital strategy of a balanced return of free cash flow to shareholders, while still having ample free cash flow available for acquisitions. In 2016, we returned $3.1 billion to our shareholders through dividend and share repurchases. Our balance sheet remained strong, with reasonable debt levels and an ability to continue to support the return of capital and acquisitions going forward. We have added a balance sheet and cash flow summary in the appendix for additional details. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Terrence."

And now, I'll cover our guidance for the first quarter and the full year 2017. So if you could please turn to Slide 11 for the first quarter outlook.

So if you could please turn to Slide 11 for the first quarter outlook. We expect first quarter revenue of $2.95 billion to $3.05 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $0.98 to $1.02, representing sales growth of 6%, and 3% on an organic basis, and 19% adjusted EPS growth at the midpoint. Following record adjusted EPS and strong orders in the fourth quarter, our guidance represents a strong start to our fiscal 2017. By segment, we expect Transportation Solutions to grow mid-single digits both organically and on an actual basis. This was above expected Auto production growth levels of 2% in the first quarter, driven by China as well as Europe. Commercial Transportation growth we expect to be driven by Asia. In the industrial segment, we expect it to grow double digits overall due to the Creganna and Intercontec acquisition, and will be flat organically, with the weakness in oil and gas market offsetting growth in our Aerospace and Defense business. We expect low single-digit organic growth in the Communication segment, driven by Appliances and SubCom. 
If you could now turn to Slide 12 and I'll cover the full year guidance. For the full year, we expect revenue in the range of $12.3 billion to $12.9 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $4.19 to $4.49. This represents 5% overall growth, 3% organic growth and 10% adjusted earnings per share growth at the midpoint versus 52 weeks fiscal 2016 results. I feel very good about our ability to drive 3% organic growth and double-digit adjusted EPS growth in this challenging economic environment. This is in line with our overall business model and proves that our harsh strategy is delivering, while we continue to benefit from the secular trend of content growth across our harsh businesses. We expect our Transportation segment to be up mid-single digits organically on 1% global Auto production growth next year, and this reflects content growth trends as well as share gains from the programs we've won in the past. Commercial Transportation we expect to outperform at the end market again this year, benefiting from content expansion in the heavy truck market. And we expect our Sensors business to grow 7% in total year-over-year. In the Industrial segment, we expect it to be up low single digits organically, with continued gains in Commercial Aerospace and Defense, momentum in interventional medical applications, driving the growth and also stabilization in our Oil and Gas business. In the Communication segment, we expect to be up low single digits organically, with growth driven by Appliances and SubCom. As I said, momentum in SubCom remains very strong, with the $1 billion that we have in backlog benefiting from the build out of the cloud, and we expect growth in the mid-single digits in SubCom in 2017. 
Now let me turn it back over to Tom for some closing comments"
8106523,403548757,1070082,"TE Connectivity Ltd., Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2016",2016-11-02,"Earnings Calls","TE Connectivity plc","Executives","Thanks, Terrence.

To reiterate, 2016 was a very good year for TE, and we're expecting another very good year in 2017, with 5% overall sales growth, 3% organic growth, operating margin expansion and double-digit adjusted EPS growth excluding the additional week in 2016. Our harsh strategy is definitely delivering, with 80% of our revenue driven by harsh environment applications. These products are highly engineered and developed at the application architecture level, providing a wide moat around our solution. Over the past 5 years, we've averaged mid-single-digit growth across our harsh businesses and have multiple levers to continue to drive margin expansion. We have remained active in shaping our portfolio to focus on harsh applications. Over the past year, our acquisitions have given TE a leading position in solutions for the minimally invasive medical markets, expanded our portfolio of industrial connectors and bolstered our offering of sensors for the auto market. At the same time, we returned over $3 billion to shareholders through buybacks and dividend. Over time, we have maintained consistency with our capital strategy, returning nearly $12 billion to shareholders since we became a public company nearly 10 years ago. 
Moving forward, we expect free cash flow to approximate net income and continue to expect to return 2/3 of our free cash flow to shareholders and use 1/3 for acquisitions. While there will be cyclicality, the markets that TE serves a strong underlying secular trends driven by the megatrends of safe, green and connected. Using Auto as an example, these trends are driving the need for more sensors and connectors to support increased safety features, autonomous driving system, higher emission standards and infotainment. TE benefits directly from these trends, and this is reflected in our transportation guidance for fiscal 2017, where we expect to grow mid-single digits on 1% auto production growth. We see similar drivers in our Industrial and Communications businesses, which will enable us to grow content. TE has multiple levers to drive revenue and EPS growth. As a world leader in connectors and sensors, we have unmatched technology and global presence. With over 7,000 engineers, we are setting the pace for new products and technology development and are driving our customer's road maps with integrated solutions, which TE is uniquely positioned to provide. And all the work we've done over the last several years has translated into each dollar of revenue today delivering 40% more EPS than 5 years ago. These are very exciting times for TE, and I'm proud of what we have accomplished this year. 
I'm also very happy that Terrence is succeeding me, as he's been instrumental in establishing TE's global leadership position in connectivity and Sensor solutions and strengthening the company's financial performance to drive value for our shareholders. We’ve prepared Terrence for this role over several years, and I will continue on as Executive Chairman of the Board, making sure this is a seamless transition.

I think when you look at next year, and when we talk about the 1% production growth, the first quarter we do see 2% production growth, really driven as we've seen some acceleration in production in China and then I think you're going to see it being more -- 1% or less for the rest of the year. We do think China, when we look at the 1% is going to be about 3% production growth for the overall year in that 1%. We do expect Europe to sort of be low single-digit production growth and North America to be flat when we sort of look at it through next year.

Your guidance here inarguably, which is prudent given the weakness that we're seeing across different regions of 1% production growth, is implying a 5% growth in transport. So can you help sort of talk a little bit, maybe, in a little bit more detail around some of the share gains and increased content drivers that you sort of alluded to on the call, which gives you confidence that, that you can bridge this wider gap of almost 4 points incremental growth from a content perspective? And I have a follow-up."

Actually, when you look at it, earlier in this year, as we covered, there were supply chain corrections that we had in China earlier in the year as well as North America sort of middle of the year. And that were in a pretty stable environment to where we're at today from a production. I think you're going to see that content growth to that separation. And it is around both content and share gains. Wamsi, it's not one or the other. And I think you've seen that both in our fourth quarter. You've seen that separation come back from our growth rate in a pretty stable production environment and also in our first quarter guidance, where we're guiding mid-single digits on 2% production. So I think, there's proof around our business model and our business model, as we told you, in a low growth production environment, you can have 6% of content and then a little bit of price get back that sort of gets to that mid-single digit around this 1% production environment. And we feel very confident with the gains we have in all the global platforms we're on, even in a 1% production environment, we can drive that type of growth."

And then my second follow-up question is, on the subsea business that you're winning, which is nice to see that, is there anything different with this round of the terms and covenants, such as better visibility or worse or similar profitability or worse or better? And also I assume that simply because it's not being funded by governments or the telecom operators that the funding is probably more in place versus past cycles, so maybe a little bit more visibility. If you can touch on that, that would be great?"

We might ask to have you repeat the second question. My memory, I'm not sure I’ll hold it all.

We might ask to have you repeat the second question. My memory, I'm not sure I’ll hold it all. But regarding content, Jim, definitely, if you look back to 4, 5 years ago, we would have said if we were guiding 1% production growth, we would probably been guiding 3%, maybe 4% revenue growth. Today, we're guiding 1%. We're guiding 4% to 5% revenue growth. So that combination of content and design-ins -- continued design-ins for us. And there's no question that as emission standards increase and you see more of a push for hybrid and electric vehicle, the content -- that's an upward. That's a tailwind for content. And no, it's been relatively slower than people expected. But in China, for example, there's a huge push by the government there to transition to electric vehicle. So that's a real positive trend for us, and we're very, very well positioned in the electric vehicle and the hybrid electric vehicle with our content. So yes, I think over time as the penetration of ATV vehicles increases, we're going to be seeing more content growth. We'd also -- just in general, we expect content to grow about 6% over the next 4 to 5 years in the vehicle. So it's a really good, sustainable long-term trend that we're well positioned to take advantage of."

And if I miss any of it just hit me at the end because there was about 4 questions in there I think. Overall, I think when you look at the cycle we're in, one of the things that's really nice about the cycle, I don't think it changes the visibility much, but the customer base is different. It is not your traditional carriers. It is the -- actually, the cloud operators. So it is -- those cloud operators are very concerned how do they make sure they have capacity as they come out with their service offering. And that has changed the customer profile than what it was 5, 10 years ago. So they are much more active in owning the systems. Clearly from a financing perspective, it creates a different financing cycle because they do have the capital versus in the past that would be a part of a Telco operating budget or somebody had to go raise financing for the project. So I think it helps accelerate the cycle a little bit, but it does come down to their offerings in the cloud. And I think what's great that you've seen in the programs we've won, we had programs in the Atlantic, also the Pacific here and they’re activities all around the cloud demand and the service offerings they have. So when you look at the cycle, it's very good that it's a different customer base. I think we've done a good job adapting to a different customer base. And I think that's why you're seeing the strong wins, coupled with the technology we bring, that being very strong. And I think when you look at profitability, the profitability is sort of where we expect it to be at this point of the cycle. At these levels and we'll have these levels again next year. You're going to be around company average margins, maybe a little bit less, but excellent return on capital versus company’s WAC and feel good that we had the backlog in place that secure '17, and now we have to continue to win projects to secure '18."

So when you look at it, it's split pretty much organic and inorganic that 7% pretty evenly between the inorganic and organic. When you think about, you're exactly right, when you think about Measurement. Measurement really did not have an Automotive business and that's one of the reasons we like their portfolios, so that we could build that up. So the program wins that we have, really, when it comes to Auto, they won't be kicking in until 2018. So we're not getting the benefit of the growth, certainly as Tom talked. We're spending ahead to industrialize all the programs and win those programs. What's great about those programs, they're among various technologies we got with Measurement as well as they're in multiple regions of the world. So it's not concentrated in one area. So we really like the breadth that we’re winning as that'll coming into '18. When we look at the market conditions, because Measurement was very much focused on the industrial markets, they were getting some of the impacts of the industrial markets that I've talked about in our industrial segment. So anything around general and industrial, test and measurement has been slowing. And that's what you see in the organic impact that we had. We have seen some pick up across those industrial businesses similar to what we've seen in our industrial segment. That has given us the confidence for the 3.5%, 4% organic growth next year, that's implied in our guidance. But the Auto program still will not be coming in meaningfully until 2018."

So I think, when you think about our Automotive business this year and ahead, you're going to see production in the first half, be a little bit more in the first quarter and then the second quarter, due mainly to that China phenomenon, and we aren't assuming any new incentives right now in our guidance.

The second big driver is as medical becomes organic growth later half of the year, like I talked about Creganna, that's -- the minimally invasive market is 7% growth market, we're growing about 10% pro forma in that. So we feel good about those 2 being the big drivers in the industrial market next year.

I'm going to review the highlights of Q4 and the full year and preview fiscal 2017 guidance, then I will turn it over to Terrence to cover our performance in more detail. Before I get started, one more reminder that our fourth quarter included 14 weeks this year. 
Please turn to Slide 3. Fiscal 2016 was a very good year for TE. I'm especially pleased with our Q4 results, which included record adjusted earnings per share above the high end of our guidance and record free cash flow. We also finished the year with strong orders, setting us up for a good start to our 2017 fiscal year. A key takeaway is that on both a 13-week and 14-week basis, the company had a very good fourth quarter, exceeding our guidance and earnings and expectations in cash flow. Sales for the full 14-week quarter were $3.3 billion, essentially at the midpoint of our guidance. Excluding the extra week, sales grew 4%, and 2% organically. Adjusted EPS was $1.27 on a 14-week basis, $0.07 better than the midpoint of our guidance. On a 13-week basis, adjusted EPS was $1.14, up 27% over the prior year, and as I mentioned, a new record for us. Orders of $2.95 billion were up 11% year-over-year and up 1% sequentially excluding the extra week and our SubCom business. Adjusted operating margin was 16.5% and free cash flow was approximately $600 million. 
We continue to execute our harsh strategy, with the completion of the acquisition of Intercontec at the end of the quarter adding a very nice range of connectivity products to our Industrial Solutions product portfolio. We also continued to execute very well in the SubCom business with the October announcement that TE was awarded the new Pacific Light Cable Network, a trans-Pacific system, where TE is working with Google and Facebook. Q4 was a very good quarter, and momentum is strong as we enter fiscal 2017. 
Now please turn to Slide 4. We were able to beat our guidance and deliver double-digit adjusted EPS growth despite a slower-than-expected economic environment. This is a good indicator of the multiple levers we have to drive performance. Our harsh businesses continued to perform well. SubCom had an excellent year, and we made several key acquisitions, including Creganna, which established us as a leader in the market for minimally invasive medical solutions; Jaquet, which expanded our sensor position in the transportation market; and Intercontec, which I mentioned earlier. We also sold our Circuit Protection business to narrow our focus in the communications segment. From a financial perspective, sales were $12.24 billion. Adjusted EPS was $4.08, $0.08 above our original guidance, and free cash flow exceeded our expectations at $1.6 billion. We maintain strong operating margins of 15.8% for the full year, with operating margins in the 16%-plus range in the second half. Adjusted EBITDA margins remain strong at 20.6% in a very low growth market. We also returned $3.1 billion to shareholders in dividends and stock buybacks. 
Now I'll take a minute to highlight our fiscal 2017 guidance. We expect revenue of $12.3 billion to $12.9 billion, which represent total growth of 5% and organic growth of 3% at midpoint using a 52-week baseline in fiscal 2016. We expect adjusted EPS of $4.19 to $4.49, representing 10% growth at midpoint and another year of double-digit EPS growth when compared to the 52-week base of $3.95 in 2016. 
Before we move on, I wanted to recognize that this is the first earnings call since our announcement that Terrence Curtin will become CEO in March. I couldn't be more confident about the choice of Terrence. I also want to welcome Heath Mitts, who joined us as CFO a couple of months ago. Heath is getting up to speed very quickly and will be a strong partner for Terrence. 
Now I'll pass it over to Terrence, and he will review our performance in more detail."

Before we get into the segment results and updates, I'd like to cover our orders for the quarter, which will help provide the foundation for the trends that we're seeing in our business as well as our expectations for 2017. 
If you could please turn to Slide 5. And this shows our order trends on both a 13- and 14-week basis excluding our SubCom business. I'll speak to our orders on a 13-week basis so you have an apples-to-apples comparison versus last year and last quarter. Orders were up 11% year-over-year, and our book-to-bill was 1.03. On a sequential basis, we saw 1% growth, which is stronger than normal seasonality as we typically experience a slight sequential decline. So we're clearly pleased with the order momentum as we enter into 2017. 
Geographically, we saw order growth in all regions on an organic basis. The strength overall was driven by Asia, both in China as well as outside of China with order growth of 22%. Europe and the America's orders grew approximately 3% and those regions remain steady with continued growth in orders. From a segment perspective, in transportation, orders increased 15% year-over-year and were up 3% sequentially as China auto OEMs increased production ahead of the expiration of government incentives at the end of the calendar year.
Industrial segment orders grew 15% year-over-year due to the Creganna acquisition and on an organic order basis, they grew 4%, with growth across each of our 3 industrial businesses. Sequentially, industrial orders declined in line with typical seasonality.
In the communications segment, excluding SubCom, we saw sequential growth of 4% driven by both our Appliances and data device businesses. In Data and Devices, we are seeing increasing momentum in the business as product exits are largely behind us, and year-over-year orders were up, if you exclude the impact on the sale of our Circuit Protection business. 
Now let me spend a minute on SubCom, as this business continues its strong momentum. As Tom mentioned, we were recently named as the supplier of trans-Pacific system with Google and Facebook, and with $1 billion of backlog, we expect SubCom to grow again in 2017. 
Please turn to Slide 6 to discuss the segment results, and let me kick it off with our transportation segment. Segment sales grew 5% organically in the quarter on a 13-week basis, with strong growth in Auto and Commercial Transportation. This was offset by weakness in Sensors that was driven by industrial-related markets like we talked about the past few quarters. Our Auto sales in the quarter were up 6%, in line with our expectations and ahead of auto production growth of 3% during the quarter, due to content gains. Growth was driven by strength in Asia and in Europe, partially offset by declines in North America. Going forward, we continue to expect our Auto business to grow ahead of Auto production, driven by electronic content growth and a rich pipeline of platform ramps and design wins that we generated over the past several years. In our commercial and transportation business, we delivered very strong performance, with organic growth of 4% year-over-year despite a very challenging end market in North America. Our performance was driven by strength in China and Europe, and this was partially offset by declines in North America. 
Turning to Sensors, we saw overall growth of 4% that was driven by the acquisition of the Jaquet. We did see a 2% organic decline as we continue to be impacted by the weaknesses in the industrial-related markets, which make up more than half of our Sensors sales. We continue to see strong design win momentum in the Automotive space for sensor applications and expect to begin to see meaningful revenue from these programs beginning in fiscal 2018. Adjusted operating margins in the segment were 19.6% and were in line with our expectations and were up sequentially 20 basis points. For the full year, the segment delivered 5% organic growth and 19.2% adjusted operating margins. 
If you could please turn to Slide 7, let me move over to the Industrial Solutions segment. On an overall basis, segment sales were up 16% year-over-year due to the acquisition of Creganna. On a 13-week organic basis, revenue in the segment declined 2%, driven by weakness in the oil and gas and an overall slow Industrial Equipment environment. Geographically, we continue to see North America as weak, Europe as stable and China improving. 
I'll provide some color now on sales growth and our industrial businesses, and this will be on a 13-week basis. In the Industrial Equipment area, we saw 15% growth, driven by the Creganna acquisition, which is performing ahead of our expectations. We continue to be excited about the growth potential in this minimally invasive medical market. On a pro forma basis, if we had owned Creganna this time last year, our growth would've been greater than 10%. Excluding Creganna, the Industrial Equipment business declined 7% organically, with softness in all regions, but did show first half to second half growth of 7% as markets recovered from the first half inventory correction that we talked about earlier in the year. In the Aerospace and Defense area, we had strong growth of 6% organically, driven by share gains in both commercial air platforms and defense applications. In oil and gas, similar to prior quarters, our sales declined by 27% due to the end market conditions in that area. And finally, our Energy business had a very nice growth of 6% organically, with growth both in China as well as in the Americas. From a margin perspective, adjusted operating margins were in line with expectations, but down year-over-year. The year-over-year decline is due entirely to the Oil and Gas business, which impacted segment operating margin by approximately 100 basis points year-over-year due to the revenue declines that we saw in that business. We do expect the oil and gas impact to our margins to affect our comparisons through the first quarter of 2017, but then they'll be anniversary-ed as we get in later into the year. For the full year, the Industrial Solution segment delivered 1% actual growth and 12.3% adjusted operating margins. Organically, the segment sales declined 3% for the full year but did grow 11% from the first half to second half, following the inventory corrections that I mentioned that we experienced in the first 2 quarters. 
So if you could please turn to Slide 8, let me cover Communications Solutions. During the quarter, the Communications segment revenue was down 1% organically on a 13-week basis. The SubCom business saw 13% year-over-year growth, driven by strong execution from multiple projects that we have in for us. For the full year, SubCom grew 25% in fiscal 2016. In Appliances, on a 13-week basis, our business grew 3% organically, while Data and Devices declined 13% organically due to the effects of product exits. What was nice about Data and Devices, we did experience another quarter of sequential sales growth in the business in quarter 4 as the product exits are largely behind us. Adjusted operating margins for the segment expanded 180 basis points sequentially and 240 basis points year-over-year due to the productivity improvements and restructuring actions we've taken in the segment. For the full year, 2016, Communications Solutions declined 2% organically, driven by Data and Devices, and generated 11.6% adjusted operating margins. 
Now let me hand it over to Heath, who'll cover the financials."

To start off, I'm excited to join the team here and I look forward to getting to know the investor and analyst community over the coming quarters. 
Now if you’d please turn to Slide 9, I'll provide more details on our Q4 earnings. Adjusted operating income was $551 million, with an adjusted operating margin of 16.5%. Excluding the extra week, our adjusted operating margin was 16%. Note that the operating income impact from the additional week was $55 million. GAAP operating income was $517 million and included $30 million of restructuring charges driven primarily by Data and Devices and $4 million of acquisition-related charges. Adjusted EPS was $1.27 for the quarter. If you exclude the $0.13 contribution from the additional week, adjusted EPS was $1.14 and up 27% year-on-year, a new company record. The growth above prior year was driven by an increase in operating income, incremental benefits from share buyback and a lower adjusted effective tax rate of 13%. The adjusted tax rate was lower than prior guidance due to the mix of profitability by region and statute expirations in certain jurisdictions. GAAP EPS was $1.22 for the quarter and included restructuring and acquisition-related charges of $0.05. For the full year 2016, restructuring charges were $125 million, and I expect similar levels for 2017 driven primarily by activity in our industrial-related and acquired businesses. Due to the benefit from the settlement of all pre-separation tax disputes with the Internal Revenue Service that was discussed last quarter, we ended 2016 with a full year GAAP income tax benefit of $779 million and an adjusted effective tax rate of 18.5% for the full year. I expect a full year adjusted effective tax rate of 20% for 2017. 
Now, if you'll turn to Slide 10. Our business is performing well in a challenging economic environment, driven by the resiliency of our harsh portfolio and the execution of the TE Operating Advantage program, or TEOA. Adjusted gross margins in the quarter was 33.2%, a 70% improvement from the prior year driven by productivity improvements across the segments. Adjusted operating margins were 16.5% in the quarter and going forward into 2017, we continue to manage our business tightly and will continue to invest for future growth in our harsh businesses. Adjusted EBITDA margins help explain the profitability performance of our business including acquisitions. Adjusted EBITDA margins in Q4 were strong at 20.9%, which was up 20 basis points sequentially. In the quarter, we had strong performance, with cash flow from continuing operations of $782 million and free cash flow of $594 million, up a strong 53% from prior year. The growth was driven by significant improvements in working capital, and again, is reflective of the team's solid execution. 
For the full year, I'm pleased to report that we generated nearly $1.6 billion of free cash flow, signaling a very healthy business. Looking ahead, we continue to expect free cash flow to approximate net income and capital expenditures to be approximately 5% of revenue. We're very committed to our disciplined long-term capital strategy of a balanced return of free cash flow to shareholders, while still having ample free cash flow available for acquisitions. In 2016, we returned $3.1 billion to our shareholders through dividend and share repurchases. Our balance sheet remained strong, with reasonable debt levels and an ability to continue to support the return of capital and acquisitions going forward. We have added a balance sheet and cash flow summary in the appendix for additional details. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Terrence."

And now, I'll cover our guidance for the first quarter and the full year 2017. So if you could please turn to Slide 11 for the first quarter outlook.

So if you could please turn to Slide 11 for the first quarter outlook. We expect first quarter revenue of $2.95 billion to $3.05 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $0.98 to $1.02, representing sales growth of 6%, and 3% on an organic basis, and 19% adjusted EPS growth at the midpoint. Following record adjusted EPS and strong orders in the fourth quarter, our guidance represents a strong start to our fiscal 2017. By segment, we expect Transportation Solutions to grow mid-single digits both organically and on an actual basis. This was above expected Auto production growth levels of 2% in the first quarter, driven by China as well as Europe. Commercial Transportation growth we expect to be driven by Asia. In the industrial segment, we expect it to grow double digits overall due to the Creganna and Intercontec acquisition, and will be flat organically, with the weakness in oil and gas market offsetting growth in our Aerospace and Defense business. We expect low single-digit organic growth in the Communication segment, driven by Appliances and SubCom. 
If you could now turn to Slide 12 and I'll cover the full year guidance. For the full year, we expect revenue in the range of $12.3 billion to $12.9 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $4.19 to $4.49. This represents 5% overall growth, 3% organic growth and 10% adjusted earnings per share growth at the midpoint versus 52 weeks fiscal 2016 results. I feel very good about our ability to drive 3% organic growth and double-digit adjusted EPS growth in this challenging economic environment. This is in line with our overall business model and proves that our harsh strategy is delivering, while we continue to benefit from the secular trend of content growth across our harsh businesses. We expect our Transportation segment to be up mid-single digits organically on 1% global Auto production growth next year, and this reflects content growth trends as well as share gains from the programs we've won in the past. Commercial Transportation we expect to outperform at the end market again this year, benefiting from content expansion in the heavy truck market. And we expect our Sensors business to grow 7% in total year-over-year. In the Industrial segment, we expect it to be up low single digits organically, with continued gains in Commercial Aerospace and Defense, momentum in interventional medical applications, driving the growth and also stabilization in our Oil and Gas business. In the Communication segment, we expect to be up low single digits organically, with growth driven by Appliances and SubCom. As I said, momentum in SubCom remains very strong, with the $1 billion that we have in backlog benefiting from the build out of the cloud, and we expect growth in the mid-single digits in SubCom in 2017. 
Now let me turn it back over to Tom for some closing comments"

To reiterate, 2016 was a very good year for TE, and we're expecting another very good year in 2017, with 5% overall sales growth, 3% organic growth, operating margin expansion and double-digit adjusted EPS growth excluding the additional week in 2016. Our harsh strategy is definitely delivering, with 80% of our revenue driven by harsh environment applications. These products are highly engineered and developed at the application architecture level, providing a wide moat around our solution. Over the past 5 years, we've averaged mid-single-digit growth across our harsh businesses and have multiple levers to continue to drive margin expansion. We have remained active in shaping our portfolio to focus on harsh applications. Over the past year, our acquisitions have given TE a leading position in solutions for the minimally invasive medical markets, expanded our portfolio of industrial connectors and bolstered our offering of sensors for the auto market. At the same time, we returned over $3 billion to shareholders through buybacks and dividend. Over time, we have maintained consistency with our capital strategy, returning nearly $12 billion to shareholders since we became a public company nearly 10 years ago. 
Moving forward, we expect free cash flow to approximate net income and continue to expect to return 2/3 of our free cash flow to shareholders and use 1/3 for acquisitions. While there will be cyclicality, the markets that TE serves a strong underlying secular trends driven by the megatrends of safe, green and connected. Using Auto as an example, these trends are driving the need for more sensors and connectors to support increased safety features, autonomous driving system, higher emission standards and infotainment. TE benefits directly from these trends, and this is reflected in our transportation guidance for fiscal 2017, where we expect to grow mid-single digits on 1% auto production growth. We see similar drivers in our Industrial and Communications businesses, which will enable us to grow content. TE has multiple levers to drive revenue and EPS growth. As a world leader in connectors and sensors, we have unmatched technology and global presence. With over 7,000 engineers, we are setting the pace for new products and technology development and are driving our customer's road maps with integrated solutions, which TE is uniquely positioned to provide. And all the work we've done over the last several years has translated into each dollar of revenue today delivering 40% more EPS than 5 years ago. These are very exciting times for TE, and I'm proud of what we have accomplished this year. 
I'm also very happy that Terrence is succeeding me, as he's been instrumental in establishing TE's global leadership position in connectivity and Sensor solutions and strengthening the company's financial performance to drive value for our shareholders. We’ve prepared Terrence for this role over several years, and I will continue on as Executive Chairman of the Board, making sure this is a seamless transition.

We do think China, when we look at the 1% is going to be about 3% production growth for the overall year in that 1%. We do expect Europe to sort of be low single-digit production growth and North America to be flat when we sort of look at it through next year.

You've seen that separation come back from our growth rate in a pretty stable production environment and also in our first quarter guidance, where we're guiding mid-single digits on 2% production. So I think, there's proof around our business model and our business model, as we told you, in a low growth production environment, you can have 6% of content and then a little bit of price get back that sort of gets to that mid-single digit around this 1% production environment. And we feel very confident with the gains we have in all the global platforms we're on, even in a 1% production environment, we can drive that type of growth."

And then my second follow-up question is, on the subsea business that you're winning, which is nice to see that, is there anything different with this round of the terms and covenants, such as better visibility or worse or similar profitability or worse or better? And also I assume that simply because it's not being funded by governments or the telecom operators that the funding is probably more in place versus past cycles, so maybe a little bit more visibility. If you can touch on that, that would be great?"

We might ask to have you repeat the second question. My memory, I'm not sure I’ll hold it all.

We might ask to have you repeat the second question. My memory, I'm not sure I’ll hold it all. But regarding content, Jim, definitely, if you look back to 4, 5 years ago, we would have said if we were guiding 1% production growth, we would probably been guiding 3%, maybe 4% revenue growth. Today, we're guiding 1%. We're guiding 4% to 5% revenue growth. So that combination of content and design-ins -- continued design-ins for us. And there's no question that as emission standards increase and you see more of a push for hybrid and electric vehicle, the content -- that's an upward. That's a tailwind for content. And no, it's been relatively slower than people expected. But in China, for example, there's a huge push by the government there to transition to electric vehicle. So that's a real positive trend for us, and we're very, very well positioned in the electric vehicle and the hybrid electric vehicle with our content. So yes, I think over time as the penetration of ATV vehicles increases, we're going to be seeing more content growth. We'd also -- just in general, we expect content to grow about 6% over the next 4 to 5 years in the vehicle. So it's a really good, sustainable long-term trend that we're well positioned to take advantage of."

And if I miss any of it just hit me at the end because there was about 4 questions in there I think. Overall, I think when you look at the cycle we're in, one of the things that's really nice about the cycle, I don't think it changes the visibility much, but the customer base is different. It is not your traditional carriers. It is the -- actually, the cloud operators. So it is -- those cloud operators are very concerned how do they make sure they have capacity as they come out with their service offering. And that has changed the customer profile than what it was 5, 10 years ago. So they are much more active in owning the systems. Clearly from a financing perspective, it creates a different financing cycle because they do have the capital versus in the past that would be a part of a Telco operating budget or somebody had to go raise financing for the project. So I think it helps accelerate the cycle a little bit, but it does come down to their offerings in the cloud. And I think what's great that you've seen in the programs we've won, we had programs in the Atlantic, also the Pacific here and they’re activities all around the cloud demand and the service offerings they have. So when you look at the cycle, it's very good that it's a different customer base. I think we've done a good job adapting to a different customer base. And I think that's why you're seeing the strong wins, coupled with the technology we bring, that being very strong. And I think when you look at profitability, the profitability is sort of where we expect it to be at this point of the cycle. At these levels and we'll have these levels again next year. You're going to be around company average margins, maybe a little bit less, but excellent return on capital versus company’s WAC and feel good that we had the backlog in place that secure '17, and now we have to continue to win projects to secure '18."

So when you look at it, it's split pretty much organic and inorganic that 7% pretty evenly between the inorganic and organic. When you think about, you're exactly right, when you think about Measurement. Measurement really did not have an Automotive business and that's one of the reasons we like their portfolios, so that we could build that up. So the program wins that we have, really, when it comes to Auto, they won't be kicking in until 2018. So we're not getting the benefit of the growth, certainly as Tom talked. We're spending ahead to industrialize all the programs and win those programs. What's great about those programs, they're among various technologies we got with Measurement as well as they're in multiple regions of the world. So it's not concentrated in one area. So we really like the breadth that we’re winning as that'll coming into '18. When we look at the market conditions, because Measurement was very much focused on the industrial markets, they were getting some of the impacts of the industrial markets that I've talked about in our industrial segment. So anything around general and industrial, test and measurement has been slowing. And that's what you see in the organic impact that we had. We have seen some pick up across those industrial businesses similar to what we've seen in our industrial segment. That has given us the confidence for the 3.5%, 4% organic growth next year, that's implied in our guidance. But the Auto program still will not be coming in meaningfully until 2018."

The second big driver is as medical becomes organic growth later half of the year, like I talked about Creganna, that's -- the minimally invasive market is 7% growth market, we're growing about 10% pro forma in that. So we feel good about those 2 being the big drivers in the industrial market next year.
