Let's take a look at Slide 4 and reflect on a few of the more notable financial accomplishments for 2015. Although we operate in a very capital-intensive industry, LyondellBasell's record earnings in 2015 generated robust cash flow at a 34",2648,"Thanks, Thomas. Let's take a look at Slide 4 and reflect on a few of the more notable financial accomplishments for 2015. Although we operate in a very capital-intensive industry, LyondellBasell's record earnings in 2015 generated robust cash flow at a 34% return on our invested capital. $1.4 billion of this cash was used to fund our capital program, while over $6 billion was committed to dividends and share buybacks. Our dividend yield places us in the top quintile of the S&P 500 Index, and the purchase of our outstanding shares relative to our average enterprise value place us in the top 3% of the S&P 500. The strength of our earnings and our disciplined use of cash helped us to again outperform the S&P 500 on total shareholder return basis.
Before we dive deeper into the financials, I would like to call your attention to Slide #5. LyondellBasell's culture places a strong emphasis on continuously improving our health, safety and environmental performance. I'm proud to report that our team again achieved record performance in 2015. This is top decile performance for our industry. We believe that outstanding safety performance is an essential foundation for reliable operations that deliver differential financial performance. While I'm pleased to see the improvement for the past year, we'll continue to be relentless in our drive for safety perfection.
Our annual results summarized on Slide #6 exceeded the previous records established during 2014 with $8.1 billion of EBITDA and $10.35 of earnings per share during 2015. As seen in the quarterly results of the bottom of the slide, LyondellBasell's strong operating performance during the second and third quarter enabled us to capture the benefits of tight markets due to industry outages. Relatively lower margin resulting from more balanced markets, seasonal trends and lower crude prices, coupled with several planned and unplanned outages reduced the company's fourth quarter profitability.
Slide 7 summarizes some 2015 accomplishments in segment results. Three of the 5 segments, Olefins & Polyolefins, Europe, Asia and International, Intermediates & Derivatives and Technology achieved record results. Over $5.8 billion of cash flow from operations enabled us to buy back 52 million shares or 11% of the shares outstanding at the beginning of 2015. Additionally, we increased our interim dividend by 11% to $0.78 per share, bringing our total dividend in 2015 to $3.04 per share. I won't mention each of the separate accomplishments shown here, but I think these items exemplify our continued operating strength and advancing growth program. Strong operations, advantaged feeds and incremental volumes reflect the common and consistent theme of how the entire team at LyondellBasell continually finds ways to realize more productivity from our existing assets.
Let's turn to Slide 8 and look at some of the metrics that drove 2015 performance. I'll highlight a few. Across the top of the page, we have plotted our key volumes. On the left, you can see the additional volume from our La Porte ethylene expansion and the steady increase in polyethylene and polypropylene volumes largely from existing assets. In the charts along the bottom of the page, you see a summary of product margins and spreads. The index ethylene and polyolefin charts represent our internal data, while the other 2 represent industry benchmarks. Falling U.S. ethylene margins were partially offset by rising polyethylene and polypropylene margins helping to maintain strong chain profitability.
In Europe, both Olefins & Polyolefins margins increased. MTBE and Refining industry spreads remain relatively constant with prior year's.
Please turn to Slide 9, which plots fourth quarter and full year segment results. As I already mentioned, this has been a record-setting year for both EBITDA and operating income. I'll review these in detail during the segment discussions.
Please turn to Slide 10, which provides a picture of our cash generation and use. During 2015, we generated $5.8 billion of cash from operations. We also took advantage of favorable interest rates and borrowed $1 billion at a coupon rate of 4 5/8%. Cash and short-term security balance ended the year at $2.4 billion. 
Turning to Slide 11, you can see the $5.8 billion in cash from operations. This cash generation has allowed us great flexibility. Over the past 4 years we have funded $5.6 billion of capital investment and $18.7 billion towards dividends and share repurchases. Since the inception of our share repurchase program, we have repurchased approximately 142 million shares or about 25% of the total shares outstanding. At the end of 2015, we had approximately 15 million shares remaining under the existing share repurchase authorization. Since this is the beginning of a new year, I want to address some of your 2016 modeling questions. Regarding capital. We are currently planning to spend approximately $1.9 billion during 2016. This spending level progresses both our base maintenance and growth programs. Approximately 40% is targeted toward our growth program. Base maintenance spending increases this year due to a heavy turnaround schedule and increased health safety and environmental spending. The majority of the growth spending will be dedicated to the Corpus Christi ethylene expansion that should begin production during the third quarter. Although not all plans are finalized, we expect capital spending to remain around $2 billion annually through 2020. The largest individual growth project is our PO/TBA plant, which is currently estimated to cost approximately $2.1 billion. While we have not yet finalized plans and timing for all of our polyethylene growth projects, we are currently performing design engineering for a 1 billion pound expansion that could be completed during the 2018 to 2019 time frame.
Our net cash interest expense for 2016 is expected to be approximately $320 million. This includes interest on $7.7 billion of outstanding bonds at an average coupon rate of approximately 5.2% and $12 million of interest on short-term facilities.
At current conditions, we estimate that these expenses will be offset by approximately $100 million in benefits from interest rate and currency swaps and interest on our cash balance.
2016 annual book depreciation and amortization should be approximately $1.1 billion. We plan to make regular pension contributions that total approximately $110 million, and we estimate a pension expense of approximately $65 million. We currently expect a 2016 effective tax rate of approximately 28%. The cash tax rate is expected to be somewhat lower.
Now let's turn to Slide 12 and review segment results. As mentioned previously, my discussion of business results will be in regard to our underlying business results, excluding the impacts of the LCM inventory charges. In our Olefins & Polyolefins America segment, fourth quarter EBITDA was $834 million, $86 million less than third quarter. For the full year, segment EBITDA was $3.8 billion. Relative to the third quarter, ethylene margins decreased by $0.06 per pound. This decline was driven by prices that were lower by $0.04 per pound in higher cost due to lower coal product prices. Our operating rates remained strong during the quarter, averaging 95%. 72% of our ethylene production was from ethane, and approximately 90% came from NGLs.
In polyolefins, our polyethylene spread was relatively unchanged, while the polypropylene spread was up approximately $0.04 per pound. Polyethylene volumes were relatively unchanged. Polypropylene experienced sales volume decline of approximately 8% due to operating issues in our plan. For the full year, results decreased by $369 million higher polyolefin results offsetting more than half of the decline in olefins. Polyolefins results provided approximately $570 million of improvement over the prior year due to margin improvement and increased polyethylene volumes from our 2014 debottleneck.
Overall, 2015 was a year of transition with lower crude prices moving margin from olefins into polyolefins. Industry operating rates for olefins improves, and our crackers operated reliably. We completed our Channelview expansion during the third quarter and captured the additional capacity from our 2014 La Porte olefins expansion and Matagorda polyethylene debottleneck. Our growth program for ethylene and polyethylene continues to add value.
In January, spot ethylene prices have continued to decline as the market follows lower oil prices. We continue to see margins holding for polyethylene and additional upside for polypropylene margins in a very tight North American market. A heavy turnaround season expand for U.S. crackers in 2016 with the schedule particularly heavy during the second quarter where IHS estimates that 10% of North American capacity will be offline. Our Corpus Christi ethylene turnaround and expansion will begin during the second quarter with completion planned during the third quarter.
Let's turn to Slide 13 and review performance in the Olefins & Polyolefins Europe, Asia and international segment. During the fourth quarter, underlying EBITDA was $451 million or $104 million lower than the third quarter. For the full year, underlying EBITDA was a record of nearly $1.9 billion, a $445 million increase versus 2014. Olefins results decreased versus the third quarter by approximately $130 million due to lower margins. Polyolefin results improved as sales volumes increased by 6% and 5% for polyethylene and polypropylene respectively. Polyethylene margins remain strong but were relatively unchanged while polypropylene margins had a modest improvement. Our polypropylene compounding business improved modestly on higher sales volumes. Equity income decreased by $11 million due to a reduced margins at our Saudi Arabian joint ventures. 
Olefins results for the full year increased by approximately $25 million over 2014. This increase is largely the result of lower cost of naphtha that outpaced the declines in ethylene pricing. Excluding the effect of our Muenchsmunster cracker turnaround we operate crackers in Europe at 95%. Our polyolefins results increase approximately $420 million year-on-year, reflecting the improved spreads and higher volumes for both polyethylene and polypropylene. Polypropylene compounding and polybutylene-1 results were relatively unchanged versus 2014. Equity income from our joint ventures increased by $54 million due to strong margins in our joint ventures in South Korea.
During January, industry conditions were generally consistent with the fourth quarter. During March, we will start a turnaround on our olefins cracker that is expected to impact first quarter results by approximately $20 million. Joint venture equity earnings are anticipated to decline modestly, in part due to lower polyolefin prices and the Saudi feedstock price increases that took effect in late December.
Now please turn to Slide 13 for a discussion of our Intermediates & Derivatives segment. Fourth quarter EBITDA was $286 million, a decline of $220 million from third quarter. For the full year, the segment generated record EBITDA of nearly $1.7 billion. $104 million more than 2014. The fourth quarter decline was attributable to typical seasonal demand declines combined with planned outages and uncharacteristically high unplanned outages in our plants. The segment's fourth quarter results were impacted by planned maintenance totaling approximately $20 million, and unplanned downtime impacted results by approximately $50 million. Propylene oxide and derivatives results decreased by approximately $10 million with slightly lower margins due to sales mix. In our intermediate chemicals business, EBITDA declined by approximately $160 million as styrene margins declined by $0.07 per pound. Included in the intermediate chemicals results, acetyl results declined by approximately $30 million due to lower volumes from an extended turnaround and a $0.17 per gallon decrease in methanol pricing. Oxyfuels results were lower by approximately $60 million, in line with typical seasonal trends. During most of 2015, LyondellBasell's propylene oxide and derivatives and styrene businesses captured opportunities while the industry experienced operating problems that tightened the markets for those products. Intermediate chemicals results improved by approximately $120 million due to improved styrene margins that were partially offset by lower methanol and margins. Oxyfuels results decreased by approximately $60 million versus 2014, which benefited from an unseasonably strong fourth quarter margins 1 year ago. The new year started with stable demand in the propylene oxide market. Oxyfuel margins remain near-typical winter levels. Methanol prices have come under pressure with additional capacity entering the market and lower crude oil prices. In contrast to the fourth quarter, we do not have any significant planned maintenance schedule during the first quarter.
Let's move to Slide 15 for a discussion of the Refining segment.
Fourth quarter EBITDA was $68 million, a decline of $75 million from the prior quarter. For the full year, the segment generated $519 million of EBITDA, an increase of $110 million versus 2014. During the fourth quarter, the Maya 2-1-1 spread averaged $18.55 per barrel, and crude throughput averaged 206,000 barrels a day. Rates were impacted by planned and unplanned maintenance. The total impacted estimated to be approximately $50 million. The lower my Maya spread was primarily driven by seasonally weaker gasoline frac spreads. The cost of increased by approximately $10 million related to the EPA ethanol requirements. 
2015 full year refining results improves over 2015 despite challenges from a labor strike in the first quarter and a fourth quarter -- fourth quarter operating issues. Crude throughput averaged 238,000 barrels per day, down 21,000 barrels per day from 2014. The Maya 2-1-1 benchmark decreased by approximately $2 per barrel to average $22 per barrel for the year. The refineries' capture rate of this margin improved during 2015 with improved secondary product margins and higher utilization rates. Higher utilization of discounted Canadian crude oil volumes, the cost of were relatively unchanged. We're currently performing planned maintenance on accrued units that is expected to impact first quarter results by approximately $40 million. First quarter crude oil throughput is expected to be similar to the fourth quarter of 2015.
Turning to Slide 16, let's step back and consider changes that are occurring in our core Olefins & Polyolefins markets. As crude prices have fallen over the past 15 months, there has been some compression in North America monomer margins, but they remain quite good. This is illustrated by the gray bars in the charts on the top left. The chart in the upper right demonstrate that polyethylene and polypropylene demand growth improved in 2015 relative to the prior 4 years to approach the long-term growth averages we have seen over the past 25 years. This strong growth supports the balance tight market conditions that are likely to persist into 2016. These healthy markets have resulted in strong polyolefin margins in both Europe and the U.S. as you can see from the blue bars on the left. Finally, the table on lower right highlights LyondellBasell's leverage to be strong integrated chain margins. Global supply and demand balances, regional feedstock advantages and industry operating rates continue to support our positive outlook for our industry and our business. 
Let me conclude with Slide 17. The fourth quarter was a period where the ethylene industry returned to a balanced market as industry operating problems subsided. 
Polyolefin margin expansions offset much of the decline in monomer margins. As LyondellBasell planned maintenance activities across our assets negatively impacted our results by approximately $55 million, while unplanned events increased the negative impact by $105 million. The fourth quarter was also impacted by seasonal factors, primarily in our fuel-related products, which negatively impacted the quarter by approximately $100 million. This is generally comparable to the seasonal impact of the last few years. During 2016, oil price volatility and concerns about the global economy will undoubtedly foster uncertainty in financial markets. Despite such uncertainty, we believe that we continue to benefit from abundant supplies of low priced feedstocks and from solid underlying demand for our products. Additionally, we anticipate that the heavy industry outage scheduled for the first half of 2016 will continue to be constructive for the markets we serve.

So I think inventories are probably at average levels in our industry. And I would say, downstream, they are on the low side. In terms of demand benefiting from lower energy, difficult to say. I think the more important theme is that in 2015, we saw a very good strong growth in polyethylene and polypropylene globally, including in Europe where we saw demand growth. I think this is a testament to the fact that both of those product areas and about 2/3 of our total output from the company goes into nondurable applications, which tend to grow generally irrespective of economic conditions. And so, again, I see next year or '16 very being very similar that demand growth and supply growth will likely match, and we'll have pretty balanced markets.

So we'll continue to evaluate that as the year goes but I would expect that our pace in the past is what should occur in the future."

If ethane price were to rise enough where propane and butane become much more economic, I think you will see those who can shift to those other feedstocks will do it.

Production of ethylene in the U.S. was at a record level in Q4, so we have the highest production. At a time when we also had a largely merchant supplier of ethylene had logistics issues where they had to move ethylene out of because they were going to do some maintenance on it. Also, we had a very weak PVC market. So I think all of those things led to a decline in ethylene price in Q4, and that's kind of where we are today. As we look through Q1 and Q2 and we talked about some of these large unplanned -- I'm sorry, planned outages during Q2, that will likely tighten market. I would expect PVC to improve the specific logistics issues I described, and I think that will it run its course by the end of Q1. So we'll have to see but it seems to me that ethylene price are to drift somewhat higher, and the forward curve indicates that for ethylene. The other thing that's important here in the U.S. is to also look at polyethylene price and look at the polyethylene price in the U.S. relative to the rest of the world, and I think that starts to make a lot more sense. So our ethylene is priced more locally, and polyethylene is priced globally and it's important to remember that distinction as we move through the year."

So I think meaningful expansions as we sit here today, likely not until back half of '18, maybe '19, something like that if someone were to decide today. In the near term, polypropylene expansions have to come in concert with some thoughts about the source propylene. And as we have more flexible crackers and propylene output varies, those who are going to expand, have to take a view on where propylene prices are going and where the supply is going to come from. So my sense is that this year, people will probably take a look at that and see where we go. And in the near term, I don't think higher polypropylene prices will impact demand or substitution from polyethylene. We've seen these periods in the past. I think polypropylene is very competitively priced."

Well, thank you for all of your thoughtful questions, as always. Let me close with a few comments. First of all, 2015 was a very challenging year with significant oil price decline, feedstock price volatility and uncertain outlook for global economic growth. Despite all these headwinds, our portfolio continued to prove its resiliency, and we delivered record results. I think our focus on safety, operational reliability and cost efficiency continue to serve us very well and position us to outperform in a variety of market conditions. This focus has enabled robust free cash flow generation, which is deployed in a very shareholder friendly way through low-cost high-value growth projects, strong regular dividend and large stock buybacks.

The strength of our earnings and our disciplined use of cash helped us to again outperform the S&P 500 on total shareholder return basis.
Before we dive deeper into the financials, I would like to call your attention to Slide #5. LyondellBasell's culture places a strong emphasis on continuously improving our health, safety and environmental performance. I'm proud to report that our team again achieved record safety performance in 2015. This is top decile performance for our industry. We believe that outstanding safety performance is an essential foundation for reliable operations that deliver differential financial performance. While I'm pleased to see the improvement for the past year, we'll continue to be relentless in our drive for safety perfection.
Our annual results summarized on Slide #6 exceeded the previous records established during 2014 with $8.1 billion of EBITDA and $10.35 of earnings per share during 2015. As seen in the quarterly results on the bottom of the slide, LyondellBasell's strong operating performance during the second and third quarters enabled us to capture the benefits of tight markets due to industry outages. Relatively lower margins resulting from more balanced markets, seasonal trends and lower crude prices, coupled with several planned and unplanned outages in our plans, reduced the company's fourth quarter profitability.
Slide 7 summarizes some 2015 accomplishments and segment results. Three of the 5 segments, Olefins & Polyolefins, Europe, Asia and International, Intermediates & Derivatives and Technology achieved record results. Over $5.8 billion of cash flow from operations enabled us to buyback 52 million shares or 11% of the shares outstanding at the beginning of 2015. Additionally, we increased our interim dividend by 11% to $0.78 per share, bringing our total dividend for 2015 to $3.04 per share. I won't mention each of the operating accomplishments shown here, but I think these items exemplify our continued operating strength and advancing growth program. Strong operations, advantage feeds and incremental volumes reflect the common and consistent themes of how the entire team at LyondellBasell continually finds ways to realize more productivity from our existing assets.
Let's turn to Slide 8 and look at some of the metrics that drove 2015 performance. I'll highlight a few. Across the top of the page, we have plotted our key volumes. On the left, you can see the additional volume from our La Porte ethylene expansion and the steady increase in polyethylene and polypropylene volumes, largely from existing assets. In the charts along the bottom of the page, you see a summary of product margins and spreads. The indexed ethylene and polyolefins charts represent our internal data, while the other 2 represent industry benchmarks. Falling U.S. ethylene margins were partially offset by rising polyethylene and polypropylene margins, helping to maintain strong chain profitability.
In Europe, both Olefins & Polyolefins margins increased. MTBE and Refining industry spreads remain relatively constant with prior year's.
Please turn to Slide 9, which plots fourth quarter and full year segment results. As I already mentioned, this has been a record-setting year for both EBITDA and operating income. I'll review these in detail during the segment discussions.
Please turn to Slide 10, which provides a picture of our cash generation and use. During 2015, we generated $5.8 billion of cash from operations. We also took advantage of favorable interest rates and borrowed $1 billion at a coupon rate of 4 5/8%. The cash and short-term security balance ended the year at $2.4 billion.
Turning to Slide 11, you can see the $5.8 billion in cash from operations. This cash generation has allowed us great flexibility. Over the past 4 years, we have funded $5.6 billion of capital investment and $18.7 billion towards dividends and share repurchases. Since the inception of our share repurchase program, we have repurchased approximately 142 million shares or about 25% of the total shares outstanding. At the end of 2015, we had approximately 15 million shares remaining under the existing share repurchase authorization. Since this is the beginning of a new year, I want to address some of your 2016 modeling questions. Regarding capital. We are currently planning to spend approximately $1.9 billion during 2016. This spending level progresses both our base maintenance and growth programs. Approximately 40% is targeted toward our growth program. Base maintenance spending increases this year due to a heavy turnaround schedule and increased health safety and environmental spending. The majority of the growth spending will be dedicated to the Corpus Christi ethylene expansion that should begin production during the third quarter. Although not all plans are finalized, we expect capital spending to remain around $2 billion annually through 2020. The largest individual growth project is our PO/TBA plant, which is currently estimated to cost approximately $2.1 billion. While we have not yet finalized plans and timing for all of our polyethylene growth projects, we are currently performing design engineering for a 1 billion pound expansion that could be completed during the 2018 to 2019 time frame.
Our net cash interest expense for 2016 is expected to be approximately $320 million. This includes interest on $7.7 billion of outstanding bonds at an average coupon rate of approximately 5.2% and $12 million of interest on short-term facilities.
At current conditions, we estimate that these expenses will be offset by approximately $100 million in benefits from interest rate and currency swaps and interest on our cash balance.
2016 annual book depreciation and amortization should be approximately $1.1 billion. We plan to make regular pension contributions that total approximately $110 million, and we estimate a pension expense of approximately $65 million. We currently expect a 2016 effective tax rate of approximately 28%. The cash tax rate is expected to be somewhat lower.
Now let's turn to Slide 12 and review segment results. As mentioned previously, my discussion of business results will be in regard to our underlying business results, excluding the impacts of the LCM inventory charges. In our Olefins & Polyolefins America segment, fourth quarter EBITDA was $834 million, $86 million less than third quarter. For the full year, segment EBITDA was $3.8 billion. Relative to the third quarter, ethylene margins decreased by $0.06 per pound. This decline was driven by prices that were lower by $0.04 per pound in higher costs due to lower coal product prices. Our operating rates remained strong during the quarter, averaging 95%. 72% of our ethylene production was from ethane, approximately 90% came from NGLs.
In polyolefins, our polyethylene spread was relatively unchanged, while the polypropylene spread was up approximately $0.04 per pound. Polyethylene volumes were relatively unchanged. Polypropylene experienced sales volume decline of approximately 8% due to operating issues in our Bayport plant. For the full year, results decreased by $369 million with higher polyolefin results offsetting more than half of the decline in olefins. Polyolefins results provided approximately $570 million of improvement over the prior year due to margin improvement and increased polyethylene volumes from our 2014 Matagorda debottleneck.
Overall, 2015 was a year of transition with lower crude prices moving margin from olefins into polyolefins. Industry operating rates for olefins improved, and our crackers operated reliably. We completed our Channelview expansion during the third quarter and captured the additional capacity from our 2014 La Porte olefins expansion and Matagorda polyethylene debottleneck. Our growth program for ethylene and polyethylene continues to add value.
In January, spot ethylene prices have continued to decline as the market follows lower oil prices. We continue to see margins holding for polyethylene and additional upside for polypropylene margins in a very tight North American market. A heavy turnaround season is planned for U.S. crackers in 2016 with the schedule, particularly heavy during the second quarter, where IHS estimates that 10% of North American capacity will be offline. Our Corpus Christi ethylene turnaround and expansion will begin during the second quarter with completion planned during the third quarter.
Let's turn to Slide 13 and review performance in the Olefins & Polyolefins Europe, Asia and International segment. During the fourth quarter, underlying EBITDA was $451 million or $104 million lower than the third quarter. For the full year, underlying EBITDA was a record of nearly $1.9 billion, a $445 million increase versus 2014. Olefins results decreased versus the third quarter by approximately $130 million due to lower margins. Polyolefin results improved as sales volumes increased by 6% and 5% for polyethylene and polypropylene respectively. Polyethylene margins remain strong, but were relatively unchanged while polypropylene margins had a modest improvement. Our polypropylene compounding business improved modestly on higher sales volumes. Equity income decreased by $11 million due to a reduced margins at our Saudi Arabian joint ventures.
Olefins results for the full year increased by approximately $25 million over 2014. This increase is largely the result of a lower cost of naphtha that outpaced the declines in ethylene pricing. Excluding the impact of our Muenchsmunster cracker turnaround, we operated our crackers in Europe at 95%. Our polyolefin results increased approximately $420 million year-on-year, reflecting improved spreads and higher volumes for both polyethylene and polypropylene. Polypropylene compounding and polybutene-1 results were relatively unchanged versus 2014. 
Equity income from our joint ventures increased by $54 million due to strong margins at our joint ventures in Poland and South Korea.
During January, industry conditions were generally consistent with the fourth quarter. During March, we will start a turnaround on our Bayer France olefins cracker that is expected to impact first quarter results by approximately $20 million. Joint venture equity earnings are anticipated to decline modestly, in part due to lower polyolefin prices and the Saudi feedstock price increases that took effect in late December.
Now please turn to Slide 14 for a discussion of our Intermediates & Derivatives segment. Fourth quarter EBITDA was $286 million, a decline of $220 million from third quarter. For the full year, the segment generated record EBITDA of nearly $1.7 billion. $104 million more than 2014. The fourth quarter decline was attributable to typical seasonal demand declines combined with planned outages and uncharacteristically high unplanned outages in our plants. The segment's fourth quarter results were impacted by planned maintenance, totaling approximately $20 million, and unplanned downtime impacted results by approximately $50 million. Propylene oxide and derivatives results decreased by approximately $10 million with slightly lower margins due to sales mix. In our Intermediate Chemicals business, EBITDA declined by approximately $160 million as styrene margins declined by $0.07 per pound. Included in the Intermediate Chemicals results, acetyl results declined by approximately $30 million due to lower volumes from an extended turnaround and a $0.17 per gallon decrease in methanol pricing. Oxyfuels results were lower by approximately $60 million, in line with typical seasonal trends. During most of 2015, LyondellBasell's propylene oxide and derivatives and styrene businesses captured opportunities, while the industry experienced operating problems that tightened the markets for those products. Intermediate Chemicals results improved by approximately $120 million due to improved styrene margins that were partially offset by a lower methanol and vinyl acetate margins. Oxyfuels results decreased by approximately $60 million versus 2014, which benefited from an unseasonably strong fourth quarter margins 1 year ago. The new year has started with stable demand in the propylene oxide market. Oxyfuel margins remain near-typical winter levels. Methanol prices have come under pressure with additional capacity entering the market and lower crude oil prices. In contrast to the fourth quarter, we do not have any significant planned maintenance scheduled during the first quarter.
Let's move to Slide 15 for a discussion of the Refining segment.  Fourth quarter EBITDA was $68 million, a decline of $75 million from the prior quarter. For the full year, the segment generated $519 million of EBITDA, an increase of $110 million versus 2014. During the fourth quarter, the Maya 2-1-1 spread averaged $18.55 per barrel, and crude throughput averaged 206,000 barrels per day. Rates were impacted by planned and unplanned maintenance. The total impact is estimated to be approximately $50 million. The lower Maya spread was primarily driven by seasonally weaker gasoline's frac spreads. The cost of RINs increased by approximately $10 million related to the EPA ethanol requirements. 
2015 full year refining results improved over 2014 despite challenges from a labor strike in the first quarter and a fourth quarter -- and fourth quarter operating issues. Crude throughput averaged 238,000 barrels per day, down 21,000 barrels per day from 2014. The Maya 2-1-1 benchmark decreased by approximately $2 per barrel to average $22 per barrel for the year. The refinery's capture rate of this margin improved during 2015, with improved secondary product margins and higher utilization rates. Higher utilization of discounted Canadian crude oil volumes, the cost of RINs were relatively unchanged. We're currently performing planned maintenance on a crude unit and a coker that is expected to impact first quarter results by approximately $40 million. First quarter crude oil throughput is expected to be similar to the fourth quarter of 2015.
Turning to Slide 16, let's step back and consider the changes that are occurring in our core Olefins & Polyolefins markets. As crude prices have fallen over the past 15 months, there has been some compression in North American monomer margins, but they remain quite good. This is illustrated by the gray bars in the charts on the top left. The chart in the upper right demonstrate that polyethylene and polypropylene demand growth improved in 2015 relative to the prior 4 years to approach the long-term growth averages we have seen over the past 25 years. This strong growth supports to balance  the tight market conditions that are likely to persist into 2016. These healthy markets have resulted in strong polyolefin margins, in both Europe and the U.S. as you can see from the blue bars on the left. Finally, the table on the lower right highlights LyondellBasell's leverage to the strong integrated chain margins. Global supply and demand balances, regional feedstock advantages and industry operating rates continue to support our positive outlook for our industry and our business. 
Let me conclude with Slide 17. The fourth quarter was a period, where the ethylene industry returned to a balanced market as industry operating problems subsided. 
Polyolefin margin expansions offset much of the decline in monomer margins. As LyondellBasell planned maintenance activities across our assets negatively impacted our results by approximately $55 million, while unplanned events increased the negative impact by $105 million. The fourth quarter was also impacted by seasonal factors, primarily in our fuel-related products, which negatively impacted the quarter by approximately $100 million. This is generally comparable to the seasonal impact over the last few years. 
During 2016, oil price volatility and concerns about the global economy will undoubtedly foster uncertainty in financial markets. Despite such uncertainty, we believe that we continue to benefit from abundant supplies of low-priced feedstocks then from solid underlying demand for our products. Additionally, we anticipate that the heavy industry outage scheduled for the first half of 2016 will continue to be constructive for the markets we serve.
Before we open the line for your questions, I want to make you aware of our upcoming Investor Reception to be held here in Houston in conjunction with the IHS World Petrochemical conference. As in the past, we'll be hosting a reception with members of our executive leadership team at the end of the first day of the conference near the venue. Please watch your email for invitations or contact Doug for further details.
We're now pleased to take your questions."

And typically with turnarounds, my sense is that the industry does intend to build polyolefin inventory, especially here in the U.S., where we were able to supplement ethylene production through purchases and so on. So I think inventories are probably at average levels in our industry. And I would say, downstream, they are on the low side. In terms of demand benefiting from lower energy, difficult to say. I think the more important theme is that in 2015, we saw a very good, strong growth in polyethylene and polypropylene globally, including in Europe, where we saw demand growth. And I think this is a testament to the fact that both of those product areas and about 2/3 of our total output from the company goes into nondurable applications, which tend to grow generally irrespective of economic conditions. And so, again, I see next year or '16 being very similar that demand growth and supply growth will likely match, and we'll have pretty balanced markets. And again, if there is inventory replenishment downstream, then that should add to demand in '16."

We're seeing buying activity pick up as we move towards the second half of January, and I would expect that this year we ought to see similar growth last year and frankly if I'm right about lower inventory downstream, the higher sum, I mean, as the oil price incrementally stabilizes or moves up, we should see inventory replenishment downstream, which will add to demand growth year-over-year. Frankly, I'm pretty constructive about polyethylene growth here going into '16. Thankfully, on downstream, our customers don't have a lot of inventory, globally."

And our own intel, our sense is that ethane should be very well supplied. There's enough ethane to supply the expansions that are upcoming. Our sense also is that you think about gas drilling, likely the wet barrels could develop first because ethane and propane and butane incrementally provide value to the economics of gas. So we're pretty constructive. And again, for us, we continue to focus on our ability to also crack more propane and butane and so on. And I think, the industry will swing from ethane to propane if propane becomes more favored, and that will naturally balance the 3 NGLs, I think. So more and more we need to consider the NGL pool as a total rather than the individuals, I think."

Or coming into March, April, May time frame, they will bring a seasonal uptick in demand, likely inventory restocking. I would imagine, at some point, oil price will reach some kind of a bottom and if that happens, it will bring buyers back. We have had -- if you think about 2015, we had a year, where not only there was lack of confidence on oil price, but also, there were questions about economic growth in the U.S. in China and we have destocking. Despite that polyethylene demand grew more than 4%. So that's what makes me constructive.

So that will all bring things in balance. And our sense is that the industry is still rejecting somewhere 400,000 to 500,000 barrels a day of ethane.

Production of ethylene in the U.S. was at a record level in Q4, so we have the highest production. At a time when we also had a largely merchant supplier of ethylene, had logistics issues, where they had to move ethylene out of the Cameron because they were going to do some maintenance on it. Also, we had a very weak PVC market. So I think all of those things led to a decline in ethylene price in Q4, and that's kind of where we are today. As we look through Q1 and Q2 and we've talked about some of these large unplanned -- I'm sorry, planned outages that are in Q2, that will likely tighten market. I would expect PVC to improve the specific logistics issue I described, and I think that will run its course by the end of Q1. So we'll have to see, but it seems to me that ethylene price are to drift somewhat higher, and the forward curve indicates that for ethylene. The other thing that's important here in the U.S. is to also look at polyethylene price and look at the polyethylene price in the U.S. relative to the rest of the world, and I think that starts to make a lot more sense. So our ethylene is priced more locally, and polyethylene is priced globally and it's important to remember that distinction as we move through the year."

So I think meaningful expansions as we sit here today, likely not until back half of '18, maybe '19, something like that if someone were to decide today. In the near term, polypropylene expansions have to come in concert with some thought about the source of propylene. And as we have more flexible crackers and propylene output varies, those who are going to expand have to take a view on where propylene prices are going and where the supply is going to come from. So my sense is that this year, people will probably take a look at that and see where we go. In the near term, I don't think higher polypropylene prices will impact demand or substitution from polyethylene. We've seen these periods in the past. I think polypropylene is very competitively priced."

Well, thank you for all of your thoughtful questions, as always. And let me close with a few comments. First of all, 2015 was a very challenging year with significant oil price decline, feedstock price volatility and uncertain outlook for global economic growth. Despite all these headwinds, our portfolio continued to prove its resiliency, and we delivered record results. I think our focus on safety, operational reliability and cost efficiency continue to serve us very well and position us to outperform in a variety of market conditions. And this focus has enabled robust, free cash flow generation, which has been deployed in a very shareholder friendly way through low-cost, high-value growth projects, strong regular dividend and large stock buybacks. Going forward, our focus and priorities remain very consistent. Thanks for your continued interest in our company."

Let's take a look at Slide 4 and reflect on a few of the more notable financial accomplishments for 2015. Although we operate in a very capital-intensive industry, LyondellBasell's record earnings in 2015 generated robust cash flow and a 3",2679,"Thanks, Thomas. Let's take a look at Slide 4 and reflect on a few of the more notable financial accomplishments for 2015. Although we operate in a very capital-intensive industry, LyondellBasell's record earnings in 2015 generated robust cash flow and a 34% return on our invested capital. $1.4 billion of this cash was used to fund our capital program, while over $6 billion was committed to dividends and share buybacks. Our dividend yield places us in the top quintile of the S&P 500 Index, and the purchase of our outstanding shares relative to our average enterprise value placed us in the top 3% of the S&P 500. The strength of our earnings and our disciplined use of cash helped us to again outperform the S&P 500 on total shareholder return basis.
Before we dive deeper into the financials, I would like to call your attention to Slide #5. LyondellBasell's culture places a strong emphasis on continuously improving our health, safety and environmental performance. I'm proud to report that our team again achieved record safety performance in 2015. This is top decile performance for our industry. We believe that outstanding safety performance is an essential foundation for reliable operations that deliver differential financial performance. While I'm pleased to see the improvement for the past year, we'll continue to be relentless in our drive for safety perfection.
Our annual results summarized on Slide #6 exceeded the previous records established during 2014, with $8.1 billion of EBITDA and $10.35 of earnings per share during 2015. As seen in the quarterly results on the bottom of the slide, LyondellBasell's strong operating performance during the second and third quarters enabled us to capture the benefits of tight markets due to industry outages. Relatively lower margins resulting from more balanced markets, seasonal trends and lower crude prices, coupled with several planned and unplanned outages in our plants, reduced the company's fourth quarter profitability.
Slide 7 summarizes some 2015 accomplishments and segment results. Three of the 5 segments, Olefins & Polyolefins - Europe, Asia, International; Intermediates & Derivatives; and Technology achieved record results. Over $5.8 billion of cash flow from operations enabled us to buy back 52 million shares or 11% of the shares outstanding at the beginning of 2015. Additionally, we increased our interim dividend by 11% to $0.78 per share, bringing our total dividend for 2015 to $3.04 per share. I won't mention each of the operating accomplishments shown here, but I think these items exemplify our continued operating strength in advancing growth programs. Strong operations, advantaged feeds and incremental volumes reflect a common and consistent theme of how the entire team at LyondellBasell continually finds ways to realize more productivity from our existing assets.
Let's turn to Slide 8 and look at some of the metrics that drove 2015 performance. I'll highlight a few. Across the top of the page, we have plotted our key volumes. On the left, you can see the additional volume from our La Porte ethylene expansion and the steady increase in polyethylene and polypropylene volumes, largely from existing assets. In the charts along the bottom of the page, you see a summary of product margins and spreads. The indexed ethylene and polyolefins charts represent our internal data, while the other 2 represent industry benchmarks. Falling U.S. ethylene margins were partially offset by rising polyethylene and polypropylene margins, helping to maintain strong chain profitability.
In Europe, both Olefins & Polyolefins margins increased. MTBE and refining industry spreads remained relatively constant with prior years.
Please turn to Slide 9, which plots fourth quarter and full year segment results. As I already mentioned, this has been a record-setting year for both EBITDA and operating income. I'll review these in detail during the segment discussions.
Please turn to Slide 10, which provides a picture of our cash generation and use. During 2015, we generated $5.8 billion of cash from operations. We also took advantage of favorable interest rates and borrowed $1 billion at a coupon rate of 4 5/8%. The cash and short-term securities balance ended the year at $2.4 billion.
Turning to Slide 11, you can see the $5.8 billion in cash from operations. This cash generation has allowed us great flexibility. Over the past 4 years, we have funded $5.6 billion of capital investment and $18.7 billion towards dividends and share repurchases. Since the inception of our share repurchase program, we have repurchased approximately 142 million shares or about 25% of the total shares outstanding. At the end of 2015, we had approximately 15 million shares remaining under the existing share repurchase authorization. Since this is the beginning of a new year, I want to address some of your 2016 modeling questions. Regarding capital. We are currently planning to spend approximately $1.9 billion during 2016. This spending level progresses both our base maintenance and growth programs. Approximately 40% is targeted toward our growth program. Base maintenance spending increases this year due to a heavy turnaround schedule and increased health safety and environmental spending. The majority of the growth spending will be dedicated to the Corpus Christi ethylene expansion that should begin production during the third quarter. Although not all plans are finalized, we expect capital spending to remain around $2 billion annually through 2020. The largest individual growth project is our PO/TBA plant, which is currently estimated to cost approximately $2.1 billion. While we have not yet finalized plans and timing for all of our polyethylene growth projects, we are currently performing design engineering for a 1 billion pound expansion that could be complete during the 2018 to 2019 time frame.
Our net cash interest expense for 2016 is expected to be approximately $320 million. This includes interest on $7.7 billion of outstanding bonds at an average coupon rate of approximately 5.2% and $12 million of interest on short-term facilities.
At current conditions, we estimate that these expenses will be offset by approximately $100 million in benefits from interest rate and currency swaps and interest on our cash balance.
2016 annual book depreciation and amortization should be approximately $1.1 billion. We plan to make regular pension contributions that total approximately $110 million, and we estimate a pension expense of approximately $65 million. We currently expect a 2016 effective tax rate of approximately 28%. The cash tax rate is expected to be somewhat lower.
Now let's turn to Slide 12 and review segment results. As mentioned previously, my discussion of business results will be in regard to our underlying business results, excluding the impacts of the LCM inventory charges. In our Olefins & Polyolefins - Americas segment, fourth quarter EBITDA was $834 million, $86 million less than the third quarter. For the full year, segment EBITDA was $3.8 billion. Relative to the third quarter, ethylene margins decreased by $0.06 per pound. This decline was driven by prices that were lower by $0.04 per pound and higher costs due to lower coal product prices. Our operating rates remained strong during the quarter, averaging 95%. 72% of our ethylene production was from ethane, and approximately 90% came from NGLs.
In polyolefins, our polyethylene spread was relatively unchanged, while the polypropylene spread was up approximately $0.04 per pound. Polyethylene volumes were relatively unchanged. Polypropylene experienced sales volume decline of approximately 8% due to operating issues at our Bayport plant. For the full year, results decreased by $369 million with higher polyolefin results offsetting more than half of the decline in olefins. Polyolefins results provided approximately $570 million of improvement over the prior year due to margin improvement and increased polyethylene volumes from our 2014 Matagorda debottleneck.
Overall, 2015 was a year of transition, with lower crude prices moving margin from olefins into polyolefins. Industry operating rates for olefins improved, and our crackers operated reliably. We completed our Channelview expansion during the third quarter and captured the additional capacity from our 2014 La Porte olefins expansion and Matagorda polyethylene debottleneck. Our growth program for ethylene and polyethylene continues to add value.
In January, spot ethylene prices have continued to decline as the market follows lower oil prices. We continue to see margins holding for polyethylene and additional upside for polypropylene margins in a very tight North American market. A heavy turnaround season is planned for U.S. crackers in 2016, with the schedule particularly heavy during the second quarter, where IHS estimates that 10% of North American capacity will be offline. Our Corpus Christi ethylene turnaround and expansion will begin during the second quarter with completion planned during the third quarter.
Let's turn to Slide 13 and review performance in the Olefins & Polyolefins Europe, Asia and International segment. During the fourth quarter, underlying EBITDA was $451 million or $104 million lower than the third quarter. For the full year, underlying EBITDA was a record of nearly $1.9 billion, a $445 million increase versus 2014. Olefins results decreased versus the third quarter by approximately $130 million due to lower margins. Polyolefin results improved as sales volumes increased by 6% and 5% for polyethylene and polypropylene, respectively. Polyethylene margins remained strong, but were relatively unchanged, while polypropylene margins had a modest improvement. Our polypropylene compounding business improved modestly on higher sales volumes. Equity income decreased by $11 million due to a reduced margins at our Saudi Arabian joint ventures.
Olefins results for the full year increased by approximately $25 million over 2014. This increase is largely the result of a lower cost of naphtha that outpaced the declines in ethylene pricing. Excluding the impact of our Muenchsmunster cracker turnaround, we operated our crackers in Europe at 95%. Our polyolefin results increased approximately $420 million year-on-year, reflecting improved spreads and higher volumes for both polyethylene and polypropylene. Polypropylene compounding and polybutene-1 results were relatively unchanged versus 2014. 
Equity income from our joint ventures increased by $54 million due to strong margins at our joint ventures in Poland and South Korea.
During January, industry conditions were generally consistent with the fourth quarter. During March, we will start a turnaround on our Bayer, France olefins cracker that is expected to impact first quarter results by approximately $20 million. Joint venture equity earnings are anticipated to decline modestly, in part due to lower polyolefin prices and the Saudi feedstock price increases that took effect in late December.
Now please turn to Slide 14 for a discussion of our Intermediates & Derivatives segment. Fourth quarter EBITDA was $286 million, a decline of $220 million from the third quarter. For the full year, the segment generated record EBITDA of nearly $1.7 billion, $104 million more than 2014. The fourth quarter decline was attributable to typical seasonal demand declines combined with planned outages and uncharacteristically high unplanned outages at our plants. The segment's fourth quarter results were impacted by planned maintenance totaling approximately $20 million, and unplanned downtime impacted results by approximately $50 million. Propylene oxide and derivatives results decreased by approximately $10 million with slightly lower margins due to sales mix. In our Intermediate Chemicals business, EBITDA declined by approximately $160 million as styrene margins declined by $0.07 per pound. Included in the Intermediate Chemicals results, acetyl results declined by approximately $30 million due to lower volumes from an extended turnaround and a $0.17 per gallon decrease in methanol pricing. Oxyfuels results were lower by approximately $60 million, in line with typical seasonal trends. During most of 2015, LyondellBasell's propylene oxide and derivatives and styrene businesses captured opportunities, while the industry experienced operating problems that tightened the markets for those products. Intermediate Chemicals results improved by approximately $120 million due to improved styrene margins that were partially offset by lower methanol and vinyl acetate margins. Oxyfuels results decreased by approximately $60 million versus 2014, which benefited from unseasonably strong fourth quarter margins 1 year ago. The new year has started with stable demand in the propylene oxide market. Oxyfuel margins remain near typical winter levels. Methanol prices have come under pressure with additional capacity entering the market and lower crude oil prices. In contrast to the fourth quarter, we do not have any significant planned maintenance scheduled during the first quarter.
Let's move to Slide 15 for a discussion of the Refining segment. Fourth quarter EBITDA was $68 million, a decline of $75 million from the prior quarter. For the full year, the segment generated $519 million of EBITDA, an increase of $110 million versus 2014. During the fourth quarter, the Maya 2-1-1 spread averaged $18.55 per barrel, and crude throughput averaged 206,000 barrels per day. Rates were impacted by planned and unplanned maintenance. The total impact is estimated to be approximately $50 million. The lower Maya spread was primarily driven by seasonally weaker gasolines frac spreads. The cost of RINs increased by approximately $10 million related to the EPA ethanol requirements. 
2015 full year Refining results improved over 2014 despite challenges from a labor strike in the first quarter and a fourth quarter -- and fourth quarter operating issues. Crude throughput averaged 238,000 barrels per day, down 21,000 barrels per day from 2014. The Maya 2-1-1 benchmark decreased by approximately $2 per barrel to average $22 per barrel for the year. The refinery's capture rate of this margin improved during 2015, with improved secondary product margins and higher utilization rates -- higher utilization of discounted Canadian crude oil volumes. The cost of RINs were relatively unchanged. We are currently performing planned maintenance on a crude unit in a coker that is expected to impact first quarter results by approximately $40 million. First quarter crude oil throughput is expected to be similar to the fourth quarter of 2015.
Turning to Slide 16, let's step back and consider the changes that are occurring in our core olefins and polyolefins markets. As crude prices have fallen over the past 15 months, there has been some compression in North American monomer margins, but they remain quite good. This is illustrated by the gray bars in the charts on the top left. The chart in the upper right demonstrates that polyethylene and polypropylene demand growth improved in 2015 relative to the prior 4 years to approach the long-term growth averages we have seen over the past 25 years. This strong growth supports the balanced tight market conditions that are likely to persist into 2016. These healthy markets have resulted in strong polyolefin margins in both Europe and the U.S., as you can see from the blue bars on the left. Finally, the table on the lower right highlights LyondellBasell's leverage to these strong integrated chain margins. Global supply and demand balances, regional feedstock advantages and industry operating rates continue to support our positive outlook for our industry and our business. 
Let me conclude with Slide 17. The fourth quarter was a period where the ethylene industry returned to a balanced market as industry operating problems subsided. 
Polyolefin margin expansions offset much of the decline in monomer margins. At LyondellBasell, planned maintenance activities across our assets negatively impacted our results by approximately $55 million, while unplanned events increased the negative impact by $105 million. The fourth quarter was also impacted by seasonal factors, primarily in our fuel-related products, which negatively impacted the quarter by approximately $100 million. This is generally comparable to the seasonal impact over the last few years. 
During 2016, oil price volatility and concerns about the global economy will undoubtedly foster uncertainty in financial markets. Despite such uncertainty, we believe that we continue to benefit from abundant supplies of low-priced feedstocks and from solid underlying demand for our products. Additionally, we anticipate that the heavy industry outage schedule for the first half of 2016 will continue to be constructive for the markets we serve.

And typically with turnarounds, my sense is that the industry doesn't tend to build polyolefin inventory, especially here in the U.S., where we're able to supplement ethylene production through purchases and so on. So I think inventories are probably at average levels in our industry. And I would say downstream, they are on the low side. In terms of demand benefiting from lower energy, difficult to say. I think the more important theme is that in 2015, we saw a very good strong growth in polyethylene and polypropylene globally, including in Europe, where we saw demand growth. And I think this is a testament to the fact that both of those product areas and about 2/3 of our total output from the company goes into nondurable applications, which tend to grow generally irrespective of economic conditions. And so, again, I see next year or '16 being very similar that demand growth and supply growth will likely match, and we'll have pretty balanced markets. And again, if there is inventory replenishment downstream, then that should add to demand in '16."

We're coming into a March, April, May time frame that will bring a seasonal uptick in demand, likely inventory restocking. I would imagine, at some point, oil price will reach some kind of a bottom, and as that happens, it will bring buyers back. We've had -- if you think about 2015, we had a year where not only there was a lack of confidence on oil price, but also, there were questions about economic growth in the U.S. and in China and we had destocking. Despite that, polyethylene demand grew more than 4%. So that's what makes me constructive. In the near term, I don't know where polyethylene prices are going to go, but I think markets are pretty balanced."

Production of ethylene in the U.S. was at a record level in Q4. So we had the highest production at a time when we also had a largely merchant supplier of ethylene had logistics issues, where they had to move ethylene out of the Cameron because they were going to do some maintenance on it. Also, we had a very weak PVC market. So I think all of those things led to a decline in ethylene price in Q4, and that's kind of where we are today. As we work through Q1 and Q2, and we've talked about some of these large unplanned -- I'm sorry, planned outages that are in Q2, that will likely tighten the market. I would expect PVC to improve. The specific logistics issue I described, I think that will run its course by the end of Q1. So we'll have to see, but it seems to me that ethylene price ought to drift somewhat higher, and the forward curve indicates that for ethylene. The other thing that's important here in the U.S. is to also look at polyethylene price, and look at polyethylene price in the U.S. relative to the rest of the world, and I think that starts to make a lot more sense. So ethylene is priced more locally, and polyethylene is priced globally, and it's important to remember that distinction as we move through the year."

So I think meaningful expansions, as we sit here today, likely not until back half of '18, maybe '19, something like that if someone were to decide today. In the near term, polypropylene expansions have to come in concert with some thought about the source of propylene. And as we have more flexible crackers and propylene output varies, those who are going to expand have to take a view on where propylene prices are going and where the supply is going to come from. So my sense is that this year, people will probably take a look at that and see where we go. In the near term, I don't think higher polypropylene prices will impact demand or substitution from polyethylene. We've seen these periods in the past. I think polypropylene is very competitively priced."

Well, thank you for all of your thoughtful questions, as always. Let me close with a few comments. First of all, 2015 was a very challenging year, with significant oil price decline, feedstock price volatility and uncertain outlook for global economic growth. Despite all these headwinds, our portfolio continued to prove its resiliency, and we delivered record results. I think our focus on safety, operational reliability and cost efficiency continue to serve us very well and position us to outperform in a variety of market conditions. This focus has enabled robust free cash flow generation, which has been deployed in a very shareholder friendly way through low-cost, high-value growth projects, strong regular dividend and large stock buybacks. Going forward, our focus and priorities remain very consistent. Thanks for your continued interest in our company."

Before turning the call over to Bob, I'd like to call your attention to the noncash lower cost or market inventory adjustments, or LCM, that we have discussed on past calls. As previously explained, these adjustments are related to our use of LIFO accounting and the recent decline in prices of raw material and finished goods inventories. And during the first quarter, we recognized LCM charges totaling $68 million. And comments made in this call will be in regard to our underlying business results excluding the impact of these LCM inventory charges.

Let's begin with Slide 4 and review the highlights from the first quarter. Our first quarter diluted earnings per share improved relative to the fourth quarter to $2.48 per share with EBITDA of $1.9 billion. This excludes the $68 million lower of cost or market inventory adjustment. The sale of our Argentine subsidiary, Petroken, resulted in a gain of $78 million, which impacted earnings by $0.18 per share. We continue to deliver with 3 of our 5 operating segments improving in profitability relative to the fourth quarter.
During the quarter, our balanced stream integration in polyolefins and other derivatives enabled us to capture profitability as margin moved from monomer into polymers and other downstream products. Our chemical and polymer operations generally ran well across most sites, and we completed a planned maintenance turnaround in our refinery. After the close of the quarter, we completed our second Indian polypropylene compounding acquisition. We continue to execute on our financial priorities during the first quarter, and Thomas will provide you with an update on this progress in a few moments.
Slide 5 reflects the outstanding safety performance that our employees and contractors achieved during the first quarter of this year by reducing injuries to almost half the already low rates from the past several years. We strongly believe that an unrelenting focus on safety provides benefits to our operations and ultimate profitability. Operating reliability across our chemical facilities supports in this belief. And now, Thomas will discuss our financial highlights for the first quarter."

As Bob mentioned, 3 of our 5 business segments improved relative to their fourth quarter 2015 performance. In Olefins & Polyolefins Americas, results were similar to the fourth quarter. Olefins & Polyolefins EAI benefit from falling naphtha prices and continued strength in polymers. Intermediates & Derivatives benefit from a strong global styrene market and improved production following fourth quarter maintenance work. The refineries' low seasonal margins and reduced volumes largely due to a plant turnaround. Overall, despite the substantial fall in the price of crude oil and global economic uncertainties, our profitability has remained strong with $7.9 billion in EBITDA over the past 12 months.
Please turn to Slide 7, which provides a picture of cash generation and use. During the first quarter, we generated $1.3 billion of cash from operations and utilized a similar amount in dividends and share repurchases. We also took advantage of favorable interest rates to borrow EUR 750 million at a coupon rate of 1.875% [ph]. Our maintenance and growth category capital investments increased to $527 million during the first quarter with the majority of these investments focused on our Corpus Christi ethylene expansion and turnarounds at the refinery and our Berre, France facility.
During the quarter, we increased our cash and liquid investment by $577 million to [indiscernible] the balance of nearly $3 billion. Over the past 12 months, we generated $5.7 billion of cash from operations and again used a nearly equal amount for dividends and share repurchases. After investments in our capital program, our borrowing and other activities the cash and liquid investment balance declined by approximately $600 million.
Slide 8 provides our longer perspective as well as some current financial metrics. Our strong results and cash flow generation over multiple years positioned to steadily raise our dividend and purchase shares. Additionally, it has allowed us to access favorable credit markets while maintaining a strong balance sheet and BBB+ Baa1 credit rating. We finished the quarter with approximately $5 billion of liquidity and a total debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.2.
Our share repurchase program continued during the quarter with another 12.3 million shares purchased. Since the inception of the program, we have repurchased approximately 155 million shares or approximately 27% of the initial shares outstanding. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately 3 million shares remaining on the existing authorization. In our proxy statement filed with the SEC in early March, we proposed that our shareholders vote to authorize an additional share repurchase program of up to 10% of our outstanding shares.
During February, we received gross profits of $184 million from the sale of Petroken, our wholly-owned subsidiary in Argentina. The Petroken polypropylene sale provided an after-tax gain of $78 million. $57 million is to the American segment while $21 million is related to the PB compound business and to our EAI. The gain represents an $0.18 per share impact on our first quarter earnings.
Before I wrap up, I want to point out a few other items that might help you modeling of our company. First, our executive tax rate for the quarter was 29.5%, slightly higher than our annual estimate. The first quarter was impacted by discrete tax events, and our estimate for the full year remains unchanged at 28%.
Depreciation, amortization and interest expenses are currently running at rates in line with our previous annual estimate.
With that, I will turn the call back to Bob."

As mentioned previously, my discussion of business results will be in regard to our underlying business results excluding the impact of the LCM inventory charges. In our Olefins & Polyolefi",1638,"Thanks, Thomas. Let's turn to Slide 9 and review segment results. As mentioned previously, my discussion of business results will be in regard to our underlying business results excluding the impact of the LCM inventory charges. In our Olefins & Polyolefins Americas segment, first quarter EBITDA was $878 million, a $44 million improvement over the fourth quarter. This includes a $57 million gain from the sale of Petroken. Relative to the previous quarter, olefins results are relatively unchanged. Ethylene prices declined by approximately $0.005 per pound, and our margin slightly declined as we incurred an estimated $20 million negative impact related to ethylene purchases in preparation for our Corpus Christi plant turnaround. 
Our operating rates remained strong during the quarter, averaging 84% with similar high rates seen across the North American industry. 69% of our ethylene production was from ethane, and approximately 88% came from NGLs. In polyolefins, combined results declined by approximately $20 million. Results were driven by lower polyethylene spreads of approximately $0.04 per pound with price declines partially offset by lower ethane costs. Declines in polyethylene were partially offset by improved polypropylene results with spreads expanding by approximately $0.06 per pound over the fourth quarter. Polypropylene volumes relatively unchanged with improved U.S. volumes offset by the absence of Petroken volumes for most of the first quarter. During April, despite ethylene prices have improved over first quarter averages as supply has tightened during the heavy industry turnaround season, the quarter is benefiting from a $0.05 per pound March polyethylene price increase. Polypropylene prices may decline by a few cents during the quarter, but demand and margins remain strong. Our Corpus Christi ethylene turnaround and expansion began last week with completion planned during the third quarter. We currently estimate this to impact second quarter results by approximately $10 million and third quarter by approximately $40 million.
Let's turn to Slide 10 and review performance in the Olefins & Polyolefins Europe, Asia and International segment. During the first quarter, underlying EBITDA was $549 million or $98 million higher than the fourth quarter. These results include a $21 million gain from the Petroken sale. Olefins results improved by approximately $65 million with reduced cost for naphtha and other feeds outpacing a decline in ethylene prices. Our ethylene production volume was relatively unchanged as both periods included the impact of a plant turnaround.
Utilization of advantaged feedstocks increased by 7% of ethylene production to provide a $15 million advantage over naphtha during the quarter.
Operating rates for the ethylene industry during the first quarter have been reported at 91%, a level that has not been seen in Europe since the first quarter of 2008. In polyolefins, improved results were driven by higher margins. European polyethylene spreads increased by approximately $0.01 per pound, while polypropylene spreads improved by approximately $0.02 per pound. Our polypropylene compounding and equity income was relatively unchanged.
During April, global markets continued to tighten on strong demand with occasional reports of olefin and polyolefins shortages across various geographies and end-users. Next week, we anticipate completion of our Berre turnaround.
Now please turn to Slide 11 for a discussion of our Intermediates & Derivatives segment. First quarter EBITDA was $354 million, an improvement of $68 million from the fourth quarter. Results for propylene oxide and derivatives and oxyfuels were relatively unchanged. The improvement in I&D was largely driven by higher volumes and margins in the intermediate chemicals business. Styrene margins improved by approximately $0.02 per pound versus the fourth quarter. Our asset yields, C4 chemicals and the ethylene oxide and derivatives businesses all benefited from volume improvements relative to the fourth quarter when we performed maintenance.
Oxyfuels were relatively unchanged as low seasonal margins were offset by volume improvements. April has exhibited continued tightness for styrene and supported by pricing. Oxyfuel margins have started to rebound from winter levels, and methanol prices continue to be pressured by additional capacity entering the market with some offset from higher crude oil prices.
Let's move to Slide 12 for a discussion of the refining segment. First quarter EBITDA was $14 million, a decline of $54 million from the prior quarter. During the first quarter, the Maya 2-1-1 spread declined by $0.69 per barrel to average $17.86 for the quarter, and crude throughput averaged 186,000 barrels per day.
Rates were impacted by our plant turnaround and some unplanned maintenance. The cost of was relatively unchanged from the fourth quarter. As you may be aware, a fire occurred in 1 of our 2 corporate processing units at the refinery on April 8. While we have not yet completed the investigation to determine the cause and full impact of the incident, we have continued to operate the refinery during the 2 weeks following the fire, and we expect to operate at approximately 75% of full throughput during the second quarter. At the current time, we expect that repairs to return the refinery to full processing capability can be completed before the end of the second quarter. At current market conditions and repair expectations, we estimate a $40 million to $70 million second quarter impact.
Our Technology segment continue to perform well with an $18 million improvement to $73 million of EBITDA during the first quarter.
Turning back to the O&P segments, Slide 13 describes how our integrated positions in the ethylene chain help provide consistent profitability.
The last chart illustrates the balance of ethylene production and consumption amongst products in the U.S. and relative to our wholly owned and joint venture shares globally. In the U.S, typically less than 20% of our sales are into the merchant market. In addition to our polyethylene integration, approximately 1/4 of our U.S. ethylene production is consumed internally in products and processes including ethylene outside, styrene, vinyl acetate and metastasis. On a global basis, our ethylene position is relatively balanced. The right chart illustrates how polyethylene is partially offsetting moderation of ethylene margins and improving our capture of the full chain margin established by global price of polymers.
Turning to Slide 14. This slide provides a similar view of the propylene chain. In the U.S, our propylene oxide business consumes approximately 1/3 of our propylene production. Although we are short of propylene both in the U.S. and globally, we are comfortable with our strong long-term supply arrangements in all regions. With the addition of new on-purpose propylene production from PDH and MTO Technology around the world, we believe that the world will be well supplied for the foreseeable future. The expansion of polypropylene margins illustrated by the prices and spreads on the right chart has leveraged our leading global position in the polypropylene market. And with lower propylene pricing, the lower absolute price of polypropylene has driven strong demand growth globally.
Slide 15 illustrates the impact of new capacity and new technologies from the global ethylene market. As we discussed before, we believe that global demand growth in ethylene chain will continue to support effective operating rates between 90% and 93%. This is the zone that we have operated in since late 2014 and where the market will typically behave in a balanced to tight manner depending on maintenance schedules and operational reliability. While the upcoming capacity additions may create periods of disruption and local markets, the global market should be able to absorb these additions reasonably quickly. In the first quarter of 2016 , the industry appeared to shift from a balanced market towards the high end of this transition zone. We estimate that first quarter industry effective operating rates were 95% in the U.S., 91% in Europe and about 90% in Asia. Today, global conditions are quite tight.
The chart on the right describes why we believe that new and rapid additions of methanol to olefins-based ethylene capacity in China is beginning to play a role in establishing a high cost floor for global ethylene chain pricing. While naphtha and LPG economics drive the majority of global ethylene supply, the last incremental global supply is increasingly thrilled by production from new China NGL price.
Early in the first quarter, ethylene price was supported by this high cost floor, and as we entered the spring demand and turnaround season, global supply/demand tightened, and March prices reflect the transition from a balanced to tight global market as approximately $0.15 per pound above this high cost floor.
With approximately $0.25 per pound lower cost than MTO, U.S. ethane-based production should continue to benefit from strong operating rates.
Let me conclude with Slide 16. The first quarter developed as we anticipated. We continue to see strong and growing demand for our polyolefin products in all regions. This support full chain margins for our O&P businesses, our I&D, the completion of fourth quarter maintenance and strengthening styrene margins. Refining results were impacted by the turnaround and seasonally lower industry spends. We are actively managing our portfolio with a successful European bond placement, the completion of our Argentine divestiture, our second polypropylene compounding acquisition in India and continuation of the share repurchase program.
Looking forward, we see olefins and polyolefin markets remaining tight during the near term as there are heavy turnaround schedules in both the U.S. and Asia. The recent rise in crude oil prices provides tailwinds for both pricing and demand as customers no longer feel incentives to delay purchases in hopes of future declines in product prices. In fuel markets, we're realizing typical seasonal spread improvements that support both our oxyfuels and Refining businesses. Brand maintenance at our facilities is expected to impact second quarter results by approximately $20 million to $30 million, and the refinery repair will impact results by an additional $40 million to $70 million. The supply and inventory to natural gas and NGL feedstocks remain strong, and we expect pricing to remain favorable for the foreseeable future.
We are now pleased to take your questions."

I think we're in a regime where operating rates are balanced in that balanced zone to type zone. In Europe, the prices have held up well. We think operating rates are relatively high. We're moving into a seasonally strong period. So as I suspect that, generally, polyolefin prices pretty resilient in Europe for the foreseeable future going into Q3. In the case of the U.S. PP prices, a very large gap had developed between Asia and the U.S.,  and we have anticipated that some of that gap would need to be narrowed. Now part of that happened with Asian polypropylene prices moving up in Q1, and part of that has been with PP price declining some in the U.S. I think both things are coming back to balance, but if you step back, we'll likely land in the zone where margins are very good from a historical perspective. And I suspect that given where operating rates are, we should be able to sustain that for some period of time here. In terms of your last question about exports, our marginal export from the U.S. should go to Asia. That's really the destination. To the extent that we produce products in the U.S. and we could supplement our production in Europe, we might consider doing that, but we have a big base in Europe already. So we're really well positioned, I think, to optimize globally. We have a great marketing position in Asia. We have a big presence in Europe, and so our shift is really moving more to global optimization in polyolefins as this new capacity comes on having well positioned to capture value in that regard."

I mean, I think certainly that interplay between ethane, propane and butane is important. And we come into the summer months, propane and butane tend to price lower and are more abundant here in the U.S. Let me talk a little bit about ethane and the lots of people's minds. If you think about different time horizons think about the very near term, we still think there's a significant amount of that's occurring in the U.S. and some of that nearby the Gulf coast and in some of the shale plays like the Eagle Ford and the Permian and so on. So we think in the near term, there's plenty of ethane available. And certainly during this turnaround season, there's a little bit less ethane demand. As we go into the second half of the year, in Q3, there's quite a few turnarounds. So I think between that and propane and butane becoming more competitive in the cracker in the summer months, should do quite well. Longer term, I can't help but think that with all the reduction in E&P CapEx that eventually there should be a supply price response in oil, and we've seen a bit of that already with fairly big move in oil price recently. And as the oil price moves higher presumably, that makes propane and butane more valuable and likely, I think, wet gas more desirable to develop. And so we think that the crude-to-gas ratio should be favorable. We think that wet gas ought to be more desirable to produce and that in the end, that ethane demand increase over time will be met with more supply. And we've seen of that in the past where the space is able to respond pretty quickly. The infrastructure to the west is still fairly scalable. New fractionation capacity can be added very quickly, and capital cycle is far, far less than that for crackers. So in the end, if I step back, I think about there's plenty of hydrocarbons here and ethane available that really it's a matter of the degree of advantage, and I do think that greenfield investment will need to be undertaken more carefully in a 60, 65, 100-plus kind of oil environment. So that's how I see ethane short, medium and longer term."

This is around 90%, plus or minus, depending on timing of capacity expansions, how demand develops, as you say. The other thing that is very different about this cycle is the U.S. is positioned in the top quartile of the cost curve, so where our assets are. And when you think about the fourth quartile, MTO does become more meaningful as time goes on. And so to your point, that ought to be more and more the price setter. And as an oil price rises into -- presumably rises going into '17 and '18, we obviously -- the slope of this cost curve may be in some.

There's a little bit of a mix affect across We think of it as a global business and if different events occur in the industry often with other players of which part of we're going to be supplying.

And during today's call, we will focus on first quarter results, the current environment and the near-term outlook. Before turning the call over to Bob, I'd like to call your attention to the noncash lower of cost or market inventory adjustments, or LCM, that we have discussed on past calls. As previously explained, these adjustments are related to our use of LIFO accounting and the recent decline in prices of our raw material and finished goods inventories. And during the first quarter, we recognized LCM charges totaling $68 million. And comments made on this call will be in regard to our underlying business results excluding the impacts of these LCM inventory charges.

Let's begin with Slide 4 and review the highlights from the first quarter. Our first quarter diluted earnings per share improved relative to the fourth quarter to $2.48 per share with EBITDA of $1.9 billion. This excludes a $68 million lower of cost or market inventory adjustment. The sale of our Argentine subsidiary, Petroken, resulted in a gain of $78 million, which impacted earnings by $0.18 per share. We continue to deliver with 3 of our 5 operating segments improving in profitability relative to the fourth quarter.
During the quarter, our downstream integration in polyolefins and other derivatives enabled us to capture profitability as margin moved from monomer into polymers and other downstream products. Our chemical and polymer operations generally ran well across most sites, and we completed a planned maintenance turnaround in our refinery. After the close of the quarter, we completed our second Indian polypropylene compounding acquisition. We continue to execute on our financial priorities during the first quarter, and Thomas will provide you with an update on this progress in a few moments.
Slide 5 reflects the outstanding safety performance that our employees and contractors achieved during the first quarter of this year by reducing injuries to almost half the already low rates from the past several years. We strongly believe that an unrelenting focus on safety provides benefits to our operations, and ultimately, profitability. Good operating reliability across our chemical facilities supports in this belief. And now, Thomas will discuss our financial highlights for the first quarter."

As Bob mentioned, 3 of our 5 business segments improved relative to their fourth quarter 2015 performance. In Olefins & Polyolefins - Americas, results were similar to the fourth quarter. Olefins & Polyolefins - EAI benefited from falling naphtha prices and continued strength in polymers. Intermediates & Derivatives benefit from a strong global styrene market and improved production following fourth quarter maintenance work. The refineries saw low seasonal margins and reduced volumes largely due to a plant turnaround. Overall, despite the substantial fall in the price of crude oil and global economic uncertainties, our profitability has remained strong with $7.9 billion in EBITDA over the past 12 months.
Please turn to Slide 7, which provides a picture of cash generation and use. During the first quarter, we generated $1.3 billion of cash from operations and utilized a similar amount in dividends and share repurchases. We also took advantage of favorable interest rates to borrow EUR 750 million at a coupon rate of 1.875%. Our maintenance and growth capital investments increased to $527 million during the first quarter with the majority of these investments focused on our Corpus Christi ethylene expansion and turnarounds at the refinery and our Berre, France facility.
During the first quarter, we increased our cash and liquid investment by $577 million to end with a balance of nearly $3 billion. Over the past 12 months, we generated $5.7 billion of cash from operations and again used a nearly equal amount for dividends and share repurchases. After investments in our capital program, our borrowing and other activities, the cash and liquid investment balance declined by approximately $600 million.
Slide 8 provides a longer perspective as well as some current financial metrics. Our strong results and cash flow generation over multiple years positioned us to steadily raise our dividend and purchase shares. Additionally, it has allowed us to access favorable credit markets while maintaining a strong balance sheet and BBB+ Baa1 credit rating. We finished the quarter with approximately $5 billion of liquidity and a total debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.2.
Our share repurchase program continued during the quarter with another 12.3 million shares purchased. Since the inception of the program, we have repurchased approximately 155 million shares or approximately 27% of the initial shares outstanding. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately 3 million shares remaining on the existing authorization. In our proxy statement filed with the SEC in early March, we proposed that our shareholders vote to authorize an additional repurchase program of up to 10% of our outstanding shares.
During February, we received gross proceeds of $184 million from the sale of Petroken, our wholly-owned subsidiary in Argentina. The Petroken polypropylene sale provided an after-tax gain of $78 million. $57 million is poked to the O&P-America segment while $21 million is related to the PB compound business and poked to O&P-EAI. The gain represents an $0.18 per share impact on our first quarter earnings.
Before I wrap up, I want to point out a few other items that might help your modeling of our company. First, our executive tax rate for the quarter was 29.5%, slightly higher than our annual estimate. The first quarter was impacted by discrete tax events, and our estimate for the full year remains unchanged at 28%.
Depreciation, amortization and interest expenses are currently running at rates in line with our previous annual estimate.
With that, I will turn the call back to Bob."

Let's turn to Slide 9 and review segment results. As mentioned previously, my discussion of business results will be in regard to our underlying business results excluding the impact of the LCM inventory charges. In our Olefins & Polyolefi",1646,"Thanks, Thomas. Let's turn to Slide 9 and review segment results. As mentioned previously, my discussion of business results will be in regard to our underlying business results excluding the impact of the LCM inventory charges. In our Olefins & Polyolefins - Americas segment, first quarter EBITDA was $878 million, a $44 million improvement over the fourth quarter. This includes a $57 million gain from the sale of Petroken. Relative to the previous quarter, olefins results are relatively unchanged. Ethylene prices declined by approximately $0.005 per pound, and our margin slightly declined as we incurred an estimated $20 million negative impact related to ethylene purchases in preparation for our Corpus Christi plant turnaround. 
Our operating rates remain strong during the quarter, averaging 94% with similar high rates seen across the North American industry. 69% of our ethylene production was from ethane, and approximately 88% came from NGLs. In polyolefins, combined results declined by approximately $20 million. Results were driven by lower polyethylene spreads of approximately $0.04 per pound with price declines partially offset by lower ethylene costs. Declines in polyethylene were partially offset by improved polypropylene results with spreads expanding by approximately $0.06 per pound over the fourth quarter. Polypropylene volumes were relatively unchanged, with improved U.S. volumes offset by the absence of Petroken volumes for most of the first quarter. During April, spot ethylene prices have improved over first quarter averages as supply has tightened during a heavy industry turnaround season. The quarter is benefiting from a $0.05 per pound March polyethylene price increase. Polypropylene prices may decline by a few cents during the quarter, but demand and margins remain strong. Our Corpus Christi ethylene turnaround and expansion began last week with completion planned during the third quarter. We currently estimate this to impact second quarter results by approximately $10 million and third quarter by approximately $40 million.
Let's turn to Slide 10 and review performance in the Olefins & Polyolefins Europe, Asia and International segment. During the first quarter, underlying EBITDA was $549 million or $98 million higher than the fourth quarter. These results include a $21 million gain from the Petroken sale. Olefins results improved by approximately $65 million with reduced cost for naphtha and other feeds outpacing a decline in ethylene prices. Our ethylene production volume was relatively unchanged, as both periods included the impact of a plant turnaround.
Utilization of advantaged feedstocks increased by 7% of ethylene production to provide a $15 million advantage over naphtha during the quarter.
Operating rates for the ethylene industry during the first quarter have been reported at 91%, a level that has not been seen in Europe since the first quarter of 2008. In polyolefins, improved results were driven by higher margins. European polyethylene spreads increased by approximately $0.01 per pound, while polypropylene spreads improved by approximately $0.02 per pound. Our polypropylene compounding and equity income was relatively unchanged.
During April, global markets continued to tighten on strong demand, with occasional reports of olefin and polyolefin shortages across various geographies and end-users. Next week, we anticipate completion of our Berre turnaround.
Now please turn to Slide 11 for a discussion of our Intermediates & Derivatives segment. First quarter EBITDA was $354 million, an improvement of $68 million from the fourth quarter. Results for propylene oxide and derivatives and oxyfuels were relatively unchanged. The improvement in I&D was largely being driven by higher volumes and margins in the intermediate chemicals business. Styrene margins improved by approximately $0.02 per pound versus the fourth quarter. Our asset yields, C4 chemicals and the ethylene oxide and derivatives businesses all benefited from volume improvements relative to the fourth quarter when we perform maintenance.
Oxyfuels were relatively unchanged as low seasonal margins were offset by volume improvements. April has exhibited continued tightness for styrene that has supported strong pricing. Oxyfuel margins have started to rebound from winter levels, and methanol prices continue to be pressured by additional capacity entering the market with some offset from higher crude oil prices.
Let's move to Slide 12 for a discussion of the refining segment. First quarter EBITDA was $14 million, a decline of $54 million from the prior quarter. During the first quarter, the Maya 2-1-1 spread declined by $0.69 per barrel to average $17.86 for the quarter, and crude throughput averaged 186,000 barrels per day.
Rates were impacted by our plant turnaround and some unplanned maintenance. The cost of RINs was relatively unchanged from the fourth quarter. As you may be aware, a fire occurred in 1 of our 2 coker processing units at the refinery on April 8. While we have not yet completed the investigation to determine the cause and full impact of the incident, we have continued to operate the refinery during the 2 weeks following the fire, and we expect to operate at approximately 75% of full throughput during the second quarter. At the current time, we expect that repairs to return the refinery to full processing capability can be completed before the end of the second quarter. At current market conditions and repair expectations, we estimate a $40 million to $70 million second quarter impact.
Our Technology segment continued to perform well with an $18 million improvement to $73 million of EBITDA during the first quarter.
Turning back to the O&P segments, Slide 13 describes how our integrated positions in the ethylene chain help provide consistent profitability.
The left chart illustrates the balance of ethylene production and consumption among products in the U.S. and relative to our wholly owned and joint venture share globally. In the U.S, typically less than 20% of our sales are into the merchant market. In addition to our polyethylene integration, approximately 1/4 of our U.S. ethylene production is consumed internally in products and processes including ethylene oxide, styrene, vinyl acetate and metathesis. On a global basis, our ethylene position is relatively balanced. The right chart illustrates how polyethylene is partially offsetting moderation of regional ethylene margins and improving our capture of the full chain margin established by global price of polymers.
Turning to Slide 14. This slide provides a similar view of the propylene chain. In the U.S, our propylene oxide business consumes approximately 1/3 of our propylene production. Although we are short of propylene both in the U.S. and globally, we are comfortable with our strong long-term supply arrangements in all regions. With the addition of new on-purpose propylene production from PDH and MTO technology around the world, we believe that the world will be well supplied for the foreseeable future. The expansion of polypropylene margins illustrated by the prices and spreads on the right chart has leveraged our leading global position in the polypropylene market. And with lower propylene pricing, the lower absolute price of polypropylene has driven strong demand growth globally.
Slide 15 illustrates the impact of new capacity and new technologies on the global ethylene market. As we have discussed before, we believe that global demand growth in the ethylene chain will continue to support effective operating rates, between 90% and 93%. This is the zone that we have operated in since late 2014 and where the market will typically behave in a balanced to tight manner depending on maintenance schedules and operational reliability. While the upcoming capacity additions may create periods of disruption in local markets, the global market should be able to absorb these additions reasonably quickly. In the first quarter of 2016, the industry appeared to shift from a balanced market toward the high end of this transition zone. We estimate that first quarter industry effective operating rates were 95% in the U.S., 91% in Europe and about 90% in Asia. Today, global conditions are quite tight.
The chart on the right describes why we believe that new and rapid additions of methanol to olefins-based ethylene capacity in China is beginning to play a role in establishing a high cost floor for global ethylene chain pricing. While naphtha and LPG economics drive the majority of global ethylene supply, the last incremental global supply is increasingly filled by production from new China NGL plants.
Early in the first quarter, ethylene price was supported by this high cost floor, and as we entered the spring demand and turnaround season, global supply/demand tightened, and March prices reflect the transition from a balanced to tight global market that is approximately $0.15 per pound above this high cost floor.
With approximately $0.25 per pound lower cost than MTO, U.S. ethane-based production should continue to benefit from strong operating rates.
Let me conclude with Slide 16. The first quarter developed as we anticipated. We continue to see strong and growing demand for our polyolefin products in all regions. This supported full chain margins for our O&P businesses, our I&D, the completion of fourth quarter maintenance and strengthening styrene margins. Refining results were impacted by the turnaround and seasonally lower industry spends. We are actively managing our portfolio with a successful European bond placement, the completion of our Argentine divestiture, our second polypropylene compounding acquisition in India and continuation of the share repurchase program.
Looking forward, we see olefins and polyolefin markets remaining tight during the near term as there are heavy turnaround schedules in both the U.S. and Asia. The recent rise in crude oil prices provides tailwinds for both pricing and demand as customers no longer feel incentives to delay purchases in hopes of future declines in product prices. In field markets, we are realizing typical seasonal spread improvements that support both our oxyfuels and Refining businesses. Planned maintenance at our facilities is expected to impact second quarter results by approximately $20 million to $30 million, and the refinery repair will impact results by an additional $40 million to $70 million. The supply and inventory to natural gas and NGL feedstocks remain strong, and we expect pricing to remain favorable for the foreseeable future.
We're now pleased to take your questions."

I think we're in a regime where operating rates are balanced in that balanced zone to tight zone. In Europe, PE prices have held up well. We think operating rates are relatively high. We're moving into a seasonally strong period. So I suspect that, generally, polyolefin prices will be pretty resilient in Europe for the foreseeable future going into Q3. In the case of the U.S. PP prices, a very large gap had developed between Asia and the U.S., and we had anticipated that some of that gap would need to be narrowed. Now part of that's happened with Asian polypropylene prices moving up in Q1, and part of that has been with PP price declining some in the U.S. I think those things are coming back into balance, but if you step back, we'll likely land in a zone where margins are very good from a historical perspective. And I suspect that given where operating rates are, we should be able to sustain that for some period of time here. In terms of your last question about exports, our marginal export from the U.S. should go to Asia. That's really the destination. To the extent that we produce products in the U.S. and we could supplement our production in Europe, we might consider doing that, but we have a big base in Europe already. So we're really well positioned, I think, to optimize globally. We have a great marketing position in Asia. We have a big presence in Europe, and so our shift is really moving more to global optimization in polyolefins as this new capacity comes on, having been well positioned to capture value in that regard."

And as we come into the summer months, propane and butane tend to price lower and are more abundant here in the U.S. But let me talk a little bit about ethane and I know this a topic that's on a lot of people's minds. If you think about different time horizons, think about the very near term, we still think there's a significant amount of rejection that's occurring in the U.S. and some of that nearby the Gulf coast and in some of the shale plays like the Eagle Ford and the Permian and so on. So we think in the near term, there's plenty of ethane available. And certainly during this turnaround season, there's a little bit less ethane demand. As we go into the second half of the year, in Q3, there's quite a few turnarounds. So I think between that and propane and butane becoming more competitive in the cracker [indiscernible] trade in the summer months, ethane should do quite well. Longer term, I can't help but think that with all the reduction in E&P CapEx, that eventually there should be a supply price response in oil, and we've seen a bit of that already with the fairly big move in oil price recently. And as the oil price moves higher presumably, that makes propane and butane more valuable and likely, I think, wet gas, are more desirable to develop. And so we think that the crude-to-gas ratio should be favorable. We think that wet gas ought to be more desirable to produce and that in the end, that ethane demand increase over time will be met with more supply. And we've seen of that in the past where the midstream space is able to respond pretty quickly. The infrastructure to the west is still fairly scalable. New fractionation capacity can be added very quickly. The capital cycle is far, far less than that for crackers. So in the end, I mean, if I step back, I think about there's plenty of hydrocarbons here and ethane available that really it's a matter of the degree of advantage, and I do think that greenfield investment will need to be undertaken more carefully in a 60, 65, 100-plus kind of oil environment. So that's how I see ethane short, medium and longer term."

The other thing that I think is very different about this cycle is the U.S. is positioned in the top quartile of the cost curve, so we're going to where our assets are. And when you think about the fourth quartile, MTO does become more meaningful as time goes on. And so, to your point, that ought to be more and more the price setter.

And then, we also had the maintenance going on across ethylene glycol and the acetyls. So fourth quarter volume is pretty heavily affected by maintenance. First quarter really reflects all assets up and running. There's a little bit of a mix affect across PO. You got to think of it as a global business, and as different events occur in the industry, often with other players, of which part of the globe you're going to be supplying. But in general, I think if you went back over our past 5 years, what you'd see is a typical comment about propylene oxide and derivatives has a very stable quarter-to-quarter profitability."

And during today's call, we'll focus on first quarter results, the current environment and the near-term outlook. Before turning the call over to Bob, I'd like to call your attention to the noncash lower of cost or market inventory adjustments, or LCM, that we have discussed on past calls. As previously explained, these adjustments are related to our use of LIFO accounting and the recent decline in prices of our raw material and finished goods inventories. And during the first quarter, we recognized LCM charges totaling $68 million. And comments made on this call will be in regard to our underlying business results excluding the impacts of these LCM inventory charges.

Let's begin with Slide 4 and review the highlights from the first quarter. Our first quarter diluted earnings per share improved relatively to the fourth quarter to $2.48 per share with EBITDA of $1.9 billion. This excludes a $68 million lower of cost or market inventory adjustment. The sale of our Argentine subsidiary, Petroken, resulted in a gain of $78 million, which impacted earnings by $0.18 per share. We continued to deliver with 3 of our 5 operating segments improving in profitability relative to the fourth quarter.
During the quarter, our downstream integration in polyolefins and other derivatives enabled us to capture profitability as margin moved from monomer into polymers and other downstream products. Our chemical and polymer operations generally ran well across most sites, and we completed a planned maintenance turnaround in our refinery. After the close of the quarter, we completed our second Indian polypropylene compounding acquisition. We continued to execute on our financial priorities during the first quarter, and Thomas will provide you with an update on this progress in a few moments.
Slide 5 reflects the outstanding safety performance that our employees and contractors achieved during the first quarter of this year by reducing injuries to almost half the already low rates from the past several years. We strongly believe that an unrelenting focus on safety provides benefits to our operations and, ultimately, profitability. Good operating reliability across our chemical facilities supports this belief. And now, Thomas will discuss our financial highlights for the first quarter."

As Bob mentioned, 3 of our 5 business segments improved relative to their fourth quarter 2015 performance. In Olefins & Polyolefins - Americas, results were similar to the fourth quarter. Olefins & Polyolefins - EAI benefited from falling naphtha prices and continued strength in polymers. Intermediates & Derivatives benefit from a strong global styrene market and improved production following fourth quarter maintenance work. The refineries saw low seasonal margins and reduced volumes largely due to a planned turnaround. Overall, despite the substantial fall in the price of crude oil and global economic uncertainties, our profitability has remained strong with $7.9 billion in EBITDA over the past 12 months.
Please turn to Slide 7, which provides a picture of cash generation and use. During the first quarter, we generated $1.3 billion of cash from operations and utilized a similar amount in dividends and share repurchases. We also took advantage of favorable interest rates to borrow EUR 750 million at a coupon rate of 1.875%. Our maintenance and growth capital investments increased to $527 million during the first quarter with the majority of these investments focused on our Corpus Christi ethylene expansion and turnarounds at the refinery and our Berre, France, facility.
During the first quarter, we increased our cash and liquid investment by $577 million to end with a balance of nearly $3 billion. Over the past 12 months, we generated $5.7 billion of cash from operations and, again, used a nearly equal amount for dividends and share repurchases. After investments in our capital program, our borrowing and other activities, the cash and liquid investment balance declined by approximately $600 million.
Slide 8 provides a longer perspective as well as some current financial metrics. Our strong results and cash flow generation over multiple years positioned us to steadily raise our dividend and purchase shares. Additionally, it has allowed us to access favorable credit markets while maintaining a strong balance sheet and BBB+, Baa1 credit ratings. We finished the quarter with approximately $5 billion of liquidity and a total debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.2.
Our share repurchase program continued during the quarter with another 12.3 million shares purchased. Since the inception of the program, we have repurchased approximately 155 million shares or approximately 27% of the initial shares outstanding. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately 3 million shares remaining on the existing authorization. In our proxy statement filed with the SEC in early March, we proposed that our shareholders vote to authorize an additional repurchase program of up to 10% of our outstanding shares.
During February, we received gross proceeds of $184 million from the sale of Petroken, our wholly owned subsidiary in Argentina. The Petroken polypropylene sale provided an after-tax gain of $78 million. $57 million is poked [ph] to the O&P-America segment, while $21 million is related to the PP compound business and poked [ph] to O&P-EAI. The gain represents an $0.18 per share impact on our first quarter earnings.
Before I wrap up, I want to point out a few other items that might help your modeling of our company. First, our executive tax rate for the quarter was 29.5%, slightly higher than our annual estimate. The first quarter was impacted by discrete tax events, and our estimate for the full year remains unchanged at 28%.
Depreciation, amortization and interest expenses are currently running at rates in line with our previous annual estimate. 
With that, I will turn the call back to Bob."

Let's turn to Slide 9 and review segment results. As mentioned previously, my discussion of business results will be in regard to our underlying business results excluding the impact of the LCM inventory charges. In our Olefins & Polyolefi",1641,"Thanks, Thomas. Let's turn to Slide 9 and review segment results. As mentioned previously, my discussion of business results will be in regard to our underlying business results excluding the impact of the LCM inventory charges. In our Olefins & Polyolefins - Americas segment, first quarter EBITDA was $878 million, a $44 million improvement over the fourth quarter. This includes a $57 million gain from the sale of Petroken. Relative to the previous quarter, olefins results were relatively unchanged. Ethylene prices declined by approximately $0.005 per pound, and our margin slightly declined as we incurred an estimated $20 million negative impact related to ethylene purchases in preparation for our Corpus Christi planned turnaround. 
Our operating rates remained strong during the quarter, averaging 94% with similar high rates seen across the North American industry. 69% of our ethylene production was from ethane, and approximately 88% came from NGLs. In polyolefins, combined results declined by approximately $20 million. Results were driven by lower polyethylene spreads of approximately $0.04 per pound with price declines partially offset by lower ethylene costs. Declines in polyethylene were partially offset by improved polypropylene results with spreads expanding by approximately $0.06 per pound over the fourth quarter. Polypropylene volumes were relatively unchanged with improved U.S. volumes offset by the absence of Petroken volumes for most of the first quarter. 
During April, spot ethylene prices have improved over first quarter averages as supply has tightened during a heavy industry turnaround season. The quarter is benefiting from a $0.05 per pound March polyethylene price increase. Polypropylene prices may decline by a few cents during the quarter, but demand and margins remain strong. Our Corpus Christi ethylene turnaround and expansion began last week with completion planned during the third quarter. We currently estimate this to impact second quarter results by approximately $10 million and third quarter by approximately $40 million.
Let's turn to Slide 10 and review performance in the Olefins & Polyolefins Europe, Asia and International segment. During the first quarter, underlying EBITDA was $549 million or $98 million higher than the fourth quarter. These results include a $21 million gain from the Petroken sale. Olefins results improved by approximately $65 million with reduced cost for naphtha and other feeds outpacing a decline in ethylene prices. Our ethylene production volume was relatively unchanged as both periods included the impact of a planned turnaround.
Utilization of advantaged feedstocks increased by 7% of ethylene production to provide a $15 million advantage over naphtha during the quarter.
Operating rates for the ethylene industry during the first quarter have been reported at 91%, a level that has not been seen in Europe since the first quarter of 2008. In polyolefins, improved results were driven by higher margins. European polyethylene spreads increased by approximately $0.01 per pound while polypropylene spreads improved by approximately $0.02 per pound. Our polypropylene compounding and equity income was relatively unchanged.
During April, global markets continued to tighten on strong demand with occasional reports of olefin and polyolefin shortages across various geographies and end-uses. Next week, we anticipate completion of our Berre turnaround.
Now please turn to Slide 11 for a discussion of our Intermediates & Derivatives segment. First quarter EBITDA was $354 million, an improvement of $68 million from the fourth quarter. Results for propylene oxide and derivatives and oxyfuels were relatively unchanged. The improvement in I&D was largely driven by higher volumes and margins in the intermediate chemicals business. Styrene margins improved by approximately $0.02 per pound versus the fourth quarter. Our asset yields, C4 chemicals and the ethylene oxide and derivatives businesses all benefited from volume improvements relative to the fourth quarter when we perform maintenance.
Oxyfuels were relatively unchanged as low seasonal margins were offset by volume improvements. April has exhibited continued tightness for styrene that has supported strong pricing. Oxyfuel margins have started to rebound from winter levels, and methanol prices continue to be pressured by additional capacity entering the market with some offset from higher crude oil prices.
Let's move to Slide 12 for a discussion of the refining segment. First quarter EBITDA was $14 million, a decline of $54 million from the prior quarter. During the first quarter, the Maya 2-1-1 spread declined by $0.69 per barrel to average $17.86 for the quarter, and crude throughput averaged 186,000 barrels per day.
Rates were impacted by our planned turnaround and some unplanned maintenance. The cost of RINs was relatively unchanged from the fourth quarter. As you may be aware, a fire occurred in 1 of our 2 coker processing units at the refinery on April 8. While we have not yet completed the investigation to determine the cause and full impact of the incident, we have continued to operate the refinery during the 2 weeks following the fire, and we expect to operate at approximately 75% of full throughput during the second quarter. At the current time, we expect that repairs to return the refinery to full processing capability can be completed before the end of the second quarter. At current market conditions and repair expectations, we estimate a $40 million to $70 million second quarter impact.
Our Technology segment continued to perform well with an $18 million improvement to $73 million of EBITDA during first quarter.
Turning back to the O&P segments, Slide 13 describes how our integrated positions in the ethylene chain help provide consistent profitability. The left chart illustrates the balance of ethylene production and consumption among products in the U.S. and relative to our wholly owned and joint venture share globally. In the U.S., typically less than 20% of our sales are into the merchant market. In addition to our polyethylene integration, approximately 1/4 of our U.S. ethylene production is consumed internally in products and processes, including ethylene oxide, styrene, vinyl acetate and metathesis. On a global basis, our ethylene position is relatively balanced. The right chart illustrates how polyethylene is partially offsetting moderation of regional ethylene margins and improving our capture of the full chain margin established by global price of polymers.
Turning to Slide 14. This slide provides a similar view of the propylene chain. In the U.S., our propylene oxide business consumes approximately 1/3 of our propylene production. Although we are short of propylene both in the U.S. and globally, we are comfortable with our strong long-term supply arrangements in all regions. With the addition of new on-purpose propylene production from PDH and MTO technology around the world, we believe that the world will be well supplied for the foreseeable future. The expansion of polypropylene margins illustrated by the prices and spreads on the right chart has leveraged our leading global position in the polypropylene market. And with lower propylene pricing, the lower absolute price of polypropylene has driven strong demand growth globally.
Slide 15 illustrates the impact of new capacity and new technologies on the global ethylene market. As we have discussed before, we believe that global demand growth in ethylene chains will continue to support effective operating rates between 90% and 93%. This is the zone that we have operated in since late 2014 and where the market will typically behave in a balanced to tight manner depending on maintenance schedules and operational reliability. While the upcoming capacity additions may create periods of disruption in local markets, the global market should be able to absorb these additions reasonably quickly. In the first quarter of 2016, the industry appeared to shift from a balanced market toward the high end of this transition zone. We estimate that first quarter industry effective operating rates were 95% in the U.S., 91% in Europe and about 90% in Asia. Today, global conditions are quite tight.
The chart on the right describes why we believe that new and rapid additions of methanol to olefins-based ethylene capacity in China is beginning to play a role in establishing a high cost floor for global ethylene chain pricing. While naphtha and LPG economics drive the majority of global ethylene supply, the last incremental global supply is increasingly filled by production from new China MTO plants.
Early in the first quarter, ethylene price was supported by this high cost floor, and as we entered the spring demand and turnaround season, global supply/demand tightened, and March prices reflect the transition from a balanced to tight global market that is approximately $0.15 per pound above this high-cost floor.
With approximately $0.25 per pound lower costs than MTO, U.S. ethane-based production should continue to benefit from strong operating rates.
Let me conclude with Slide 16. The first quarter developed as we anticipated. We continue to see strong and growing demand for our polyolefin products in all regions. This supported full chain margins for our O&P businesses, our I&D, the completion of fourth quarter maintenance and strengthening styrene margins. Refining results were impacted by the turnaround and seasonally lower industry spreads. We are actively managing our portfolio with a successful European bond placement, the completion of our Argentine divestiture, our second polypropylene compounding acquisition in India and continuation of the share repurchase program.
Looking forward, we see olefins and polyolefin markets remaining tight during the near term as there are heavy turnaround schedules in both the U.S. and Asia. The recent rise in crude oil prices provides tailwinds for both pricing and demand as customers no longer feel incentives to delay purchases in hopes of future declines in product prices. In fuel markets, we're realizing typical seasonal spread improvements that support both our oxyfuels and Refining businesses. Planned maintenance at our facilities is expected to impact second quarter results by approximately $20 million to $30 million, and the refinery repair will impact results by an additional $40 million to $70 million. The supply and inventory of natural gas and NGL feedstocks remain strong, and we expect pricing to remain favorable for the foreseeable future.
We're now pleased to take your questions."

I think we're in a regime where operating rates are balanced in that balanced zone to tight zone. In Europe, PE prices have held up well. We think operating rates are relatively high. We're moving into a seasonally strong period. So I suspect that, generally, polyolefin prices will be pretty resilient in Europe for the foreseeable future going into Q3. In the case of the U.S. PP prices, a very large gap had developed between Asia and the U.S., and we had anticipated that some of that gap would need to be narrowed. Now part of that's happened with Asian polypropylene prices moving up in Q1, and part of that has been with PP price declining some in the U.S. I think those things are coming back into balance, but if you step back, we'll likely land in a zone where margins are very good from a historical perspective. And I suspect that, given where operating rates are, we should be able to sustain that for some period of time here. In terms of your last question about exports, our marginal export from the U.S. should go to Asia. That's really the destination. To the extent that we produce products in the U.S. and we could supplement our production in Europe, we might consider doing that, but we have a big base in Europe already. So we're really well positioned, I think, to optimize globally. We have a great marketing position in Asia. We have a big presence in Europe, and so our shift is really moving more to global optimization in polyolefins as this new capacity comes on having been well positioned to capture value in that regard."

And as we come into the summer months, propane and butane tend to price lower and are more abundant here in the U.S. But let me talk a little bit about ethane, and I know this a topic that's on a lot of people's minds. If you think about different time horizons, think about the very near term, we still think there's a significant amount of rejection that's occurring in the U.S. and some of that nearby the Gulf Coast and in some of the shale plays like the Eagle Ford and the Permian and so on. So we think in the near term, there's plenty of ethane available. And certainly during this turnaround season, there's a little bit less ethane demand. As we go into the second half of the year, in Q3, there's quite a few turnarounds. So I think between that and propane and butane becoming more competitive in the cracker feed trade in the summer months, ethane should do quite well. Longer term, I can't help but think that with all the reduction in E&P CapEx, that eventually there should be a supply price response in oil, and we've seen a bit of that already with the fairly big move in oil price recently. And as the oil price moves higher presumably, that makes propane and butane more valuable and, likely, I think, wet gas, more desirable to develop. And so we think that the crude-to-gas ratio should be favorable. We think that wet gas ought to be more desirable to produce and that in the end, that ethane demand increase over time will be met with more supply. And we've seen that in the past where the midstream space is able to respond pretty quickly. The infrastructure to the West is still fairly scalable. New fractionation capacity can be added very quickly. The capital cycle is far, far less than that for crackers. So in the end, I mean, if I step back, I think about there's plenty of hydrocarbons here and ethane available that, really, it's a matter of the degree of advantage, and I do think that greenfield investment will need to be undertaken more carefully in a 60, 65, 100-plus kind of oil environment. So that's how I see ethane short, medium and longer term."

This is kind of around 90%, plus or minus, depending on timing of capacity expansions, how demand develops, as you say. The other thing that I think is very different about this cycle is the U.S. is positioned in the top quartile of the cost curve, so we're going to run our assets hard. And if you think about the fourth quartile, MTO does become more meaningful as time goes on. And so, to your point, that ought to be more and more the price setter. And as oil price rises, going into -- presumably rises, going into '17 and '18, we ought to see the slope of this cost curve maybe inch up some.

But frankly, part of that was, was offset by pretty good styrene margins, and we think those should continue."

First quarter really reflects all assets up and running. There's a little bit of a mix affect across PO. You have to think of it as a global business, and as different events occur in the industry, often with other players, of which parts of the globe you're going to be supplying. But in general, I think if you went back over our past 5 years, what you'd see is a typical comment about propylene oxide and derivatives as a very stable quarter-to-quarter profitability."

And during today's call, we'll focus on second quarter results, the current environment and the near-term outlook. But before I turn the call over to Bob, I'd like to call your attention to the noncash lower cost for market inventory adjustments or LCM that we've discussed on past calls. As previously explained, these adjustments are related to our use of LIFO accounting and the volatility in prices of our raw material and finished goods inventories. And second quarter price recoveries for impacted products resulted in the reversal of the entire $68 million first quarter LCM charge. Interim LCM charges are reversed in subsequent periods when information shows the outstanding charge may not be sustained through year-end. However, I'd also remind you that LCM charges that exist at year-end cannot be reversed. Additionally, if there are future price declines within our inventory accruals during the remainder of the year, this could lead to additional LCM charges. Now comments made on this call will be in regard to our underlying business results excluding the impacts of these LCM inventory charges. 
Now with that being said, I'll turn the call over to Bob."

Let's begin with Slide 4 and review the highlights of the second quarter. Our second quarter diluted earnings per share declined relative to the first quarter to $2.45 per share with EBITDA of $1.7 billion. This excludes a $68 million lower of cost for market inventory gain. While the gain on sale of the Petroken Argentine business is also excluded from first quarter results, underlying earnings per share in the second quarter increased by $0.15 per share. Overall, second quarter business trends were as we had expected. 
During the quarter, our downstream integration in polyolefins and other olefin derivatives enabled us to capture strong chain margins. Positive seasonal oxyfuels margin trends benefited the Intermediates & Derivatives business. While our chemical polymer operations generally ran well, there was scheduled maintenance and some unplanned downtime across the company. Most significantly, the refinery operator that reduced rates throughout the quarter has repair to require involving a fire in our coker unit in April. The refinery returned to normal operation in mid-July. Based upon industry benchmark margins, the value of second quarter lost production due to planned and unplanned outages across the company is estimated to have been approximately $140 million. [indiscernible] generate strong earnings during a period of heavy plant maintenance and the refinery upside is indicative of our solid portfolio. We progressed our financial priorities during the quarter as well, and Thomas will provide you with an update on those in a few moments. 
Slide 5 reflects our continued outstanding safety performance. As I mentioned during the first half of this year, we performed an usually high amount of maintenance. Periods like this often result in an increased number of injuries. However, our results remain steady. We strongly believe that an unrelenting focus on safety has resulted in the excellent performance we have seen over the past 4 years. 
Now Thomas will discuss our financial highlights for the second quarter."

On Slide 6, we outlined our quarterly and trailing 12-month segment results. Combined olefins and polyolefins generated good results with $1.3 billion or EBITDA in the second quarter and $5.5 billion during the last 12 months. The Intermediates & Derivatives segment remained steady with second quarter EBITDA of approximately $370 million and $1.5 billion over the last 12 months. Q2 operating issues the refinery recorded a loss. Technology continued to perform well at an LCM pace of approximately $270 million. Overall, despite ongoing maintenance and global economic uncertainties, our profitability has remained strong with $7.5 billion of EBITDA over the past 12 months. The first half 2016 EBITDA represents an annual pace of nearly $7.2 billion. 
Please turn to Slide 7 which provides a picture of gas generation and use. During the second quarter, we generated $1.3 billion of cash from operations and utilized $1.1 billion for dividends and share repurchases. Our maintenance and growth capital investments increased to approximately $560 million during the second quarter, with a significant portion of this investments focused on our Corpus Christi ethylene expansion and the turnaround at our Berre, France facility. During the second quarter, cash and liquid investments decreased by approximately $400 million to end with a balance of $2.5 billion. Over the last 12 months, cash from operations was $5.5 billion. A nearly equal amount was dedicated to dividends and share repurchases over the same period. After investments in our capital program, returns to our shareholders, borrowing and other activities, the cash and liquid investments balance declined by approximately $1.3 billion. However, at $2.5 billion, this remains well above our minimum requirements. 
Slide 8 provides a longer perspective of cash flow as well as some current financial metrics. Our strong results and cash flow generation over multiple years positioned us to steadily raise our dividend and purchase shares. In May 2016, we increased our quarterly entering [ph] dividend by 9% to $0.85 per share. Additionally, our results have allowed us to access favorable credit markets while maintaining a strong balance sheet, BBB, Baa1 credit rating and available liquidity of approximately $5 billion. During the first 6 months of 2016, cash flow generation remained strong although somewhat less than the pace seen in 2014 and 2015. On an annualized basis, using June 30 market capitalization, the cash flow yield is 9.4%. 
Our share repurchase program remained at approximate 10% annual pace. During the quarter, we purchased 8.8 million shares, representing 2% of our outstanding shares with approximately 4 million shares purchased during June. Notably, during May, we received approval for our fourth share repurchase program for up to an additional 10% of outstanding shares over the next 18 months. Based on the June 30 sha reprice and the May quarterly dividend increase to $0.85 per share, the current dividend yield is approximately 4.6%. 
Before I wrap up, I want to point out a few other items that may help your modeling. First, our effective tax rate for the quarter was 24%, several percentage points lower than our previously communicated estimate. The rate variance for the quarter compared to our forecasted annual rate was impacted primarily by discrete items including the impact of a non-U.S. tax law change as well as by our global earnings mix being balanced towards lower tax regions. We currently estimate our full year tax rate at approximately 27%, which is approximately 1 percentage point below our previous estimate. 2016 CapEx spending is on target to meet our forecast of $2.1 billion. Depreciation, amortization and interest expense are currently running [indiscernible]  In line with our previous estimate. 
With that, thank you very much for your attention, and I will turn the call back to Bob."

Let's turn to Slide 9 and review segment results. As mentioned previously, my discussion of business results will exclude the impact of the LCM inventory gain. In our Olefins & Polyolefins America segment, second quarter EBITDA was $754",1249,"Thank you, Thomas. Let's turn to Slide 9 and review segment results. As mentioned previously, my discussion of business results will exclude the impact of the LCM inventory gain. In our Olefins & Polyolefins America segment, second quarter EBITDA was $754 million. Results declined by $67 million excluding the first quarter gain of $57 million on the sale of the Petroken polypropylene business. Relative to the previous quarter, olefin results were generally unchanged. Ethylene prices improved by approximately $0.04 per pound and our margins improved while our customer internal derivative plant maintenance resulted in reduced ethylene volumes. Our operating rates during the quarter, averaged approximately 80% due to the planned maintenance and expansion of our Corpus Christi facility. Excluding the Corpus Christi outage, quarterly rates were approximately 90%. During the quarter, we operated around [indiscernible] unit contribution was not material. 74% of our ethylene production was from ethane and approximately 90% came from NGLs. We initiated the Corpus Christi ethylene turnaround and expansion during mid-April with completion planned for the end of the third quarter. At industry benchmark margins, second quarter loss production impact was estimated to be approximately $65 million. However, all that are approximately $15 million was offset by purchases and inventory management during prior quarters. 
In polyolefins, combined results declined by approximately $60 million. Results were driven by lower polyethylene and polypropylene volumes. Approximately half of the polyethylene volume decline was due to scheduled plant maintenance. Polypropylene volumes declined 5% primarily due to lower sales following the first quarter sale of Petroken. Polyethylene price  spreads were relatively unchanged while polypropylene spreads declined by approximately $0.02 per pound, several cents less than the industry data would indicate. 
Thus far, during the third quarter, Olefins & Polyolefins Americas industry trends are relatively unchanged. Our heavy plant maintenance schedule continues into the quarter. The Corpus Christi plant is scheduled to remain down throughout the quarter. Two weeks ago, we began a turnaround at our Morris, Illinois facility. At current benchmark rates -- at current industry benchmarks, the net value of lost the third quarter production is estimated to be approximately $135 million. 
Let's turn to Slide 10 and review performance in the Olefins & Polyolefins - Europe Asia and international segment. During the second quarter, underlying EBITDA was $536 million. Exclusive of a $21 million first quarter gain from the Argentine Petroken sale, EBITDA was relatively unchanged. Olefins results declined by approximately $30 million as increased feedstock costs outpaced olefin price increases. A turnaround at our Berre facility impacted Olefin & Polyolefin production during both the first and second quarters. At industry benchmark margins, the second quarter value of lost production is estimated to be approximately $35 million, $20 million greater than the first quarter impact. The advantaged feedstock accounted for 52% of ethylene production, contributing approximately $25 million over naphtha [ph] . 
In polyolefins, results were relatively unchanged. Exclusive of the gain from Petroken sale, our polypropylene compounding and polybutylene 1 results improved by approximately $10 million Joint venture equity income was very strong, increasing by $27 million consistent with strong polyolefin margins. During the early weeks of the third quarter, underlying industry conditions have fallen expectations and remain relatively unchanged. However, the third quarter is typically impacted by slower seasonal conditions. During the quarter, there is no significant maintenance planned and our wholly owned facilities but there will be some at our joint ventures. 
Now please start to Slide 11 for a discussion of our Intermediates & Derivatives segments. Second quarter EBITDA was $369 million, an improvement of $15 million versus the first quarter. Results for propylene oxide and derivatives declined by approximately $20 million, partially due to sales, product mix and derivative margins. This was offset by an improvement in the intermediate chemicals of approximately $10 million. Styrene margins were the leading factor with an improvement of approximately $0.04 per pound versus the first quarter. Higher oxyfuels volumes and seasonal margin increases contributed approximately $30 million more than the first quarter results. Thus far, in the third quarter, PO and derivatives and the intermediate chemicals industry conditions are relatively unchanged from the second quarter. However, weaker gasoline markets have negatively impacted oxyfuels. This is seen on the slide in the reduction of the July MTBE margins. Additionally, a turnaround at our Bayport EO/EG plant has estimated to impact third quarter results by approximately $15 million. 
LEt's move to Slide 12 for a discussion of the Refining segment. Second quarter EBITDA was a loss of $13 million, a decline of $27 million from the prior quarter. Crude throughput averaged 183,000 barrels per day as rates were impacted by the April 8 fire and other maintenance. During the second quarter, the Maya 2-1-1 spread increased by $3.21 per barrel to average $21.07 for the quarter. However, due to our processing limitations, we were not able to benefit from the increased spreads. 
Based on the second quarter industry benchmark spreads, the lost profit opportunity is estimated to be approximately $85 million. Repairs are now complete and the refinery returned to normal operation in mid-July. As you can see on the slide, during July, industry spreads trended downward. Additionally, the cost of RINs [ph] increased following the issuance of new EPA guidelines. Compared to the second quarter, market RIN price July month-to-date has increased by approximately $0.17 per gallon. At full refinery rates, every $0.10 change in the RIN cost in estimated to impact quarterly cost by approximately $5 million. Our Technology segment continued to perform well with second quarter EBITDA of $73 million. 
I'll conclude with Slide 16. Second quarter industry trends generally developed as we anticipated. We continue to see strong results in global Olefins and Polyolefins businesses. Our I&D segment benefited from strengthened styrene margins and seasonal oxyfuel improvements. Refining results were impacted by the refinery coker unit fire. Our solid cash flow enabled us to increase our dividend and extend our share repurchase program. In the near term, we believe that olefins and polyolefins markets will remain balanced with periods of potential tightness. Our refinery has returned to normal operation. Due to recent gasoline market changes, our Oxyfuels and Refining businesses are experiencing some margin pressure. We continue to invest in our facilities of with the third quarter plant maintenance turnarounds at 2 olefin sites and our EO/EG facility at Bayport. 
At recent industry margins, we estimate the impact of the related production loss in the third quarter to be approximately $150 million. However, this maintenance is the foundation for continued reliability over the coming years. Due to our unusually high plant maintenance schedule this year, the value of lost production through the first 3 quarters based upon industry benchmark margins is estimated to be approximately $300 million. In contrast, next year's schedule is quite light. Within chemicals, there are no olefin plant turnarounds and only one PO plant turnaround. The refinery will also have a fluid unit turnaround. 
Finally, I'm pleased to announce that in a separate press release to be issued shortly, you will see that we have made a final investment decision for a new 1.1 billion pound per year polyethylene line. Startup is targeted to occur during 2019. This facility represents an 18% increase in our U.S. polyethylene capacity. Additionally, it is the first of its kind process, combining attributes of both of our polyethylene and polypropylene technologies. As a result, the product capabilities will range from basic benchmark resins through to higher value-added grades. 
We're now pleased to take your questions."

And so that's evidenced in the growth rate despite some uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment, and we're seeing that play through in terms of demand growth globally, has been pretty solid year-over-year. Because of planned and unplanned outages in the industry including our plant maintenance that we're doing at Corpus, market seemed to be balanced a tight inventories. Our sense is that our inventories are about average or below average. So my view is then in the next  quarter or  2, market should be pretty well balanced, and anything unplanned would create tightness in markets.

That's something that we're very focused on for the long run, is to continue to find ways to increase feedstock flexibility. The cracker fleet in the U.S. has a reasonable amount of feedstock flexibility, which if ethane prices were to rise above, let's say, propane or butane economics, then a lot of us could switch, which would take some of that pressure off of ethane. The other thing is in the low oil price environment, I would think that some of the ethane exports could be more variable, and they could be shut off if ethane price were to rise. So I think those balancing factors in the market from a supply standpoint with some premium over fuel value and with oil price moderately rising over time, I would think that, that will attract more supply. So we think this will sort of balance out over time. And also the timing of startups of crackers will impact that to, right? So if there are delays, then that pushes out that tightness of ethane and more time for more ethane production to come to market."

So we want the team over there focusing on PO/TBA. Also, if you look more broadly in the company, near term, our priority is more to build out our derivative portfolio. And then in time, we'll come back and do that debottleneck. When we do our turnarounds at our Channelview crackers in '18 and '19, we'll likely be able to put in tie-ins such that we can implement that debottleneck any time and it may not have to be dependent on a turnaround. So we're going to do that project at some point, but I'd like for us to focus in the near term on the polyethylene plants and on PO/TBA and build out our derivatives and then we'll come back and take a look at that one."

So I think the market will balance. The other thing is if ethane values persist at much higher than its fuel value, that ought to attract more supply or incent more supply. And so really I think what we're all concerned about here I suppose is more about the volatility not about some structural change in how ethane will be priced. I think as we saw earlier in this decade, when ethane price rose and margins on ethane over fuel value were $0.30 per gallon or $0.40 per gallon, that was met with a lot more supply. And so we think that this cracker startup and so on, a combination of switching to other feedstocks may be less export and more supply, the market will find a new equilibrium and that will leave us in a position where the U.S. still have advantage vis-à-vis heavier crackers globally."

First of all, in the near term, we see markets being very strong. We see solid demand growth year-over-year. Planned maintenance and some unplanned outages in the industry and our planned maintenance have kept supply moderate. So we see pretty balanced markets. When we think about the cycle with some delays in new capacity, operating rates, we're not going to get much below 90% on paper in the past. And as we see some of these delays and even some of the CTO projects in Asia being canceled, there's a higher likelihood that 2018 operating rates may not even -- effective operating rates may not dip below 90%. So yes, our view is that we're very constructive on markets near term, medium term. We're continuing to deliver strong earnings last 12 months at a pace of nearly $10 per share excluding LCM. We have a strong dividend. We're engaged in our fourth 10% share buyback program. And by virtue of those 2 things, we're returning significant cash back to our shareholders. Our focus remains very consistent safe, reliable cost-efficient operations. We're going to finish the Corpus turnaround and debottleneck it by the end of Q3. We're going to continue to execute on the other turnaround that we have. I think what all of this planned maintenance activity sets us up for is a very strong '17. We have very little turnaround activity in '17, and so I think that positions us well for next year. And we're starting to build out our growth project portfolio with our polyethylene project in '19 and potentially the PO/TBA project in '20, so we're continuing to advance those growth projects as well.

Before we begin the business discussion, I'd like to point out that a slide presentation accompanies today's call and is available on our website at www.lyb.com. I'd also like for you to note that statements made in this call relating to matters that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements and these forward-looking statements are based upon assumptions of management which are believed to be reasonable at the time made and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties, and actual results could differ materially from those forward-looking statements. For more detailed information about the factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially, please refer to the cautionary statements in the presentation slides and our financial reports, which are available at www.lyb.com/investorrelations. And reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures, together with any other applicable disclosures, including the earnings release, are currently available on our website at www.lyb.com.
And finally, I'd like to point out that a recording of this call will be available by telephone beginning at 2 p.m. Eastern time today until 1 a.m. Eastern time on August 29 by calling (866) 453-2318 in the United States and (203) 369-1226 outside the United States, and the passcode for both numbers is 72916.
And during today's call, we'll focus on second quarter results, the current environment and the near-term outlook. But before I turn the call over to Bob, I'd like to call your attention to the noncash lower of cost or market inventory adjustments, or LCM, that we've discussed on past calls. As previously explained, these adjustments are related to our use of LIFO accounting and the volatility in prices of our raw material and finished goods inventories. And second quarter price recoveries for impacted products resulted in the reversal of the entire $68 million first quarter LCM charge. Interim LCM charges are reversed in subsequent periods when information shows the LCM charge may not be sustained through year-end. However, I'd also remind you that LCM charges that exist at year-end cannot be reversed. Additionally, if there are future price declines within our inventory accruals during the remainder of the year, this could lead to additional LCM charges. Now comments made on this call will be in regard to our underlying business results excluding the impacts of these LCM inventory charges.
Now with that being said, I'll turn the call over to Bob."

Good morning to all of you, and thank you for joining our second quarter earnings call. Let's begin with Slide 4 and review the highlights of the second quarter.

Let's begin with Slide 4 and review the highlights of the second quarter. Our second quarter diluted earnings per share declined relative to the first quarter to $2.45 per share with EBITDA of $1.7 billion. This excludes the $68 million lower of cost or market inventory gain. When the gain on sale of the Petroken Argentine business is also excluded from first quarter results, underlying earnings per share in the second quarter increased by $0.15 per share. Overall, second quarter business trends were as we had expected.
During the quarter, our downstream integration in polyolefins and other olefin derivatives enabled us to capture strong chain margins. Positive seasonal oxyfuel margin trends benefited the Intermediates & Derivatives business. While our chemical and polymer operations generally ran well, there was scheduled maintenance and some unplanned downtime across the company. Most significantly, the refinery operator had reduced rates throughout the quarter as repair were required following a fire in our coker unit in April. The refinery returned to normal operation in mid-July. Based upon industry benchmark margins, the value of second quarter lost production due to planned and unplanned outages across the company is estimated to have been approximately $140 million. The ability to generate strong earnings during a period of heavy plant maintenance and the refinery upset is indicative of our solid portfolio. We progressed our financial priorities during the quarter as well, and Thomas will provide you with an update on those in a few moments.
Slide 5 reflects our continued outstanding safety performance. As I mentioned during the first half of this year, we performed an usually high amount of maintenance. Periods like this often result in an increased number of injuries. However, our results remain steady. We strongly believe that an unrelenting focus on safety has resulted in the excellent performance we have seen over the past 4 years.
Now Thomas will discuss our financial highlights for the second quarter."

On Slide 6, we outlined our quarterly and trailing 12-month segment results. Combined olefins and polyolefins generated good results with $1.3 billion or EBITDA in the second quarter and $5.5 billion during the last 12 mo",625,"Thank you, Bob, and good morning. On Slide 6, we outlined our quarterly and trailing 12-month segment results. Combined olefins and polyolefins generated good results with $1.3 billion or EBITDA in the second quarter and $5.5 billion during the last 12 months. The Intermediates & Derivatives segment remained steady with second quarter EBITDA of approximately $370 million and $1.5 billion over the last 12 months. Due to operating issues, the refinery recorded a loss. Technology continued to perform well at an LCM pace of approximately $270 million. Overall, despite ongoing maintenance and global economic uncertainties, our profitability has remained strong with $7.5 billion of EBITDA over the past 12 months. The first half 2016 EBITDA represents an annual pace of nearly $7.2 billion.
Please turn to Slide 7 which provides a picture of cash generation and use. During the second quarter, we generated $1.3 billion of cash from operations and utilized $1.1 billion for dividends and share repurchases. Our maintenance and growth capital investments increased to approximately $560 million during the second quarter, with a significant portion of this investment focused on our Corpus Christi ethylene expansion and the turnaround at our Berre, France facility. During the second quarter, cash and liquid investments decreased by approximately $400 million to end with a balance of $2.5 billion. Over the last 12 months, cash from operations was $5.5 billion. A nearly equal amount was dedicated to dividends and share repurchases over the same period. After investments in our capital program, returns to our shareholders, borrowing and other activities, the cash and liquid investments balance declined by approximately $1.3 billion. However, at $2.5 billion, this remains well above our minimum requirements.
Slide 8 provides a longer perspective of cash flow as well as some current financial metrics. Our strong results and cash flow generation over multiple years positioned us to steadily raise our dividend and purchase shares. In May 2016, we increased our quarterly interim dividend by 9% to $0.85 per share. Additionally, our results have allowed us to access favorable credit markets while maintaining a strong balance sheet, BBB, Baa1 corporate credit rating and available liquidity of approximately $5 billion. During the first 6 months of 2016, cash flow generation remained strong although somewhat less than the pace seen in 2014 and 2015. On an annualized basis, using June 30 market capitalization, the cash flow yield is 9.4%.
Our share repurchase program remained at an approximate 10% annual pace. During the quarter, we purchased 8.8 million shares, representing 2% of our outstanding shares with approximately 4 million shares purchased during June. Notably, during May, we received approval for our fourth share repurchase program for up to an additional 10% of outstanding shares over the next 18 months. Based on the June 30 share price and the May quarterly dividend increase to $0.85 per share, the current dividend yield is approximately 4.6%.
Before I wrap up, I want to point out a few other items that may help your modeling. First, our effective tax rate for the quarter was 24%, several percentage points lower than our previously communicated estimate. The rate variance for the quarter compared to our forecasted annual rate was impacted primarily by discrete items including the impact of a non-U.S. tax law change as well as by our global earnings mix being balanced towards lower tax regions. We currently estimate our full year tax rate at approximately 27%, which is approximately 1 percentage point below our previous estimate. 2016 CapEx spending is on target to meet our forecast of $2.1 billion. Depreciation, amortization and interest expense are currently running at rates in line with our previous estimate.
With that, thank you very much for your attention, and I will turn the call back to Bob."

Ethylene prices improved by approximately $0.04 per pound and our margins improved, while our customer and internal derivative plant maintenance resulted in reduced ethylene volumes. Our operating rates during the quarter averaged approximately 80% due to the planned maintenance and expansion at our Corpus Christi facility. Excluding the Corpus Christi outage, quarterly rates were approximately 90%. During the quarter, we operated our metathesis unit, but the contribution was not material. 74% of our ethylene production was from ethane and approximately 90% came from NGLs. We initiated the Corpus Christi ethylene turnaround and expansion during mid-April with completion planned for the end of the third quarter. At industry benchmark margins, second quarter loss production impact was estimated to be approximately $65 million. However, all but approximately $15 million was offset by purchases and inventory management during prior quarters.
In polyolefins, combined results declined by approximately $60 million. Results were driven by lower polyethylene and polypropylene volumes. Approximately 0.5 of the polyethylene volume decline was due to scheduled plant maintenance. Polypropylene volumes declined 5% primarily due to lower sales following the first quarter sale of Petroken. Polyethylene price spreads were relatively unchanged while polypropylene spreads declined by approximately $0.02 per pound, several cents less than industry data would indicate.
Thus far, during the third quarter, Olefins & Polyolefins - Americas industry trends are relatively unchanged. Our heavy plant maintenance schedule continues into the quarter. The Corpus Christi plant is scheduled to remain down throughout the quarter. Two weeks ago, we began a turnaround at our Morris, Illinois facility. At current benchmark rates -- at current industry benchmarks, the net value of lost third quarter production is estimated to be approximately $135 million.
Let's turn to Slide 10 and review performance in the Olefins & Polyolefins - Europe, Asia, and International segment. During the second quarter, underlying EBITDA was $536 million. Exclusive of a $21 million first quarter gain from the Argentine Petroken sale, EBITDA was relatively unchanged. Olefins results declined by approximately $30 million as increased feedstock costs outpaced olefin price increases. A turnaround at our Berre facility impacted Olefin & Polyolefin production during both the first and second quarters. At industry benchmark margins, the second quarter value of lost production is estimated to be approximately $35 million, $20 million greater than the first quarter impact. The advantage feedstock accounted for 52% of ethylene production, contributing approximately $25 million over naphtha.
In polyolefins, results were relatively unchanged. Exclusive of the gain from Petroken sale, our polypropylene compounding and polybutylene-1 results improved by approximately $10 million. Joint venture equity income was very strong, increasing by $27 million consistent with strong polyolefin margins. During the early weeks of the third quarter, underlying industry conditions have followed expectations and remained relatively unchanged. However, the third quarter is typically impacted by slower seasonal conditions. During the quarter, there is no significant maintenance planned at our wholly owned facilities, but there will be some at our joint ventures.
Now please turn to Slide 11 for a discussion of our Intermediates & Derivatives segment. Second quarter EBITDA was $369 million, an improvement of $15 million versus the first quarter. Results for propylene oxide and derivatives declined by approximately $20 million, partially due to sales, product mix and derivative margins. This was offset by an improvement in the intermediate chemicals of approximately $10 million. Styrene margins were the leading factor with an improvement of approximately $0.04 per pound versus the first quarter. Higher oxyfuels volumes and seasonal margin increases contributed approximately $30 million more than the first quarter results. Thus far, in the third quarter, PO and derivatives and the intermediate chemicals industry conditions are relatively unchanged from the second quarter. However, weaker gasoline markets have negatively impacted oxyfuels. This is seen on the slide in the reduction of the July MTBE margins. Additionally, a turnaround at our Bayport EO/EG plant has estimated to impact third quarter results by approximately $15 million.
Let's move to Slide 12 for a discussion of the Refining segment. Second quarter EBITDA was a loss of $13 million, a decline of $27 million from the prior quarter. Crude throughput averaged 183,000 barrels per day as rates were impacted by the April 8 fire and other maintenance. During the second quarter, the Maya 2-1-1 spread increased by $3.21 per barrel to average $21.07 for the quarter. However, due to our processing limitations, we were not able to benefit from the increased spreads.
Based on the second quarter industry benchmark spreads, the lost profit opportunity is estimated to be approximately $85 million. Repairs are now complete and the refinery returned to normal operation in mid-July. As you can see on the slide, during July, industry spreads trended downward. Additionally, the cost of RINs increased following the issuance of new EPA guidelines. Compared to the second quarter, market RIN price July month-to-date has increased by approximately $0.17 per gallon. At full refinery rates, every $0.10 change in the RIN cost is estimated to impact quarterly cost by approximately $5 million. Our Technology segment continued to perform well with second quarter EBITDA of $73 million.
I'll conclude with Slide 16 (sic) [ Slide 13 ]. Second quarter industry trends generally developed as we anticipated. We continued to see strong results in global olefins and polyolefins businesses. Our I&D segment benefited from strengthened styrene margins and seasonal oxyfuel improvements. Refining results were impacted by the refinery coker unit fire. Our solid cash flow enabled us to increase our dividend and extend our share repurchase program. In the near term, we believe that olefins and polyolefins markets will remain balanced with periods of potential tightness. Our refinery has returned to normal operation. Due to recent gasoline market changes, our Oxyfuels and Refining businesses are experiencing some margin pressure. We continue to invest in our facilities with the third quarter plant maintenance turnarounds at 2 olefin sites and our EO/EG facility at Bayport.
At recent industry margins, we estimate the impact of the related production loss in the third quarter to be approximately $150 million. However, this maintenance is the foundation for continued reliability over the coming years. Due to our unusually high plant maintenance schedule this year, the value of lost production through the first 3 quarters based upon the industry benchmark margins is estimated to be approximately $300 million. In contrast, next year's schedule is quite light. Within chemicals, there are no olefin plant turnarounds and only 1 PO plant turnaround. The refinery will also have a fluid unit turnaround.
Finally, I'm pleased to announce that in a separate press release to be issued shortly, you will see that we have made the final investment decision for a new 1.1 billion pound per year polyethylene line. Startup is targeted to occur during 2019. This facility represents an 18% increase in our U.S. polyethylene capacity. Additionally, it is the ""first of its kind"" process, combining attributes of both of our polyethylene and polypropylene technologies. As a result, the product capabilities will range from basic benchmark resins through to higher value-added grades.
We're now pleased to take your questions."

Because of planned and unplanned outages in the industry including our plant maintenance that we're doing at Corpus, market seemed to be balanced a tight. Inventories, I would -- our sense is that inventories are about average or below average. So my view is then in the next quarter or 2, market should be pretty well balanced and anything unplanned would create tightness in markets.

Well, there's still a significant amount of rejection that's occurring even some still in the Eagle Ford and then places a little further away. P.J., I think what's going to be important to see is how propane and butane prices develop because part of what will balance markets is feedstock flexibility. That's something that we're very focused on for the long run, is to continue to find ways to increase feedstock flexibility. The cracker fleet in the U.S. has a reasonable amount of feedstock flexibility, which if ethane prices were to rise above, let's say, propane or butane economics, then a lot of us could switch, which would take some of that pressure off of ethane. The other thing is in the low oil price environment, I would think that some of the ethane exports could be more variable, and they could be shut off if ethane price were to rise. So I think there is balancing factors in the market from a supply standpoint with some premium over fuel value and with oil price moderately rising over time, I would think that, that will attract more supply. So we think this will sort of balance out over time. And also the timing of startups of crackers will impact that too, right? So if there are delays, then that pushes out that tightness of ethane and more time for more ethane production to come into market."

The other thing is if ethane values persist at much higher than its fuel value, that ought to attract more supply or incent more supply. And so really I think what we're all concerned about here, I suppose, is more about the volatility, not about some structural change and how ethane will be priced. Because I think as we saw earlier in this decade, when ethane price rose and margins on ethane over fuel value were $0.30 per gallon or $0.40 per gallon, that was met with a lot more supply.

First of all, in the near term, we see markets being very strong. We see solid demand growth year-over-year. Planned maintenance and some unplanned outages in the industry and our planned maintenance have kept supply moderate. So we see pretty balanced markets. When we think about the cycle with some delays in new capacity, operating rates were not going to dip much below 90% on paper in the past, and as we see some of these delays and even some of the CTO projects in Asia being canceled, there's a higher likelihood that 2018 operating rates may not even -- effective operating rates may not dip below 90%. So yes, our view is that we're very constructive on markets near term, medium term. We're continuing to deliver strong earnings last 12 months at a pace of nearly $10 per share excluding LCM. We have a strong dividend. We're engaged in our fourth 10% share buyback program. So by virtue of those 2 things, we're returning significant cash back to our shareholders. Our focus remains very consistent: safe, reliable cost-efficient operations. We're going to finish the Corpus turnaround and debottleneck it by the end of Q3. We're going to continue to execute on the other turnarounds that we have. I think what all of this planned maintenance activity sets us up for is a very strong '17. We have very little turnaround activity in '17, and so I think that positions us well for next year. And we're starting to build out our growth project portfolio with our polyethylene project in '19 and potentially the PO/TBA project in '20, so we're continuing to advance those growth projects as well.

Before we begin the business discussion, I'd like to point out that a slide presentation accompanies today's call and is available on our website at www.lyb.com. I'd also like for you to note that statements made in this call relating to matters that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements and these forward-looking statements are based upon assumptions of management which are believed to be reasonable at the time made and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties, and actual results could differ materially from those forward-looking statements. For more detailed information about the factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially, please refer to the cautionary statements in the presentation slides and our financial reports, which are available at www.lyb.com/investorrelations. And reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures, together with any other applicable disclosures, including the earnings release, are currently available on our website at www.lyb.com.
And finally, I'd like to point out that a recording of this call will be available by telephone beginning at 2 p.m. Eastern time today until 1 a.m. Eastern time on August 29 by calling (866) 453-2318 in the United States and (203) 369-1226 outside the United States, and the passcode for both numbers is 72916.
Now during today's call, we'll focus on second quarter results, the current environment and the near-term outlook. But before turning the call over to Bob, I'd like to call your attention to the noncash lower of cost or market inventory adjustments, or LCM, that we've discussed on past calls. As previously explained, these adjustments are related to our use of LIFO accounting and the volatility in prices of our raw material and finished goods inventories. And second quarter price recoveries for impacted products resulted in the reversal of the entire $68 million first quarter LCM charge. Interim LCM charges are reversed in subsequent periods when information shows the LCM charge may not be sustained through year-end. However, I'd also remind you that LCM charges that exist at year-end cannot be reversed. Additionally, if there are future price declines within our inventory pools during the remainder of the year, this could lead to additional LCM charges. Now comments made on this call will be in regard to our underlying business results excluding the impacts of these LCM inventory charges.
Now with that being said, I'll turn the call over to Bob."

This excludes the $68 million lower of cost or market inventory gain. When the gain on sale of the Petroken Argentine business is also excluded from first quarter results, underlying earnings per share in the second quarter increased by $0.15 per share. Overall, second quarter business trends were as we had expected.
During the quarter, our downstream integration in polyolefins and other olefin derivatives enabled us to capture strong chain margins. Positive seasonal oxyfuel margin trends benefited the Intermediates & Derivatives business. While our chemical and polymer operations generally ran well, there was scheduled maintenance and some unplanned downtime across the company. Most significantly, the refinery operated at reduced rates throughout the quarter as repairs were required following a fire in our coker unit in April. The refinery returned to normal operation in mid-July. Based upon industry benchmark margins, the value of second quarter lost production due to planned and unplanned outages across the company is estimated to have been approximately $140 million. The ability to generate strong earnings during a period of heavy planned maintenance and a refinery upset is indicative of our solid portfolio. We progressed our financial priorities during the quarter as well, and Thomas will provide you with an update on those in a few moments.
Slide 5 reflects our continued outstanding safety performance. As I mentioned during the first half of this year, we performed an usually high amount of maintenance. Periods like this often result in an increased number of injuries. However, our results remain steady. We strongly believe that an unrelenting focus on safety has resulted in the excellent performance we have seen over the past 4 years.
Now Thomas will discuss our financial highlights for the second quarter."

On Slide 6, we outlined our quarterly and trailing 12-month segment results. Combined olefins and polyolefins generated good results with $1.3 billion of EBITDA in the second quarter and $5.5 billion during the last 12 mo",625,"Thank you boss, and good morning. On Slide 6, we outlined our quarterly and trailing 12-month segment results. Combined olefins and polyolefins generated good results with $1.3 billion of EBITDA in the second quarter and $5.5 billion during the last 12 months. The Intermediates & Derivatives segment remained steady with second quarter EBITDA of approximately $370 million and $1.5 billion over the last 12 months. Due to operating issues, the refinery recorded a loss. Technology continued to perform well at an LTM pace of approximately $270 million. Overall, despite ongoing maintenance and global economic uncertainty, our profitability has remained strong with $7.5 billion of EBITDA over the past 12 months. The first half 2016 EBITDA represents an annual pace of nearly $7.2 billion.
Please turn to Slide 7 which provides a picture of cash generation and use. During the second quarter, we generated $1.3 billion of cash from operations and utilized $1.1 billion for dividends and share repurchases. Our maintenance and growth capital investments increased to approximately $560 million during the second quarter, with a significant portion of this investment focused on our Corpus Christi ethylene expansion and the turnaround at our Berre, France facility. During the second quarter, cash and liquid investments decreased by approximately $400 million to end with a balance of $2.5 billion. Over the last 12 months, cash from operations was $5.5 billion. A nearly equal amount was dedicated to dividends and share repurchases over the same period. After investments in our capital program, returns to our shareholders, borrowing and other activities, the cash and liquid investments balance declined by approximately $1.3 billion. However, at $2.5 billion, this remains well above our minimum requirements.
Slide 8 provides a longer perspective of cash flow as well as some current financial metrics. Our strong results and cash flow generation over multiple years positioned us to steadily raise our dividend and purchase shares. In May 2016, we increased our quarterly interim dividend by 9% to $0.85 per share. Additionally, our results have allowed us to access favorable credit markets while maintaining a strong balance sheet, BBB, Baa1 corporate credit rating and available liquidity of approximately $5 billion. During the first 6 months of 2016, cash flow generation remained strong although somewhat less than the pace seen in 2014 and 2015. On an annualized basis, using June 30 market capitalization, the cash flow yield is 9.4%.
Our share repurchase program remained at an approximate 10% annual pace. During the quarter, we purchased 8.8 million shares, representing 2% of our outstanding shares with approximately 4 million shares purchased during June. Notably, during May, we received approval for our fourth share repurchase program for up to an additional 10% of outstanding shares over the next 18 months. Based on the June 30 share price and the May quarterly dividend increase to $0.85 per share, the current dividend yield is approximately 4.6%.
Before I wrap up, I want to point out a few other items that may help your modeling. First, our effective tax rate for the quarter was 24%, several percentage points lower than our previously communicated estimate. The rate variance for the quarter compared to our forecasted annual rate was impacted primarily by discrete items including the impact of a non-U.S. tax law change as well as by our global earnings mix being balanced towards lower tax regions. We currently estimate our full year tax rate at approximately 27%, which is approximately 1 percentage point below our previous estimate. 2016 CapEx spending is on target to meet our forecast of $2.1 billion. Depreciation, amortization and interest expense are currently running at rates in line with our previous estimates.
With that, thank you very much for your attention, and I will turn the call back to Bob."

Let's turn to Slide 9 and review segment results. As mentioned previously, my discussion of business results will exclude the impact of the LCM inventory gain. In our Olefins & Polyolefins - Americas segment, second quarter EBITDA was $",1252,"Thank you, Thomas. Let's turn to Slide 9 and review segment results. As mentioned previously, my discussion of business results will exclude the impact of the LCM inventory gain. In our Olefins & Polyolefins - Americas segment, second quarter EBITDA was $754 million. Results declined by $67 million excluding the first quarter gain of $57 million on the sale of the Petroken polypropylene business. Relative to the previous quarter, olefin results were generally unchanged. Ethylene prices improved by approximately $0.04 per pound and our margins improved, while customer and internal derivative plant maintenance resulted in reduced ethylene volumes. Our operating rates during the quarter averaged approximately 80% due to the planned maintenance and expansion at our Corpus Christi facility. Excluding the Corpus Christi outage, quarterly rates were approximately 90%. During the quarter, we operated our metathesis unit, but the contribution was not material. 74% of our ethylene production was from ethane and approximately 90% came from NGLs. We initiated the Corpus Christi ethylene turnaround and expansion during mid-April with completion planned for the end of the third quarter. At industry benchmark margins, second quarter loss production impact was estimated to be approximately $65 million. However, all but approximately $15 million was offset by purchases and inventory management during prior quarters.
In polyolefins, combined results declined by approximately $60 million. Results were driven by lower polyethylene and polypropylene volumes. Approximately half of the polyethylene volume decline was due to scheduled plant maintenance. Polypropylene volumes declined 5% primarily due to lower sales following the first quarter sale of Petroken. Polyethylene price spreads were relatively unchanged while polypropylene spreads declined by approximately $0.02 per pound, several cents less than industry data would indicate.
Thus far, during the third quarter, Olefins & Polyolefins - Americas industry trends are relatively unchanged. Our heavy planned maintenance schedule continues into the quarter. The Corpus Christi plant is scheduled to remain down throughout the quarter. Two weeks ago, we began a turnaround at our Morris, Illinois facility. At current benchmark rates -- at current industry benchmarks, the net value of lost third quarter production is estimated to be approximately $135 million.
Let's turn to Slide 10 and review performance in the Olefins & Polyolefins - Europe, Asia, and International segment. During the second quarter, underlying EBITDA was $536 million. Exclusive of a $21 million first quarter gain from the Argentine Petroken sale, EBITDA was relatively unchanged. Olefins results declined by approximately $30 million as increased feedstock costs outpaced olefin price increases. A turnaround at our Berre facility impacted Olefin & Polyolefin production during both the first and second quarters. At industry benchmark margins, the second quarter value of lost production is estimated to be approximately $35 million, $20 million greater than the first quarter impact. The advantaged feedstock accounted for 52% of ethylene production, contributing approximately $25 million over naphtha [ph].
In polyolefins, results were relatively unchanged. Exclusive of the gain from Petroken sale, our polypropylene compounding and polybutylene-1 results improved by approximately $10 million. Joint venture equity income was very strong, increasing by $27 million consistent with strong polyolefin margins. During the early weeks of the third quarter, underlying industry conditions have followed expectations and remained relatively unchanged. However, the third quarter is typically impacted by slower seasonal conditions. During the quarter, there is no significant maintenance planned at our wholly owned facilities, but there will be some at our joint ventures.
Now please turn to Slide 11 for a discussion of our Intermediates & Derivatives segment. Second quarter EBITDA was $369 million, an improvement of $15 million versus the first quarter. Results for propylene oxide and derivatives declined by approximately $20 million, partially due to sales, product mix and derivative margins. This was offset by an improvement in the intermediate chemicals of approximately $10 million. Styrene margins were the leading factor with an improvement of approximately $0.04 per pound versus the first quarter. Higher oxyfuels volumes and seasonal margin increases contributed approximately $30 million more than the first quarter results. Thus far, in the third quarter, PO and derivatives and the intermediate chemicals industry conditions are relatively unchanged from the second quarter. However, weaker gasoline markets have negatively impacted oxyfuels. This is seen on the slide in the reduction of the July MTBE margins. Additionally, a turnaround at our Bayport EO/EG plant has estimated to impact third quarter results by approximately $15 million.
Let's move to Slide 12 for a discussion of the Refining segment. Second quarter EBITDA was a loss of $13 million, a decline of $27 million from the prior quarter. Crude throughput averaged 183,000 barrels per day as rates were impacted by the April 8 fire and other maintenance. During the second quarter, the Maya 2-1-1 spread increased by $3.21 per barrel to average $21.07 for the quarter. However, due to our processing limitations, we were not able to benefit from the increased spreads.
Based on the second quarter industry benchmark spreads, the lost profit opportunity is estimated to be approximately $85 million. Repairs are now complete and the refinery returned to normal operation in mid-July. As you can see on the slide, during July, industry spreads trended downward. Additionally, the cost of RINs increased following the issuance of new EPA guidelines. Compared to the second quarter, market RIN price July month-to-date has increased by approximately $0.17 per gallon. At full refinery rates, every $0.10 change in the RIN cost is estimated to impact quarterly cost by approximately $5 million. Our Technology segment continued to perform well with second quarter EBITDA of $73 million.
I'll conclude with Slide 16 (sic) [ Slide 13 ]. Second quarter industry trends generally developed as we anticipated. We continued to see strong results in global olefins and polyolefins businesses. Our I&D segment benefited from strengthened styrene margins and seasonal oxyfuel improvements. Refining results were impacted by the refinery coker unit fire. Our solid cash flow enabled us to increase our dividend and extend our share repurchase program. In the near term, we believe that olefins and polyolefins markets will remain balanced with periods of potential tightness. Our refinery has returned to normal operation. Due to recent gasoline market changes, our Oxyfuels and Refining businesses are experiencing some margin pressure. We continue to invest in our facilities with the third quarter planned maintenance turnarounds at 2 olefin sites and our EO/EG facility at Bayport.
At recent industry margins, we estimate the impact of the related production loss in the third quarter to be approximately $150 million. However, this maintenance is the foundation for continued reliability over the coming years. Due to our unusually high planned maintenance schedule this year, the value of lost production through the first 3 quarters based upon the industry benchmark margins is estimated to be approximately $300 million. In contrast, next year's schedule is quite light. Within chemicals, there are no olefin plant turnarounds and only 1 PO plant turnaround. The refinery will also have a fluid unit turnaround.
Finally, I'm pleased to announce that in a separate press release to be issued shortly, you will see that we have made the final investment decision for a new 1.1 billion pound per year polyethylene line. Startup is targeted to occur during 2019. This facility represents an 18% increase in our U.S. polyethylene capacity. Additionally, it is the ""first of its kind"" process, combining attributes of both of our polyethylene and polypropylene technologies. As a result, the product capabilities will range from basic benchmark resins through to higher value-added grades.
We're now pleased to take your questions."

P.J., I think what's going to be important to see is how propane and butane prices develop because part of what will balance markets is feedstock flexibility. That's something that we're very focused on for the long run, is to continue to find ways to increase feedstock flexibility. The cracker fleet in the U.S. has a reasonable amount of feedstock flexibility, which if ethane prices were to rise above, let's say, propane or butane economics, then a lot of us could switch, which would take some of that pressure off of ethane. The other thing is in the low oil price environment, I would think that some of the ethane exports could be more variable, and they could be shut off if ethane price were to rise. So I think there is balancing factors in the market from a supply standpoint with some premium over fuel value and with oil price moderately rising over time, I would think that, that will attract more supply. So we think this will sort of balance out over time. And also the timing of startups of crackers will impact that too, right? So if there are delays, then that pushes out that tightness of ethane and more time for more ethane production to come into market."

Some of those could be variable at very high ethane prices. So I think the market will balance. The other thing is if ethane values persist at much higher than its fuel value, that ought to attract more supply or incent more supply. And so really I think what we're all concerned about here, I suppose, is more about the volatility, not about some structural change and how ethane will be priced. Because I think as we saw earlier in this decade, when ethane price rose and margins on ethane over fuel value were $0.30 per gallon or $0.40 per gallon, that was met with a lot more supply.

The other thing is when we started the turnaround, and especially in June and early July, we had some very, very unusual weather patterns, had a lot of -- we have a few days where we couldn't be in the field because of lightening and heavy rain. So on the Texas Gulf Coast, those things do have an impact at this time of the year. But we're aiming to get that done by the end of Q3."

First of all, in the near term, we see markets being very strong. We see solid demand growth year-over-year. Planned maintenance and some unplanned outages in the industry and our planned maintenance have kept supply moderate. So we see pretty balanced markets. When we think about the cycle with some delays in new capacity, operating rates were not going to dip much below 90% on paper in the past, and as we see some of these delays and even some of the CTO projects in Asia being canceled, there's a higher likelihood that 2018 operating rates may not even -- effective operating rates may not dip below 90%. So yes, our view is that we're very constructive on markets near term, medium term. We're continuing to deliver strong earnings last 12 months at a pace of nearly $10 per share excluding LCM. We have a strong dividend. We're engaged in our fourth 10% share buyback program. So by virtue of those 2 things, we're returning significant cash back to our shareholders. Our focus remains very consistent: safe, reliable cost-efficient operations. We're going to finish the Corpus turnaround and debottleneck it by the end of Q3. We're going to continue to execute on the other turnarounds that we have. I think what all of this planned maintenance activity sets us up for is a very strong '17. We have very little turnaround activity in '17, and so I think that positions us well for next year. And we're starting to build out our growth project portfolio with our polyethylene project in '19 and potentially the PO/TBA project in '20, so we're continuing to advance those growth projects as well. So we look forward to updating all of you on those items at our next call. So thanks, again, for your interest in our company."

Before we begin the business discussion, I'd like to point out that a slide presentation accompanies today's call and is available on our website at www.lyb.com. I'd also like for you to note that statements made in this call relating to matters that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements and these forward-looking statements are based upon assumptions of management which are believed to be reasonable at the time made and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties, and actual results could differ materially from those forward-looking statements. For more detailed information about the factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially, please refer to the cautionary statements in the presentation slides and our financial reports, which are available at www.lyb.com/investorrelations. And reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures, together with any other applicable disclosures, including the earnings release, are currently available on our website at www.lyb.com.
And finally, I'd like to point out that a recording of this call will be available by telephone beginning at 2 p.m. Eastern time today until 1 a.m. Eastern time on August 29 by calling (866) 453-2318 in the United States and (203) 369-1226 outside the United States, and the passcode for both numbers is 72916.
Now during today's call, we'll focus on second quarter results, the current environment and the near-term outlook. But before turning the call over to Bob, I'd like to call your attention to the noncash lower of cost or market inventory adjustments, or LCM, that we've discussed on past calls. As previously explained, these adjustments are related to our use of LIFO accounting and the volatility in prices of our raw material and finished goods inventories. And second quarter price recoveries for impacted products resulted in the reversal of the entire $68 million first quarter LCM charge. Interim LCM charges are reversed in subsequent periods when information shows the LCM charge may not be sustained through year-end. However, I'd also remind you that LCM charges that exist at year-end cannot be reversed. Additionally, if there are future price declines within our inventory pools during the remainder of the year, this could lead to additional LCM charges. Now comments made on this call will be in regard to our underlying business results excluding the impacts of these LCM inventory charges.
Now with that being said, I'll turn the call over to Bob."

Good morning to all of you, and thank you for joining our second quarter earnings call. Let's begin with Slide 4 and review the highlights from the second quarter. Our second quarter diluted earnings per share declined relative to the first",339,"Thanks, Doug. Good morning to all of you, and thank you for joining our second quarter earnings call. Let's begin with Slide 4 and review the highlights from the second quarter. Our second quarter diluted earnings per share declined relative to the first quarter to $2.45 per share with EBITDA of $1.7 billion. This excludes the $68 million lower of cost or market inventory gain. When the gain on sale of the Petroken Argentine business is also excluded from first quarter results, underlying earnings per share in the second quarter increased by $0.15 per share. Overall, second quarter business trends were as we had expected.
During the quarter, our downstream integration in polyolefins and other olefin derivatives enabled us to capture strong chain margins. Positive seasonal oxyfuel margin trends benefited the Intermediates & Derivatives business. While our chemical and polymer operations generally ran well, there was scheduled maintenance and some unplanned downtime across the company. Most significantly, the refinery operated at reduced rates throughout the quarter as repairs were required following a fire in our coker unit in April. The refinery returned to normal operation in mid-July. Based upon industry benchmark margins, the value of second quarter lost production due to planned and unplanned outages across the company is estimated to have been approximately $140 million. The ability to generate strong earnings during a period of heavy planned maintenance and a refinery upset is indicative of our solid portfolio. We progressed our financial priorities during the quarter as well, and Thomas will provide you with an update on those in a few moments.
Slide 5 reflects our continued outstanding safety performance. As I mentioned during the first half of this year, we performed an usually high amount of maintenance. Periods like this often result in an increased number of injuries. However, our results remain steady. We strongly believe that an unrelenting focus on safety has resulted in the excellent performance we have seen over the past 4 years.
Now Thomas will discuss our financial highlights for the second quarter."

On Slide 6, we outlined our quarterly and trailing 12-month segment results.

On Slide 6, we outlined our quarterly and trailing 12-month segment results. Combined olefins and polyolefins generated good results with $1.3 billion of EBITDA in the second quarter and $5.5 billion during the last 12 months. The Intermediates & Derivatives segment remained steady with second quarter EBITDA of approximately $370 million and $1.5 billion over the last 12 months. Due to operating issues, the refinery recorded a loss. Technology continued to perform well at an LTM pace of approximately $270 million. Overall, despite ongoing maintenance and global economic uncertainty, our profitability has remained strong with $7.5 billion of EBITDA over the past 12 months. The first half 2016 EBITDA represents an annual pace of nearly $7.2 billion.
Please turn to Slide 7 which provides a picture of cash generation and use. During the second quarter, we generated $1.3 billion of cash from operations and utilized $1.1 billion for dividends and share repurchases. Our maintenance and growth capital investments increased to approximately $560 million during the second quarter, with a significant portion of this investment focused on our Corpus Christi ethylene expansion and the turnaround at our Berre, France facility. During the second quarter, cash and liquid investments decreased by approximately $400 million to end with a balance of $2.5 billion. Over the last 12 months, cash from operations was $5.5 billion. A nearly equal amount was dedicated to dividends and share repurchases over the same period. After investments in our capital program, returns to our shareholders, borrowing and other activities, the cash and liquid investments balance declined by approximately $1.3 billion. However, at $2.5 billion, this remains well above our minimum requirements.
Slide 8 provides a longer perspective of cash flow as well as some current financial metrics. Our strong results and cash flow generation over multiple years positioned us to steadily raise our dividend and purchase shares. In May 2016, we increased our quarterly interim dividend by 9% to $0.85 per share. Additionally, our results have allowed us to access favorable credit markets while maintaining a strong balance sheet, BBB, Baa1 corporate credit rating and available liquidity of approximately $5 billion. During the first 6 months of 2016, cash flow generation remained strong although somewhat less than the pace seen in 2014 and 2015. On an annualized basis, using June 30 market capitalization, the cash flow yield is 9.4%.
Our share repurchase program remained at an approximate 10% annual pace. During the quarter, we purchased 8.8 million shares, representing 2% of our outstanding shares with approximately 4 million shares purchased during June. Notably, during May, we received approval for our fourth share repurchase program for up to an additional 10% of outstanding shares over the next 18 months. Based on the June 30 share price and the May quarterly dividend increase to $0.85 per share, the current dividend yield is approximately 4.6%.
Before I wrap up, I want to point out a few other items that may help your modeling. First, our effective tax rate for the quarter was 24%, several percentage points lower than our previously communicated estimate. The rate variance for the quarter compared to our forecasted annual rate was impacted primarily by discrete items including the impact of a non-U.S. tax law change as well as by our global earnings mix being balanced towards lower tax regions. We currently estimate our full year tax rate at approximately 27%, which is approximately 1 percentage point below our previous estimate. 2016 CapEx spending is on target to meet our forecast of $2.1 billion. Depreciation, amortization and interest expense are currently running at rates in line with our previous estimates.
With that, thank you very much for your attention, and I will turn the call back to Bob."

In our Olefins & Polyolefins - Americas segment, second quarter EBITDA was $",1252,"Thank you, Thomas. Let's turn to Slide 9 and review segment results. As mentioned previously, my discussion of business results will exclude the impact of the LCM inventory gain. In our Olefins & Polyolefins - Americas segment, second quarter EBITDA was $754 million. Results declined by $67 million excluding the first quarter gain of $57 million on the sale of the Petroken polypropylene business. Relative to the previous quarter, olefin results were generally unchanged. Ethylene prices improved by approximately $0.04 per pound and our margins improved, while customer and internal derivative plant maintenance resulted in reduced ethylene volumes. Our operating rates during the quarter averaged approximately 80% due to the planned maintenance and expansion at our Corpus Christi facility. Excluding the Corpus Christi outage, quarterly rates were approximately 90%. During the quarter, we operated our metathesis unit, but the contribution was not material. 74% of our ethylene production was from ethane and approximately 90% came from NGLs. We initiated the Corpus Christi ethylene turnaround and expansion during mid-April with completion planned for the end of the third quarter. At industry benchmark margins, second quarter loss production impact was estimated to be approximately $65 million. However, all but approximately $15 million was offset by purchases and inventory management during prior quarters.
In polyolefins, combined results declined by approximately $60 million. Results were driven by lower polyethylene and polypropylene volumes. Approximately half of the polyethylene volume decline was due to scheduled plant maintenance. Polypropylene volumes declined 5% primarily due to lower sales following the first quarter sale of Petroken. Polyethylene price spreads were relatively unchanged while polypropylene spreads declined by approximately $0.02 per pound, several cents less than industry data would indicate.
Thus far, during the third quarter, Olefins & Polyolefins - Americas industry trends are relatively unchanged. Our heavy planned maintenance schedule continues into the quarter. The Corpus Christi plant is scheduled to remain down throughout the quarter. Two weeks ago, we began a turnaround at our Morris, Illinois facility. At current benchmark rates -- at current industry benchmarks, the net value of lost third quarter production is estimated to be approximately $135 million.
Let's turn to Slide 10 and review performance in the Olefins & Polyolefins - Europe, Asia, and International segment. During the second quarter, underlying EBITDA was $536 million. Exclusive of a $21 million first quarter gain from the Argentine Petroken sale, EBITDA was relatively unchanged. Olefins results declined by approximately $30 million as increased feedstock costs outpaced olefin price increases. A turnaround at our Berre facility impacted Olefin & Polyolefin production during both the first and second quarters. At industry benchmark margins, the second quarter value of lost production is estimated to be approximately $35 million, $20 million greater than the first quarter impact. The advantaged feedstock accounted for 52% of ethylene production, contributing approximately $25 million over naphtha [ph].
In polyolefins, results were relatively unchanged. Exclusive of the gain from Petroken sale, our polypropylene compounding and polybutylene-1 results improved by approximately $10 million. Joint venture equity income was very strong, increasing by $27 million consistent with strong polyolefin margins. During the early weeks of the third quarter, underlying industry conditions have followed expectations and remained relatively unchanged. However, the third quarter is typically impacted by slower seasonal conditions. During the quarter, there is no significant maintenance planned at our wholly owned facilities, but there will be some at our joint ventures.
Now please turn to Slide 11 for a discussion of our Intermediates & Derivatives segment. Second quarter EBITDA was $369 million, an improvement of $15 million versus the first quarter. Results for propylene oxide and derivatives declined by approximately $20 million, partially due to sales, product mix and derivative margins. This was offset by an improvement in the intermediate chemicals of approximately $10 million. Styrene margins were the leading factor with an improvement of approximately $0.04 per pound versus the first quarter. Higher oxyfuels volumes and seasonal margin increases contributed approximately $30 million more than the first quarter results. Thus far, in the third quarter, PO and derivatives and the intermediate chemicals industry conditions are relatively unchanged from the second quarter. However, weaker gasoline markets have negatively impacted oxyfuels. This is seen on the slide in the reduction of the July MTBE margins. Additionally, a turnaround at our Bayport EO/EG plant has estimated to impact third quarter results by approximately $15 million.
Let's move to Slide 12 for a discussion of the Refining segment. Second quarter EBITDA was a loss of $13 million, a decline of $27 million from the prior quarter. Crude throughput averaged 183,000 barrels per day as rates were impacted by the April 8 fire and other maintenance. During the second quarter, the Maya 2-1-1 spread increased by $3.21 per barrel to average $21.07 for the quarter. However, due to our processing limitations, we were not able to benefit from the increased spreads.
Based on the second quarter industry benchmark spreads, the lost profit opportunity is estimated to be approximately $85 million. Repairs are now complete and the refinery returned to normal operation in mid-July. As you can see on the slide, during July, industry spreads trended downward. Additionally, the cost of RINs increased following the issuance of new EPA guidelines. Compared to the second quarter, market RIN price July month-to-date has increased by approximately $0.17 per gallon. At full refinery rates, every $0.10 change in the RIN cost is estimated to impact quarterly cost by approximately $5 million. Our Technology segment continued to perform well with second quarter EBITDA of $73 million.
I'll conclude with Slide 16 (sic) [ Slide 13 ]. Second quarter industry trends generally developed as we anticipated. We continued to see strong results in global olefins and polyolefins businesses. Our I&D segment benefited from strengthened styrene margins and seasonal oxyfuel improvements. Refining results were impacted by the refinery coker unit fire. Our solid cash flow enabled us to increase our dividend and extend our share repurchase program. In the near term, we believe that olefins and polyolefins markets will remain balanced with periods of potential tightness. Our refinery has returned to normal operation. Due to recent gasoline market changes, our Oxyfuels and Refining businesses are experiencing some margin pressure. We continue to invest in our facilities with the third quarter planned maintenance turnarounds at 2 olefin sites and our EO/EG facility at Bayport.
At recent industry margins, we estimate the impact of the related production loss in the third quarter to be approximately $150 million. However, this maintenance is the foundation for continued reliability over the coming years. Due to our unusually high planned maintenance schedule this year, the value of lost production through the first 3 quarters based upon the industry benchmark margins is estimated to be approximately $300 million. In contrast, next year's schedule is quite light. Within chemicals, there are no olefin plant turnarounds and only 1 PO plant turnaround. The refinery will also have a fluid unit turnaround.
Finally, I'm pleased to announce that in a separate press release to be issued shortly, you will see that we have made the final investment decision for a new 1.1 billion pound per year polyethylene line. Startup is targeted to occur during 2019. This facility represents an 18% increase in our U.S. polyethylene capacity. Additionally, it is the ""first of its kind"" process, combining attributes of both of our polyethylene and polypropylene technologies. As a result, the product capabilities will range from basic benchmark resins through to higher value-added grades.
We're now pleased to take your questions."

Yes, polypropylene margins, last time we spoke, there was a pretty wide gap between Asia and the U.S., and we've had said that, that would come in some partly with Asian prices coming up, which they did, and U.S. prices coming off a bit. I think we've kind of reached that delta, where likely we don't see a whole lot more. If we step back and look at supply-demand, and especially here in the U.S., there's not a lot of new supply coming and there is growth year-over-year. So I expect the polypropylene market in the U.S. to be relatively balanced to tight over the coming quarters, and we don't really see meaningful new capacity in the U.S. for a couple of years. There might be some debottlenecks, but I think it's probably 2 or 3 years out before we see new grassroots capacity."

Well, there's still a significant amount of rejection that's occurring even some still in the Eagle Ford and then places a little further away. P.J., I think what's going to be important to see is how propane and butane prices develop because part of what will balance markets is feedstock flexibility. That's something that we're very focused on for the long run, is to continue to find ways to increase feedstock flexibility. The cracker fleet in the U.S. has a reasonable amount of feedstock flexibility, which if ethane prices were to rise above, let's say, propane or butane economics, then a lot of us could switch, which would take some of that pressure off of ethane. The other thing is in the low oil price environment, I would think that some of the ethane exports could be more variable, and they could be shut off if ethane price were to rise. So I think there is balancing factors in the market from a supply standpoint with some premium over fuel value and with oil price moderately rising over time, I would think that, that will attract more supply. So we think this will sort of balance out over time. And also the timing of startups of crackers will impact that too, right? So if there are delays, then that pushes out that tightness of ethane and more time for more ethane production to come into market."

I think we're the probably the largest right now. So we have a very balanced strategy around buying ethane. I'll come back to my earlier comments which I think around ethane is, we have to think about what are the balancing factors on ethane price, and again, I think propane and butane will play an important role, also exports. Some of those could be variable at very high ethane prices. So I think the market will balance. The other thing is if ethane values persist at much higher than its fuel value, that ought to attract more supply or incent more supply. And so really I think what we're all concerned about here, I suppose, is more about the volatility, not about some structural change and how ethane will be priced. Because I think as we saw earlier in this decade, when ethane price rose and margins on ethane over fuel value were $0.30 per gallon or $0.40 per gallon, that was met with a lot more supply. And so we think that as these crackers start-up and so on, a combination of switching to other feedstocks, maybe less export and more supply, the market will find a new equilibrium and that will leave us in a position where the U.S. still has advantage vis-à-vis heavier crackers globally."

First of all, in the near term, we see markets being very strong. We see solid demand growth year-over-year. Planned maintenance and some unplanned outages in the industry and our planned maintenance have kept supply moderate. So we see pretty balanced markets. When we think about the cycle with some delays in new capacity, operating rates were not going to dip much below 90% on paper in the past, and as we see some of these delays and even some of the CTO projects in Asia being canceled, there's a higher likelihood that 2018 operating rates may not even -- effective operating rates may not dip below 90%. So yes, our view is that we're very constructive on markets near term, medium term. We're continuing to deliver strong earnings last 12 months at a pace of nearly $10 per share excluding LCM. We have a strong dividend. We're engaged in our fourth 10% share buyback program. So by virtue of those 2 things, we're returning significant cash back to our shareholders. Our focus remains very consistent: safe, reliable cost-efficient operations. We're going to finish the Corpus turnaround and debottleneck it by the end of Q3. We're going to continue to execute on the other turnarounds that we have. I think what all of this planned maintenance activity sets us up for is a very strong '17. We have very little turnaround activity in '17, and so I think that positions us well for next year. And we're starting to build out our growth project portfolio with our polyethylene project in '19 and potentially the PO/TBA project in '20, so we're continuing to advance those growth projects as well. So we look forward to updating all of you on those items at our next call. So thanks, again, for your interest in our company."

Good morning to all of you, and thank you for joining our third quarter earnings call. Let's begin with Slide 4 and review the highlights from the third quarter. Our third quarter diluted earnings were $2.31 per share with EBITDA of $1.6 billion. Overall, third quarter business trends developed as we expected. During the quarter, olefin chain margins continued to be healthy. Most notably, excellent results in our European Olefins and Polyolefins business demonstrated the strength of our global portfolio. Despite the significant planned maintenance in the Americas, the combined Olefins & Polyolefins results were $1.3 billion, relatively unchanged versus second quarter. 
While our chemical and polymer operations generally ran well, there was planned downtime in these operations and unplanned downtime in our Refining segment. Based upon industry benchmark margins, the value of third quarter loss production due to planned and unplanned outages across the company is estimated to have been approximately $285 million.
Slide 5 reflects our continued outstanding safety performance. Our results year-to-date have remained steady despite performing an usually high amount of maintenance.
Thomas will discuss our financial highlights for the third quarter."

 On Slide 6, we outlined our quarterly and trailing 12-month segment results. Combined, Olefins & Polyolefins continued to generate good quarter results with $1.3 billion of EBITDA and $5.3 billion during the last 12 months. The Intermediates & Derivatives segment third quarter EBITDA was approximately $300 million and $1.3 billion over the last 12 months. Utility supply and other operational upsets resulted in a loss at the refinery. Technology continued to perform well at a last 12-month pace of approximately $270 million. Overall, despite ongoing maintenance and refinery upsets, year-to-date earnings are near a $7 billion annual pace.
Please return to Slide 7, which provides a picture of cash generation and use. During the third quarter, we generated $1.3 billion of cash from operations. We utilized $1.2 billion for dividends and share repurchases. Our maintenance and gross capital investments were approximately $590 million during the third quarter, with a significant portion of these investments focused on our Corpus Christi ethylene expansion and the turnaround at our Morris, Illinois facility.
During the third quarter, cash and liquid investments decreased by approximately $420 million to end with a balance of $2.1 billion. Over the last 12 months, quarterly cash generation and spending trends were relatively similar to the third quarter pace. The $2.1 billion ending cash and liquid investments balance remains above our minimum requirement.
Slide 8 provides a longer perspective of cash flow as well as some current financial metrics. I will just mention a couple. First, our last 12 months cash flow was approximately $5 billion, with free cash flow off the Capex of approximately $3 billion. With respect to share repurchases during the third quarter, we purchased 10.3 million shares, bringing the year-to-date purchases to 7%. 2016 CapEx spending is trending above our forecast of $2.1 billion.
With that, thank you for your attention. I will turn the call back to Bob."

Let's turn to Slide 9 and review segment results. As mentioned previously, my discussion of business results will exclude the impact of the LCM inventory charges. In our Olefins & Polyolefins Americas segment, third quarter EBITDA was $682 million, a decline of $72 million versus the second quarter. Relative to the previous quarter, olefin results increased by approximately $15 million. Ethylene prices and margins increased while scheduled plant maintenance at our Corpus Christi and Morris sites negatively impacted the quarter. Olefin operating rates averaged approximately 70%. Excluding the scheduled maintenance, quarterly operating rates were approximately 95%. Ethylene production from ethane was approximately 70% and about 87% came from NGLs.
In polyolefins, results declined by $70 million. Results were driven by lower margins partially offset by increased sales volumes. Polyethylene price spreads declined approximately $0.04 per pound, while polypropylene spreads declined by approximately $0.09 per pound. Polyethylene and polypropylene sales volumes increased by approximately 6% and 13%, respectively. At third quarter industry benchmark margins, the net value of loss production related to our planned turnarounds was estimated to be about $205 million. Thus far, during the fourth quarter, Olefins and Polyolefins Americas industry trends are relatively unchanged. The Corpus Christi ethylene facility is currently being commissioned after the turnaround and expansion. We expect the plant to be operating at the expanded capacity during the month of November.
Let's turn to Slide 10 and review performance in the Olefins & Polyolefins Europe, Asia and International segment. During the third quarter, underlying EBITDA was $548 million -- $584 million, a $48 million increase over the second quarter. Despite a decline in polyolefins and equity income, overall results represent a record quarter. The quarter benefited by $11 million from the restructuring of Asian polypropylene joint ventures and the sale of Australian polypropylene assets.
Olefins results improved by approximately $95 million as feedstock cost decreased coupled with olefin price increases. Additionally,, volumes for the third quarter increased in the absence of second quarter planned maintenance. Advantaged feedstock accounted for 52% of ethylene production, contributing approximately $40 million over naphtha.
Polyolefins results declined $25 million, driven by reduced polyethylene margins. Equity income declined by $29 million due to scheduled maintenance at joint venture facilities. During the early weeks of the fourth quarter, naphtha feedstock prices have increased while underlying industry conditions remained relatively unchanged. Plant maintenance is underway at one of our ethylene crackers in Wesseling, Germany. The value of lost production is estimated to be approximately $25 million.
Now please turn to Slide 11 for a discussion of our Intermediates & Derivatives segments. Third quarter EBITDA was $304 million, a decline of $65 million versus the second quarter. Planned maintenance impacted the quarter by approximately $15 million. Results for polypropylene oxide and derivatives declined by approximately $15 million as a result of lower derivative margins following propylene price increases.
Intermediate chemicals declined approximately $60 million versus the second quarter. Styrene margins were the primary factor, with a decrease of approximately $0.03 per pound. Oxyfuels results were relatively unchanged, with increased volume offsetting lower margins. Thus far in the fourth quarter, I&D industry conditions are relatively unchanged from the third quarter. However, it is typical for oxyfuel margins to weaken during the fall and winter months.
Let's move to Slide 12 for a discussion of the Refining segment. Third quarter EBITDA was a loss of $10 million. Crude throughput averaged 209,000 barrels per day as throughput and yields were impacted by operating disruptions. The industry Maya 2-1-1 spread decreased by approximately $2 per barrel to average $19 per barrel in the quarter. Based on the third quarter industry benchmark spreads, the lost profit opportunity due to operational issues is estimated to be approximately $65 million.
Our Technology segment continued to perform well, with second quarter -- with third quarter EBITDA of $45 million.
Let me summarize our results with Slide 13. Overall earnings and cash generation continued to be satisfactory and industry trends generally developed as we anticipated. Olefins & Polyolefins conditions remained quite tight as evidenced by increased prices in U.S. ethylene and polypropylene change. Although our O&P results were impacted by a heavy planned maintenance schedule, they remain consistent with the prior quarter. In the I&D segment, increased raw material prices impacted PO derivative and styrene results while planned maintenance impacted the ethylene derivatives. These events are temporary and within the normal quarter-to-quarter variability.
During the fourth quarter, we anticipate some typical seasonal slowing in the ethylene chain in oxyfuels and refining. However, reduced scheduled maintenance, completion of the ethylene expansion at Corpus Christi and improved refining operations should provide a positive counterbalance. While there will be some planned maintenance within the system, the current estimate of the loss production value is approximately $75 million to $100 million, well-below the maintenance impact of second and third quarters.
I expect that there are some questions regarding the refining -- refinery status within our portfolio. Let me address that now. The company currently is exploring its options relating to our Houston refinery, which is the core asset of the refining operating segment. As the company has stated in the past, we believe the Houston refinery may be more valuable to others. We've engaged an investment bank to assist us in our process to explore our alternatives. We believe this refinery is a very unique asset, and to that end, we'll only consider a sale if it is in the best interest of all stakeholders. Any sale of the Houston refinery would be subject to the approval of our supervisory board. And assuming such approval is obtained, certain regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions would also apply. No decisions by our supervisory board with respect to a sale have been made at this time, and any further comment on a potential transaction would be speculative in nature.
Before I finish with closing remarks, I'd like to spend a few minutes looking at the near- and medium-term outlook for supply and demand, particularly within the ethylene chain for both LyondellBasell and the global industry.
Turning to Slide 14. I'd like to outline how LyondellBasell's heavy maintenance schedule for '16 compares to our relatively light plans for 2017. We typically have turnarounds at only 2 crackers in a given year. However, during 2016, we had 4 major cracker turnarounds and significant derivative turnaround activity. We also expanded the capacity of our Corpus Christi cracker by 800 million pounds. With this hard work completed during 2016, we have no cracker turnaround scheduled during 2017. At the refinery, planned and unplanned maintenance helped crude runs to a level that is projected to be 40,000 barrels per day below our 2017 plant throughput availability. The math behind the increased earnings power associated with these volumes is pretty straightforward, and we have provided 2016 benchmark margins for each of these businesses. The additional throughput has the potential to add hundreds of millions of dollars to the LyondellBasell bottom line during 2017.
As we look forward to 2017 and beyond, the combination of delays and capacity additions and continuing growth in global demand is improving our views on the market. Let's turn to Slide 15 and view the drivers of O&P demand. Within our polyethylene and polypropylene businesses, approximately 2/3 of the demand for our polyolefins comes from nondurable end users that are largely driven by population growth and a rising standard of living around the world. The large populations, GDP growth and consumption trends seen in China, India and other emerging economies will continue to drive these markets towards higher consumption. We believe that polyethylene and polypropylene can maintain the 4% to 5% demand growth that we have seen for these products over the past 25 years.
Given this demand growth, the operating rate question turns to the capacity additions that we have outlined on Slide 16. Crackers require billions of dollars of investments, with long engineering and construction lead times. This enables good visibility of olefin capacity additions for the coming 5 years. Earlier this year, we combined the IHS supply and demand outlook with a 4% forecast for planned and unplanned maintenance downtime to arrive at the effective operating rate illustrated by the green dotted line on the right side of Slide 16. Operating rates were forecast to remain strong, with only a brief decline in 2018, below the 90% to 94% range shaded in blue. This is the range where we would consider markets to be in a transition between loose and tight conditions.
Over the past several months, consultants have upgraded their views on capacity additions to reflect their increasing likelihood of project delays and cancellations. The result is a 6 billion pound reduction in an available capacity for 2018 that elevates global operating rates by about 1.5%. We also reviewed recent operating history on the left side of the Slide 16 which shows that downtime from planned and unplanned maintenance averaged 6%, 2% higher than our previous 4% estimate, and that results of these updates is shown as the black line on the right. The historical shape of this operating rate curve shows good correlation with profitability that the global industry has seen since late 2014 when prices and margins began to surpass the cost of the marginal producer. While we likely see reductions from current operating rates as new capacity comes online, it appears that these reductions in operating rates will be shorter and less severe than previous estimates.
On Slide 17, global balances are quantified in terms of the annual capacity of a world-scale cracker using ethane feedstocks to produce 3 billion pounds of ethylene. The 3 time periods provide perspective of the oncoming shale-based capacity additions relative to global demand growth and earlier capacity additions in other parts of the world. As seen in the left chart, from 2007 to 2011, global capacity additions exceeded demand by approximately 8 crackers. Most of these new crackers were built in the Middle East to leverage advantaged feedstocks. And these crackers ran at maximum rates even through the 2009 recession. Over the past 5 years, world demand has outpaced capacity additions by an amount equivalent to 3 crackers, primarily due to growing demand in China. As a result, global markets have tightened. Seeing with the 8 cracker equivalent forecast to come online in the United States by 2021, the forecast is relatively balanced over the next 5 years. 
In summary, delays and cancellations, coupled with continued population-driven demand, create a positive outlook for the coming years. Our team has completed several major turnarounds and we head into 2017 very well positioned. The view of the next several years is indicating better operating rates and conditions than we forecasted earlier this year. 
Finally, I'm pleased to announce that we plan to host an Investor Day on April 5 in New York. Please hold that date on your calendars, and we look forward to seeing you there. Thank you, and now we're pleased to take your questions."

Frankly, I think if we compare and contrast last year and this year, there's a few big drivers. First of all, in the oxyfuels area, our earnings are lower the long gasoline market and you see that in refining as well, so that reflects oxyfuels. Octane was a little more balanced rather than tight and were lower. And butane in the U.S. was higher priced compared to fuel value or oil price. So those all kind of contributed to lower margin in oxyfuels. We do think that those certainly can reverse themselves next year. I would say last year, butane trading at 35% of oil price in the summer, that was probably unusually low, and this year, we've been on the high side. So I think that's one contributor. The other is methanol has come off some. Methanol was very different last year and new capacity coming. We've already paid for our restart. So for us, our methanol, as that is, is much more opportunistic and a play on still keep natural gas in the U.S. And then lastly, styrene margins are good but they've come off of a really great year last year. So that's how I would kind of compare and contrast 2015 and 2016, Oxyfuels, methanol and styrene and the oxyfuels being probably the most dominant of the 3 in terms of the change."

So my sense is that with demand still growing 1%, 2% a year, no new capacity and euro is now below $1.10 so our customers can export a little more competitively and imports probably don't look as attractive to people from outside of Europe. So all of that seems to me creates a very balanced market. And what's going to be important is for us to operate really well, and this year, we have. Other than one turnaround in France early in the year that went a bit long with operated wells which has contributed to a really strong third quarter, we have strong volumes in Q3.

So first and foremost, we've got to take a view on oil to gas ratio. And even if capital cost come off soon compared to just really sort of heightened period we've just been through, we're still at a level where returns -- to me, they look marginal when you look at a $50 oil price and let's say, $3 gas and if ethane has some premium over field value, which I think is reasonable to assume.

Good morning to all of you, and thank you for joining our third quarter earnings call. Let's begin with Slide 4 and review the highlights from the third quarter. Our third quarter diluted earnings were $2.31 per share with EBITDA of $1.6 billion. Overall, third quarter business trends developed as we expected. During the quarter, olefin chain margins continued to be healthy. Most notably, excellent results in our European Olefins and Polyolefins business demonstrated the strength of our global portfolio. Despite the significant planned maintenance in the Americas, the combined Olefins & Polyolefins results were $1.3 billion, relatively unchanged versus second quarter. 
While our chemical and polymer operations generally ran well, there was planned downtime in these operations and unplanned downtime in our Refining segment. Based upon industry benchmark margins, the value of third quarter loss production due to planned and unplanned outages across the company is estimated to have been approximately $285 million.
Slide 5 reflects our continued outstanding safety performance. Our results year-to-date have remained steady despite performing an usually high amount of maintenance.
Thomas will discuss our financial highlights for the third quarter."

 On Slide 6, we outlined our quarterly and trailing 12-month segment results. Combined, Olefins & Polyolefins continued to generate good quarter results with $1.3 billion of EBITDA and $5.3 billion during the last 12 months. The Intermediates & Derivatives segment third quarter EBITDA was approximately $300 million and $1.3 billion over the last 12 months. Utility supply and other operational upsets resulted in a loss at the refinery. Technology continued to perform well at a last 12-month pace of approximately $270 million. Overall, despite ongoing maintenance and refinery upsets, year-to-date earnings are near a $7 billion annual pace.
Please return to Slide 7, which provides a picture of cash generation and use. During the third quarter, we generated $1.3 billion of cash from operations. We utilized $1.2 billion for dividends and share repurchases. Our maintenance and gross capital investments were approximately $590 million during the third quarter, with a significant portion of these investments focused on our Corpus Christi ethylene expansion and the turnaround at our Morris, Illinois facility.
During the third quarter, cash and liquid investments decreased by approximately $420 million to end with a balance of $2.1 billion. Over the last 12 months, quarterly cash generation and spending trends were relatively similar to the third quarter pace. The $2.1 billion ending cash and liquid investments balance remains above our minimum requirement.
Slide 8 provides a longer perspective of cash flow as well as some current financial metrics. I will just mention a couple. First, our last 12 months cash flow was approximately $5 billion, with free cash flow off the Capex of approximately $3 billion. With respect to share repurchases during the third quarter, we purchased 10.3 million shares, bringing the year-to-date purchases to 7%. 2016 CapEx spending is trending above our forecast of $2.1 billion.
With that, thank you for your attention. I will turn the call back to Bob."

Let's turn to Slide 9 and review segment results. As mentioned previously, my discussion of business results will exclude the impact of the LCM inventory charges. In our Olefins & Polyolefins Americas segment, third quarter EBITDA was $682 million, a decline of $72 million versus the second quarter. Relative to the previous quarter, olefin results increased by approximately $15 million. Ethylene prices and margins increased while scheduled plant maintenance at our Corpus Christi and Morris sites negatively impacted the quarter. Olefin operating rates averaged approximately 70%. Excluding the scheduled maintenance, quarterly operating rates were approximately 95%. Ethylene production from ethane was approximately 70% and about 87% came from NGLs.
In polyolefins, results declined by $70 million. Results were driven by lower margins partially offset by increased sales volumes. Polyethylene price spreads declined approximately $0.04 per pound, while polypropylene spreads declined by approximately $0.09 per pound. Polyethylene and polypropylene sales volumes increased by approximately 6% and 13%, respectively. At third quarter industry benchmark margins, the net value of loss production related to our planned turnarounds was estimated to be about $205 million. Thus far, during the fourth quarter, Olefins and Polyolefins Americas industry trends are relatively unchanged. The Corpus Christi ethylene facility is currently being commissioned after the turnaround and expansion. We expect the plant to be operating at the expanded capacity during the month of November.
Let's turn to Slide 10 and review performance in the Olefins & Polyolefins Europe, Asia and International segment. During the third quarter, underlying EBITDA was $548 million -- $584 million, a $48 million increase over the second quarter. Despite a decline in polyolefins and equity income, overall results represent a record quarter. The quarter benefited by $11 million from the restructuring of Asian polypropylene joint ventures and the sale of Australian polypropylene assets.
Olefins results improved by approximately $95 million as feedstock cost decreased coupled with olefin price increases. Additionally,, volumes for the third quarter increased in the absence of second quarter planned maintenance. Advantaged feedstock accounted for 52% of ethylene production, contributing approximately $40 million over naphtha.
Polyolefins results declined $25 million, driven by reduced polyethylene margins. Equity income declined by $29 million due to scheduled maintenance at joint venture facilities. During the early weeks of the fourth quarter, naphtha feedstock prices have increased while underlying industry conditions remained relatively unchanged. Plant maintenance is underway at one of our ethylene crackers in Wesseling, Germany. The value of lost production is estimated to be approximately $25 million.
Now please turn to Slide 11 for a discussion of our Intermediates & Derivatives segments. Third quarter EBITDA was $304 million, a decline of $65 million versus the second quarter. Planned maintenance impacted the quarter by approximately $15 million. Results for polypropylene oxide and derivatives declined by approximately $15 million as a result of lower derivative margins following propylene price increases.
Intermediate chemicals declined approximately $60 million versus the second quarter. Styrene margins were the primary factor, with a decrease of approximately $0.03 per pound. Oxyfuels results were relatively unchanged, with increased volume offsetting lower margins. Thus far in the fourth quarter, I&D industry conditions are relatively unchanged from the third quarter. However, it is typical for oxyfuel margins to weaken during the fall and winter months.
Let's move to Slide 12 for a discussion of the Refining segment. Third quarter EBITDA was a loss of $10 million. Crude throughput averaged 209,000 barrels per day as throughput and yields were impacted by operating disruptions. The industry Maya 2-1-1 spread decreased by approximately $2 per barrel to average $19 per barrel in the quarter. Based on the third quarter industry benchmark spreads, the lost profit opportunity due to operational issues is estimated to be approximately $65 million.
Our Technology segment continued to perform well, with second quarter -- with third quarter EBITDA of $45 million.
Let me summarize our results with Slide 13. Overall earnings and cash generation continued to be satisfactory and industry trends generally developed as we anticipated. Olefins & Polyolefins conditions remained quite tight as evidenced by increased prices in U.S. ethylene and polypropylene change. Although our O&P results were impacted by a heavy planned maintenance schedule, they remain consistent with the prior quarter. In the I&D segment, increased raw material prices impacted PO derivative and styrene results while planned maintenance impacted the ethylene derivatives. These events are temporary and within the normal quarter-to-quarter variability.
During the fourth quarter, we anticipate some typical seasonal slowing in the ethylene chain in oxyfuels and refining. However, reduced scheduled maintenance, completion of the ethylene expansion at Corpus Christi and improved refining operations should provide a positive counterbalance. While there will be some planned maintenance within the system, the current estimate of the loss production value is approximately $75 million to $100 million, well-below the maintenance impact of second and third quarters.
I expect that there are some questions regarding the refining -- refinery status within our portfolio. Let me address that now. The company currently is exploring its options relating to our Houston refinery, which is the core asset of the refining operating segment. As the company has stated in the past, we believe the Houston refinery may be more valuable to others. We've engaged an investment bank to assist us in our process to explore our alternatives. We believe this refinery is a very unique asset, and to that end, we'll only consider a sale if it is in the best interest of all stakeholders. Any sale of the Houston refinery would be subject to the approval of our supervisory board. And assuming such approval is obtained, certain regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions would also apply. No decisions by our supervisory board with respect to a sale have been made at this time, and any further comment on a potential transaction would be speculative in nature.
Before I finish with closing remarks, I'd like to spend a few minutes looking at the near- and medium-term outlook for supply and demand, particularly within the ethylene chain for both LyondellBasell and the global industry.
Turning to Slide 14. I'd like to outline how LyondellBasell's heavy maintenance schedule for '16 compares to our relatively light plans for 2017. We typically have turnarounds at only 2 crackers in a given year. However, during 2016, we had 4 major cracker turnarounds and significant derivative turnaround activity. We also expanded the capacity of our Corpus Christi cracker by 800 million pounds. With this hard work completed during 2016, we have no cracker turnaround scheduled during 2017. At the refinery, planned and unplanned maintenance helped crude runs to a level that is projected to be 40,000 barrels per day below our 2017 plant throughput availability. The math behind the increased earnings power associated with these volumes is pretty straightforward, and we have provided 2016 benchmark margins for each of these businesses. The additional throughput has the potential to add hundreds of millions of dollars to the LyondellBasell bottom line during 2017.
As we look forward to 2017 and beyond, the combination of delays and capacity additions and continuing growth in global demand is improving our views on the market. Let's turn to Slide 15 and view the drivers of O&P demand. Within our polyethylene and polypropylene businesses, approximately 2/3 of the demand for our polyolefins comes from nondurable end users that are largely driven by population growth and a rising standard of living around the world. The large populations, GDP growth and consumption trends seen in China, India and other emerging economies will continue to drive these markets towards higher consumption. We believe that polyethylene and polypropylene can maintain the 4% to 5% demand growth that we have seen for these products over the past 25 years.
Given this demand growth, the operating rate question turns to the capacity additions that we have outlined on Slide 16. Crackers require billions of dollars of investments, with long engineering and construction lead times. This enables good visibility of olefin capacity additions for the coming 5 years. Earlier this year, we combined the IHS supply and demand outlook with a 4% forecast for planned and unplanned maintenance downtime to arrive at the effective operating rate illustrated by the green dotted line on the right side of Slide 16. Operating rates were forecast to remain strong, with only a brief decline in 2018, below the 90% to 94% range shaded in blue. This is the range where we would consider markets to be in a transition between loose and tight conditions.
Over the past several months, consultants have upgraded their views on capacity additions to reflect their increasing likelihood of project delays and cancellations. The result is a 6 billion pound reduction in an available capacity for 2018 that elevates global operating rates by about 1.5%. We also reviewed recent operating history on the left side of the Slide 16 which shows that downtime from planned and unplanned maintenance averaged 6%, 2% higher than our previous 4% estimate, and that results of these updates is shown as the black line on the right. The historical shape of this operating rate curve shows good correlation with profitability that the global industry has seen since late 2014 when prices and margins began to surpass the cost of the marginal producer. While we likely see reductions from current operating rates as new capacity comes online, it appears that these reductions in operating rates will be shorter and less severe than previous estimates.
On Slide 17, global balances are quantified in terms of the annual capacity of a world-scale cracker using ethane feedstocks to produce 3 billion pounds of ethylene. The 3 time periods provide perspective of the oncoming shale-based capacity additions relative to global demand growth and earlier capacity additions in other parts of the world. As seen in the left chart, from 2007 to 2011, global capacity additions exceeded demand by approximately 8 crackers. Most of these new crackers were built in the Middle East to leverage advantaged feedstocks. And these crackers ran at maximum rates even through the 2009 recession. Over the past 5 years, world demand has outpaced capacity additions by an amount equivalent to 3 crackers, primarily due to growing demand in China. As a result, global markets have tightened. Even with the 8-cracker equivalents forecast to come online in the United States by 2021, the forecast is relatively balanced over the next 5 years.
In summary, delays and cancellations, coupled with continued population-driven demand, create a positive outlook for the coming years. Our team has completed several major turnarounds and we head into 2017 very well-positioned. The view of the next several years is indicating better operating rates and conditions than we forecasted earlier this year.
Finally, I'm pleased to announce that we plan to host an Investor Day on April 5 in New York. Please hold that date on your calendars, and we look forward to seeing you there.

They're adding derivative capacity that has a different timing than crackers, and some are pure merchant buyers and need to continue to buy. So our pricing discussions tend to be more longer term rather than quarter-to-quarter in nature."

Frank, I think if we compare and contrast last year and this year, there's a few big drivers. First of all, in the oxyfuels area, our earnings are lower the long gasoline market and then you see that in refining as well, so that impacts oxyfuels. Octane was a little more balanced rather than tight, so blend premiums were lower. And butane in the U.S. was higher priced compared to fuel value or oil price. So those all kind of contributed to lower margins in oxyfuels. We do think that those certainly can reverse themselves next year. I would say last year, butane trading at 35% of oil price in the summer, that was probably unusually low, and this year, we've been on the high side. So I think that's one contributor. The other is methanol has come off some. Methanol was very different last year and new capacity coming. We've already paid for our restart. So for us, our methanol asset is much more opportunistic and a play on still keep natural gas in the U.S. And then lastly, styrene margins are good, but they've come off of a really great year last year. So that's how I would kind of compare and contrast 2015 and 2016, oxyfuels, methanol and styrene and the oxyfuels being probably the most dominant of the 3 in terms of a change."

So my sense is that with demand still growing 1%, 2% a year, no new capacity and euro is now below $1.10 so our customers can export a little more competitively and imports probably don't look as attractive to people from outside of Europe. So all of that seems to me creates a very balanced market. And what's going to be important is for us to operate really well, and this year, we have. Other than one turnaround in France early in the year that went a bit long, we've operated wells which has contributed to a really strong third quarter. We had strong volumes in Q3.

But in a lower oil price environment and incrementally higher capital cost, to me, it's not obvious that we would invest in a new cracker facility here in the U.S. in post 2020. So first and foremost, we've got to take a view on oil to gas ratio. And even if capital cost come off some compared to just really sort of heightened period we've just been through, we're still at a level where returns -- to me, they look marginal when you look at a $50 oil price and let's say, $3 gas and if ethane has some premium over field value, which I think is reasonable to assume.

Good morning to all of you, and thank you for joining our third quarter earnings call. Let's begin with Slide 4 and review the highlights from the third quarter. Our third quarter diluted earnings were $2.31 per share with EBITDA of $1.6 billion. Overall, third quarter business trends developed as we expected. During the quarter, olefin chain margins continued to be healthy. Most notably, excellent results in our European Olefins and Polyolefins business demonstrated the strength of our global portfolio. Despite the significant planned maintenance in the Americas, the combined Olefins & Polyolefins results were $1.3 billion, relatively unchanged versus second quarter. 
While our chemical and polymer operations generally ran well, there was planned downtime in these operations and unplanned downtime in our Refining segment. Based upon industry benchmark margins, the value of third quarter loss production due to planned and unplanned outages across the company is estimated to have been approximately $285 million.
Slide 5 reflects our continued outstanding safety performance. Our results year-to-date have remained steady despite performing an unusually high amount of maintenance.
Thomas will discuss our financial highlights for the third quarter."

 On Slide 6, we outlined our quarterly and trailing 12-month segment results. Combined, Olefins & Polyolefins continued to generate good quarter results with $1.3 billion of EBITDA and $5.3 billion during the last 12 months. The Intermediates & Derivatives segment third quarter EBITDA was approximately $300 million and $1.3 billion over the last 12 months. Utility supply and other operational upsets resulted in a loss at the refinery. Technology continued to perform well at a last 12-month pace of approximately $270 million. Overall, despite ongoing maintenance and refinery upsets, year-to-date earnings are near a $7 billion annual pace.
Please return to Slide 7, which provides a picture of cash generation and use. During the third quarter, we generated $1.3 billion of cash from operations. We utilized $1.2 billion for dividends and share repurchases. Our maintenance and gross capital investments were approximately $590 million during the third quarter, with a significant portion of these investments focused on our Corpus Christi ethylene expansion and the turnaround at our Morris, Illinois facility.
During the third quarter, cash and liquid investments decreased by approximately $420 million to end with a balance of $2.1 billion. Over the last 12 months, quarterly cash generation and spending trends were relatively similar to the third quarter pace. The $2.1 billion ending cash and liquid investments balance remains above our minimum requirement.
Slide 8 provides a longer perspective of cash flow as well as some current financial metrics. I will just mention a couple. First, our last 12 months cash flow was approximately $5 billion, with free cash flow after CapEx of approximately $3 billion. With respect to share repurchases during the third quarter, we purchased 10.3 million shares, bringing the year-to-date purchases to 7%. 2016 CapEx spending is trending above our forecast of $2.1 billion.
With that, thank you for your attention. I will turn the call back to Bob."

Let's turn to Slide 9 and review segment results. As mentioned previously, my discussion of business results will exclude the impact of the LCM inventory charges. In our Olefins & Polyolefins Americas segment, third quarter EBITDA was $682 million, a decline of $72 million versus the second quarter. Relative to the previous quarter, olefin results increased by approximately $15 million. Ethylene prices and margins increased while scheduled plant maintenance at our Corpus Christi and Morris sites negatively impacted the quarter. Olefin operating rates averaged approximately 70%. Excluding the scheduled maintenance, quarterly operating rates were approximately 95%. Ethylene production from ethane was approximately 70% and about 87% came from NGLs.
In polyolefins, results declined by $70 million. Results were driven by lower margins partially offset by increased sales volumes. Polyethylene price spreads declined approximately $0.04 per pound, while polypropylene spreads declined by approximately $0.09 per pound. Polyethylene and polypropylene sales volumes increased by approximately 6% and 13%, respectively. At third quarter industry benchmark margins, the net value of loss production related to our planned turnarounds was estimated to be about $205 million. Thus far, during the fourth quarter, Olefins and Polyolefins Americas industry trends are relatively unchanged. The Corpus Christi ethylene facility is currently being commissioned after the turnaround and expansion. We expect the plant to be operating at the expanded capacity during the month of November.
Let's turn to Slide 10 and review performance in the Olefins & Polyolefins Europe, Asia and International segment. During the third quarter, underlying EBITDA was $548 million -- $584 million, a $48 million increase over the second quarter. Despite a decline in polyolefins and equity income, overall results represent a record quarter. The quarter benefited by $11 million from the restructuring of Asian polypropylene joint ventures and the sale of Australian polypropylene assets.
Olefins results improved by approximately $95 million as feedstock cost decreased coupled with olefin price increases. Additionally,, volumes for the third quarter increased in the absence of second quarter planned maintenance. Advantaged feedstock accounted for 52% of ethylene production, contributing approximately $40 million over naphtha.
Polyolefins results declined $25 million, driven by reduced polyethylene margins. Equity income declined by $29 million due to scheduled maintenance at joint venture facilities. During the early weeks of the fourth quarter, naphtha feedstock prices have increased while underlying industry conditions remained relatively unchanged. Plant maintenance is underway at one of our ethylene crackers in Wesseling, Germany. The value of lost production is estimated to be approximately $25 million.
Now please turn to Slide 11 for a discussion of our Intermediates & Derivatives segments. Third quarter EBITDA was $304 million, a decline of $65 million versus the second quarter. Planned maintenance impacted the quarter by approximately $15 million. Results for propylene oxide and derivatives declined by approximately $15 million as a result of lower derivative margins following propylene price increases.
Intermediate chemicals declined approximately $60 million versus the second quarter. Styrene margins were the primary factor, with a decrease of approximately $0.03 per pound. Oxyfuels results were relatively unchanged, with increased volume offsetting lower margins. Thus far in the fourth quarter, I&D industry conditions are relatively unchanged from the third quarter. However, it is typical for oxyfuel margins to weaken during the fall and winter months.
Let's move to Slide 12 for a discussion of the Refining segment. Third quarter EBITDA was a loss of $10 million. Crude throughput averaged 209,000 barrels per day as throughput and yields were impacted by operating disruptions. The industry Maya 2-1-1 spread decreased by approximately $2 per barrel to average $19 per barrel in the quarter. Based on the third quarter industry benchmark spreads, the lost profit opportunity due to operational issues is estimated to be approximately $65 million.
Our Technology segment continued to perform well, with second quarter -- with third quarter EBITDA of $45 million.
Let me summarize our results with Slide 13. Although our overall earnings and cash generation continued to be satisfactory and industry trends generally developed as we anticipated, Olefins & Polyolefins conditions remained quite tight as evidenced by increased prices in U.S. ethylene and polypropylene chains. Although our O&P results were impacted by a heavy planned maintenance schedule, they remain consistent with the prior quarter. In the I&D segment, increased raw material prices impacted PO derivative and styrene results while planned maintenance impacted the ethylene derivatives. These events are temporary and within the normal quarter-to-quarter variability.
During the fourth quarter, we anticipate some typical seasonal slowing in the ethylene chain in oxyfuels and refining. However, reduced scheduled maintenance, completion of the ethylene expansion at Corpus Christi and improved refining operations should provide a positive counterbalance. While there will be some planned maintenance within the system, the current estimate of the loss production value is approximately $75 million to $100 million, well-below the maintenance impact of second and third quarters.
I expect that there are some questions regarding the refining -- refinery status within our portfolio. Let me address that now. The company currently is exploring its options relating to our Houston refinery, which is the core asset of the refining operating segment. As the company has stated in the past, we believe the Houston refinery may be more valuable to others. We've engaged an investment bank to assist us in our process to explore our alternatives. We believe this refinery is a very unique asset, and to that end, we'll only consider a sale if it is in the best interest of all stakeholders. Any sale of the Houston refinery would be subject to the approval of our supervisory board. And assuming such approval is obtained, certain regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions would also apply. No decisions by our supervisory board with respect to a sale have been made at this time, and any further comment on a potential transaction would be speculative in nature.
Before I finish with closing remarks, I'd like to spend a few minutes looking at the near- and medium-term outlook for supply and demand, particularly within the ethylene chain for both LyondellBasell and the global industry.
Turning to Slide 14. I'd like to outline how LyondellBasell's heavy maintenance schedule for '16 compares to our relatively light plans for 2017. We typically have turnarounds at only 2 crackers in a given year. However, during 2016, we had 4 major cracker turnarounds and significant derivative turnaround activity. We also expanded the capacity of our Corpus Christi cracker by 800 million pounds. With this hard work completed during 2016, we have no cracker turnaround scheduled during 2017. At the refinery, planned and unplanned maintenance held crude runs to a level that is projected to be 40,000 barrels per day below our 2017 plant throughput availability. The math behind the increased earnings power associated with these volumes is pretty straightforward, and we have provided 2016 benchmark margins for each of these businesses. The additional throughput has the potential to add hundreds of millions of dollars to the LyondellBasell bottom line during 2017.
As we look forward to 2017 and beyond, the combination of delays and capacity additions and continuing growth in global demand is improving our views on the market. Let's turn to Slide 15 and view the drivers of O&P demand. Within our polyethylene and polypropylene businesses, approximately 2/3 of the demand for our polyolefins comes from nondurable end users that are largely driven by population growth and a rising standard of living around the world. The large populations, GDP growth and consumption trends seen in China, India and other emerging economies will continue to drive these markets towards higher consumption. We believe that polyethylene and polypropylene can maintain the 4% to 5% demand growth that we have seen for these products over the past 25 years.
Given this demand growth, the operating rate question turns to the capacity additions that we have outlined on Slide 16. Crackers require billions of dollars of investments, with long engineering and construction lead times. This enables good visibility of olefin capacity additions for the coming 5 years. Earlier this year, we combined the IHS supply and demand outlook with a 4% forecast for planned and unplanned maintenance downtime to arrive at the effective operating rate illustrated by the green dotted line on the right side of Slide 16. Operating rates were forecast to remain strong, with only a brief decline in 2018, below the 90% to 94% range shaded in blue. This is the range where we would consider markets to be in a transition between loose and tight conditions.
Over the past several months, consultants have upgraded their views on capacity additions to reflect their increasing likelihood of project delays and cancellations. The result is a 6 billion pound reduction in an available capacity for 2018 that elevates global operating rates by about 1% and 1.5%. We also reviewed recent operating history on the left side of the Slide 16 which shows that downtime from planned and unplanned maintenance averaged 6%, 2% higher than our previous 4% estimate, and that results of these updates is shown as the black line on the right. The historical shape of this operating rate curve shows good correlation with profitability that the global industry has seen since late 2014 when prices and margins began to surpass the cost of the marginal producer. While we likely see reductions from current operating rates as new capacity comes online, it appears that these reductions in operating rates will be shorter and less severe than previous estimates.
On Slide 17, global balances are quantified in terms of the annual capacity of a world-scale cracker using ethane feedstocks to produce 3 billion pounds of ethylene. The 3 time periods provide perspective of the oncoming shale-based capacity additions relative to global demand growth and earlier capacity additions in other parts of the world. As seen in the left chart, from 2007 to 2011, global capacity additions exceeded demand by approximately 8 crackers. Most of these new crackers were built in the Middle East to leverage advantaged feedstocks. And these crackers ran at maximum rates even through the 2009 recession. Over the past 5 years, world demand has outpaced capacity additions by an amount equivalent to 3 crackers, primarily due to growing demand in China. As a result, global markets have tightened. Even with the 8-cracker equivalents forecast to come online in the United States by 2021, the forecast is relatively balanced over the next 5 years.
In summary, delays and cancellations, coupled with continued population-driven demand, create a positive outlook for the coming years. Our team has completed several major turnarounds and we head into 2017 very well-positioned. The view of the next several years is indicating better operating rates and conditions than we forecasted earlier this year.
Finally, I'm pleased to announce that we plan to host an Investor Day on April 5 in New York. Please hold that date on your calendars, and we look forward to seeing you there.
Thank you, and now we're pleased to take your questions."

Frank, I think if we compare and contrast last year and this year, there's a few big drivers. First of all, in the oxyfuels area, our earnings are lower. Long gasoline market and then you see that in refining as well, so that impacts oxyfuels. Octane was a little more balanced rather than tight, so blend premiums were lower. And butane in the U.S. was higher priced compared to fuel value or oil price. So those all kind of contributed to lower margins in oxyfuels. We do think that those certainly can reverse themselves next year. I would say last year, butane trading at 35% of oil price in the summer, that was probably unusually low, and this year, we've been on the high side. So I think that's one contributor. The other is methanol has come off some. Methanol was very different last year and new capacity coming. We've already paid for our restart. So for us, our methanol asset is much more opportunistic and a play on still keep natural gas in the U.S. And then lastly, styrene margins are good, but they've come off of a really great year last year. So that's how I would kind of compare and contrast 2015 and 2016, oxyfuels, methanol and styrene and the oxyfuels being probably the most dominant of the 3 in terms of a change."

So my sense is that with demand still growing 1%, 2% a year, no new capacity and euro is now below $1.10 so our customers can export a little more competitively and imports probably don't look as attractive to people from outside of Europe. So all of that seems to me creates a very balanced market. And what's going to be important is for us to operate really well, and this year, we have. Other than one turnaround in France early in the year that went a bit long, we've operated well which has contributed to a really strong third quarter. We had strong volumes in Q3.

So first and foremost, we've got to take a view on oil to gas ratio. And even if capital cost come off some compared to just really sort of heightened period we've just been through, we're still at a level where returns -- to me, they look marginal when you look at a $50 oil price and let's say, $3 gas and if ethane has some premium over field value, which I think is reasonable to assume.

Good morning to all of you, and thank you for joining our third quarter earnings call. Let's begin with Slide 4 and review the highlights from the third quarter. Our third quarter diluted earnings were $2.31 per share with EBITDA of $1.6 billion. Overall, third quarter business trends developed as we expected. During the quarter, olefin chain margins continued to be healthy. Most notably, excellent results in our European Olefins and Polyolefins business demonstrated the strength of our global portfolio. Despite the significant planned maintenance in the Americas, the combined Olefins & Polyolefins results were $1.3 billion, relatively unchanged versus second quarter. 
While our chemical and polymer operations generally ran well, there was planned downtime in these operations and unplanned downtime in our Refining segment. Based upon industry benchmark margins, the value of third quarter loss production due to planned and unplanned outages across the company is estimated to have been approximately $285 million.
Slide 5 reflects our continued outstanding safety performance. Our results year-to-date have remained steady despite performing an unusually high amount of maintenance.
Thomas will discuss our financial highlights for the third quarter."

The Intermediates & Derivatives segment third quarter EBITDA was approximately $300 million and $1.3 billion over the last 12 months.

Please return to Slide 7, which provides a picture of cash generation and use. During the third quarter, we generated $1.3 billion of cash from operations. We utilized $1.2 billion for dividends and share repurchases. Our maintenance and gross capital investments were approximately $590 million during the third quarter, with a significant portion of these investments focused on our Corpus Christi ethylene expansion and the turnaround at our Morris, Illinois facility.
During the third quarter, cash and liquid investments decreased by approximately $420 million to end with a balance of $2.1 billion. Over the last 12 months, quarterly cash generation and spending trends were relatively similar to the third quarter pace. The $2.1 billion ending cash and liquid investments balance remains above our minimum requirement.
Slide 8 provides a longer perspective of cash flow as well as some current financial metrics. I will just mention a couple. First, our last 12 months cash flow was approximately $5 billion, with free cash flow after CapEx of approximately $3 billion. With respect to share repurchases during the third quarter, we purchased 10.3 million shares, bringing the year-to-date purchases to 7%. 2016 CapEx spending is trending above our forecast of $2.1 billion.
With that, thank you for your attention. I will turn the call back to Bob."

Let's turn to Slide 9 and review segment results. As mentioned previously, my discussion of business results will exclude the impact of the LCM inventory charges. In our Olefins & Polyolefins Americas segment, third quarter EBITDA was $682 million, a decline of $72 million versus the second quarter. Relative to the previous quarter, olefin results increased by approximately $15 million. Ethylene prices and margins increased while scheduled plant maintenance at our Corpus Christi and Morris sites negatively impacted the quarter. Olefin operating rates averaged approximately 70%. Excluding the scheduled maintenance, quarterly operating rates were approximately 95%. Ethylene production from ethane was approximately 70% and about 87% came from NGLs.
In polyolefins, results declined by $70 million. Results were driven by lower margins partially offset by increased sales volumes. Polyethylene price spreads declined approximately $0.04 per pound, while polypropylene spreads declined by approximately $0.09 per pound. Polyethylene and polypropylene sales volumes increased by approximately 6% and 13%, respectively. At third quarter industry benchmark margins, the net value of loss production related to our planned turnarounds was estimated to be about $205 million. Thus far, during the fourth quarter, Olefins and Polyolefins Americas industry trends are relatively unchanged. The Corpus Christi ethylene facility is currently being commissioned after the turnaround and expansion. We expect the plant to be operating at the expanded capacity during the month of November.
Let's turn to Slide 10 and review performance in the Olefins & Polyolefins Europe, Asia and International segment. During the third quarter, underlying EBITDA was $548 million -- $584 million, a $48 million increase over the second quarter. Despite a decline in polyolefins and equity income, overall results represent a record quarter. The quarter benefited by $11 million from the restructuring of Asian polypropylene joint ventures and the sale of Australian polypropylene assets.
Olefins results improved by approximately $95 million as feedstock cost decreased coupled with olefin price increases. Additionally,, volumes for the third quarter increased in the absence of second quarter planned maintenance. Advantaged feedstock accounted for 52% of ethylene production, contributing approximately $40 million over naphtha.
Polyolefins results declined $25 million, driven by reduced polyethylene margins. Equity income declined by $29 million due to scheduled maintenance at joint venture facilities. During the early weeks of the fourth quarter, naphtha feedstock prices have increased while underlying industry conditions remained relatively unchanged. Plant maintenance is underway at one of our ethylene crackers in Wesseling, Germany. The value of lost production is estimated to be approximately $25 million.
Now please turn to Slide 11 for a discussion of our Intermediates & Derivatives segments. Third quarter EBITDA was $304 million, a decline of $65 million versus the second quarter. Planned maintenance impacted the quarter by approximately $15 million. Results for propylene oxide and derivatives declined by approximately $15 million as a result of lower derivative margins following propylene price increases.
Intermediate chemicals declined approximately $60 million versus the second quarter. Styrene margins were the primary factor, with a decrease of approximately $0.03 per pound. Oxyfuels results were relatively unchanged, with increased volume offsetting lower margins. Thus far in the fourth quarter, I&D industry conditions are relatively unchanged from the third quarter. However, it is typical for oxyfuel margins to weaken during the fall and winter months.
Let's move to Slide 12 for a discussion of the Refining segment. Third quarter EBITDA was a loss of $10 million. Crude throughput averaged 209,000 barrels per day as throughput and yields were impacted by operating disruptions. The industry Maya 2-1-1 spread decreased by approximately $2 per barrel to average $19 per barrel in the quarter. Based on the third quarter industry benchmark spreads, the lost profit opportunity due to operational issues is estimated to be approximately $65 million.
Our Technology segment continued to perform well, with second quarter -- with third quarter EBITDA of $45 million.
Let me summarize our results with Slide 13. Although our overall earnings and cash generation continued to be satisfactory and industry trends generally developed as we anticipated, Olefins & Polyolefins conditions remained quite tight as evidenced by increased prices in U.S. ethylene and polypropylene chains. Although our O&P results were impacted by a heavy planned maintenance schedule, they remain consistent with the prior quarter. In the I&D segment, increased raw material prices impacted PO derivative and styrene results while planned maintenance impacted the ethylene derivatives. These events are temporary and within the normal quarter-to-quarter variability.
During the fourth quarter, we anticipate some typical seasonal slowing in the ethylene chain in oxyfuels and refining. However, reduced scheduled maintenance, completion of the ethylene expansion at Corpus Christi and improved refining operations should provide a positive counterbalance. While there will be some planned maintenance within the system, the current estimate of the loss production value is approximately $75 million to $100 million, well-below the maintenance impact of second and third quarters.
I expect that there are some questions regarding the refining -- refinery status within our portfolio. Let me address that now. The company currently is exploring its options relating to our Houston refinery, which is the core asset of the refining operating segment. As the company has stated in the past, we believe the Houston refinery may be more valuable to others. We've engaged an investment bank to assist us in our process to explore our alternatives. We believe this refinery is a very unique asset, and to that end, we'll only consider a sale if it is in the best interest of all stakeholders. Any sale of the Houston refinery would be subject to the approval of our supervisory board. And assuming such approval is obtained, certain regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions would also apply. No decisions by our supervisory board with respect to a sale have been made at this time, and any further comment on a potential transaction would be speculative in nature.
Before I finish with closing remarks, I'd like to spend a few minutes looking at the near- and medium-term outlook for supply and demand, particularly within the ethylene chain for both LyondellBasell and the global industry.
Turning to Slide 14. I'd like to outline how LyondellBasell's heavy maintenance schedule for '16 compares to our relatively light plans for 2017. We typically have turnarounds at only 2 crackers in a given year. However, during 2016, we had 4 major cracker turnarounds and significant derivative turnaround activity. We also expanded the capacity of our Corpus Christi cracker by 800 million pounds. With this hard work completed during 2016, we have no cracker turnaround scheduled during 2017. At the refinery, planned and unplanned maintenance held crude runs to a level that is projected to be 40,000 barrels per day below our 2017 plant throughput availability. The math behind the increased earnings power associated with these volumes is pretty straightforward, and we have provided 2016 benchmark margins for each of these businesses. The additional throughput has the potential to add hundreds of millions of dollars to the LyondellBasell bottom line during 2017.
As we look forward to 2017 and beyond, the combination of delays and capacity additions and continuing growth in global demand is improving our views on the market. Let's turn to Slide 15 and view the drivers of O&P demand. Within our polyethylene and polypropylene businesses, approximately 2/3 of the demand for our polyolefins comes from nondurable end users that are largely driven by population growth and a rising standard of living around the world. The large populations, GDP growth and consumption trends seen in China, India and other emerging economies will continue to drive these markets towards higher consumption. We believe that polyethylene and polypropylene can maintain the 4% to 5% demand growth that we have seen for these products over the past 25 years.
Given this demand growth, the operating rate question turns to the capacity additions that we have outlined on Slide 16. Crackers require billions of dollars of investments, with long engineering and construction lead times. This enables good visibility of olefin capacity additions for the coming 5 years. Earlier this year, we combined the IHS supply and demand outlook with a 4% forecast for planned and unplanned maintenance downtime to arrive at the effective operating rate illustrated by the green dotted line on the right side of Slide 16. Operating rates were forecast to remain strong, with only a brief decline in 2018, below the 90% to 94% range shaded in blue. This is the range where we would consider markets to be in a transition between loose and tight conditions.
Over the past several months, consultants have upgraded their views on capacity additions to reflect their increasing likelihood of project delays and cancellations. The result is a 6 billion pound reduction in an available capacity for 2018 that elevates global operating rates by about 1% and 1.5%. We also reviewed recent operating history on the left side of the Slide 16 which shows that downtime from planned and unplanned maintenance averaged 6%, 2% higher than our previous 4% estimate, and that results of these updates is shown as the black line on the right. The historical shape of this operating rate curve shows good correlation with profitability that the global industry has seen since late 2014 when prices and margins began to surpass the cost of the marginal producer. While we likely see reductions from current operating rates as new capacity comes online, it appears that these reductions in operating rates will be shorter and less severe than previous estimates.
On Slide 17, global balances are quantified in terms of the annual capacity of a world-scale cracker using ethane feedstocks to produce 3 billion pounds of ethylene. The 3 time periods provide perspective of the oncoming shale-based capacity additions relative to global demand growth and earlier capacity additions in other parts of the world. As seen in the left chart, from 2007 to 2011, global capacity additions exceeded demand by approximately 8 crackers. Most of these new crackers were built in the Middle East to leverage advantaged feedstocks. And these crackers ran at maximum rates even through the 2009 recession. Over the past 5 years, world demand has outpaced capacity additions by an amount equivalent to 3 crackers, primarily due to growing demand in China. As a result, global markets have tightened. Even with the 8-cracker equivalents forecast to come online in the United States by 2021, the forecast is relatively balanced over the next 5 years.
In summary, delays and cancellations, coupled with continued population-driven demand, create a positive outlook for the coming years. Our team has completed several major turnarounds and we head into 2017 very well-positioned. The view of the next several years is indicating better operating rates and conditions than we forecasted earlier this year.
Finally, I'm pleased to announce that we plan to host an Investor Day on April 5 in New York. Please hold that date on your calendars, and we look forward to seeing you there.

Historical average has been somewhere around $0.07 per gallon, and we think that's reasonable and that still affords the U.S. a reasonable advantage vis-à-vis the rest of the world, so relatively unchanged.

Frank, I think if we compare and contrast last year and this year, there's a few big drivers. First of all, in the oxyfuels area, our earnings are lower. Long gasoline market and then you see that in refining as well, so that impacts oxyfuels. Octane was a little more balanced rather than tight, so blend premiums were lower. And butane in the U.S. was higher priced compared to fuel value or oil price. So those all kind of contributed to lower margins in oxyfuels. We do think that those certainly can reverse themselves next year. I would say last year, butane trading at 35% of oil price in the summer, that was probably unusually low, and this year, we've been on the high side. So I think that's one contributor. The other is methanol has come off some. Methanol was very different last year and new capacity coming. We've already paid for our restart. So for us, our methanol asset is much more opportunistic and a play on still keep natural gas in the U.S. And then lastly, styrene margins are good, but they've come off of a really great year last year. So that's how I would kind of compare and contrast 2015 and 2016, oxyfuels, methanol and styrene and the oxyfuels being probably the most dominant of the 3 in terms of a change."

So my sense is that with demand still growing 1%, 2% a year, no new capacity and euro is now below $1.10 so our customers can export a little more competitively and imports probably don't look as attractive to people from outside of Europe. So all of that seems to me creates a very balanced market. And what's going to be important is for us to operate really well, and this year, we have. Other than one turnaround in France early in the year that went a bit long, we've operated well which has contributed to a really strong third quarter. We had strong volumes in Q3.

So first and foremost, we've got to take a view on oil to gas ratio. And even if capital cost come off some compared to just really sort of heightened period we've just been through, we're still at a level where returns -- to me, they look marginal when you look at a $50 oil price and let's say, $3 gas and if ethane has some premium over field value, which I think is reasonable to assume.

First of all, I think we had a solid quarter despite 2 cracker turnarounds in the U.S. and some I&D planned maintenance. I think we're really well-positioned to finish the year strong. We have -- our focus is to get the Corpus Christi cracker started up here in November and realize the benefit of 800 million pounds of more capacity and to have that cracker back online. With a very large planned maintenance year this year, next year as we've outlined in our materials, we're going to meaningfully add to our volume. And I think we're really well-positioned for what we think would be very good markets next year as project timing has been pushed out. And longer term, as we outlined, we think that operating rates for ethylene globally probably shifted up a bit from our prior estimates, given ramp-up time and startup of new projects. So I think we'll continue to be well-positioned, both near term and long term. So we look forward to updating you on our full earnings in February. And thanks, as always, for your interest in our company. Thank you."
