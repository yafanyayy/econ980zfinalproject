266112,317735012,936944,"Deere & Company, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Feb 19, 2016",2016-02-19,"Earnings Calls","Deere & Company","Executives","Thank you, Tony. With the announcement of our first quarter results, John Deere has started out 2016 on a profitable note. Our results, however, were lower than last year, reflecting the continuing impact of the downturn in the global firm economy and wea",2147,"Thank you, Tony. With the announcement of our first quarter results, John Deere has started out 2016 on a profitable note. Our results, however, were lower than last year, reflecting the continuing impact of the downturn in the global firm economy and weakness in construction equipment markets. 
All of Deere's businesses remained solidly profitable for the quarter. This shows our continuing progress managing costs and creating a more flexible responsive cost structure. We also lowered our annual guidance for both sales and earnings, with most of the change due to foreign currency and weaker markets in construction equipment. 
Now let's take a closer look at our first quarter results in detail, beginning on Slide 3. Net sales and revenues were down 13% to $5.525 billion. Net income attributable to Deere & Company was $254 million. EPS was $0.80 in the quarter.
On Slide 4, total worldwide equipment operations net sales were down 15% to $4.8 billion. Price realization in the quarter was positive by 2 points. Currency translation was negative by 4 points. In comparison with our previous net sales guidance of down about 11%, the difference is largely attributable to lower sale volumes for Agriculture & Turf equipment. 
Turning to our review of our individual businesses. Let's start with Agriculture & Turf on Slide 5. Net sales were down 12% in the quarter-over-quarter comparison. The decrease was mostly due to lower shipment volumes of large ag equipment in United States and Brazil. Partially offsetting these declines were higher sales in Europe. 
Foreign currency exchange had a negative impact on sales as well, largely driven by the euro and Brazilian real. Operating profit was $144 million, down from $268 million last year. The decrease in operating profit was primarily driven by lower shipment volumes, unfavorable foreign currency exchange and a less favorable product mix. These factors were partially offset by price realization, lower selling, administrative and general expenses and lower production costs. The division's decremental margin in the quarter was about 26%. 
Before we review the industry sales outlook, let's look at fundamentals affecting the ag business. Slide 6 outlines U.S. farm cash receipts. Given the record crop harvest for the last 3 years and the resulting lower commodity prices, our estimate for 2015 cash receipts is now down about 10% from 2014's peak levels. Our 2016 forecast contemplates total cash receipts to be about $381 billion, down slightly from 2015.
On Slide 7, grain stocks-to-use ratios remain at somewhat sensitive levels on a global basis, even after the abundant harvest of the past 3 years. Global grain and oilseed demand remains strong while supply is now fully adequate. Even so, unfavorable growing conditions in any key region of the world as well as unknown impacts from any geopolitical tension could result in prices quickly moving higher. 
Our economic outlook for the EU 28 is on Slide 8. Economic growth is improving at a moderate base. Farm income remains below the long-term average and weakness persists in the dairy sector. As a result, we're expecting lower industry farm machinery demand in the EU region.
On Slide 9, you'll see the economic fundamentals outlined for China and India. Because of the economic slowdown in China, we continue to anticipate lower industry sales. While the government support of mechanization is helping this sector, changes in government subsidies are causing uncertainty.
Turning to India. The government continues providing assistance to the ag sector, with programs such as minimum support prices for commodities. Although the region has experienced 2 consecutive below-normal monsoon seasons, our forecast calls for a modest rebound in industry sales in 2016.
Shifting to Brazil. Slide 10 illustrates the crop value of agricultural production, a good proxy for the health of agribusiness there. Ag production is expected to decrease about 2% in 2016 in U.S. dollar terms due to lower global commodity prices. The situation, however, is more positive in local currency due to the devaluation of the real. Brazilian farmer profitability remains at good levels as crops are sold in dollars. 
Although ag fundamentals remain positive, farmer confidence is low due to economic and political concerns, growing inflation and uncertainty over government-sponsored financing programs, all of which are leading to lower equipment sales. In spite of these short-term concerns, the long-term fundamentals for our ag business in Brazil remain strong. 
Our 2016 Ag & Turf industry outlooks are summarized on Slide 11. You'll note there are no changes from the guidance provided last quarter. Low commodity prices and stagnant farm income in the U.S. and Canada are continuing to pressure demand for farm equipment, with the decline being most pronounced in the sale of high horsepower models. 
Our forecast for industry sales in the U.S. and Canada remains down 15% to 20%, with large ag equipment sales down 25% to 30%. The EU 28 industry outlook remains flat to down 5% in 2016 due to low crop prices and farm incomes as well as continued pressure on the dairy sector. In South America, industry sales of tractors and combines are projected to be down 10% to 15% in 2016. Shifting to Asia, sales are expected to be flat to down slightly due in part to weakness in China. 
Turning to another product category, industry retail sales of turf and utility equipment in the U.S. and Canada are projected to be flat to up 5% in 2016, benefiting from new products and general economic growth. 
Putting this all together on Slide 12, fiscal year 2016 Deere sales of worldwide Ag & Turf equipment are now forecast to be down about 10%. This includes about 4 points of negative currency translation. The deterioration in our forecast is driven almost entirely by foreign currency exchange. Ag & Turf division operating margin is forecast to be about 7% in 2016, unchanged from the previous forecast. The implied decremental margin for the year is about 23%. 
Now let's focus on Construction & Forestry. Net sales were down 23% in the quarter as a result of lower shipment volumes and unfavorable foreign currency exchange, partially offset by price realization. Operating profit was $70 million in the quarter, down from $146 million last year. The decrease was driven by lower shipment volumes, partially offset by price realization and lower selling, administrative and general expenses. The division's decremental margin was about 21%.
Moving to Slide 14. Looking at the economic indicators at the bottom part of the slide, GDP growth is positive, construction spending is up from 2015 levels and housing starts are expected to exceed 1.2 million units this year. In spite of these encouraging signs, the industry is operating at a slow pace. 
Contributing factors are weak conditions in the North American energy sector and the movement of equipment from energy producing regions to other parts of the country. Rental utilization rates continue to decline. Economic growth outside the United States is sluggish, and the mix of housing starts in the U.S. is skewed to multifamily homes, reducing demand for earthmoving equipment. As a result, Deere's Construction & Forestry sales are now forecast to be down about 11% in 2016. 
The change from our previous forecast is largely driven by lower sales in the United States and Canada and the negative foreign exchange effect of about 1 point. The forecast for global forestry markets remains down 5% to 10% from the strong levels we've experienced in recent years, primarily as a result of lower sales in the U.S. and Canada. C&F's full year operating margin is now projected to be about 7%. The implied decremental margin for the year is about 27%. 
Let's move now to our Financial Services operations. Slide 15 shows the annualized provision for credit losses as a percent of the average owned portfolio. At the end of January, it was 8 basis points, reflecting the continued excellent quality of our portfolios. The financial forecast for 2016 contemplates a loss provision of about 19 basis points. Even so, this puts the year's losses below the 10-year average of 26 basis points and well below the 15-year average of 39 basis points.
Moving to Slide 16. Worldwide Financial Services net income attributable to Deere & Company was $129 million in the first quarter versus $157 million last year. The lower results were primarily due to the unfavorable effects of foreign currency exchange translation, higher losses on residual values primarily for construction equipment operating leases, less favorable financing spreads and a higher provision for credit losses. These were partially offset by lower selling, administrative and general expenses.
2016 net income attributable to Deere & Company is now forecast to be about $525 million, which is down from last year. The outlook reflects less favorable financing spreads and increased provision for credit losses and the negative effects of currency exchange translation. Remember that 2015 results benefited from a gain on the sale of the crop insurance business of about $30 million.
Before we move on to receivables and inventory, let's discuss the losses on residual values noted in the earnings release that affected the quarter's results. A majority of the losses were due to impairment charges for construction equipment. The losses were mainly related to short-term leases of production class equipment. We continue to closely monitor the leasing portfolio, adjust residual values on the existing portfolio as needed and take appropriate actions on new contracts to ensure we are mitigating future risk.
Slide 17 outlines receivables and inventory. For the company as a whole, receivables and inventories ended the quarter down $205 million. We expect to end 2016 with total receivables and inventory down about $550 million with reductions from both divisions. 
2016 guidance for cost of sales as a percent of net sales, shown on Slide 18, is about 79%, unchanged from last quarter. When modeling 2016, keep these unfavorable impacts in mind: unfavorable product mix, Tier 4 product costs and overhead spend. On the favorable side, we expect price realization of about 2 points, favorable raw material costs, lower pension and OPEB expense and lower incentive compensation expense.
Now let's look at a few housekeeping items. With respect to R&D expense on Slide 19, R&D was down 4% in the first quarter, including about 2 points of negative currency translation. Our 2016 forecast calls for R&D to be down about 3%, with about 1 point of negative currency translation.
Moving now to Slide 20. SA&G expense for the equipment operations was down 11% in the first quarter, with currency translation, incentive compensation and pension and OPEB accounting for about 8 points of the change. Our 2016 forecast contemplates SA&G expense being down about 4%. The same factors just cited for the quarter also account for about 6 points for the full year change.
Turning to Slide 21. Pension and OPEB expense was down $44 million for the quarter and is forecasted to be down about $200 million for the full year, unchanged from the previous forecast. 
On Slide 22, the equipment operations tax rate was 20% in the quarter, primarily due to discrete items. While it's not our practice to provide specifics on discrete items, I would point out the R&D tax credit was extended for 2015 during the quarter. For 2016, the full year effective tax rate is forecast to be in the range of 33% to 35%.
Slide 23 shows our equipment operations history of strong cash flow. Cash flow from the equipment operations is now forecast to be about $2.1 billion in 2016. The reduction from our previous guidance is largely attributable to the forecasted change in working capital and lower net income. 
The company's second quarter financial outlook is on Slide 24. Net sales for the quarter are forecast to be down about 8% compared with 2015. This includes about 2 points of price realization and unfavorable currency translation of about 3 points.
Turning to Slide 25 and the full year outlook. Our forecast now calls for net sales to be down about 10%. Price realization is expected to be positive by about 2 points. Currency translation is negative by about 3 points. Finally, our full year 2016 net income forecast is now about $1.3 billion. 
In closing, although Deere expects another challenging year in 2016, our forecast represents a level of performance that is much better than we've experienced in previous downturns. This illustrates the continuing impact of our efforts to establish a more durable business model and a wider range of revenue sources. 
At the same time, Deere's financial condition remains strong, and the company is continuing to forecast a healthy level of cash flow this year. As a result, we're well positioned to continue looking to the future and making investments in innovative products, advanced technology and new markets. These actions, we're confident, will deliver significant value to our customers and investors in the years ahead. I'll now turn the call over to Tony."

So if you think about inventory and some may have noticed kind of along that line with the receivables and inventory forecast, that it is -- it did change and the reduction is actually a little lower from what we had in original budget. And I would point out, first of all, that's really more related to changes in small ag. So if you look at large ag, the forecast is change in receivables is really very, very similar, very much in line with what we had in the original budget. Used equipment, we continue to make progress. It's still -- as we talked about previously, there's still a lot of work there especially on large tractors. I think last time we talked about down 18% roughly from kind of the highs that were set in 2014. Today, we would put large ag used at about 23% lower, so again continuing to make some good progress there. Maybe as importantly, as we bring that down, used pricing on our large ag equipment is remaining steady. So again, continuing to make progress but those efforts will certainly continue through 2016."

So it does provide some additional flexibility and we would have additional flexibility. We've also talked in our forecast for R&D, while down a bit, is not a lever we pulled significantly hard at this point. And again, that's trying to take a long-term view. So depending on if our perspective changes in terms of the length of this downturn, that would be certainly an area we would continue to be able to pull levers. I would note from original budget, our SA&G forecast has come down further in terms of what we're forecasting. That's an area we continue to look at and attempt to identify costs that can come out. And as those are identified, we'll add those into the forecast. So again, it's -- I don't want to imply, however, that we have the same type of leverage that we would have had coming off of the peak. Obviously, we're already at very low levels so our ability to pull costs out relative to any further sales declines will be more challenging. We've been pretty open about that. This year, fortunately, with incrementals or decrementals as the case may be quite gotten some benefit from the pension and OPEB change and some other factors, lower material costs, so forth. And so -- but still, I think it's demonstrating that we are very focused on cost management and doing an effective job today."

And we've talked about our cash use by already several times in the past. They remain the same, okay? So our highest priority is our single A rating. We are maintaining a strong balance sheet and ample liquidity. And maintaining access to attractive funding sources is even more important during a downturn like right now. So next priority is organic and inorganic investments then benefit the company in the long term. And we are, as Tony mentioned, continuing to invest in R&D, especially with a focus on innovation. And we take a long-term view with respect to inorganic options. And we have discussions over multiple years sometimes with inorganic options. They're aligned with our strategy. So we recently announced 2 acquisitions. One was Monosem based in France and the other was Precision Planting based in the U.S., and we will use about $325 million of cash for just those 2. The next priority is dividends and our goal is to keep dividends at about 25% to 35% of mid-cycle earnings. And we'll maintain our dividends even through difficult downturns. And finally, share repurchases are a residual use of cash and deployed only after this interesting value is significant so it's beneficial to our longer-term shareholders when the distance intrinsic value makes repurchases attractive now, higher priorities will obviously take precedence. So the other point I'll make is you may recall that quarter 1 is typically a significant user of cash on operations side, okay? So if you put all those together, I think that's a summary of our thought is on the cash."

So we are seeing sales down certainly for North American ag with a greater impact on the large ag business. But I would say our order books are very much in line with that outlook."

Most of that optimism candidly has been removed from the forecast. And so what we're forecasting today for Construction is we'd say normal seasonality. So you'll see some improved sales as you go kind of through the year but really nothing beyond again a typical seasonality. So with Ag & Turf again, you get some better clarity as you go through the year. We talked about some higher level of impacted FX as well.

So always remember that versus large ag in the U.S. and Canada where we do have the best visibility from an order book perspective. So there's certainly, I would say, continued to risk in South America and potential opportunity. I would say you have both. So risk, Brazil continues -- while the farmers in Brazil continue to operate at a very profitable level because of the fact that they do sell their commodities in U.S. dollars so the FX is benefiting them. But the overall government concerns remain. The FINAMI financing there appears to have stabilized. Somewhat, is back in place and the funding appears to be in place for that as well. We've heard some positive comments from government officials regarding their commitment to that. But again, there's always risk. And remember, their fiscal year ends in June. And so what happens with the FINAMI financing and other supports beyond June would continue to be a question as well. Now on the flip side, you have Argentina where we would argue there's potential upside opportunity there if the reforms continue to progress, and if those reforms are fully implemented such that we have the ability not just to import but also export and so on. We think that could be a really good opportunity for us. You may have heard when we were out traveling with some the fact that it is a very profitable market for us. And so the opportunity to sell more product into Argentina would certainly be beneficial for us. So there are a lot of puts and takes as you think about South America. But all in all, the industry outlook, you got to remember that's on tractors and combines, remains unchanged.

We are seeing dealers shifting the use of those more towards the retail. Sale portion, as you may be aware, they can use those funds both to provide low or no interest wholesale funding while that inventory is on their lot or they can also use it towards various incentives. I think part of the reason why used pricing is staying high, A, that historically how Deere equipment has responded in this type of environment. And B, some of those incentives aren't focused on simply reducing the purchase price. So we're looking at things like lower rate financing opportunities, providing additional warranty on the equipment, those sorts of things that provide incentives to the customer without degrading the purchase price, if you will. So again, we did see, I want to be clear when we came into the downturn, we did see some small decreases in used pricing, but they held very firm at those kind of small single-digit type of declines at least today.

But I just want to clarify that because again, while used equipment prices have held firm, they did from that initial decline, we did see some initial decline. And so when you look at losses on return leases, keeping in mind the average new equipment, the average lease term is around 3 years and used has actually moved to that. Used to be a little bit further out. So most of the lease returns that are coming back today would have been written 3 years ago, at least on average. So really still kind of the height of the market. So recoveries aren't as high as what they would have been historically. They're still very, very strong but we're still seeing a little bit of a decline in the recovery rate on the ag equipment coming in. But I wouldn't imply anything beyond that. Certainly, from a provision increase, a lot of those increases come from things like a revolving credit portfolio, which is where you tend to see some responsiveness early on, not just the ag portfolio. So those are the things that are really driving those higher level of provisions in the forecast. The other thing I'd be quick to point out is they're higher, but they're higher off of, as you know, very, very low level. And if -- let's just say that forecast is dead on, we hit 19 basis points this year, that's still a very attractive level for any portfolio to be maintaining in this type of an environment with the provision on credit losses. So again, we feel very good about the strength of the farmer and their ability to continue to pay for the equipment they have financed with us."

And the size of the portfolio is significantly smaller. And so again, I think that's the key difference. And I wouldn't extrapolate any of what we're talking about on construction towards ag. There are significant differences in those portfolios between ag and construction on our leasing. So you think about things like the term of the leases. Most of the losses we're seeing in the impairment taken for construction are about short-term leases. We have less than 5% of the ag operating lease portfolio would be what we deem short-term lease, 12 months or less where you got 22% of production class equipment leases that would be in that view. We also lease a lot more used equipment in ag, which again in our view, is -- would reduce some of that risk. So about 42% of our ag portfolio is used equipment versus about 14% of construction -- I'm sorry, 3% of construction is used equipment. And probably the most important difference between those 2, similar to what we would talk about from a retail note perspective with the dealer reserve, on our operating leases, over half of the ag operating leases in the U.S. and Canada have some level of dealer guarantee on residual values, which provides obviously protection around any losses on residual value. More importantly, it drives a varying gauge dealer in the process when these leases come back or when equipment comes back off of lease. So again, very, very different portfolios. And I wouldn't say we're trying to imply anything when we talk about higher provisions or the value of used equipment other than the fact that they're holding steady. And if that continues, our risk on operating leases in ag are quite low. Now that's still a risk that we can maintain those used equipment prices. But at this point, that is holding well."

Any year that we enter, we would hope to gain some market share. We have a lot of new product that's entering the European market. We've been recognized from",318,"Yes, as you think about Europe, first, to the second part of that question, we certainly hope so. Any year that we enter, we would hope to gain some market share. We have a lot of new product that's entering the European market. We've been recognized from numerous trade shows with that innovation, Agritechnica as well as a number of shows since then, that we've received a variety of awards for that innovation. So again, some of those key products, we would certainly hope to gain some share. But if you think about in the short term with Europe, I would note that in the first part of the year that we're getting some benefit from France. They had a super amortization program, which does allow for some additional amortization of equipment in the early stages of the ownership which is providing some benefit for sales there. And we did see that increase in sales in France. Now that program is scheduled to end in mid-April. So -- and it's based on retail. So those would be tractors that would need to be sold to customers by mid-April. And so we are again seeing a bit of advantage from that. Outside of that, I think if you think about Europe, there, just overall, continue to be some headwind there with just like a lot of parts of the world with the lower commodity prices. Dairy is a significant market for the European farmer, and we continue to see pressure there. I think every quarter, we anticipate in the next 6 months for that to start to moderate, and each quarter, it kind of keeps getting pushed out. It seems to be holding on in the [indiscernible] in terms of the pressure on dairy right now for those farmers. But with that, I think I'm not sure I can add much more value beyond that. But appreciate the question."

With the announcement of our first quarter results, John Deere has started out 2016 on a profitable note. Our results, however, were lower than last year, reflecting the continuing impact of the downturn in the global firm economy and wea",2145,"Thank you, Tony. With the announcement of our first quarter results, John Deere has started out 2016 on a profitable note. Our results, however, were lower than last year, reflecting the continuing impact of the downturn in the global firm economy and weakness in construction equipment markets. 
All of Deere's businesses remained solidly profitable for the quarter. This shows our continuing progress managing costs and creating a more flexible, responsive cost structure. We also lowered our annual guidance for both sales and earnings, with most of the change due to foreign currency and weaker markets in construction equipment. 
Now let's take a closer look at our first quarter results in detail, beginning on Slide 3. Net sales and revenues were down 13% to $5.525 billion. Net income attributable to Deere & Company was $254 million. EPS was $0.80 in the quarter.
On Slide 4, total worldwide equipment operations net sales were down 15% to $4.8 billion. Price realization in the quarter was positive by 2 points. Currency translation was negative by 4 points. In comparison with our previous net sales guidance of down about 11%, the difference is largely attributable to lower sale volumes for Agriculture & Turf equipment. 
Turning to our review of our individual businesses, let's start with Agriculture & Turf on Slide 5. Net sales were down 12% in the quarter-over-quarter comparison. The decrease was mostly due to lower shipment volumes of large ag equipment in United States and Brazil. Partially offsetting these declines were higher sales in Europe. 
Foreign currency exchange had a negative impact on sales as well, largely driven by the euro and Brazilian real. Operating profit was $144 million, down from $268 million last year. The decrease in operating profit was primarily driven by lower shipment volumes, unfavorable foreign currency exchange and a less favorable product mix. These factors were partially offset by price realization, lower selling, administrative and general expenses and lower production costs. The division's decremental margin in the quarter was about 26%. 
Before we review the industry sales outlook, let's look at fundamentals affecting the Ag business. Slide 6 outlines U.S. farm cash receipts. Given the record crop harvest for the last 3 years and the resulting lower commodity prices, our estimate for 2015 cash receipts is now down about 10% from 2014's peak levels. Our 2016 forecast contemplates total cash receipts to be about $381 billion, down slightly from 2015.
On Slide 7, grain stocks-to-use ratios remain at somewhat sensitive levels on a global basis, even after the abundant harvest of the past 3 years. Global grain and oilseed demand remains strong while supply is now fully adequate. Even so, unfavorable growing conditions in any key region of the world as well as unknown impacts from any geopolitical tension could result in prices quickly moving higher. 
Our economic outlook for the EU 28 is on Slide 8. Economic growth is improving at a moderate base. Farm income remains below the long-term average, and weakness persists in the dairy sector. As a result, we're expecting lower industry farm machinery demand in the EU region.
On Slide 9, you'll see the economic fundamentals outlined for China and India. Because of the economic slowdown in China, we continue to anticipate lower industry sales. While the government support of mechanization is helping this sector, changes in government subsidies are causing uncertainty.
Turning to India. The government continues providing assistance to the ag sector, with programs such as minimum support prices for commodities. Although the region has experienced 2 consecutive below-normal monsoon seasons, our forecast calls for a modest rebound in industry sales in 2016.
Shifting to Brazil. Slide 10 illustrates the crop value of agricultural production, a good proxy for the health of agribusiness there. Ag production is expected to decrease about 2% in 2016 in U.S. dollar terms due to lower global commodity prices. The situation, however, is more positive in local currency due to the devaluation of the real. Brazilian farmer profitability remains at good levels as crops are sold in dollars. 
Although ag fundamentals remain positive, farmer confidence is low due to economic and political concerns, growing inflation and uncertainty over government-sponsored financing programs, all of which are leading to lower equipment sales. In spite of these short-term concerns, the long-term fundamentals for our ag business in Brazil remain strong. 
Our 2016 Ag & Turf industry outlooks are summarized on Slide 11. You'll note there are no changes from the guidance provided last quarter. Low commodity prices and stagnant farm income in the U.S. and Canada are continuing to pressure demand for farm equipment, with the decline being most pronounced in the sale of high-horsepower models. 
Our forecast for industry sales in the U.S. and Canada remains down 15% to 20%, with large ag equipment sales down 25% to 30%. The EU 28 industry outlook remains flat to down 5% in 2016 due to low crop prices and farm incomes as well as continued pressure on the dairy sector. 
In South America, industry sales of tractors and combines are projected to be down 10% to 15% in 2016. 
Shifting to Asia, sales are expected to be flat to down slightly due in part to weakness in China. 
Turning to another product category, industry retail sales of turf and utility equipment in the U.S. and Canada are projected to be flat to up 5% in 2016, benefiting from new products and general economic growth. 
Putting this all together on Slide 12, fiscal year 2016 Deere sales of worldwide Ag & Turf equipment are now forecast to be down about 10%. This includes about 4 points of negative currency translation. The deterioration in our forecast is driven almost entirely by foreign currency exchange. Ag & Turf division operating margin is forecast to be about 7% in 2016, unchanged from the previous forecast. The implied decremental margin for the year is about 23%. 
Now let's focus on Construction & Forestry. Net sales were down 23% in the quarter as a result of lower shipment volumes and unfavorable foreign currency exchange, partially offset by price realization. Operating profit was $70 million in the quarter, down from $146 million last year. The decrease was driven by lower shipment volumes, partially offset by price realization and lower selling, administrative and general expenses. The division's decremental margin was about 21%.
Moving to Slide 14. Looking at the economic indicators at the bottom part of the slide, GDP growth is positive, construction spending is up from 2015 levels and housing starts are expected to exceed 1.2 million units this year. In spite of these encouraging signs, the industry is operating at a slow pace. 
Contributing factors are weak conditions in the North American energy sector and the movement of equipment from energy-producing regions to other parts of the country. 
Rental utilization rates continue to decline. Economic growth outside the United States is sluggish, and the mix of housing starts in the U.S. is skewed to multifamily homes, reducing demand for earthmoving equipment. As a result, Deere's Construction & Forestry sales are now forecast to be down about 11% in 2016. 
The change from our previous forecast is largely driven by lower sales in the United States and Canada and the negative foreign exchange effect of about 1 point. The forecast for global forestry markets remains down 5% to 10% from the strong levels we've experienced in recent years, primarily as a result of lower sales in the U.S. and Canada. C&F's full year operating margin is now projected to be about 7%. The implied decremental margin for the year is about 27%. 
Let's move now to our Financial Services operations. Slide 15 shows the annualized provision for credit losses as a percent of the average owned portfolio. At the end of January, it was 8 basis points, reflecting the continued excellent quality of our portfolios. The financial forecast for 2016 contemplates a loss provision of about 19 basis points. Even so, this puts the year's losses below the 10-year average of 26 basis points and well below the 15-year average of 39 basis points.
Moving to Slide 16. Worldwide Financial Services net income attributable to Deere & Company was $129 million in the first quarter versus $157 million last year. The lower results were primarily due to the unfavorable effects of foreign currency exchange translation, higher losses on residual values primarily for construction equipment operating leases, less favorable financing spreads and a higher provision for credit losses. These were partially offset by lower selling, administrative and general expenses.
2016 net income attributable to Deere & Company is now forecast to be about $525 million, which is down from last year. The outlook reflects less favorable financing spreads and increased provision for credit losses and the negative effects of currency exchange translation. Remember that 2015 results benefited from a gain on the sale of the crop insurance business of about $30 million.
Before we move on to receivables and inventory, let's discuss the losses on residual values noted in the earnings release that affected the quarter's results. A majority of the losses were due to impairment charges for construction equipment. The losses were mainly related to short-term leases of production class equipment. We continue to closely monitor the leasing portfolio, adjust residual values on the existing portfolio as needed and take appropriate actions on new contracts to ensure we are mitigating future risk.
Slide 17 outlines receivables and inventory. For the company as a whole, receivables and inventories ended the quarter down $205 million. We expect to end 2016 with total receivables and inventory down about $550 million with reductions from both divisions. 
2016 guidance for cost of sales as a percent of net sales shown on Slide 18 is about 79%, unchanged from last quarter. When modeling 2016, keep these unfavorable impacts in mind: unfavorable product mix, Tier 4 product costs and overhead spend. On the favorable side, we expect price realization of about 2 points, favorable raw material costs, lower pension and OPEB expense and lower incentive compensation expense.
Now let's look at a few housekeeping items. With respect to R&D expense on Slide 19, R&D was down 4% in the first quarter, including about 2 points of negative currency translation. Our 2016 forecast calls for R&D to be down about 3%, with about 1 point of negative currency translation.
Moving now to Slide 20. SA&G expense for the equipment operations was down 11% in the first quarter, with currency translation, incentive compensation and pension and OPEB accounting for about 8 points of the change. Our 2016 forecast contemplates SA&G expense being down about 4%. The same factors just cited for the quarter also account for about 6 points for the full year change.
Turning to Slide 21. Pension and OPEB expense was down $44 million for the quarter and is forecasted to be down about $200 million for the full year, unchanged from the previous forecast. 
On Slide 22, the equipment operations tax rate was 20% in the quarter, primarily due to discrete items. While it's not our practice to provide specifics on discrete items, I would point out the R&D tax credit was extended for 2015 during the quarter. For 2016, the full year effective tax rate is forecast to be in the range of 33% to 35%.
Slide 23 shows our equipment operations history of strong cash flow. Cash flow from the equipment operations is now forecast to be about $2.1 billion in 2016. The reduction from our previous guidance is largely attributable to the forecasted change in working capital and lower net income. 
The company's second quarter financial outlook is on Slide 24. Net sales for the quarter are forecast to be down about 8% compared with 2015. This includes about 2 points of price realization and unfavorable currency translation of about 3 points.
Turning to Slide 25 and the full year outlook. Our forecast now calls for net sales to be down about 10%. Price realization is expected to be positive by about 2 points. Currency translation is negative by about 3 points. Finally, our full year 2016 net income forecast is now about $1.3 billion. 
In closing, although Deere expects another challenging year in 2016, our forecast represents a level of performance that is much better than we have experienced in previous downturns. This illustrates the continuing impact of our efforts to establish a more durable business model and a wider range of revenue sources. 
At the same time, Deere's financial condition remains strong, and the company is continuing to forecast a healthy level of cash flow this year.

So if you think about inventory, and some may have noticed kind of along that line with the receivables and inventory forecast, that it is -- it did change and the reduction is actually a little lower from what we had in original budget. And I would point out, first of all, that's really more related to changes in small ag. So if you look at large ag, the forecast is change in dealer receivables is really very, very similar, very much in line with what we had in the original budget. 
Used equipment, we continue to make progress. It's still -- as we talked about previously, there's still a lot of work there, especially on large tractors. I think last time we talked about, down 18% roughly from kind of the highs that were set in 2014. Today, we would put large ag used at about 23% lower. So again, continuing to make some good progress there. Maybe as importantly, as we bring that down, used pricing on our large ag equipment is remaining steady. So again, continuing to make progress, but those efforts will certainly continue through 2016."

We've also talked in our forecast for R&D, while down a bit, is not a lever we pulled significantly hard at this point. And again, that's trying to take a long-term view. So depending on if our perspective changes in terms of the length of this downturn, that would be certainly an area we would continue to be able to pull levers. I would note from original budget, our SA&G forecast has come down further in terms of what we're forecasting. That's an area we continue to look at and attempt to identify costs that can come out. And as those are identified, we'll add those into the forecast. So again, it's -- I don't want to imply, however, that we have the same type of leverage that we would have had coming off of the peak. Obviously, we're already at very low levels so our ability to pull costs out relative to any further sales declines will be more challenging. We've been pretty open about that. This year, fortunately, with incrementals or decrementals, as the case may be, early gotten some benefits from those, the pension and OPEB change and some other factors and lower material costs, those sort of things.

And we've talked about our cash use priorities several times in the past. They remain the same, okay? So our highest priority is our single A rating. We are maintaining a strong balance sheet and ample liquidity. And maintaining access to attractive funding sources is even more important during a downturn like right now. So next priority is organic and inorganic investments. That will benefit the company in the long term. And we are, as Tony mentioned, continuing to invest in R&D, especially with a focus on innovation. And we take a long-term view with respect to inorganic options. And we have discussions over multiple years sometimes with inorganic options. They're aligned with our strategy. So we recently announced 2 acquisitions. One was Monosem based in France. The other was Precision Planting based in the U.S., and we will use about $325 million of cash for just those 2. The next priority is dividends, and our goal is to keep dividends at about 25% to 35% of mid-cycle earnings. And we'll maintain our dividends even through difficult downturns. And finally, share repurchases are a residual use of cash and deployed only half the distance so intrinsic value is significant, so it's beneficial to our longer-term shareholders. When the distance intrinsic value makes repurchases attractive now, higher priorities will obviously take precedence. So the other point I'll make is you may recall that quarter 1 is typically a significant user of cash on the operations side, okay? So if you put all those together, I think that's a summary of thought -- that our thought is on the cash."

So you'll see some improved sales as you go kind of through the year but really nothing beyond, again, a typical seasonality. So with Ag & Turf again, you get some better clarity as you go through the year. We talked about some higher level of impact of FX as well. That certainly -- FX tends to, from a decremental perspective, provide a little bit of benefit and boost of decremental.

So always remember that versus large ag in the U.S. and Canada, where we do have the best visibility from an order book perspective. So there's certainly, I would say, continued to risk in South America and potential opportunity. I would say you have both. So risk, Brazil continues -- while the farmers in Brazil continue to operate at a very profitable level because of the fact that they do sell their commodities in U.S. dollars so the FX is benefiting them. But the overall government concerns remain. The FINAMI financing there appears to have stabilized somewhat. The [indiscernible] is back in place and the funding appears to be in place for that as well. We've heard some positive comments from government officials regarding their commitment to that. But again, there's always risk. And remember, their fiscal year ends in June. And so what happens with the FINAMI financing and other supports beyond June would continue to be a question as well. Now on the flip side, you have Argentina, where we would argue, there's potential upside opportunity there. If the reforms continue to progress and if those reforms are fully implemented such that we have the ability not just to import but also export and so on, we think that could be a really good opportunity for us. You may have heard when we were out traveling with Sam, the fact that this is a very profitable market for us. And so the opportunity to sell more product into Argentina would certainly be beneficial for us. So there are a lot of puts and takes as you think about South America. But all in all, the industry outlook, again, remember that time on tractors and combines remains unchanged. And so that's really not much changed in our current view of what that market may look like."

And certainly, we say overall, and I'll tell you, really no change from last quarter. Overall, they're in good shape. Now there are some -- we couldn't say that for every dealer. I mean, we have some dealers where we wouldn't be comfortable with the level of pool funds they have relative to the equipment that's on their lots. We are seeing dealers shifting the use of those more towards the retail sale portion. As you may be aware, they can use those funds both to provide low or no interest wholesale funding while that inventory is on their lot, or they can also use it towards various incentives. I think the part of the reason why used pricing is staying high, a, that's historically how Deere equipment has responded in this type of environment. And b, some of those incentives aren't focused on simply reducing the purchase price. So we're looking at things like lower rate financing opportunities, providing additional warranty on the equipment, those sorts of things that provide incentives to the customer without degrading the purchase price, if you will. So again, we did see, and I want to be clear when we came into the downturn, we did see some small decreases in used pricing, but they have held very firm at those kind of small single-digit type of declines, at least today. So we are pleased with that aspect."

So -- but I just want to clarify that because again, our -- while used equipment prices have held firm, they did -- from that initial decline, we did see some initial decline. And so when you look at losses on return leases, keeping in mind the average new equipment, the average lease term is around 3 years, and used has actually moved to that. It used to be a little bit further out. So most of the lease returns that are coming back today would have been written 3 years ago, at least on average. So you're still in kind of the height of the market. So recoveries aren't as high as what they would have been historically. They're still very, very strong, but we're still seeing a little bit of a decline in the recovery rate on the ag equipment coming in. But I wouldn't imply anything beyond that. Certainly, from a provision increase, a lot of those increases come from things like a revolving credit portfolio, which is where you tend to see some responsiveness early on, not just the ag portfolio. So those are the things that are really driving those higher level of provisions in the forecast. 
The other thing I'd be quick to point out is, they're higher, but they're higher off of his story. As you know, very, very low level. And if -- let's just say that forecast is dead on and we hit 19 basis points this year, that's still a very attractive level for any portfolio to be maintaining in this type of an environment with the provision on credit losses. So again, we feel very good about the strength of the farmer and their ability to continue to pay for the equipment they have financed with us."

I mean, if -- yes, there are some losses in the forecast, but we're not talking about -- especially when you put it relative to the size of that portfolio. I mean, you look at those portfolios, ag or construction, as we talked about, is more than 2/3 of the impairment charges that we took in the quarter. And the size of the portfolio is significantly smaller. And so again, I think that's the key difference. And I wouldn't extrapolate any of what we're talking about on construction towards ag. There are significant differences in those portfolios between ag and construction on our leasing. So you think about things like the term of the leases. Most of the losses we're seeing in the impairment before taking for construction are about short-term leases. We have less than 5% of the ag operating lease portfolio would be what we would deem as short-term lease, 12 months or less, where you've got 22% of production class equipment leases that would be in that view. We also lease a lot more used equipment in ag which, again, in our view, is -- would reduce some of that risk. So about 42% of our ag portfolio is used equipment versus about 14% of construction. I'm sorry, 3% of construction is used equipment. And probably the most important difference between those 2, similar to what we would talk about from a retail note perspective with the dealer reserve, on our operating leases, over half of the ag operating leases in the U.S. and Canada have some level of dealer guarantee on the residual values, which provides, obviously, protection around any losses on residual value. More importantly, it drives a very engaged dealer in the process when these leases come back or when equipment comes back off of lease. So again, very, very different portfolios, and I wouldn't say we're trying to imply anything when we talk about higher provisions or the value of used equipment other than the fact that they're holding steady. And if that continues, our risk on operating leases in ag are quite low. Now that's -- it's still a risk that we can maintain those used equipment prices, but at this point, that is holding it well."

We have a lot of new product that's entering the European market. We've been recognized from numerous trade shows with that innovation, with Agritechnica as well as a number of shows since then that we've received a variety of awards for that innovation. So again, especially in some of those key products, we would certainly hope to gain some share. 
But if you think about in the short term with Europe, yes, I would note that in the first part of the year, that we're getting some benefit from France. They had a [indiscernible] through the super amortization program, which does allow for some additional amortization of the equipment in the early stages of the ownership, which is providing some benefit for sales there. And we did see that increase in sales in France. Now that program is scheduled to end in mid-April. So -- and it's based on retail. So those would be tractors that would need to be sold to customers by mid-April. And so we are again seeing a bit of advantage from that. 
Outside of that, I think if you think about Europe, there does, overall, continue to be some headwind there with just like a lot of parts of the world with the lower commodity prices. Dairy is a significant market for the European farmer, and we continue to see pressure there. I think every quarter, we anticipate in the next 6 months for that to start to moderate. And each quarter, it kind of keeps getting pushed out. It seems to be holding on in the stubborn land in terms of the pressure on dairy right now for those farmers. But with that, I think that's the -- I'm not sure I can add much more value beyond that, but I appreciate the question."

With the announcement of our first quarter results, John Deere has started out 2016 on a profitable note.

With the announcement of our first quarter results, John Deere has started out 2016 on a profitable note. Our results, however, were lower than last year, reflecting the continuing impact of the downturn in the global farm economy and weakness in construction equipment markets. 
All of Deere's businesses remained solidly profitable for the quarter. This shows our continuing progress managing costs and creating a more flexible, responsive cost structure. We also lowered our annual guidance for both sales and earnings, with most of the change due to foreign currency and weaker markets in construction equipment. 
Now let's take a closer look at our first quarter results in detail, beginning on Slide 3. Net sales and revenues were down 13% to $5.525 billion. Net income attributable to Deere & Company was $254 million. EPS was $0.80 in the quarter.
On Slide 4, total worldwide equipment operations net sales were down 15% to $4.8 billion. Price realization in the quarter was positive by 2 points. Currency translation was negative by 4 points. In comparison with our previous net sales guidance of down about 11%, the difference is largely attributable to lower sale volumes for Agriculture & Turf equipment. 
Turning to a review of our individual businesses, let's start with Agriculture & Turf on Slide 5. Net sales were down 12% in the quarter-over-quarter comparison. The decrease was mostly due to lower shipment volumes of large ag equipment in United States and Brazil. Partially offsetting these declines were higher sales in Europe. 
Foreign currency exchange had a negative impact on sales as well, largely driven by the euro and Brazilian real. Operating profit was $144 million, down from $268 million last year. The decrease in operating profit was primarily driven by lower shipment volumes, unfavorable foreign currency exchange and a less favorable product mix. These factors were partially offset by price realization, lower selling, administrative and general expenses and lower production costs. The division's decremental margin in the quarter was about 26%. 
Before we review the industry sales outlook, let's look at fundamentals affecting the Ag business. Slide 6 outlines U.S. farm cash receipts. Given the record crop harvests of the last 3 years and the resulting lower commodity prices, our estimate for 2015 cash receipts is now down about 10% from 2014's peak levels. Our 2016 forecast contemplates total cash receipts to be about $381 billion, down slightly from 2015.
On Slide 7, grain stocks-to-use ratios remain at somewhat sensitive levels on a global basis, even after the abundant harvests of the past 3 years. Global grain and oilseed demand remains strong while supplies are now fully adequate. Even so, unfavorable growing conditions in any key region of the world as well as unknown impacts from any geopolitical tensions could result in prices quickly moving higher. 
Our economic outlook for the EU 28 is on Slide 8. Economic growth is improving at a moderate pace. Farm income remains below the long-term average, and weakness persists in the dairy sector. As a result, we're expecting lower industry farm machinery demand in the EU region.
On Slide 9, you'll see the economic fundamentals outlined for China and India. Because of the economic slowdown in China, we continue to anticipate lower industry sales. While the government support of mechanization is helping the sector, changes in government subsidies are causing uncertainty.
Turning to India. The government continues providing assistance to the ag sector, with programs such as minimum support prices for commodities. Although the region has experienced 2 consecutive below-normal monsoon seasons, our forecast calls for a modest rebound in industry sales in 2016.
Shifting to Brazil. Slide 10 illustrates the crop value of agricultural production, a good proxy for the health of agribusiness there. Ag production is expected to decrease about 2% in 2016 in U.S. dollar terms due to lower global commodity prices. The situation, however, is more positive in local currency due to the devaluation of the real. Brazilian farmer profitability remains at good levels as crops are sold in dollars. 
Although ag fundamentals remain positive, farmer confidence is low due to economic and political concerns, growing inflation and uncertainty over government-sponsored financing programs, all of which are leading to lower equipment sales. In spite of these short-term concerns, the long-term fundamentals for our ag business in Brazil remain strong. 
Our 2016 Ag & Turf industry outlooks are summarized on Slide 11. You'll note there are no changes from the guidance provided last quarter. Low commodity prices and stagnant farm incomes in the U.S. and Canada are continuing to pressure demand for farm equipment, with the decline being most pronounced in the sale of high-horsepower models. 
Our forecast for industry sales in the U.S. and Canada remains down 15% to 20%, with large ag equipment sales down 25% to 30%. The EU 28 industry outlook remains flat to down 5% in 2016 due to low crop prices and farm incomes as well as continued pressure on the dairy sector. 
In South America, industry sales of tractors and combines are projected to be down 10% to 15% in 2016. 
Shifting to Asia, sales are expected to be flat to down slightly due in part to weakness in China. 
Turning to another product category, industry retail sales of turf and utility equipment in the U.S. and Canada are projected to be flat to up 5% in 2016, benefiting from new products and general economic growth. 
Putting this all together on Slide 12, fiscal year 2016 Deere sales of worldwide Ag & Turf equipment are now forecast to be down about 10%. This includes about 4 points of negative currency translation. The deterioration in our forecast is driven almost entirely by foreign currency exchange. Ag & Turf division operating margin is forecast to be about 7% in 2016, unchanged from the previous forecast. The implied decremental margin for the year is about 23%. 
Now let's focus on Construction & Forestry. Net sales were down 23% in the quarter as a result of lower shipment volumes and unfavorable foreign currency exchange, partially offset by price realization. Operating profit was $70 million in the quarter, down from $146 million last year. The decrease was driven by lower shipment volumes, partially offset by price realization and lower selling, administrative and general expenses. The division's decremental margin was about 21%.
Moving to Slide 14. Looking at the economic indicators at the bottom part of the slide, GDP growth is positive, construction spending is up from 2015 levels and housing starts are expected to exceed 1.2 million units this year. In spite of these encouraging signs, the industry is operating at a slow pace. 
Contributing factors are weak conditions in the North American energy sector and the movement of equipment from energy-producing regions to other parts of the country. 
Rental utilization rates continue to decline. Economic growth outside the United States is sluggish, and the mix of housing starts in the U.S. is skewed to multifamily homes, reducing demand for earthmoving equipment. As a result, Deere's Construction & Forestry sales are now forecast to be down about 11% in 2016. 
The change from our previous forecast is largely driven by lower sales in the United States and Canada and the negative foreign exchange effect of about 1 point. The forecast for global forestry markets remains down 5% to 10% from the strong levels we've experienced in recent years, primarily as a result of lower sales in the U.S. and Canada. C&F's full year operating margin is now projected to be about 7%. The implied decremental margin for the year is about 27%. 
Let's move now to our Financial Services operations. Slide 15 shows the annualized provision for credit losses as a percent of the average owned portfolio. At the end of January, it was 8 basis points, reflecting the continued excellent quality of our portfolios. The financial forecast for 2016 contemplates a loss provision of about 19 basis points. Even so, this will put the year's losses below the 10-year average of 26 basis points and well below the 15-year average of 39 basis points.
Moving to Slide 16. Worldwide Financial Services net income attributable to Deere & Company was $129 million in the first quarter versus $157 million last year. The lower results were primarily due to the unfavorable effects of foreign currency exchange translation, higher losses on residual values primarily for construction equipment operating leases, less favorable financing spreads and a higher provision for credit losses. These were partially offset by lower selling, administrative and general expenses.
2016 net income attributable to Deere & Company is now forecast to be about $525 million, which is down from last year. The outlook reflects less favorable financing spreads and increased provision for credit losses and the negative effects of currency exchange translation. Remember that 2015 results benefited from a gain on the sale of the crop insurance business of about $30 million.
Before we move on to receivables and inventory, let's discuss the losses on residual values noted in the earnings release that affected the quarter's results. A majority of the losses were due to impairment charges for construction equipment. The losses were mainly related to short-term leases of production class equipment. We continue to closely monitor the leasing portfolio, adjust residual values on the existing portfolio as needed and take appropriate actions on new contracts to ensure we are mitigating future risks.
Slide 17 outlines receivables and inventories. For the company as a whole, receivables and inventories ended the quarter down $205 million. We expect to end 2016 with total receivables and inventory down about $550 million with reductions from both divisions. 
2016 guidance for cost of sales as a percent of net sales shown on Slide 18 is about 79%, unchanged from last quarter. When modeling 2016, keep these unfavorable impacts in mind: unfavorable product mix, Tier 4 product costs and overhead spend. On the favorable side, we expect price realization of about 2 points, favorable raw material costs, lower pension and OPEB expense and lower incentive compensation expense.
Now let's look at a few housekeeping items. With respect to R&D expense on Slide 19, R&D was down 4% in the first quarter, including about 2 points of negative currency translation. Our 2016 forecast calls for R&D to be down about 3%, with about 1 point of negative currency translation.
Moving now to Slide 20. SA&G expense for the equipment operations was down 11% in the first quarter, with currency translation, incentive compensation and pension and OPEB accounting for about 8 points of the change. Our 2016 forecast contemplates SA&G expense being down about 4%. The same factors just cited for the quarter also account for about 6 points for the full year change.
Turning to Slide 21. Pension and OPEB expense was down $44 million for the quarter and is forecasted to be down about $200 million for the full year, unchanged from the previous forecast. 
On Slide 22, the equipment operations tax rate was 20% in the quarter, primarily due to discrete items. While it's not our practice to provide specifics on discrete items, I would point out the R&D tax credit was extended for 2015 during the quarter. For 2016, the full year effective tax rate is forecast to be in the range of 33% to 35%.
Slide 23 shows our equipment operations history of strong cash flow. Cash flow from the equipment operations is now forecast to be about $2.1 billion in 2016. The reduction from our previous guidance is largely attributable to the forecasted change in working capital and lower net income. 
The company's second quarter financial outlook is on Slide 24. Net sales for the quarter are forecast to be down about 8% compared with 2015. This includes about 2 points of price realization and unfavorable currency translation of about 3 points.
Turning to Slide 25 and the full year outlook. Our forecast now calls for net sales to be down about 10%. Price realization is expected to be positive by about 2 points. Currency translation is negative by about 3 points. Finally, our full year 2016 net income forecast is now about $1.3 billion. 
In closing, although Deere expects another challenging year in 2016, our forecast represents a level of performance that is much better than we have experienced in previous downturns. This illustrates the continuing impact of our efforts to establish a more durable business model and a wider range of revenue sources. 
At the same time, Deere's financial condition remains strong, and the company is continuing to forecast a healthy level of cash flow this year. As a result, we're well-positioned to continue looking to the future and making investments in innovative products, advanced technology and new markets. These actions we're confident will deliver significant value to our customers and investors in the years ahead. I'll now turn the call over to Tony."

So if you think about inventory, and some may have noticed kind of along that line with the receivables and inventory forecast, that it is -- it did change and the reduction is actually a little lower from what we had in original budget.

So if you think about inventory, and some may have noticed kind of along that line with the receivables and inventory forecast, that it is -- it did change and the reduction is actually a little lower from what we had in original budget. And I would point out, first of all, that's really more related to changes in small ag. So if you look at large ag, the forecasted change in dealer receivables is really very, very similar, very much in line with what we had in the original budget. 
Used equipment, we continue to make progress. It's still -- as we talked about previously, there's still a lot of work there, especially on large tractors. I think last time we talked about down 18%, roughly, from kind of the highs that were set in 2014. Today, we would put large ag used at about 23% lower. So again, continuing to make some good progress there. Maybe as importantly, as we bring that down used pricing on our large ag equipment is remaining steady. So again, continuing to make progress but those efforts will certainly continue through 2016."

So it does provide some additional flexibility, and we would have additional flexibility. 
We've also talked in our forecast for R&D, while down a bit, is not a lever we pulled significantly hard at this point. And again, that's trying to take a long-term view. So depending on if our perspective changes in terms of the length of this downturn, that would be certainly an area that we would continue to be able to pull levers. I would note, from original budget our SA&G forecast has come down further in terms of what we're forecasting. That's an area we continue to look at and attempt to identify costs that can come out. And as those are identified, we'll add those into the forecast. So again, it's -- I don't want to imply, however, that we have the same type of leverage that we would have had coming off of the peak. Obviously, we're already at very low levels, so our ability to pull costs out relative to any further sales declines will be more challenging. We've been pretty open about that. This year, fortunately, with incrementals or decrementals as the case may be, we've gotten some benefit from the pension and OPEB change and some other factors and lower material costs, those sorts of things. And so -- but still, I think it's demonstrating that we are very focused on cost management and doing an effective job to date. So..."

And we've talked about our cash use priorities several times in the past. They remain the same, okay? So our highest priority is our single A rating. We are maintaining a strong balance sheet and ample liquidity. And maintaining access to attractive funding sources is even more important during a downturn like right now. So next priority is organic and inorganic investments that will benefit the company in the long term. And we are, as Tony mentioned, continuing to invest in R&D, especially with a focus on innovation. And we take a long-term view with respect to inorganic options. And we have discussions over multiple years sometimes with inorganic options. They're aligned with our strategy. So we recently announced 2 acquisitions. One was Monosem based in France. The other was Precision Planting based in the U.S., and we will use about $325 million of cash for just those 2. The next priority is dividends, and our goal is to keep dividends at about 25% to 35% of mid-cycle earnings. And we'll maintain our dividends even through difficult downturns. And finally, share repurchases are a residual use of cash and deployed only if the distance from intrinsic value is significant, so it's beneficial to our longer-term shareholders. When the distance from intrinsic value makes repurchases attractive now, our higher priorities will obviously take precedence. So the other point I'll make is you may recall that quarter 1 is typically a significant user of cash on the operations side, okay? So if you put all those together, I think that's a summary of what our thought is on the cash."

I'm trying to reconcile the unchanged U.S. and Canada Ag & Turf outlook and the modifications you made to the commodity outlook in the appendix. In the appendix, you decreased the farm cash receipts projection for 2015 and '16 mostly due to livestock but also in the crop area. And then the net cash income projection for 2015 and 2016 dropped to about 8% and 16%, respectively. But despite all of that, you maintained U.S. and Canada end market view. I'm just wondering if you could help us understand why the reduced farm financial outlook really did not impact the end market view."

Most of that optimism, candidly, has been removed from the forecast. And so what we're forecasting today for construction is we'd say normal seasonality. So you'll see some improved sales as you go kind of through the year but really nothing beyond, again, a typical seasonality. So with Ag & Turf again, you get some better clarity as you go through the year. We talked about some higher level of impact of FX as well. That certainly -- FX tends to, from a decremental perspective, provide a little bit of benefit and boost of decremental.

So risk, Brazil continues -- while the farmers in Brazil continue to operate at a very profitable level because of the fact that they do sell their commodities in U.S. dollars so the FX is benefiting them. But the overall government concerns remain. The FINAMI financing there appears to have stabilized somewhat. So Moderfrota is back in place, and the funding appears to be in place for that as well. We've heard some positive comments from government officials regarding their commitment to that. But again, there's always risk. And remember, their fiscal year ends in June. And so what happens with the FINAMI financing and other supports beyond June would continue to be a question as well. Now on the flip side you have Argentina, where we would argue there's potential upside opportunity there. If the reforms continue to progress and if those reforms are fully implemented such that we have the ability not just to import but also export and so on, we think that could be a really good opportunity for us. You may have heard when we were out traveling with Sam, the fact that it is a very profitable market for us. And so the opportunity to sell more product into Argentina would certainly be beneficial for us. So there are a lot of puts and takes as you think about South America. But all in all, the industry outlook -- again, remember that's on tractors and combines remained unchanged.

I mean, we have some dealers where we wouldn't be comfortable with the level of pool funds they have relative to the equipment that's on their lots. We are seeing dealers shifting the use of those more towards the retail sale portion. As you may be aware, they can use those funds both to provide low or no interest wholesale funding while that inventory is on their lot, or they can also use it towards various incentives. I think the part of the reason why used pricing is staying high, a, that's historically how Deere equipment has responded in this type of environment. And b, some of those incentives aren't focused on simply reducing the purchase price. So we're looking at things like lower rate financing opportunities, providing additional warranty on the equipment, those sorts of things that provide incentives to the customer without degrading the purchase price, if you will. So again, we did see, and I want to be clear, when we came into the downturn we did see some small decreases in used pricing, but they have held very firm at those kind of small single-digit type of declines, at least to date.

So -- but I just want to clarify that because again, our -- while used equipment prices have held firm, they did -- from that initial decline, we did see some initial decline. And so when you look at losses on returned leases, keeping in mind the average for new equipment, the average lease term is around 3 years and used has actually moved to that. It used to be a little bit further out. So most of the lease returns that are coming back today would have been written 3 years ago, at least on average. So you're really still in kind of the height of the market. So recoveries aren't as high as what they would have been historically. They're still very, very strong, but we're still seeing a little bit of a decline in the recovery rate on the ag equipment coming in. But I wouldn't imply anything beyond that. Certainly, from a provision increase, a lot of those increases come from things like a revolving credit portfolio, which is where you tend to see some responsiveness early on, not just the ag portfolio. So those are the things that are really driving those higher level of provisions in the forecast. 
The other thing I'd be quick to point out is, they're higher, but they're higher off of historic -- as you know, very, very low level. And if -- let's just say that forecast is dead on and we hit 19 basis points this year, that's still a very attractive level for any portfolio to be maintaining in this type of an environment with the provision on credit losses. So again, we feel very good about the strength of the farmer and their ability to continue to pay for the equipment they have financed with us."

I'm trying to figure out if you feel used prices are now sequentially steady. If they stay at these levels, let's just say this is it. They're straightforward. What level of residual value risk or losses are baked into your guidance? Because obviously, you highlight the construction side today, and I appreciate that, but the used comment sequentially about pricing was interesting. I'm just trying to help everybody gauge, where are we? Because clearly, there are, as you've pointed out, not quite the recoveries of the past. Can you help us a bit in framing it?"

I mean, if -- yes, there are some losses in the forecast, but we're not talking about -- especially when you put it relative to the size of that portfolio. I mean, you look at those portfolios, ag -- or construction, as we talked about, is more than 2/3 of the impairment charges that we took in the quarter. And the size of the portfolio is significantly smaller. And so again, I think that's the key difference. And I wouldn't extrapolate any of what we're talking about from construction towards ag. There are significant differences in those portfolios between ag and construction on our leasing. So you think about things like the term of the leases. Most of the losses we're seeing in the impairments we're taking for construction are about short-term leases. We have less than 5% of the ag operating lease portfolio would be what we would deem a short-term lease, 12 months or less. Where you've got 22% of production class equipment leases that would be in that view. We also lease a lot more used equipment in ag which, again, in our view, is -- would reduce some of that risk. So about 42% of our ag portfolio is used equipment versus about 14% of construction -- I'm sorry, 3% of construction is used equipment. And probably the most important difference between those 2, similar to what we would talk about from a retail note perspective with the dealer reserve, on our operating leases, over half of the ag operating leases in the U.S. and Canada have some level of dealer guarantee on the residual values, which provides, obviously, protection around any losses on residual value. More importantly, it drives a very engaged dealer in the process when these leases come back -- or when equipment comes back off of lease. So again, very, very different portfolios, and I wouldn't say we're trying to imply anything when we talk about higher provisions or the value of used equipment other than the fact that they're holding steady. And if that continues, our risk on operating leases in ag are quite low. Now that's -- it's still a risk that we can maintain those used equipment prices, but at this point, that is holding it well."

And any kind of product categories that are doing better or worse? And perhaps, is it possible for Deere itself to beat your overall market outlook for the year at all?"

We have a lot of new product that's entering the European market. We've been recognized from numerous trade shows with that innovation, with Agritechnica as well as a number of shows since then that we've received a variety of awards for that innovation. So again, especially in some of those key products, we would certainly hope to gain some share. 
But if you think about in the short term with Europe, I would note that in the first part of the year that we're getting some benefit from France. They had a -- what's been referred to as a super amortization program, which does allow for some additional amortization of the equipment in the early stages of the ownership, which is providing some benefit for sales there. And we did see that increase in sales in France. Now that program is scheduled to end in mid-April. So -- and it's based on retail. So those would be tractors that would need to be sold to customers by mid-April. And so we are, again, seeing a bit of advantage from that. 
Outside of that, I think if you think about Europe there does, overall, continue to be some headwind there with just like a lot of parts of the world with the lower commodity prices. Dairy is a significant market for the European farmer, and we continue to see pressure there. I think every quarter we anticipate in the next 6 months for that to start to moderate. And each quarter it kind of keeps getting pushed out. It seems to be holding on in a stubborn way in terms of the pressure on dairy right now for those farmers. But with that, I think that's the -- I'm not sure I can add much more value beyond that. But I appreciate the question."

With the announcement of our first quarter results, John Deere has started out 2016 on a profitable note. Our results, however, were lower than last year, reflecting the continuing impact of the downturn in the global farm economy and wea",2146,"Thank you, Tony. With the announcement of our first quarter results, John Deere has started out 2016 on a profitable note. Our results, however, were lower than last year, reflecting the continuing impact of the downturn in the global farm economy and weakness in construction equipment markets. 
All of Deere's businesses remained solidly profitable for the quarter. This shows our continuing progress managing costs and creating a more flexible, responsive cost structure. We also lowered our annual guidance for both sales and earnings, with most of the change due to foreign currency and weaker markets in construction equipment. 
Now let's take a closer look at our first quarter results in detail, beginning on Slide 3. Net sales and revenues were down 13% to $5.525 billion. Net income attributable to Deere & Company was $254 million. EPS was $0.80 in the quarter.
On Slide 4, total worldwide equipment operations net sales were down 15% to $4.8 billion. Price realization in the quarter was positive by 2 points. Currency translation was negative by 4 points. In comparison with our previous net sales guidance of down about 11%, the difference is largely attributable to lower sale volumes for Agriculture & Turf equipment. 
Turning to a review of our individual businesses, let's start with Agriculture & Turf on Slide 5. Net sales were down 12% in the quarter-over-quarter comparison. The decrease was mostly due to lower shipment volumes of large ag equipment in United States and Brazil. Partially offsetting these declines were higher sales in Europe. 
Foreign currency exchange had a negative impact on sales as well, largely driven by the euro and Brazilian real. Operating profit was $144 million, down from $268 million last year. The decrease in operating profit was primarily driven by lower shipment volumes, unfavorable foreign currency exchange and a less favorable product mix. These factors were partially offset by price realization, lower selling, administrative and general expenses and lower production costs. The division's decremental margin in the quarter was about 26%. 
Before we review the industry sales outlook, let's look at fundamentals affecting the Ag business. Slide 6 outlines U.S. farm cash receipts. Given the record crop harvests of the last 3 years and the resulting lower commodity prices, our estimate for 2015 cash receipts is now down about 10% from 2014's peak levels. Our 2016 forecast contemplates total cash receipts to be about $381 billion, down slightly from 2015.
On Slide 7, grain stocks-to-use ratios remain at somewhat sensitive levels on a global basis, even after the abundant harvests of the past 3 years. Global grain and oilseed demand remains strong while supplies are now fully adequate. Even so, unfavorable growing conditions in any key region of the world as well as unknown impacts from any geopolitical tensions could result in prices quickly moving higher. 
Our economic outlook for the EU 28 is on Slide 8. Economic growth is improving at a moderate pace. Farm income remains below the long-term average, and weakness persists in the dairy sector. As a result, we're expecting lower industry farm machinery demand in the EU region.
On Slide 9, you'll see the economic fundamentals outlined for China and India. Because of the economic slowdown in China, we continue to anticipate lower industry sales. While the government support of mechanization is helping the sector, changes in government subsidies are causing uncertainty.
Turning to India. The government continues providing assistance to the ag sector, with programs such as minimum support prices for commodities. Although the region has experienced 2 consecutive below-normal monsoon seasons, our forecast calls for a modest rebound in industry sales in 2016.
Shifting to Brazil. Slide 10 illustrates the crop value of agricultural production, a good proxy for the health of agribusiness there. Ag production is expected to decrease about 2% in 2016 in U.S. dollar terms due to lower global commodity prices. The situation, however, is more positive in local currency due to the devaluation of the real. Brazilian farmer profitability remains at good levels as crops are sold in dollars. 
Although ag fundamentals remain positive, farmer confidence is low due to economic and political concerns, growing inflation and uncertainty over government-sponsored financing programs, all of which are leading to lower equipment sales. In spite of these short-term concerns, the long-term fundamentals for our ag business in Brazil remain strong. 
Our 2016 Ag & Turf industry outlooks are summarized on Slide 11. You'll note there are no changes from the guidance provided last quarter. Low commodity prices and stagnant farm incomes in the U.S. and Canada are continuing to pressure demand for farm equipment, with the decline being most pronounced in the sale of high-horsepower models. 
Our forecast for industry sales in the U.S. and Canada remains down 15% to 20%, with large ag equipment sales down 25% to 30%. The EU 28 industry outlook remains flat to down 5% in 2016 due to low crop prices and farm incomes as well as continued pressure on the dairy sector. 
In South America, industry sales of tractors and combines are projected to be down 10% to 15% in 2016. 
Shifting to Asia, sales are expected to be flat to down slightly due in part to weakness in China. 
Turning to another product category, industry retail sales of turf and utility equipment in the U.S. and Canada are projected to be flat to up 5% in 2016, benefiting from new products and general economic growth. 
Putting this all together on Slide 12, fiscal year 2016 Deere sales of worldwide Ag & Turf equipment are now forecast to be down about 10%. This includes about 4 points of negative currency translation. The deterioration in our forecast is driven almost entirely by foreign currency exchange. Ag & Turf division operating margin is forecast to be about 7% in 2016, unchanged from the previous forecast. The implied decremental margin for the year is about 23%. 
Now let's focus on Construction & Forestry. Net sales were down 23% in the quarter as a result of lower shipment volumes and unfavorable foreign currency exchange, partially offset by price realization. Operating profit was $70 million in the quarter, down from $146 million last year. The decrease was driven by lower shipment volumes, partially offset by price realization and lower selling, administrative and general expenses. The division's decremental margin was about 21%.
Moving to Slide 14. Looking at the economic indicators at the bottom part of the slide, GDP growth is positive, construction spending is up from 2015 levels and housing starts are expected to exceed 1.2 million units this year. In spite of these encouraging signs, the industry is operating at a slow pace. 
Contributing factors are weak conditions in the North American energy sector and the movement of equipment from energy-producing regions to other parts of the country. 
Rental utilization rates continue to decline. Economic growth outside the United States is sluggish, and the mix of housing starts in the U.S. is skewed to multifamily homes, reducing demand for earthmoving equipment. As a result, Deere's Construction & Forestry sales are now forecast to be down about 11% in 2016. 
The change from our previous forecast is largely driven by lower sales in the United States and Canada and the negative foreign exchange effect of about 1 point. The forecast for global forestry markets remains down 5% to 10% from the strong levels we've experienced in recent years, primarily as a result of lower sales in the U.S. and Canada. C&F's full year operating margin is now projected to be about 7%. The implied decremental margin for the year is about 27%. 
Let's move now to our Financial Services operations. Slide 15 shows the annualized provision for credit losses as a percent of the average owned portfolio. At the end of January, it was 8 basis points, reflecting the continued excellent quality of our portfolios. The financial forecast for 2016 contemplates a loss provision of about 19 basis points. Even so, this will put the year's losses below the 10-year average of 26 basis points and well below the 15-year average of 39 basis points.
Moving to Slide 16. Worldwide Financial Services net income attributable to Deere & Company was $129 million in the first quarter versus $157 million last year. The lower results were primarily due to the unfavorable effects of foreign currency exchange translation, higher losses on residual values primarily for construction equipment operating leases, less favorable financing spreads and a higher provision for credit losses. These were partially offset by lower selling, administrative and general expenses.
2016 net income attributable to Deere & Company is now forecast to be about $525 million, which is down from last year. The outlook reflects less favorable financing spreads and increased provision for credit losses and the negative effects of currency exchange translation. Remember that 2015 results benefited from a gain on the sale of the crop insurance business of about $30 million.
Before we move on to receivables and inventory, let's discuss the losses on residual values noted in the earnings release that affected the quarter's results. A majority of the losses were due to impairment charges for construction equipment. The losses were mainly related to short-term leases of production class equipment. We continue to closely monitor the leasing portfolio, adjust residual values on the existing portfolio as needed and take appropriate actions on new contracts to ensure we are mitigating future risks.
Slide 17 outlines receivables and inventories. For the company as a whole, receivables and inventories ended the quarter down $205 million. We expect to end 2016 with total receivables and inventory down about $550 million with reductions from both divisions. 
2016 guidance for cost of sales as a percent of net sales shown on Slide 18 is about 79%, unchanged from last quarter. When modeling 2016, keep these unfavorable impacts in mind: unfavorable product mix, Tier 4 product costs and overhead spend. On the favorable side, we expect price realization of about 2 points, favorable raw material costs, lower pension and OPEB expense and lower incentive compensation expense.
Now let's look at a few housekeeping items. With respect to R&D expense on Slide 19, R&D was down 4% in the first quarter, including about 2 points of negative currency translation. Our 2016 forecast calls for R&D to be down about 3%, with about 1 point of negative currency translation.
Moving now to Slide 20. SA&G expense for the equipment operations was down 11% in the first quarter, with currency translation, incentive compensation and pension and OPEB accounting for about 8 points of the change. Our 2016 forecast contemplates SA&G expense being down about 4%. The same factors just cited for the quarter also account for about 6 points for the full year change.
Turning to Slide 21. Pension and OPEB expense was down $44 million for the quarter and is forecasted to be down about $200 million for the full year, unchanged from the previous forecast. 
On Slide 22, the equipment operations tax rate was 20% in the quarter, primarily due to discrete items. While it's not our practice to provide specifics on discrete items, I would point out the R&D tax credit was extended for 2015 during the quarter. For 2016, the full year effective tax rate is forecast to be in the range of 33% to 35%.
Slide 23 shows our equipment operations history of strong cash flow. Cash flow from the equipment operations is now forecast to be about $2.1 billion in 2016. The reduction from our previous guidance is largely attributable to the forecasted change in working capital and lower net income. 
The company's second quarter financial outlook is on Slide 24. Net sales for the quarter are forecast to be down about 8% compared with 2015. This includes about 2 points of price realization and unfavorable currency translation of about 3 points.
Turning to Slide 25 and the full year outlook. Our forecast now calls for net sales to be down about 10%. Price realization is expected to be positive by about 2 points. Currency translation is negative by about 3 points. Finally, our full year 2016 net income forecast is now about $1.3 billion. 
In closing, although Deere expects another challenging year in 2016, our forecast represents a level of performance that is much better than we have experienced in previous downturns. This illustrates the continuing impact of our efforts to establish a more durable business model and a wider range of revenue sources. 
At the same time, Deere's financial condition remains strong, and the company is continuing to forecast a healthy level of cash flow this year. As a result, we're well-positioned to continue looking to the future and making investments in innovative products, advanced technology and new markets. These actions we're confident will deliver significant value to our customers and investors in the years ahead. I'll now turn the call over to Tony."

So if you think about inventory, and some may have noticed kind of along that line with the receivables and inventory forecast, that it is -- it did change and the reduction is actually a little lower from what we had in original budget. And I would point out, first of all, that's really more related to changes in small ag. So if you look at large ag, the forecasted change in dealer receivables is really very, very similar, very much in line with what we had in the original budget. Used equipment, we continue to make progress. It's still -- as we talked about previously, there's still a lot of work there, especially on large tractors. I think last time we talked about down 18%, roughly, from kind of the highs that were set in 2014. Today, we would put large ag used at about 23% lower. So again, continuing to make some good progress there. Maybe as importantly, as we bring that down used pricing on our large ag equipment is remaining steady. So again, continuing to make progress but those efforts will certainly continue through 2016."

We've also talked in our forecast for R&D, while down a bit, is not a lever we pulled significantly hard at this point. And again, that's trying to take a long-term view. So depending on if our perspective changes in terms of the length of this downturn, that would be certainly an area that we would continue to be able to pull levers. I would note, from original budget our SA&G forecast has come down further in terms of what we're forecasting. That's an area we continue to look at and attempt to identify costs that can come out. And as those are identified, we'll add those into the forecast. So again, it's -- I don't want to imply, however, that we have the same type of leverage that we would have had coming off of the peak. Obviously, we're already at very low levels, so our ability to pull costs out relative to any further sales declines will be more challenging. We've been pretty open about that. This year, fortunately, with incrementals or decrementals as the case may be, we've gotten some benefit from the pension and OPEB change and some other factors and lower material costs, those sorts of things. And so -- but still, I think it's demonstrating that we are very focused on cost management and doing an effective job to date. So..."

And we've talked about our cash use priorities several times in the past. They remain the same, okay? So our highest priority is our single A rating. We are maintaining a strong balance sheet and ample liquidity. And maintaining access to attractive funding sources is even more important during a downturn like right now. So next priority is organic and inorganic investments that will benefit the company in the long term. And we are, as Tony mentioned, continuing to invest in R&D, especially with a focus on innovation. And we take a long-term view with respect to inorganic options. And we have discussions over multiple years sometimes with inorganic options. They're aligned with our strategy. So we recently announced 2 acquisitions. One was Monosem based in France. The other was Precision Planting based in the U.S., and we will use about $325 million of cash for just those 2. The next priority is dividends, and our goal is to keep dividends at about 25% to 35% of mid-cycle earnings. And we'll maintain our dividends even through difficult downturns. And finally, share repurchases are a residual use of cash and deployed only if the distance from intrinsic value is significant, so it's beneficial to our longer-term shareholders. When the distance from intrinsic value makes repurchases attractive now, our higher priorities will obviously take precedence. So the other point I'll make is you may recall that quarter 1 is typically a significant user of cash on the operations side, okay? So if you put all those together, I think that's a summary of what our thought is on the cash."

So with Ag & Turf again, you get some better clarity as you go through the year. We talked about some higher level of impact of FX as well.

So always remember that versus large ag in the U.S. and Canada, where we do have the best visibility from an order book perspective. So there's certainly, I would say, continued risk in South America and potential opportunity. I would say you have both. So risk, Brazil continues -- while the farmers in Brazil continue to operate at a very profitable level because of the fact that they do sell their commodities in U.S. dollars so the FX is benefiting them. But the overall government concerns remain. The FINAMI financing there appears to have stabilized somewhat. So Moderfrota is back in place, and the funding appears to be in place for that as well. We've heard some positive comments from government officials regarding their commitment to that. But again, there's always risk. And remember, their fiscal year ends in June. And so what happens with the FINAMI financing and other supports beyond June would continue to be a question as well. Now on the flip side you have Argentina, where we would argue there's potential upside opportunity there. If the reforms continue to progress and if those reforms are fully implemented such that we have the ability not just to import but also export and so on, we think that could be a really good opportunity for us. You may have heard when we were out traveling with Sam, the fact that it is a very profitable market for us. And so the opportunity to sell more product into Argentina would certainly be beneficial for us. So there are a lot of puts and takes as you think about South America. But all in all, the industry outlook -- again, remember that's on tractors and combines remained unchanged. And so that's really not much changed in our current view of what that market may look like."

I mean, we have some dealers where we wouldn't be comfortable with the level of pool funds they have relative to the equipment that's on their lots. We are seeing dealers shifting the use of those more towards the retail sale portion. As you may be aware, they can use those funds both to provide low or no interest wholesale funding while that inventory is on their lot, or they can also use it towards various incentives. I think the part of the reason why used pricing is staying high, a, that's historically how Deere equipment has responded in this type of environment. And b, some of those incentives aren't focused on simply reducing the purchase price. So we're looking at things like lower rate financing opportunities, providing additional warranty on the equipment, those sorts of things that provide incentives to the customer without degrading the purchase price, if you will. So again, we did see, and I want to be clear, when we came into the downturn we did see some small decreases in used pricing, but they have held very firm at those kind of small single-digit type of declines, at least to date. So we are pleased with that aspect."

So -- but I just want to clarify that because again, our -- while used equipment prices have held firm, they did -- from that initial decline, we did see some initial decline. And so when you look at losses on returned leases, keeping in mind the average for new equipment, the average lease term is around 3 years and used has actually moved to that. It used to be a little bit further out. So most of the lease returns that are coming back today would have been written 3 years ago, at least on average. So you're really still in kind of the height of the market. So recoveries aren't as high as what they would have been historically. They're still very, very strong, but we're still seeing a little bit of a decline in the recovery rate on the ag equipment coming in. But I wouldn't imply anything beyond that. Certainly, from a provision increase, a lot of those increases come from things like a revolving credit portfolio, which is where you tend to see some responsiveness early on, not just the ag portfolio. So those are the things that are really driving those higher level of provisions in the forecast. 
The other thing I'd be quick to point out is, they're higher, but they're higher off of historic -- as you know, very, very low level. And if -- let's just say that forecast is dead on and we hit 19 basis points this year, that's still a very attractive level for any portfolio to be maintaining in this type of an environment with the provision on credit losses. So again, we feel very good about the strength of the farmer and their ability to continue to pay for the equipment they have financed with us."

I mean, if -- yes, there are some losses in the forecast, but we're not talking about -- especially when you put it relative to the size of that portfolio. I mean, you look at those portfolios, ag -- or construction, as we talked about, is more than 2/3 of the impairment charges that we took in the quarter. And the size of the portfolio is significantly smaller. And so again, I think that's the key difference. And I wouldn't extrapolate any of what we're talking about from construction towards ag. There are significant differences in those portfolios between ag and construction on our leasing. So you think about things like the term of the leases. Most of the losses we're seeing in the impairments we're taking for construction are about short-term leases. We have less than 5% of the ag operating lease portfolio would be what we would deem a short-term lease, 12 months or less. Where you've got 22% of production class equipment leases that would be in that view. We also lease a lot more used equipment in ag which, again, in our view, is -- would reduce some of that risk. So about 42% of our ag portfolio is used equipment versus about 14% of construction -- I'm sorry, 3% of construction is used equipment. And probably the most important difference between those 2, similar to what we would talk about from a retail note perspective with the dealer reserve, on our operating leases, over half of the ag operating leases in the U.S. and Canada have some level of dealer guarantee on the residual values, which provides, obviously, protection around any losses on residual value. More importantly, it drives a very engaged dealer in the process when these leases come back -- or when equipment comes back off of lease. So again, very, very different portfolios, and I wouldn't say we're trying to imply anything when we talk about higher provisions or the value of used equipment other than the fact that they're holding steady. And if that continues, our risk on operating leases in ag are quite low. Now that's -- it's still a risk that we can maintain those used equipment prices, but at this point, that is holding it well."

We have a lot of new product that's entering the European market. We've been recognized from numerous trade shows with that innovation, with Agritechnica as well as a number of shows since then that we've received a variety of awards for that innovation. So again, especially in some of those key products, we would certainly hope to gain some share. But if you think about in the short term with Europe, I would note that in the first part of the year that we're getting some benefit from France. They had a -- what's been referred to as a super amortization program, which does allow for some additional amortization of the equipment in the early stages of the ownership, which is providing some benefit for sales there. And we did see that increase in sales in France. Now that program is scheduled to end in mid-April. So -- and it's based on retail. So those would be tractors that would need to be sold to customers by mid-April. And so we are, again, seeing a bit of advantage from that. Outside of that, I think if you think about Europe there does, overall, continue to be some headwind there with just like a lot of parts of the world with the lower commodity prices. Dairy is a significant market for the European farmer, and we continue to see pressure there. I think every quarter we anticipate in the next 6 months for that to start to moderate. And each quarter it kind of keeps getting pushed out. It seems to be holding on in a stubborn way in terms of the pressure on dairy right now for those farmers. But with that, I think that's the -- I'm not sure I can add much more value beyond that. But I appreciate the question."

John Deere's performance for the second quarter and first 6 months reflected the continuing impact of the downturn in the global farm economy as well as weakness in markets for construction equipment. Nevertheless, all our businesses remain profitable. They benefited from the sound execution of our operating plans, the strength of our broad product portfolio and our success establishing a more flexible cost structure. You may have also noted that we've made changes in our outlook for sales and profits for the full year. 
Now let's take a closer look at our second quarter results, beginning on Slide 3. Net sales and revenues were down 4% to $7.875 billion. Net income attributable to Deere & Company was $495 million. EPS was $1.56 in the quarter.
On Slide 4, total worldwide equipment operations net sales were down 4% to $7.1 billion. That's better than our previous net sales guidance of down about 8%. The higher sales of the quarter were largely due to timing differences of shipments between quarters mainly attributable to Agriculture & Turf equipment in North America and Brazil. Price realization in the quarter was positive by 1 point. Currency translation was negative by 2 points. 
Turning to a review of our individual businesses. Let's start with Agriculture & Turf on Slide 5. Net sales were flat in the quarter-over-quarter comparison. Foreign currency exchange had a negative impact on sales with the biggest impact coming from the Brazilian real. Partially offsetting this was positive price realization. Operating profit was $614 million, down from $639 million last year. The decrease in operating profit was primarily driven by unfavorable foreign currency exchange, lower shipment volumes and a less favorable product mix. These factors were partially offset by price realization, lower production costs and lower selling, administrative and general expenses. 
Before we review the industry sales outlook, let's look at the fundamentals affecting the ag business. Slide 6 outlines U.S. farm cash receipts. Given the record crop harvest of the last 3 [ph] years and the resulting lower commodity prices, our estimate for 2015 cash receipts remain down about 10% from 2014's peak levels. Our 2016 forecast contemplates total cash receipts to be about $375 billion, down only slightly from 2015. 
On Slide 7, grain stocks-to-use ratios remain at somewhat sensitive levels, even after the abundant harvest of the past 3 years. Global grain and oilseed demand continue to be strong, while supplies are now fully adequate. Even so, unfavorable growing conditions in any key region of the world as well as unknown impacts from any geopolitical tensions could result in prices quickly moving higher. 
Our economic outlook for the EU 28 is on Slide 8. Modest economic growth is continuing, however, the region is experiencing continued geopolitical risk such as the upcoming [indiscernible] referendum. Farm income remains below the long-term average and weakness persists in the dairy sector. As a result, we are expecting lower industry farm machinery demand in the EU region.
On Slide 9, you'll see the economic fundamentals outlined for China and India. Due to the economic slowdown in China, we continue to anticipate lower industry sales. Although the government continues to be supportive of the agriculture sector, recent policy changes related to corn floor prices, reduction of corn stockpiles and a less stringent position on grain self-sufficiency are causing short-term uncertainty for both domestic and global markets.
Turning to India. The economy is growing, outpacing other emerging markets and foreign investment is returning. The government continues providing assistance to the ag sector with programs such as minimum support prices for commodities, irrigation and crop insurance. Lastly, the upcoming monsoon is expected to provide above-average moisture after 2 years of below normal season. These factors are resulting in improved industry demand in India.
Shifting to Brazil. Slide 10 illustrates the crop value of agricultural production, a good proxy for the health of the agribusiness there. Ag production is expected to decrease about [ph] 2% in 2016 in U.S. dollar terms due to lower commodity prices. This situation is more positive in local currency as Brazilian farmer profitability remains at good levels as crops are sold in dollars. Although ag fundamentals remain positive, farmer confidence is low due to economic and political concerns as well as growing inflation, all of which are leading to lower equipment sales. The political landscape is shifting with the recent impeachment vote of the Brazilian President and the new administration taking shape. This includes the appointment of an agriculture minister with strong ties to farming and agribusiness, so it's too soon to draw conclusions. The agricultural sector seems encouraged by these changes.
Staying in Brazil, Slide 11 illustrates the finance rates for ag equipment. Brazil recently announced details of eligible rates for government-sponsored finance programs. They apply to the upcoming budget year, which runs from July 2016 through June 2017. Rates for Moderfrota will increase from 7.5% to 8.5% for small and midsize farmers and from 9% to 10.5% for large farmers. While the rates are being increased, it's important to note they remain below the level of inflation in Brazil. This announcement is a positive sign. It removes an element of uncertainty for farmers and conveys confidence the government will continue to support agriculture in spite of the economic and political challenges in Brazil.
Our 2016 ag and turf industry outlook are summarized on Slide 12. Low commodity prices, stagnant farm incomes and elevated used equipment levels in the U.S. and Canada are continuing to pressure demand for farm equipment. The decline is most pronounced in the sale of high horsepower models. 
Our forecast for industry sales in the U.S. and Canada remains down 15% to 20%, with large ag equipment sales down 25% to 30%. The EU 28 industry outlook remains flat to down 5% in 2016 due to low-cost crop prices and farm incomes as well as continued pressure on the dairy sector. In South America, industry sales of tractors and combines are now projected to be down 15% to 20% in 2016, a result of the downturn in Brazil and other commodity-driven economies in the region. Shifting to Asia. Sales are expected to be flat to down slightly, primarily due to weakness in China. 
Turning to another product category. Industry retail sales of turf and utility equipment in the U.S. and Canada are projected to be flat to up 5% in 2016. Putting this all together, on Slide 13, fiscal year 2016 Deere sales in worldwide Ag and Turf equipment are now forecast to be down about 8%. This includes about 2 points of negative currency translation. The improvement in our forecast is driven almost entirely by foreign currency exchange. Ag and Turf division operating margin is forecast to be about 7% in 2016, unchanged from the previous forecast. The implied decremental margin for the year is about 28%.
Now let's focus on Construction & Forestry on Slide 14. Net sales were down 16% in the quarter as a result of lower shipment volumes and higher sales incentive costs. Operating profit was $74 million in the quarter, down from $189 million last year. The decrease was driven by lower shipment volumes, higher sales incentive costs and an unfavorable product mix. These were partially offset by lower production costs and lower selling, administrative and general expenses. The higher sales incentive cost are reflective of the highly competitive environment in North America. The division's decremental margin was about 43%.
Moving to Slide 15. Looking at the economic indicators at the bottom part of the slide, growth in construction spending less energy and GDP are both positive, and housing starts are expected to be just below 1.2 million units this year. In spite of these encouraging signs, the industry continued operating at a slow pace. Contributing factors are: rental utilization rates continued to decline; weak conditions persist in the energy sector; used equipment is readily available and continues to be redeployed from energy-producing regions to other parts of the country; the mix of housing starts in the U.S. is skewed to multifamily homes requiring less turf moving equipment; and economic growth outside the U.S. is sluggish. As a result, Deere's Construction & Forestry sales are now forecast to be down about 13% in 2016. The change from our previous forecast is largely driven by lower sales in United States and Canada and the impact of higher sales incentive costs. The forecast for global forestry markets remains down 5% to 10% from the strong levels we've experienced in recent years, primarily as a result of lower sales in the U.S. and Canada. C&F full year operating margin is now projected to be about 6%. The implied decremental margin for the year is about 32%.
Let's move now to our Financial Services operations. Slide 16 shows the annualized provision for credit losses as a percent of the average owned portfolio. At the end of April, there was 17 basis points, reflecting the continued excellent quality of our portfolios. The forecast for 2016 now contemplates a loss provision of about 23 basis points. The change from our previous guidance is related to our C&F retail note and agriculture revolving credit portfolios. Despite the increase, this would still put the year's losses below the 10-year average of 26 basis points and well below the 15-year average of 39 basis points.
Moving to Slide 17. Worldwide Financial Services net income attributable to Deere & Company was $103 million in the second quarter versus $170 [ph] million last year. The lower results were primarily due to higher losses from lease residual values, less favorable financing spreads and a higher provision for credit losses. 2016 net income attributable to Deere & Company is now forecast to be about $480 million. The outlook reflects the same factors cited for the quarter, namely less favorable financing spreads, higher losses on lease residual values and an increased provision for credit losses. Also remember that 2015 results benefited from a gain on sale of crop insurance business of about $30 million. 
Before we move on to receivables and inventory, let's discuss the losses on residual values noted in the earnings release. The losses in the quarter were primarily related to impairment on both construction and agricultural equipment operating leases with construction accounting for more than half of the amount. While short-term leases of 12 months or less makeup only 15% to 20% of the operating lease portfolio, they account for over 60% of the impairment charges in the quarter. Recent experience have seen both the higher rate of matured lease inventory being returned to John Deere financial in addition to higher loss rate upon the remarketing of these lease returns. 
We've taken a number of actions to mitigate risk on our operating lease portfolio. A few examples include lowering our residual values for future leases, most heavily impacting short-term leases; significantly restricting our short-term lease offerings; and increasing risk sharing with dealers.
Slide 18 outlines receivables and inventories. For the company as a whole, receivables and inventories ended the quarter down $381 million. For the quarter, timing of shipments impacted the Ag and Turf division. We expect to end 2016 with total receivables and inventory down about $400 million, with reductions from both divisions. The change in the forecast for Ag and Turf is largely driven by foreign currency exchange. Field inventory to sales ratios for new large ag equipment are expected to end the year in line with 2015 year-end levels, which is consistent with our previous forecast. 
Our 2016 guidance for cost of sales as a percent of net sales shown on Slide 19 is about 79%, unchanged from the last quarter. When modeling 2016, keep these unfavorable impacts in mind: Unfavorable product mix; Tier 4 product costs; and overhead spend. On the favorable said, we expect price realization of about 1 point. Favorable raw material cost, lower pension and open expense and lower incentive compensation expense. 
Now let's look at a few housekeeping items. With respect to R&D expense on Slide 20, R&D was up 1% in the second quarter. Our 2016 forecast calls for R&D to be down about 1%, with approximately 1 point of negative currency translation.
Moving now to Slide 21. SA&G expense for the equipment operations was down 5% in the quarter with currency translation, pension and OPEB and incentive compensation accounting for nearly all the change.
Turning to Slide 22. Our 2016 forecast contemplates SA&G expense being down about 4%. The same factors cited for the quarter account for about 7 points of the full year change.
Turning to Slide 23. Pension and OPEB expense was down $50 million for the quarter and is forecast to be about down about $200 million for the full year, unchanged from the previous forecast. 
On Slide 24, the equipment operations tax rate was 31% in the quarter, primarily due to discrete items. For 2016, full year effective tax rate is now forecast to be in the range of 31% to 33%.
Slide 25 shows our equipment operations history of strong cash flow. The forecast for cash flow from the equipment operation is about $2.1 billion in 2016. 
The company's third quarter financial outlook is on Slide 26. Net sales for the quarter are forecast to be down about 12% compared with 2015. This includes about 2 points of price realization and unfavorable currency translation of about 1 point.
Turning to Slide 27 and the full year outlook. Our forecast now calls for net sales to be down about 9%. Price realization is expected to be positive by about 1 point. The reduction in price realization guidance is mostly in response to competitive pressures in the C&F division. Currency translation is negative by about 2 points. Finally, our full year 2016 net income forecast is now about $1.2 billion.
In summary, there's little question that Deere will face challenging conditions for the rest of the year. Even so, it is noteworthy the company is continuing to perform at a much higher level than we've done in previous downturns. This is due in large part to our success in developing a more durable business model and a broader range of revenue sources. What's more, the company's financial condition remains strong. In fact, we believe Deere is well positioned to capitalize on attractive growth opportunities that will deliver value to our customers and investors in the future. Meanwhile, on the cost side, we continue to look for ways to streamline our operations and make them even more efficient and profitable. 
I'll now turn the call over to Tony."

But truly, again, this quarter, there is rounding. I'll point out a few of those specifically. As you think about ag and turf and the rounding there, we talked about a 7% operating margin. Understand that is rounding up, so you're actually, got to say you're closer to 6.5% than you are at 7%. And similarly, construction is also rounding up. So as we point out the 6%, it's really closer to 5.5%. And I would point out as well, the $1.2 billion in income is also a rounded number, and in this case, it is actually rounding down a little bit. So to your point, as you look at some of those moving pieces, when you think about construction, when you think about some of the positives as well as Financial Services coming down, you don't necessarily see a full $100 million. And I would point out, as you look at the change in our internal forecast for our net income, it wouldn't be a full $100 million reduction, either. It's just the way a rounding looks. It does go to the full $100 million. So again, you are right in the sense that obviously, you're seeing some negatives from Financial Services. That income is obviously lower. The other larger item that did reduce in the quarter is around Construction & Forestry. And as you think about that sales change, a good portion of that relates to pricing. And with competitive pressures that we've seen, our price realization has come down. Actually, I would tell you, it's slightly negative in our forecast today. And remember, as we reduced pricing, that drops right to the bottom line. And so that does have a greater impact on the profitability of that particular division. But those are the major moving pieces."

Again, just from a competitive perspective, we try to be cautious around that. But I think, maybe to put some of these in context, remember that the 2 key drivers when you think about operating leases and the gains or losses on the return of material lease inventory, there is really 2 factors that we tend trying to focus on. What's the rate of return? So how much of that equipment actually comes back to John Deere financial? And in this case, as we talk about we're seeing on short-term leases a much higher return rate than the average portfolio, so more of that equipment is coming back to John Deere financial for disposition. And then the second factor is now what -- of those that come back, how much can you sell that for versus what the residual value is? And again, on the shorter-term leases, we're seeing a higher level of loss generally on the disposition of that equipment. So those are the -- a lot of the work we've done is around how do we shore up and reduce the risk around those short-term leases. And so obviously, as Josh talked about in the opening comments, it's around residual values, changing those, again bringing in more risk, sharing with the dealers. In fact, I got to tell you on some of the used equipment, short-term leases, those 12-month leases dealers today effectively are guaranteeing the residual value in terms of if we're going to write a 12-month lease on used ag equipment. So those are some of the changes that we would have made. But again, it's with the focus on how do we reduce some of that risk primarily around the short-term portion of the business. So we'll see as we move forward. Again, we're doing a lot of work around how do we reduce the return rate going forward, doing some advance marketing with our dealers and customers to, again, see more of that matured lease inventory stay with either the customer or the dealer, not yet put back on John Deere financial. As well as exploring as part of that, how can we dispose of that equipment more profitably. So we'll see as we move forward, but those will be the 2 areas I would point out. As much as I'd love to say we've captured it all and there is really no risk going forward, the change and the return rate as well as the loss rates are going to be the 2 factors we're looking at internally. And that, I would point out, has a risk of getting worse and also has the opportunity to get better if some of these activities do actually work out and we're able to reduce those 2 factors. So again, hopefully, a little bit more color that helps provide some idea of what we're doing there."

As you pointed out, we've seen steel prices increase pretty dramatically here in the last several months. Started really with some spikes in pricing in China. I'd note that actually in the Chinese market, the pricing has come down pretty dramatically again. So there are a lot of people who would argue that the high level they're at today is likely to come off of those -- that pricing. Again, not that we're saying it's likely to come back down well below the $400 range either on some of the steel pricing. Candidly, the steel mill at that level are largely unprofitable, so we would expect it to settle back a bit. Now for Deere, to get specific to your question, we would point out our risk is mostly in our fourth quarter. The way our contracts are set up, we don't have a lot of risk to the third quarter. But going into fourth quarter and then, of course, what that means for fiscal 2017 depending on where the steel prices settle in, could have some impact next year as well. So again, it's a little premature given the volatility to talk much about what '17 might look like. But for us, the risk is fourth quarter. And I point out, it's a relatively low steel purchasing quarter for us. So minimal impact on 2016, more risk in 2017."

When you think about leasing versus retail notes, our preference candidly would always be a retail note versus an operating lease. But if our customer's preference is to have an operating lease, then we'll certainly consider that. Now as I mentioned earlier, from a short-term perspective. And specific, I'm talking about 12-month leases, we've done a number of -- made a number of changes that made those short-term leases candidly much less attractive in terms of some of the residual value changes. But we would point out, it's really setting those residual values at a level that is more appropriate for the type of experience we're seeing today on the disposition of the matured lease inventory. So going forward, certainly, if a customer has a preference towards a longer-term lease when they're looking to buy used equipment, we will continue to look to offer that lease option from a financing perspective. I think there's a little bit of misunderstanding or information in the marketplace around the level of leasing, too. I've heard numbers as high as 50% is going into operating lease today. We would tell you, year-to-date, if you look at operating leases versus retail note, it's closer to a quarter of the volume as operating lease. Now again, to be fair that is higher than what it would have been historically, but it's nowhere near that half type of range that some are talking about."

In the sense, I think you're looking at the AEM data. It's in the appendix. I would point out that 100-horsepower and above, so that's a wider range than what we would consider large equipment. We would start at 220-horsepower as large ag equipment. And very specifically, that 100-horsepower, 100- to 200-horsepower range is mostly for us, 6000 Series tractors. I would point out that those 6000 Series tractors come from Germany. And as a result, they aren't a build-to-retail order type of product as our large equipment, large tractors would be in the U.S. and Canada. So you do get some shift timing-wise from that perspective. I'd also point out, similar to the previous question, we did have some higher level of shipments in the third quarter, even on the larger equipment, so there's some timing difference there as well. Maybe most importantly as we think about year-end, again, think about the quarter end as a timing issue in terms of inventory and the field on new equipment. When you look forward what's in our forecasted today, assuming our retail sales forecast is accurate and our shipment forecast is accurate, we will end the year with that 100-horsepower and above inventory to sales ratio very much in line with where we ended 2015, even inclusive of those 6000 Series tractors. Certainly, from a large ag perspective, we are expecting even a bit more of a decrease in that particular product. Again, we work in a lot of ways on used equipment with our dealers. Certainly, we leverage what we use as pool fund that provide availability to that dealer. And again, much of that is with the focus on the level of new equipment that they're willing to sell, given the level of use.  As you know, every new piece of equipment comes with a use trade-in so we do try to balance that and talk through that with our dealers. But again, I think what you're seeing today in those inventory is largely some seasonality type of differences. Hopefully that gave you some additional color."

They came into this downturn having come through a strong environment with balance sheets in good order, but you're seeing you those creep up. And some of that, a good portion of that is assets coming down and specifically land value. So you are seeing some of that and it's coming down slowly. We don't anticipate any kind of precipitous decline in land values. We're certainly not seeing signals of that. It's coming down, but it's at modest to moderate pace. As a result, financing ratios are creeping up a bit. But again, we don't sense any major financial upheaval in the farm sector at this point. Again, I would point out also at these levels, while former profitability is significantly lower, broadly speaking, farmers are still profitable at these corn prices. And again, not that they are being pinched, but are still being profitable. So if corn prices stay at these level, I would point out as cash rent comes down, that helps the profitability of most farmers as well. So there's a little bit of double-edged sword on those land values in terms of the impact it has on farmers."

Certainly, as you think about Brazil, I think, I would still frame obviously as our outlook for South America did decline a bit and on tractors and on combine. Things are still -- the market is still pretty tough there. But to your point, there are -- have been a couple signs recently of potential positives. Certainly, the fact that FINAME financing rates have been announced while they're higher than what we've been at, they're still a very attractive level for former customers. I'd point out below in -- you need to be below inflation. So that is very helpful from that perspective. And actually, in the short term, we point out, could result in a little bit of a pull ahead. So farmers have until, I believe it's June 9, to make their applications app under the current rates before the rates move up a couple of points. So again, in the short term, we would expect to see some nice activity. But again, as Josh pointed out in the opening comments, a lot of that uncertainty  around what will happen? Will we even have a FINAME program? What's going to happen with down payment requirements? All those sorts of things that at least for the time being, largely been alleviated. But we'll see as we move forward because there's still some uncertainty. I think, again, we're getting a sense that the agricultural community is viewing these changes positively, but it is early. And I would say the same thing in Argentina. Again, some very positive changes for farmer customers. Their ability to export their products, those sorts of things, but it's still early. So we could potentially expose later in the year. You could see some benefit, but I would argue, most of that we would view as a 2017 opportunity versus a 2016 opportunity."

Year-over-year, if you look at 2015, in the first half, about 45% of our shipments occurred in the first half and 55% in the back half. 2016, that actually flipped. And again, that was just really more reflective of that factory looked at the best way to line up the production for the year. That's what made the most sense for 2016. So we are seeing a little bit of shift in some of those products as we move forward. Certainly, if you look at construction, things aren't getting easier there. And our forecast, as we've talked about last year, does not look for the back half of the year to improve, and seasonally you'll see some sales increases. But you're not going to see, in our forecast anyway any anticipated lift in the overall market. So you don't get that benefit year-over-year, those sorts of things.

Just trying to understand the trend in the second half versus what you're seeing in the fiscal second quarter. Currency is maybe not as much as a competitive threat from some players that was in the first half, and I think some folks are expecting that to really help the pricing dynamic going forward. So as to what extent are you expecting pricing to get increasingly challenging in the second half versus just what you saw in the second quarter? And are you stepping up restructuring to kind of mitigate that?"

Certainly, you would hope, as we hoped all year, that some of the competitive pressure would ease up a bit and others would be as focused on some positive price realization as we are. I would point out, this isn't all about FX benefit in terms of the competitive pressures that we're seeing. I mean, it's not just people who are leveraging again the benefits specifically. And so I'll properly leave it at that, but remember, as the impact in the second quarter on price was greater than what you would see as a run rate going forward in the third and fourth quarter simply because of the accrual that you have to make when you perceive higher levels of discounts in the future because you now have to increase your accrual on all of the field inventory that's already been shipped in prior quarters. So again, the quarter in which you see the way the accounting works, the quarter in which you see that higher-level of incentives going forward does tend to take a more significant hit. And so that was the impact for construction in the second quarter."

I guess, I'm just trying to figure out kind of where are you in the cost control process? And if next year were to be another down year, would you be able to hold these decrementals around 30%?

But I would point out to your comment, I mean, obviously, the kind of forecast is pretty high corn crop to be planted short of a significant weather event that would impact production. And I would argue that's comment from really any of the key growing regions if you see a significant weather impact. We would continue to believe you would see a pretty responsive change in pricing and the environment can shift pretty quickly. But at this point, that's primarily about weather. And we're not going to make a call on weather at this point in the process. So let's go with the assumption that you're seeing a flattish kind of environment or let's go with, I think, your question was more about down. If you're talking about large ag being another significant downturn, as we've talked about last year, I mean, it will be challenging for us. Given the levels we're at with our production capacity today, it will be very difficult for us to minting this level of decremental margin. Especially to the comment earlier that I think Adam asked about with steel pricing. If you start to get headwinds on some of the material cost, that adds pressure as well, right? But even if all of those costs sort of external costs, if you will, remains flat and other significant downturn in large ag would make it very difficult for us to maintain these low decremental margins. Now I want to shift, it does not mean that we aren't continuing to look for ways that we can reduce cost. We've talked before, we haven't done a lot on R&D. If we continue to see a further weakening or even continue at these levels, we will take a much harder look at those projects. Certainly, from an SA&G perspective as well, I would say, clearly, we're looking -- continue to look at ways that we can streamline our processes and streamline our operations in order to reduce those costs. But the ability to do that at a level that would offset another significant step down in large ag would not be likely."

Otherwise, it's basically localized weather. We have said weather can impact it. You've seen the prices come back, corn prices and specially soybean prices come back up sharply with just some of the weather scenarios in Argentina and Brazil. Now specific to your question on decrementals, it clearly is going to depend on which part of the ag or C&F segment goes down or goes up. So if it's a small ag, that more and more [indiscernible] small agg, if that goes down and our decrementals can be managed at the current levels or around the current levels, if it's going to be more in the large ag, it's going to be harder for us to manage.

Nevertheless, all our businesses rema",2432,"Thank you, Tony. John Deere's performance for the second quarter and first 6 months reflected the continuing impact of the downturn in the global farm economy as well as weakness in markets for construction equipment. Nevertheless, all our businesses remained profitable. They benefited from the sound execution of our operating plans, the strength of our broad product portfolio and our success establishing a more flexible cost structure. You may have also noted that we've made changes in our outlook for sales and profits for the full year. 
Now let's take a closer look at our second quarter results, beginning on Slide 3. Net sales and revenues were down 4% to $7.875 billion. Net income attributable to Deere & Company was $495 million. EPS was $1.56 in the quarter.
On Slide 4, total worldwide equipment operations net sales were down 4% to $7.1 billion. That's better than our previous net sales guidance of down about 8%. The higher sales in the quarter were largely due to timing differences of shipments between quarters mainly attributable to Agriculture & Turf equipment in North America and Brazil. Price realization in the quarter was positive by 1 point. Currency translation was negative by 2 points. 
Turning to a review of our individual businesses. Let's start with Agriculture & Turf on Slide 5. Net sales were flat in the quarter-over-quarter comparison. Foreign currency exchange had a negative impact on sales, with the biggest impact coming from the Brazilian real. Partially offsetting this was positive price realization. Operating profit was $614 million, down from $639 million last year. The decrease in operating profit was primarily driven by unfavorable foreign currency exchange, lower shipment volumes and a less favorable product mix. These factors were partially offset by price realization, lower production costs and lower selling, administrative and general expenses. 
Before we review the industry sales outlook, let's look at the fundamentals affecting the ag business. Slide 6 outlines U.S. farm cash receipts. Given the record crop harvest of the last 3 years and the resulting lower commodity prices, our estimate for 2015 cash receipts remains down about 10% from 2014's peak levels. Our 2016 forecast contemplates total cash receipts to be about $375 billion, down only slightly from 2015. 
On Slide 7, grain stocks-to-use ratios remain at somewhat sensitive levels, even after the abundant harvest of the past 3 years. Global grain and oilseed demand continues to be strong, while supplies are now fully adequate. Even so, unfavorable growing conditions in any key region of the world as well as unknown impacts from any geopolitical tensions could result in prices quickly moving higher. 
Our economic outlook for the EU 28 is on Slide 8. Modest economic growth is continuing. However, the region is experiencing continued geopolitical risks such as the upcoming Brexit referendum. Farm income remains below the long-term average and weakness persists in the dairy sector. As a result, we are expecting lower industry farm machinery demand in the EU region.
On Slide 9, you'll see the economic fundamentals outlined for China and India. Due to the economic slowdown in China, we continue to anticipate lower industry sales. Although the government continues to be supportive of the agriculture sector, recent policy changes related to corn floor prices, reduction of corn stockpiles and a less stringent position on grain self-sufficiency are causing short-term uncertainty for both domestic and global markets.
Turning to India. The economy is growing, outpacing other emerging markets, and foreign investment is returning. The government continues providing assistance to the ag sector with programs such as minimum support prices for commodities, irrigation and crop insurance. Lastly, the upcoming monsoon is expected to provide above-average moisture after 2 years of below-normal seasons. These factors are resulting in improved industry demand in India.
Shifting to Brazil. Slide 10 illustrates the crop value of agricultural production, a good proxy for the health of the agribusiness there. Ag production is expected to decrease about 2% in 2016 in U.S. dollar terms due to lower global commodity prices. The situation is more positive in local currency as Brazilian farmer profitability remains at good levels, as crops are sold in dollars. Although ag fundamentals remain positive, farmer confidence is low due to economic and political concerns as well as growing inflation, all of which are leading to lower equipment sales. The political landscape is shifting with the recent impeachment vote of the Brazilian President and the new administration taking shape. This includes the appointment of an agriculture minister with strong ties to the -- to farming and agribusiness. Though it's too soon to draw a conclusion, the agricultural sector seems encouraged by these changes.
Staying in Brazil, Slide 11 illustrates the finance rates for ag equipment. Brazil recently announced details of eligible rates for government-sponsored finance programs. They apply to the upcoming budget year, which runs from July 2016 through June 2017. Rates for Moderfrota will increase from 7.5% to 8.5% for small and midsize farmers and from 9% to 10.5% for large farmers. While the rates are being increased, it's important to note they remain below the level of inflation in Brazil. This announcement is a positive sign. It removes an element of uncertainty for farmers and conveys confidence the government will continue to support agriculture in spite of the economic and political challenges in Brazil.
Our 2016 ag and turf industry outlooks are summarized on Slide 12. Low commodity prices, stagnant farm incomes and elevated used equipment levels in the U.S. and Canada are continuing to pressure demand for farm equipment. The decline is most pronounced in the sale of high-horsepower models. 
Our forecast for industry sales in the U.S. and Canada remains down 15% to 20%, with large ag equipment sales down 25% to 30%. The EU 28 industry outlook remains flat to down 5% in 2016 due to low crop prices and farm incomes as well as continued pressure on the dairy sector. In South America, industry sales of tractors and combines are now projected to be down 15% to 20% in 2016, a result of the downturn in Brazil and other commodity-driven economies in the region. Shifting to Asia. Sales are expected to be flat to down slightly, primarily due to weakness in China. 
Turning to another product category. Industry retail sales of turf and utility equipment in the U.S. and Canada are projected to be flat to up 5% in 2016. 
Putting these all together on Slide 13, fiscal year 2016 Deere sales in worldwide ag and turf equipment are now forecast to be down about 8%. This includes about 2 points of negative currency translation. The improvement in our forecast is driven almost entirely by foreign currency exchange. Ag and turf division operating margin is forecast to be about 7% in 2016, unchanged from the previous forecast. The implied decremental margin for the year is about 28%.
Now let's focus on Construction & Forestry on Slide 14. Net sales were down 16% in the quarter as a result of lower shipment volumes and higher sales incentive costs. Operating profit was $74 million in the quarter, down from $189 million last year. The decrease was driven by lower shipment volumes, higher sales incentive costs and an unfavorable product mix. These were partially offset by lower production costs and lower selling, administrative and general expenses. The higher sales incentive costs are reflective of the highly competitive environment in North America. The division's decremental margin was about 43%.
Moving to Slide 15. Looking at the economic indicators at the bottom part of the slide, growth in construction spending, less energy, and GDP are both positive, and housing starts are expected to be just below 1.2 million units this year. In spite of these encouraging signs, the industry continued operating at a slow pace. Contributing factors are: rental utilization rates continue to decline; weak conditions persist in the energy sector; used equipment is readily available and continues to be redeployed from energy-producing regions to other parts of the country; the mix of housing starts in the U.S. is skewed to multifamily homes requiring less turf-moving equipment; and economic growth outside the U.S. is sluggish. 
As a result, Deere's Construction & Forestry sales are now forecast to be down about 13% in 2016. The change from our previous forecast is largely driven by lower sales in the United States and Canada and the impact of higher sales incentive costs. The forecast for global forestry markets remains down 5% to 10% from the strong levels we experienced in recent years, primarily as a result of lower sales in the U.S. and Canada. C&F's full year operating margin is now projected to be about 6%. The implied decremental margin for the year is about 32%.
Let's move now to our Financial Services operations. Slide 16 shows the annualized provision for credit losses as a percent of the average owned portfolio. At the end of April, it was 17 basis points, reflecting the continued excellent quality of our portfolios. The forecast for 2016 now contemplates a loss provision of about 23 basis points. The change from our previous guidance is related to our C&F retail note and agriculture revolving credit portfolios. Despite the increase, this would still put the year's losses below the 10-year average of 26 basis points and well below the 15-year average of 39 basis points.
Moving to Slide 17. Worldwide Financial Services net income attributable to Deere & Company was $103 million in the second quarter versus $170 million last year. The lower results were primarily due to higher losses on lease residual values, less favorable financing spreads and a higher provision for credit losses. 2016 net income attributable to Deere & Company is now forecast to be about $480 million. The outlook reflects the same factors cited for the quarter, namely less favorable financing spreads, higher losses on lease residual values and an increased provision for credit losses. Also, remember that 2015 results benefited from a gain on sale of crop insurance business of about $30 million. 
Before we move on to receivables and inventory, let's discuss the losses on residual values noted in the earnings release. The losses in the quarter were primarily related to impairment on both construction and agricultural equipment operating leases, with construction accounting for more than half of the amount. While short-term leases of 12 months or less make up only 15% to 20% of the operating lease portfolio, they account for over 60% of the impairment charges in the quarter. Recent experience has seen both the higher rate of matured lease inventory being returned to John Deere financial in addition to higher loss rate upon the remarketing of these lease returns. 
We've taken a number of actions to mitigate risk on our operating lease portfolio. A few examples include lowering our residual values for future leases, most heavily impacting short-term leases; significantly restricting our short-term lease offerings; and increasing risk-sharing with dealers.
Slide 18 outlines receivables and inventories. For the company as a whole, receivables and inventories ended the quarter down $381 million. For the quarter, timing of shipments impacted the ag and turf division. We expect to end 2016 with total receivables and inventory down about $400 million, with reductions from both divisions. The change in the forecast for ag and turf is largely driven by foreign currency exchange. Field inventory-to-sales ratios for new large ag equipment are expected to end the year in line with 2015 year-end levels, which is consistent with our previous forecast. 
Our 2016 guidance for cost of sales as a percent of net sales, shown on Slide 19, is about 79%, unchanged from the last quarter. When modeling 2016, keep these unfavorable impacts in mind: unfavorable product mix; Tier 4 product costs; and overhead spend. On the favorable side, we expect price realization of about 1 point, favorable raw material costs, lower pension and OPEB expense and lower incentive compensation expense. 
Now let's look at a few housekeeping items. With respect to R&D expense on Slide 20, R&D was up 1% in the second quarter. Our 2016 forecast calls for R&D to be down about 1%, with approximately 1 point of negative currency translation.
Moving now to Slide 21. SA&G expense for the equipment operations was down 5% in the second quarter with currency translation, pension and OPEB and incentive compensation accounting for nearly all of the change.
Turning to Slide 22. Our 2016 forecast contemplates SA&G expense being down about 4%. The same factors cited for the quarter account for about 7 points of the full year change.
Turning to Slide 23. Pension and OPEB expense was down $50 million for the quarter and is forecast to be about -- down about $200 million for the full year, unchanged from the previous forecast. 
On Slide 24, the equipment operations tax rate was 31% in the quarter, primarily due to discrete items. For 2016, the full year effective tax rate is now forecast to be in the range of 31% to 33%.
Slide 25 shows our equipment operations history of strong cash flow. The forecast for cash flow from the equipment operation is about $2.1 billion in 2016. 
The company's third quarter financial outlook is on Slide 26. Net sales for the quarter are forecast to be down about 12% compared with 2015. This includes about 2 points of price realization and unfavorable currency translation of about 1 point.
Turning to Slide 27 and the full year outlook. Our forecast now calls for net sales to be down about 9%. Price realization is expected to be positive by about 1 point. The reduction in price realization guidance is mostly in response to competitive pressures in the C&F division. Currency translation is negative by about 2 points. Finally, our full year 2016 net income forecast is now about $1.2 billion.
In summary, there's little question that Deere will face challenging conditions for the rest of the year. Even so, it is noteworthy that the company is continuing to perform at a much higher level than we've done in previous downturns. This is due in large part to our success in developing a more durable business model and a broader range of revenue sources. What's more, the company's financial condition remains strong. In fact, we believe Deere is well positioned to capitalize on attractive growth opportunities that will deliver value to our customers and investors in the future. Meanwhile, on the cost side, we're continuing to look for ways to streamline our operations and make them even more efficient and profitable. 
I'll now turn the call over to Tony."

But truly, again, this quarter, there is rounding. I'll point out a few of those specifically. As you think about ag and turf and the rounding there, we talked about a 7% operating margin. Understand that is rounding up, so you're actually -- I would say you're closer to a 6.5% than you are at 7%. And similarly, construction is also rounding up. So as we point out the 6%, it's really closer to 5.5%. And I would point out as well, the $1.2 billion in income is also a rounded number. And in this case, it is actually rounding down a little bit. So to your point, as you look at some of those moving pieces, when you think about construction, and when you think about some of the positives as well as Financial Services coming down, you don't necessarily see a full $100 million. And I would point out, as you look at the change in our internal forecast for net income, it wouldn't be a full $100 million reduction, either. It's just the way the rounding looks. It does go to the full $100 million. So again, you're right in the sense that, obviously, you're seeing some negatives from Financial Services. That income's obviously lower. The other larger item that did reduce in the quarter is around Construction & Forestry. And as you think about that sales change, a good portion of that relates to pricing. And with competitive pressures that we've seen, our price realization has come down. Actually, I would tell you it's slightly negative in our forecast today. And remember, as we reduce pricing, that drops right to the bottom line. And so that does have a greater impact on the profitability of that particular division. But those are the major moving pieces."

Again, just from a competitive perspective, we try to be cautious around that. But I think, maybe to put some of these in context, remember that the 2 key drivers -- when you think about operating leases and the gains or losses on the return of mature lease inventory, there's really 2 factors that we tend to focus on. What's the rate of return? So how much of that equipment actually comes back to John Deere financial? And in this case, as we talked about, we're seeing on short-term leases a much higher return rate than the average portfolio. So more of that equipment is coming back to John Deere financial for disposition. And then, the second factor is now what -- of those that come back, how much can you sell that for versus what the residual value is? And again, on the shorter-term leases, we're seeing a higher level of loss generally on the disposition of that equipment. So those are the -- a lot of the work we've done is around, how do we shore up and reduce the risk around those short-term leases? And so obviously, as Josh talked about in the opening comments, it's around residual values, changing those, again, bringing in more risk-sharing with the dealers. In fact, I would tell you, on some of the used-equipment short-term leases, those 12-month leases, dealers today effectively are guaranteeing the residual value in terms of if we're going to write a 12-month lease on used ag equipment. So those are some of the changes that we would have made. But again, it's with a focus on how do we reduce some of that risk, primarily around the short-term portion of the business. So we'll see as we move forward. And again, we're doing a lot of work around how do we reduce the return rate going forward, doing some advance marketing with our dealers and customers to, again, see more of that matured lease inventory stay with either the customer or the dealer, not get put back on John Deere financial, as well as exploring, as part of that, how can we dispose of that equipment more profitably. So we'll see as we move forward, but those will be the 2 areas I would point out. As much as I'd love to say we've captured it all and there's really no risk going forward, the change in the return rate as well as the loss rates are going to be the 2 factors we're looking at internally. And that, I would point out, has a risk of getting worse. It also has the opportunity to get better if some of these activities do actually work out and we're able to reduce those 2 factors. So again, hopefully, a little bit more color that helps provide some idea of what we're doing there."

As you pointed out, we've seen steel prices increase pretty dramatically here in the last several months. It started really with some of the -- some spikes in pricing in China. I'd note that, actually, the -- in the Chinese market, the pricing has come down pretty dramatically again. So there are a lot of people who would argue that the high level they're at today is likely to come off of those -- that pricing. Again, not that we're saying it's likely to come back down well below the $400 range either on some of the steel pricing. Candidly, the steel mills at that level are largely unprofitable. So we would expect it to settle back a bit. Now for Deere, to get specific to your question, we would point out our risk is mostly on our fourth quarter. The way our contracts are set up, we don't have a lot of risk through the third quarter. But going into fourth quarter, and then, of course, what that means for fiscal 2017, depending on where the steel prices settle in, it could have some impact next year as well. So again, it's a little premature, given the volatility, to talk much about what '17 might look like. But for us, the risk is fourth quarter. And I'd point out, it's a relatively low steel purchasing quarter for us. So minimal impact on 2016, more risk in 2017."

And I'll point out again, as I have in the past, when you think about leasing versus retail notes, our preference, candidly, would always be a retail note versus an operating lease. But if our customer's preference is to have an operating lease, then we'll certainly consider that. Now as I mentioned earlier, from a short-term perspective, and specific on talking about 12-month leases, we've done a number of -- made a number of changes that make those short-term leases, candidly, much less attractive in terms of some of the residual value changes. But we would point out, it's really setting those residual values at a level that's more appropriate for the type of experience we're seeing today on the disposition of the matured lease inventory. So going forward, certainly, if a customer has a preference towards a longer-term lease when they're looking to buy used equipment, we would continue to look to offer that lease option from a financing perspective. I think there's a little bit of misunderstanding or information in the marketplace around the level of leasing, too. I've heard numbers as high as 50% is going into operating lease today. We would tell you, year-to-date, if you look at operating leases versus retail notes, it's closer to 1/4 of the volume is operating lease. Now again, to be fair, that is higher than what it would have been historically, but it's nowhere near that half type of range that some are talking about."

It's in the appendix. I would point out that 100 horsepower and above, so that's a wider range than what we would consider large equipment. We would start at 220-horsepower as large ag equipment. And very specifically, that 100-horsepower -- 100- to 200-horsepower range is mostly, for us it'd be our 6000 Series tractors. I would point out that those 6000 Series tractors come from Germany. And as a result, they aren't a build-to-retail order type of product as our large equipment -- large tractors would be in the U.S. and Canada. So you do get some shifts, timing-wise, from that perspective. I'd also point out, similar to the previous question, we did have some higher level of shipments in the third quarter, even on the larger equipment, so there's some timing difference there as well. Maybe most importantly, as we think about year-end, again, think about the quarter end as a timing issue in terms of inventory and the field on new equipment. When you look forward, what's in our forecast today, assuming our retail sales forecast is accurate and our shipment forecast is accurate, we will end the year with that ""100-horsepower and above"" inventory-to-sales ratio, very much in line with where we ended 2015, even inclusive of those 6000 Series tractors. Certainly, from a large ag perspective, we're expecting even a bit more of a decrease in that particular product. Again, we work in a lot of ways on used equipment with our dealers. Certainly, we leverage what we use as pool fund that provide availability to that dealer. And again, much of that is with a focus on the level of new equipment that they're willing to sell, given the level of use. As you know, every new piece of equipment comes with a used trade-in, and so we do try to balance that and talk through that with our dealers. So but again, I think what you're seeing today in those inventories is largely some seasonality type of differences. So okay? Hopefully that gave you some additional color. Thanks, Ann."

We don't anticipate any kind of precipitous decline in land values. We're certainly not seeing signals of that. It's coming down, but at moderate -- modest to moderate pace, and as a result, financing ratios are creeping up a bit. But again, we don't sense any major financial upheaval in the farm sector at this point. Again, I would point out also, at these levels, while former profitability is significantly lower, broadly speaking, farmers are still profitable at these corn prices. And again, not that they aren't being pinched but are still being profitable. So if corn prices stay at this level, I would point out, as cash rent comes down, that helps the profitability of most farmers as well.

Things are still -- the market's still pretty tough there. But to your point, there are -- have been a couple signs recently of potential positives. Certainly, the fact that FINAME financing rates have been announced, while they're higher than what we've been at, they're still very attractive levels for farmer customers. I'd point out below -- continue to be below inflation. So that is very helpful from that perspective, and actually, in the short term, we'd point out, could result in a little bit of a pull-ahead. So farmers have until, I believe it's June 9, to make their applications under the current rates before the rates move up those -- a couple of points. So again, in the short term, we would expect to see some nice activity. But again, as Josh pointed out in the opening comments, a lot of that uncertainty around what will happen, will we even have a FINAME program? What's going to happen with down payment requirements? All of those sorts of things have, at least for the time being, largely been alleviated. But we'll see as we move forward, because the -- there's still some uncertainty. I think, again, we're getting the sense that the agricultural community is viewing these changes positively, but it is early. And I would say the same thing in Argentina. Again, some very positive changes for farmer customers, their ability to export their product, those sorts of things, but it's still early. So we could potentially expose later in the year, you could see some benefit, but I would argue, most of that, we would view as a 2017 opportunity versus a 2016 opportunity."

So we are seeing a little bit of shift in some of those products as we move forward. Certainly, as you look at construction, things aren't getting easier there. And our forecast, as we talked about last year, does not look for the back half of the year to improve. And seasonally, you'll see some sales increases. But you're not going to see, in our forecast anyway, any anticipated lift in the overall market. So you don't get that benefit year-over-year, those sorts of things. So again, I think it's -- you're right in the sense that the back half is a bit wider than the first half in our forecast."

Certainly, you would hope, as we've hoped all year, that some of that competitive pressure would ease up a bit and others would be as focused on some positive price realization as we are. I would point out this isn't all about FX benefit in terms of the competitive pressures that we're seeing. I mean, it's not just people who are leveraging a yen benefit, specifically. And so I'll probably leave it at that. But remember, as -- the impact in the second quarter on price was greater than what you would see as a run rate going forward in the third and fourth quarter, simply because of the accrual that you have to make when you perceive higher levels of discounts in the future. Because you now have to increase your accrual on all of the field inventory that's already been shipped in prior quarters. So again, the quarter in which you see -- the way the accounting works, the quarter in which you see that higher level of incentives going forward does tend to take a more significant hit.

But I would point out, to your comment, I mean, obviously, the current forecast is for a pretty high corn crop to be planted short of a significant weather event that would impact production. And I would argue, that's a comment from, really, any of the key growing regions. If you see a significant weather impact, we would continue to believe you would see a pretty responsive change in pricing, and the environment could shift pretty quickly. But at this point, that's primarily about weather, and we're not going to make a call on weather at this point in the process. So let's go with the assumption that you're seeing a flattish kind of environment or -- let's go with, I think, your question was more about down. If you're talking about large ag seeing another significant downturn, as we've talked about last year, I mean, it will be challenging for us. Given the levels we're at with our production capacity today, it will be very difficult for us to maintain this level of decremental margin, especially to the comment earlier that I think Adam asked about with steel pricing. If you start to get headwinds on some of the material cost, that adds pressure as well, right? But even if all of those costs are -- those sort of external costs, if you will, remain flat, another significant downturn in large ag would make it very difficult for us to maintain these low decremental margins. Now I want to shift. It does not mean that we aren't continuing to look for ways that we can reduce cost. We've talked before, we haven't done a lot on R&D. If we continue to see a further weakening or even continue at these levels, we would take a much harder look at those projects. Certainly, from an SA&G perspective as well, I would say, clearly, we're looking -- continue to look at ways that we can streamline our processes and streamline our operations in order to reduce those costs. But the ability to do that at a level that would offset another significant step down in large ag would not be likely."

So it's -- continue to increase globally, which is a very positive signal for the long term for us. And as we look at the future, we have said, if there is a change in our overall thesis in terms of long-term demand, that would make us take some drastic changes in terms of our strategy. But we haven't seen that. Otherwise, it's basically localized weather. We have said weather can impact it. You've seen the prices come back -- corn prices and especially soybean prices come back up sharply with just some of the weather scenarios in Argentina and Brazil. Now with respect to your question on decrementals, it clearly is going to depend on which part of the ag or C&F segment goes down or goes up. So if it is small ag, there's -- that's what is more and more left with, small ag, if that goes down, then our decrementals can be managed at the current levels or -- around the current levels, if it's going to be more on the large ag, it's going to be harder for us to manage, but it's still going to be much better than in previous downturns, okay? And then, we do have continuing efforts in terms of structural cost reduction, whether they be on the material cost side, overhead side or SA&G side.

John Deere's performance for the second quarter and first 6 months reflected the continuing impact of the downturn in the global farm economy as well as weakness in markets for construction equipment. Nevertheless, all our businesses remained profitable. They benefited from the sound execution of our operating plans, the strength of our broad product portfolio and our success establishing a more flexible cost structure. You may have also noted that we've made changes in our outlook for sales and profits for the full year. 
Now let's take a closer look at our second quarter results, beginning on Slide 3. Net sales and revenues were down 4% to $7.875 billion. Net income attributable to Deere & Company was $495 million. EPS was $1.56 in the quarter.
On Slide 4, total worldwide equipment operations net sales were down 4% to $7.1 billion. That's better than our previous net sales guidance of down about 8%. The higher sales in the quarter were largely due to timing differences of shipments between quarters mainly attributable to Agriculture & Turf equipment in North America and Brazil. Price realization in the quarter was positive by 1 point. Currency translation was negative by 2 points. 
Turning to a review of our individual businesses. Let's start with Agriculture & Turf on Slide 5. Net sales were flat in the quarter-over-quarter comparison. Foreign currency exchange had a negative impact on sales, with the biggest impact coming from the Brazilian real. Partially offsetting this was positive price realization. Operating profit was $614 million, down from $639 million last year. The decrease in operating profit was primarily driven by unfavorable foreign currency exchange, lower shipment volumes and a less favorable product mix. These factors were partially offset by price realization, lower production costs and lower selling, administrative and general expenses. 
Before we review the industry sales outlook, let's look at the fundamentals affecting the ag business. Slide 6 outlines U.S. farm cash receipts. Given the record crop harvests of the last 3 years and the resulting lower commodity prices, our estimate for 2015 cash receipts remains down about 10% from 2014's peak levels. Our 2016 forecast contemplates total cash receipts to be about $375 billion, down only slightly from 2015. 
On Slide 7, grain stocks-to-use ratios remain at somewhat sensitive levels, even after the abundant harvest of the past 3 years. Global grain and oilseed demand continues to be strong, while supplies are now fully adequate. Even so, unfavorable growing conditions in any key region of the world as well as unknown impacts from any geopolitical tensions could result in prices quickly moving higher. 
Our economic outlook for the EU 28 is on Slide 8. Modest economic growth is continuing. However, the region is experiencing continued geopolitical risks such as the upcoming Brexit referendum. Farm income remains below the long-term average and weakness persists in the dairy sector. As a result, we are expecting lower industry farm machinery demand in the EU region.
On Slide 9, you'll see the economic fundamentals outlined for China and India. Due to the economic slowdown in China, we continue to anticipate lower industry sales. Although the government continues to be supportive of the agriculture sector, recent policy changes related to corn floor prices, reduction of corn stockpiles and a less stringent position on grain self-sufficiency are causing short-term uncertainty for both domestic and global markets.
Turning to India. The economy is growing, outpacing other emerging markets, and foreign investment is returning. The government continues providing assistance to the ag sector with programs such as minimum support prices for commodities, irrigation and crop insurance. Lastly, the upcoming monsoon is expected to provide above-average moisture after 2 years of below-normal seasons. These factors are resulting in improved industry demand in India.
Shifting to Brazil. Slide 10 illustrates the crop value of agricultural production, a good proxy for the health of the agribusiness there. Ag production is expected to decrease about 2% in 2016 in U.S. dollar terms due to lower global commodity prices. The situation is more positive in local currency as Brazilian farmer profitability remains at good levels, as crops are sold in dollars. Although ag fundamentals remain positive, farmer confidence is low due to economic and political concerns as well as growing inflation, all of which are leading to lower equipment sales. The political landscape is shifting with the recent impeachment vote of the Brazilian President and the new administration taking shape. This includes the appointment of an agriculture minister with strong ties to the -- to farming and agribusiness. Though it's too soon to draw a conclusion, the agricultural sector seems encouraged by these changes.
Staying in Brazil, Slide 11 illustrates the finance rates for ag equipment. Brazil recently announced details of eligible rates for government-sponsored finance programs. They apply to the upcoming budget year, which runs from July 2016 through June 2017. Rates for Moderfrota will increase from 7.5% to 8.5% for small and midsize farmers and from 9% to 10.5% for large farmers. While the rates are being increased, it's important to note they remain below the level of inflation in Brazil. This announcement is a positive sign. It removes an element of uncertainty for farmers and conveys confidence the government will continue to support agriculture in spite of the economic and political challenges in Brazil.
Our 2016 ag and turf industry outlooks are summarized on Slide 12. Low commodity prices, stagnant farm incomes and elevated used equipment levels in the U.S. and Canada are continuing to pressure demand for farm equipment. The decline is most pronounced in the sale of high-horsepower models. 
Our forecast for industry sales in the U.S. and Canada remains down 15% to 20%, with large ag equipment sales down 25% to 30%. The EU 28 industry outlook remains flat to down 5% in 2016 due to low crop prices and farm incomes as well as continued pressure on the dairy sector. In South America, industry sales of tractors and combines are now projected to be down 15% to 20% in 2016, a result of the downturn in Brazil and other commodity-driven economies in the region. Shifting to Asia. Sales are expected to be flat to down slightly, primarily due to weakness in China. 
Turning to another product category. Industry retail sales of turf and utility equipment in the U.S. and Canada are projected to be flat to up 5% in 2016. 
Putting this all together on Slide 13, fiscal year 2016 Deere sales in worldwide ag and turf equipment are now forecast to be down about 8%. This includes about 2 points of negative currency translation. The improvement in our forecast is driven almost entirely by foreign currency exchange. Ag and turf division operating margin is forecast to be about 7% in 2016, unchanged from the previous forecast. The implied decremental margin for the year is about 28%.
Now let's focus on Construction & Forestry on Slide 14. Net sales were down 16% in the quarter as a result of lower shipment volumes and higher sales incentive costs. Operating profit was $74 million in the quarter, down from $189 million last year. The decrease was driven by lower shipment volumes, higher sales incentive costs and an unfavorable product mix. These were partially offset by lower production costs and lower selling, administrative and general expenses. The higher sales incentive costs are reflective of the highly competitive environment in North America. The division's decremental margin was about 43%.
Moving to Slide 15. Looking at the economic indicators at the bottom part of the slide, growth in construction spending, less energy, and GDP are both positive, and housing starts are expected to be just below 1.2 million units this year. In spite of these encouraging signs, the industry continues operating at a slow pace. Contributing factors are: rental utilization rates continue to decline; weak conditions persist in the energy sector; used equipment is readily available and continues to be redeployed from energy-producing regions to other parts of the country; the mix of housing starts in the U.S. is skewed to multifamily homes requiring less earth-moving equipment; and economic growth outside the U.S. is sluggish. 
As a result, Deere's Construction & Forestry sales are now forecast to be down about 13% in 2016. The change from our previous forecast is largely driven by lower sales in the United States and Canada and the impact of higher sales incentive costs. The forecast for global forestry markets remains down 5% to 10% from the strong levels we experienced in recent years, primarily as a result of lower sales in the U.S. and Canada. C&F's full year operating margin is now projected to be about 6%. The implied decremental margin for the year is about 32%.
Let's move now to our Financial Services operations. Slide 16 shows the annualized provision for credit losses as a percent of the average owned portfolio. At the end of April, it was 17 basis points, reflecting the continued excellent quality of our portfolios. The forecast for 2016 now contemplates a loss provision of about 23 basis points. The change from our previous guidance is related to our C&F retail note and agriculture revolving credit portfolios. Despite the increase, this would still put the year's losses below the 10-year average of 26 basis points and well below the 15-year average of 39 basis points.
Moving to Slide 17. Worldwide Financial Services net income attributable to Deere & Company was $103 million in the second quarter versus $170 million last year. The lower results were primarily due to higher losses on lease residual values, less favorable financing spreads and a higher provision for credit losses. 2016 net income attributable to Deere & Company is now forecast to be about $480 million. The outlook reflects the same factors cited for the quarter, namely less favorable financing spreads, higher losses on lease residual values and an increased provision for credit losses. Also, remember that 2015 results benefited from a gain of sale of crop insurance business of about $30 million. 
Before we move on to receivables and inventory, let's discuss the losses on residual values noted in the earnings release. The losses in the quarter were primarily related to impairment on both construction and agricultural equipment operating leases, with construction accounting for more than half of the amount. While short-term leases of 12 months or less make up only 15% to 20% of the operating lease portfolio, they account for over 60% of the impairment charges in the quarter. Recent experience has seen both a higher rate of matured lease inventory being returned to John Deere financial in addition to higher loss rate upon the remarketing of these lease returns. 
We've taken a number of actions to mitigate risk on our operating lease portfolio. A few examples include lowering residual values for future leases, most heavily impacting short-term leases; significantly restricting our short-term lease offerings; and increasing risk-sharing with dealers.
Slide 18 outlines receivables and inventories. For the company as a whole, receivables and inventories ended the quarter down $381 million. For the quarter, timing of shipments impacted the ag and turf division. We expect to end 2016 with total receivables and inventory down about $400 million, with reductions from both divisions. The change in the forecast for ag and turf is largely driven by foreign currency exchange. Field inventory-to-sales ratios for new large ag equipment are expected to end the year in line with 2015 year-end levels, which is consistent with our previous forecast. 
Our 2016 guidance for cost of sales as a percent of net sales, shown on Slide 19, is about 79%, unchanged from the last quarter. When modeling 2016, keep these unfavorable impacts in mind: unfavorable product mix; Tier 4 product costs; and overhead spend. On the favorable side, we expect price realization of about 1 point, favorable raw material costs, lower pension and OPEB expense and lower incentive compensation expense. 
Now let's look at a few housekeeping items. With respect to R&D expense on Slide 20, R&D was up 1% in the second quarter. Our 2016 forecast calls for R&D to be down about 1%, with approximately 1 point of negative currency translation.
Moving now to Slide 21. SA&G expense for the equipment operations was down 5% in the second quarter with currency translation, pension and OPEB and incentive compensation accounting for nearly all of the change.
Turning to Slide 22. Our 2016 forecast contemplates SA&G expense being down about 4%. The same factors cited for the quarter account for about 7 points of the full year change.
Turning to Slide 23. Pension and OPEB expense was down $50 million for the quarter and is forecast to be about -- down about $200 million for the full year, unchanged from the previous forecast. 
On Slide 24, the equipment operations tax rate was 31% in the quarter, primarily due to discrete items. For 2016, the full year effective tax rate is now forecast to be in the range of 31% to 33%.
Slide 25 shows our equipment operations history of strong cash flow. The forecast for cash flow from the equipment operation is about $2.1 billion in 2016. 
The company's third quarter financial outlook is on Slide 26. Net sales for the quarter are forecast to be down about 12% compared with 2015. This includes about 2 points of price realization and unfavorable currency translation of about 1 point.
Turning to Slide 27 and the full year outlook. Our forecast now calls for net sales to be down about 9%. Price realization is expected to be positive by about 1 point. The reduction in price realization guidance is mostly in response to competitive pressures in the C&F division. Currency translation is negative by about 2 points. Finally, our full year 2016 net income forecast is now about $1.2 billion.
In summary, there's little question that Deere will face challenging conditions for the rest of the year. Even so, it is noteworthy that the company is continuing to perform at a much higher level than we've done in previous downturns. This is due in large part to our success in developing a more durable business model and a broader range of revenue sources. What's more, the company's financial condition remains strong. In fact, we believe Deere is well positioned to capitalize on attractive growth opportunities that will deliver value to our customers and investors in the future. Meanwhile, on the cost side, we're continuing to look for ways to streamline our operations and make them even more efficient and profitable. 
I'll now turn the call over to Tony."

But truly, again, this quarter, there is rounding. I'll point out a few of those specifically. As you think about ag and turf and the rounding there, we talked about a 7% operating margin. Understand that is rounding up, so you're actually -- I would say you're closer to a 6.5% than you are 7%. And similarly, construction is also rounding up. So as we point out the 6%, it's really closer to 5.5%. And I would point out as well, the $1.2 billion in income is also a rounded number. And in this case, it is actually rounding down a little bit. So to your point, as you look at some of those moving pieces, when you think about construction, and when you think about some of the positives as well as Financial Services coming down, you don't necessarily see a full $100 million. And I would point out, as you look at the change in our internal forecast for net income, it wouldn't be a full $100 million reduction, either. It's just the way the rounding looks. It does go to the full $100 million. So again, you're right in the sense that, obviously, you're seeing some negatives from Financial Services. That income's obviously lower. The other larger item that did reduce in the quarter is around Construction & Forestry. And as you think about that sales change, a good portion of that relates to pricing. And with competitive pressures that we've seen, our price realization has come down. Actually, I would tell you it's slightly negative in our forecast today. And remember, as we reduce pricing, that drops right to the bottom line. And so that does have a greater impact on the profitability of that particular division. But those are the major moving pieces."

Again, just from a competitive perspective, we try to be cautious around that. But I think, maybe to put some of this in context, remember that the 2 key drivers -- when you think about operating leases and the gains or losses on the return of mature lease inventory, there's really 2 factors that we tend to focus on. What's the rate of return? So how much of that equipment actually comes back to John Deere financial? And in this case, as we talked about, we're seeing on short-term leases a much higher return rate than the average portfolio. So more of that equipment is coming back to John Deere financial for disposition. And then, the second factor is now what -- of those that come back, how much can you sell that for versus what the residual value is? And again, on the shorter-term leases, we're seeing a higher level of loss generally on the disposition of that equipment. So those are the -- a lot of the work we've done is around, how do we shore up and reduce the risk around those short-term leases? And so obviously, as Josh talked about in the opening comments, it's around residual values, changing those, again, bringing in more risk-sharing with the dealers. In fact, I would tell you, on some of the used-equipment short-term leases, those 12-month leases, dealers today effectively are guaranteeing the residual value in terms of if we're going to write a 12-month lease on used ag equipment. So those are some of the changes that we would have made. But again, it's with a focus on how do we reduce some of that risk, primarily around the short-term portion of the business. So we'll see as we move forward. And again, we're doing a lot of work around how do we reduce the return rate going forward, doing some advance marketing with our dealers and customers to, again, see more of that matured lease inventory stay with either the customer or the dealer, not get put back on John Deere financial, as well as exploring, as part of that, how can we dispose of that equipment more profitably. So we'll see as we move forward, but those will be the 2 areas I would point out. As much as I'd love to say we've captured it all and there's really no risk going forward, the change in the return rate as well as the loss rates are going to be the 2 factors we're looking at internally. And that, I would point out, has a risk of getting worse. It also has the opportunity to get better if some of these activities do actually work out and we're able to reduce those 2 factors. So again, hopefully, a little bit more color that helps provide some idea of what we're doing there."

As you pointed out, we've seen steel prices increase pretty dramatically here in the last several months. It started really with some of the -- some spikes in pricing in China. I'd note that, actually, the -- in the Chinese market, the pricing has come down pretty dramatically again. So there are a lot of people who would argue that the high level they're at today is likely to come off of those -- that pricing. Again, not that we're saying it's likely to come back down well below the $400 range either on some of the steel pricing. Candidly, the steel mills at that level are largely unprofitable. So we would expect it to settle back a bit. Now for Deere, to get specific to your question, we would point out our risk is mostly in our fourth quarter. The way our contracts are set up, we don't have a lot of risk through third quarter. But going into fourth quarter, and then, of course, what that means for fiscal 2017, depending on where the steel prices settle in, it could have some impact next year as well. So again, it's a little premature, given the volatility, to talk much about what '17 might look like. But for us, the risk is fourth quarter. And I'd point out, it's a relatively low steel purchasing quarter for us. So minimal impact on 2016, more risk in 2017."

And I'll point out again, as I have in the past, when you think about leasing versus retail notes, our preference, candidly, would always be a retail note versus an operating lease. But if our customer's preference is to have an operating lease, then we'll certainly consider that. Now as I mentioned earlier, from a short-term perspective, and specific on talking about 12-month leases, we've done a number of -- made a number of changes that make those short-term leases, candidly, much less attractive in terms of some of the residual value changes. But we would point out, it's really setting those residual values at a level that's more appropriate for the type of experience we're seeing today on the disposition of the matured lease inventory. So going forward, certainly, if a customer has a preference towards a longer-term lease when they're looking to buy used equipment, we would continue to look to offer that lease option from a financing perspective. I think there's a little bit of misunderstanding or information in the marketplace around the level of leasing, too. I've heard numbers as high as 50% is going into operating lease today. We would tell you, year-to-date, if you look at operating leases versus retail notes, it's closer to 1/4 of the volume is operating lease. Now again, to be fair, that is higher than what it would have been historically, but it's nowhere near that half type of range that some are talking about."

I would point out that 100 horsepower and above, so that's a wider range than what we would consider large equipment. We would start at 220-horsepower as large ag equipment. And very specifically, that 100-horsepower -- 100- to 200-horsepower range is mostly, for us it'd be our 6000 Series tractors. I would point out that those 6000 Series tractors come from Germany. And as a result, they aren't a build-to-retail order type of product as our large equipment -- large tractors would be in the U.S. and Canada. So you do get some shifts, timing-wise, from that perspective. I'd also point out, similar to the previous question, we did have some higher level of shipments in the third quarter, even on the larger equipment, so there's some timing difference there as well. Maybe most importantly, as we think about year-end, again, think about the quarter end as a timing issue in terms of inventory and the field on new equipment. When you look forward, what's in our forecast today, assuming our retail sales forecast is accurate and our shipment forecast is accurate, we will end the year with that ""100-horsepower and above"" inventory-to-sales ratio, very much in line with where we ended 2015, even inclusive of those 6000 Series tractors. Certainly, from a large ag perspective, we're expecting even a bit more of a decrease in that particular product. Again, we work in a lot of ways on used equipment with our dealers. Certainly, we leverage what we use as pool funds that provide availability to that dealer. And again, much of that is with a focus on the level of new equipment that they're willing to sell, given the level of use. As you know, every new piece of equipment comes with a used trade-in, and so we do try to balance that and talk through that with our dealers. So but again, I think what you're seeing today in those inventories is largely some seasonality type of differences. So okay? Hopefully that gave you some additional color. Thanks, Ann."

And obviously, based on that chart, things are looking pretty good. But if we're looking at farm balance sheets, land accounts for better than 80% of farm assets. We're starting to see some deterioration in cash rents, we're starting to see some erosion in farmland values. So I guess, my question is, how do you think about the risk to farm balance sheets going forward? And most importantly, can equipment demand eventually stabilize if land values continue to erode?"

They came into this downturn having come through a strong environment with balance sheets in good order. But you're seeing those creep up. And some of that -- or a good portion of that is assets coming down, and specifically land value. So you are seeing some of that, and it's coming down slowly. We don't anticipate any kind of precipitous decline in land values. We're certainly not seeing signals of that. It's coming down, but at moderate -- modest to moderate pace, and as a result, financing ratios are creeping up a bit. But again, we don't sense any major financial upheaval in the farm sector at this point. Again, I would point out also, at these levels, while farmer profitability is significantly lower, broadly speaking, farmers are still profitable at these corn prices. And again, not that they aren't being pinched but are still being profitable. So if corn prices stay at this level, I would point out, as cash rent comes down, that helps the profitability of most farmers as well. So there's a little bit of double-edged sword on those land values in terms of the impact it has on farmers. Thank you. Appreciate the question."

Certainly, as you think about Brazil, I think I would still frame, obviously, as our outlook for South America did decline a bit and -- on tractors and in combine. Things are still -- the market's still pretty tough there. But to your point, there are -- have been a couple signs recently of potential positives. Certainly, the fact that FINAME financing rates have been announced, while they're higher than what we've been at, they're still at very attractive levels for farmer customers. I'd point out below -- continue to be below inflation. So that is very helpful from that perspective, and actually, in the short term, we'd point out, could result in a little bit of a pull-ahead. So farmers have until, I believe it's June 9 to make their applications under the current rates before the rates move up those -- a couple of points. So again, in the short term, we would expect to see some nice activity. But again, as Josh pointed out in the opening comments, a lot of that uncertainty around what will happen, will we even have a FINAME program? What's going to happen with down payment requirements? All of those sorts of things have, at least for the time being, largely been alleviated. But we'll see as we move forward, because the -- there's still some uncertainty. I think, again, we're getting the sense that the agricultural community is viewing these changes positively, but it is early. And I would say the same thing in Argentina. Again, some very positive changes for farmer customers, their ability to export their product, those sorts of things, but it's still early. So we could potentially expose later in the year, you could see some benefit, but I would argue, most of that, we would view as a 2017 opportunity versus a 2016 opportunity."

Year-over-year, if you look at 2015, in the first half, about 45% of our shipments occurred in the first half and 55% in the back half. 2016, that actually flips. And again, that was just the -- really more reflective of, as that factory looked at the best way to line up the production for the year, that's what made the most sense for 2016. So we are seeing a little bit of shift in some of those products as we move forward. Certainly, as you look at construction, things aren't getting easier there. And our forecast, as we talked about last year, does not look for the back half of the year to improve. And seasonally, you'll see some sales increases. But you're not going to see, in our forecast anyway, any anticipated lift in the overall market. So you don't get that benefit year-over-year, those sorts of things.

And so I'll probably leave it at that.

Because you now have to increase your accrual on all of the field inventory that's already been shipped in prior quarters.

And I'm not really asking you to bless that forecast. I guess, I'm just trying to figure out, kind of where are you in the cost control process? And if next year were to be another down year, would you be able to hold these decrementals around 30% or would they get worse? And at what point do you kind of think about doing some real footprint-reduction restructuring rather than just kind of headcount stuff?"

But I would point out, to your comment, I mean, obviously, the current forecast is for a pretty high corn crop to be planted short of a significant weather event that would impact production. And I would argue, that's a comment from, really, any of the key growing regions. If you see a significant weather impact, we would continue to believe you would see a pretty responsive change in pricing, and the environment could shift pretty quickly. But at this point, that's primarily about weather, and we're not going to make a call on weather at this point in the process. So let's go with the assumption that you're seeing a flattish kind of environment or -- let's go with, I think, your question was more about down. If you're talking about large ag seeing another significant downturn, as we've talked about last year, I mean, it will be challenging for us. Given the levels we're at with our production capacity today, it will be very difficult for us to maintain this level of decremental margin, especially to the comment earlier that I think Adam asked about with steel pricing. If you start to get headwinds on some of the material cost, that adds pressure as well, right? But even if all of those costs are -- those sort of external costs, if you will, remain flat, another significant downturn in large ag would make it very difficult for us to maintain these low decremental margins. Now I want to shift. It does not mean that we aren't continuing to look for ways that we can reduce cost. We've talked before, we haven't done a lot on R&D. If we continue to see a further weakening or even continue at these levels, we would take a much harder look at those projects. Certainly, from an SA&G perspective as well, I would say, clearly, we're looking -- continue to look at ways that we can streamline our processes and streamline our operations in order to reduce those costs. But the ability to do that at a level that would offset another significant step down in large ag would not be likely."

So it's -- continue to increase globally, which is a very positive signal for the long term for us. And as we look at the future, we have said, if there is a change in our overall thesis in terms of long-term demand, that would make us take some drastic changes in terms of our strategy. But we haven't seen that. Otherwise, it's basically localized weather. We have said weather can impact it. You've seen the prices come back -- corn prices and especially soybean prices come back up sharply with just some of the weather scenarios in Argentina and Brazil. Now with respect to your question on decrementals, it clearly is going to depend on which part of the ag or C&F segment goes down or goes up. So if it is small ag, there's -- that's what is more and more left with, small ag, if that goes down, then our decrementals can be managed at the current levels or -- around the current levels. If it's going to be more on the large ag, it's going to be harder for us to manage, but it's still going to be much better than in previous downturns, okay? And then, we do have continuing efforts in terms of structural cost reduction, whether they be on the material cost side, overhead side or SA&G side. So you will see us continuously work on those to offset any of these if the scenario you're outlining should happen."

John Deere's performance for the second quarter and first 6 months reflected the continuing impact of the downturn in the global farm economy as well as weakness in markets for construction equipment. Nevertheless, all our businesses remained profitable. They benefited from the sound execution of our operating plans, the strength of our broad product portfolio and our success establishing a more flexible cost structure. You may have also noted that we've made changes in our outlook for sales and profits for the full year. 
Now let's take a closer look at our second quarter results, beginning on Slide 3. Net sales and revenues were down 4% to $7.875 billion. Net income attributable to Deere & Company was $495 million. EPS was $1.56 in the quarter.
On Slide 4, total worldwide equipment operations net sales were down 4% to $7.1 billion. That's better than our previous net sales guidance of down about 8%. The higher sales in the quarter were largely due to timing differences of shipments between quarters mainly attributable to Agriculture & Turf equipment in North America and Brazil. Price realization in the quarter was positive by 1 point. Currency translation was negative by 2 points. 
Turning to a review of our individual businesses. Let's start with Agriculture & Turf on Slide 5. Net sales were flat in the quarter-over-quarter comparison. Foreign currency exchange had a negative impact on sales, with the biggest impact coming from the Brazilian real. Partially offsetting this was positive price realization. Operating profit was $614 million, down from $639 million last year. The decrease in operating profit was primarily driven by unfavorable foreign currency exchange, lower shipment volumes and a less favorable product mix. These factors were partially offset by price realization, lower production costs and lower selling, administrative and general expenses. 
Before we review the industry sales outlook, let's look at the fundamentals affecting the ag business. Slide 6 outlines U.S. farm cash receipts. Given the record crop harvests of the last 3 years and the resulting lower commodity prices, our estimate for 2015 cash receipts remains down about 10% from 2014's peak levels. Our 2016 forecast contemplates total cash receipts to be about $375 billion, down only slightly from 2015. 
On Slide 7, grain stocks-to-use ratios remain at somewhat sensitive levels, even after the abundant harvest of the past 3 years. Global grain and oilseed demand continues to be strong, while supplies are now fully adequate. Even so, unfavorable growing conditions in any key region of the world as well as unknown impacts from any geopolitical tensions could result in prices quickly moving higher. 
Our economic outlook for the EU 28 is on Slide 8. Modest economic growth is continuing. However, the region is experiencing continued geopolitical risks such as the upcoming Brexit referendum. Farm income remains below the long-term average and weakness persists in the dairy sector. As a result, we are expecting lower industry farm machinery demand in the EU region.
On Slide 9, you'll see the economic fundamentals outlined for China and India. Due to the economic slowdown in China, we continue to anticipate lower industry sales. Although the government continues to be supportive of the agriculture sector, recent policy changes related to corn floor prices, reduction of corn stockpiles and a less stringent position on grain self-sufficiency are causing short-term uncertainty for both domestic and global markets.
Turning to India. The economy is growing, outpacing other emerging markets, and foreign investment is returning. The government continues providing assistance to the ag sector with programs such as minimum support prices for commodities, irrigation and crop insurance. Lastly, the upcoming monsoon is expected to provide above-average moisture after 2 years of below-normal seasons. These factors are resulting in improved industry demand in India.
Shifting to Brazil. Slide 10 illustrates the crop value of agricultural production, a good proxy for the health of the agribusiness there. Ag production is expected to decrease about 2% in 2016 in U.S. dollar terms due to lower global commodity prices. The situation is more positive in local currency as Brazilian farmer profitability remains at good levels, as crops are sold in dollars. Although ag fundamentals remain positive, farmer confidence is low due to economic and political concerns as well as growing inflation, all of which are leading to lower equipment sales. The political landscape is shifting with the recent impeachment vote of the Brazilian President and the new administration taking shape. This includes the appointment of an agriculture minister with strong ties to the -- to farming and agribusiness. Though it's too soon to draw a conclusion, the agricultural sector seems encouraged by these changes.
Staying in Brazil, Slide 11 illustrates the finance rates for ag equipment. Brazil recently announced details of eligible rates for government-sponsored finance programs. They apply to the upcoming budget year, which runs from July 2016 through June 2017. Rates for Moderfrota will increase from 7.5% to 8.5% for small and midsize farmers and from 9% to 10.5% for large farmers. While the rates are being increased, it's important to note they remain below the level of inflation in Brazil. This announcement is a positive sign. It removes an element of uncertainty for farmers and conveys confidence the government will continue to support agriculture in spite of the economic and political challenges in Brazil.
Our 2016 ag and turf industry outlooks are summarized on Slide 12. Low commodity prices, stagnant farm incomes and elevated used equipment levels in the U.S. and Canada are continuing to pressure demand for farm equipment. The decline is most pronounced in the sale of high-horsepower models. 
Our forecast for industry sales in the U.S. and Canada remains down 15% to 20%, with large ag equipment sales down 25% to 30%. The EU 28 industry outlook remains flat to down 5% in 2016 due to low crop prices and farm incomes as well as continued pressure on the dairy sector. In South America, industry sales of tractors and combines are now projected to be down 15% to 20% in 2016, a result of the downturn in Brazil and other commodity-driven economies in the region. Shifting to Asia. Sales are expected to be flat to down slightly, primarily due to weakness in China. 
Turning to another product category. Industry retail sales of turf and utility equipment in the U.S. and Canada are projected to be flat to up 5% in 2016. 
Putting this all together on Slide 13, fiscal year 2016 Deere sales in worldwide ag and turf equipment are now forecast to be down about 8%. This includes about 2 points of negative currency translation. The improvement in our forecast is driven almost entirely by foreign currency exchange. Ag and turf division operating margin is forecast to be about 7% in 2016, unchanged from the previous forecast. The implied decremental margin for the year is about 28%.
Now let's focus on Construction & Forestry on Slide 14. Net sales were down 16% in the quarter as a result of lower shipment volumes and higher sales incentive costs. Operating profit was $74 million in the quarter, down from $189 million last year. The decrease was driven by lower shipment volumes, higher sales incentive costs and an unfavorable product mix. These were partially offset by lower production costs and lower selling, administrative and general expenses. The higher sales incentive costs are reflective of the highly competitive environment in North America. The division's decremental margin was about 43%.
Moving to Slide 15. Looking at the economic indicators at the bottom part of the slide, growth in construction spending, less energy, and GDP are both positive, and housing starts are expected to be just below 1.2 million units this year. In spite of these encouraging signs, the industry continues operating at a slow pace. Contributing factors are: rental utilization rates continue to decline; weak conditions persist in the energy sector; used equipment is readily available and continues to be redeployed from energy-producing regions to other parts of the country; the mix of housing starts in the U.S. is skewed to multifamily homes requiring less earth-moving equipment; and economic growth outside the U.S. is sluggish. 
As a result, Deere's Construction & Forestry sales are now forecast to be down about 13% in 2016. The change from our previous forecast is largely driven by lower sales in the United States and Canada and the impact of higher sales incentive costs. The forecast for global forestry markets remains down 5% to 10% from the strong levels we experienced in recent years, primarily as a result of lower sales in the U.S. and Canada. C&F's full year operating margin is now projected to be about 6%. The implied decremental margin for the year is about 32%.
Let's move now to our Financial Services operations. Slide 16 shows the annualized provision for credit losses as a percent of the average owned portfolio. At the end of April, it was 17 basis points, reflecting the continued excellent quality of our portfolios. The forecast for 2016 now contemplates a loss provision of about 23 basis points. The change from our previous guidance is related to our C&F retail note and agriculture revolving credit portfolios. Despite the increase, this would still put the year's losses below the 10-year average of 26 basis points and well below the 15-year average of 39 basis points.
Moving to Slide 17. Worldwide Financial Services net income attributable to Deere & Company was $103 million in the second quarter versus $170 million last year. The lower results were primarily due to higher losses on lease residual values, less favorable financing spreads and a higher provision for credit losses. 2016 net income attributable to Deere & Company is now forecast to be about $480 million. The outlook reflects the same factors cited for the quarter, namely less favorable financing spreads, higher losses on lease residual values and an increased provision for credit losses. Also, remember that 2015 results benefited from a gain of sale of crop insurance business of about $30 million. 
Before we move on to receivables and inventory, let's discuss the losses on residual values noted in the earnings release. The losses in the quarter were primarily related to impairment on both construction and agricultural equipment operating leases, with construction accounting for more than half of the amount. While short-term leases of 12 months or less make up only 15% to 20% of the operating lease portfolio, they account for over 60% of the impairment charges in the quarter. Recent experience has seen both a higher rate of matured lease inventory being returned to John Deere financial in addition to higher loss rate upon the remarketing of these lease returns. 
We've taken a number of actions to mitigate risk on our operating lease portfolio. A few examples include lowering residual values for future leases, most heavily impacting short-term leases; significantly restricting our short-term lease offerings; and increasing risk-sharing with dealers.
Slide 18 outlines receivables and inventories. For the company as a whole, receivables and inventories ended the quarter down $381 million. For the quarter, timing of shipments impacted the ag and turf division. We expect to end 2016 with total receivables and inventory down about $400 million, with reductions from both divisions. The change in the forecast for ag and turf is largely driven by foreign currency exchange. Field inventory-to-sales ratios for new large ag equipment are expected to end the year in line with 2015 year-end levels, which is consistent with our previous forecast. 
Our 2016 guidance for cost of sales as a percent of net sales, shown on Slide 19, is about 79%, unchanged from the last quarter. When modeling 2016, keep these unfavorable impacts in mind: unfavorable product mix; Tier 4 product costs; and overhead spend. On the favorable side, we expect price realization of about 1 point, favorable raw material costs, lower pension and OPEB expense and lower incentive compensation expense. 
Now let's look at a few housekeeping items. With respect to R&D expense on Slide 20, R&D was up 1% in the second quarter. Our 2016 forecast calls for R&D to be down about 1%, with approximately 1 point of negative currency translation.
Moving now to Slide 21. SA&G expense for the equipment operations was down 5% in the second quarter with currency translation, pension and OPEB and incentive compensation accounting for nearly all of the change.
Turning to Slide 22. Our 2016 forecast contemplates SA&G expense being down about 4%. The same factors cited for the quarter account for about 7 points of the full year change.
Turning to Slide 23. Pension and OPEB expense was down $50 million for the quarter and is forecast to be about -- down about $200 million for the full year, unchanged from the previous forecast. 
On Slide 24, the equipment operations tax rate was 31% in the quarter, primarily due to discrete items. For 2016, the full year effective tax rate is now forecast to be in the range of 31% to 33%.
Slide 25 shows our equipment operations history of strong cash flow. The forecast for cash flow from the equipment operation is about $2.1 billion in 2016. 
The company's third quarter financial outlook is on Slide 26. Net sales for the quarter are forecast to be down about 12% compared with 2015. This includes about 2 points of price realization and unfavorable currency translation of about 1 point.
Turning to Slide 27 and the full year outlook. Our forecast now calls for net sales to be down about 9%. Price realization is expected to be positive by about 1 point. The reduction in price realization guidance is mostly in response to competitive pressures in the C&F division. Currency translation is negative by about 2 points. Finally, our full year 2016 net income forecast is now about $1.2 billion.
In summary, there's little question that Deere will face challenging conditions for the rest of the year. Even so, it is noteworthy that the company is continuing to perform at a much higher level than we've done in previous downturns. This is due in large part to our success in developing a more durable business model and a broader range of revenue sources. What's more, the company's financial condition remains strong. In fact, we believe Deere is well positioned to capitalize on attractive growth opportunities that will deliver value to our customers and investors in the future. Meanwhile, on the cost side, we're continuing to look for ways to streamline our operations and make them even more efficient and profitable. 
I'll now turn the call over to Tony."

But truly, again, this quarter, there is rounding. I'll point out a few of those specifically. As you think about ag and turf and the rounding there, we talked about a 7% operating margin. Understand that is rounding up, so you're actually -- I would say you're closer to a 6.5% than you are 7%. And similarly, construction is also rounding up. So as we point out the 6%, it's really closer to 5.5%. And I would point out as well, the $1.2 billion in income is also a rounded number. And in this case, it is actually rounding down a little bit. So to your point, as you look at some of those moving pieces, when you think about construction, and when you think about some of the positives as well as Financial Services coming down, you don't necessarily see a full $100 million. And I would point out, as you look at the change in our internal forecast for net income, it wouldn't be a full $100 million reduction, either. It's just the way the rounding looks. It does go to the full $100 million. So again, you're right in the sense that, obviously, you're seeing some negatives from Financial Services. That income's obviously lower. The other larger item that did reduce in the quarter is around Construction & Forestry. And as you think about that sales change, a good portion of that relates to pricing. And with competitive pressures that we've seen, our price realization has come down. Actually, I would tell you it's slightly negative in our forecast today. And remember, as we reduce pricing, that drops right to the bottom line. And so that does have a greater impact on the profitability of that particular division. But those are the major moving pieces."

So more of that equipment is coming back to John Deere financial for disposition. And then, the second factor is now what -- of those that come back, how much can you sell that for versus what the residual value is? And again, on the shorter-term leases, we're seeing a higher level of loss generally on the disposition of that equipment. So those are the -- a lot of the work we've done is around, how do we shore up and reduce the risk around those short-term leases? And so obviously, as Josh talked about in the opening comments, it's around residual values, changing those, again, bringing in more risk-sharing with the dealers. In fact, I would tell you, on some of the used-equipment short-term leases, those 12-month leases, dealers today effectively are guaranteeing the residual value in terms of if we're going to write a 12-month lease on used ag equipment. So those are some of the changes that we would have made. But again, it's with a focus on how do we reduce some of that risk, primarily around the short-term portion of the business. So we'll see as we move forward. And again, we're doing a lot of work around how do we reduce the return rate going forward, doing some advance marketing with our dealers and customers to, again, see more of that matured lease inventory stay with either the customer or the dealer, not get put back on John Deere financial, as well as exploring, as part of that, how can we dispose of that equipment more profitably. So we'll see as we move forward, but those will be the 2 areas I would point out. As much as I'd love to say we've captured it all and there's really no risk going forward, the change in the return rate as well as the loss rates are going to be the 2 factors we're looking at internally. And that, I would point out, has a risk of getting worse. It also has the opportunity to get better if some of these activities do actually work out and we're able to reduce those 2 factors. So again, hopefully, a little bit more color that helps provide some idea of what we're doing there."

As you pointed out, we've seen steel prices increase pretty dramatically here in the last several months. It started really with some of the -- some spikes in pricing in China. I'd note that, actually, the -- in the Chinese market, the pricing has come down pretty dramatically again. So there are a lot of people who would argue that the high level they're at today is likely to come off of those -- that pricing. Again, not that we're saying it's likely to come back down well below the $400 range either on some of the steel pricing. Candidly, the steel mills at that level are largely unprofitable. So we would expect it to settle back a bit. Now for Deere, to get specific to your question, we would point out our risk is mostly in our fourth quarter. The way our contracts are set up, we don't have a lot of risk through third quarter. But going into fourth quarter, and then, of course, what that means for fiscal 2017, depending on where the steel prices settle in, it could have some impact next year as well. So again, it's a little premature, given the volatility, to talk much about what '17 might look like. But for us, the risk is fourth quarter. And I'd point out, it's a relatively low steel purchasing quarter for us. So minimal impact on 2016, more risk in 2017."

And I'll point out again, as I have in the past, when you think about leasing versus retail notes, our preference, candidly, would always be a retail note versus an operating lease. But if our customer's preference is to have an operating lease, then we'll certainly consider that. Now as I mentioned earlier, from a short-term perspective, and specific on talking about 12-month leases, we've done a number of -- made a number of changes that make those short-term leases, candidly, much less attractive in terms of some of the residual value changes. But we would point out, it's really setting those residual values at a level that's more appropriate for the type of experience we're seeing today on the disposition of the matured lease inventory. So going forward, certainly, if a customer has a preference towards a longer-term lease when they're looking to buy used equipment, we would continue to look to offer that lease option from a financing perspective. I think there's a little bit of misunderstanding or information in the marketplace around the level of leasing, too. I've heard numbers as high as 50% is going into operating lease today. We would tell you, year-to-date, if you look at operating leases versus retail notes, it's closer to 1/4 of the volume is operating lease. Now again, to be fair, that is higher than what it would have been historically, but it's nowhere near that half type of range that some are talking about."

I would point out that 100 horsepower and above, so that's a wider range than what we would consider large equipment. We would start at 220-horsepower as large ag equipment. And very specifically, that 100-horsepower -- 100- to 200-horsepower range is mostly, for us it'd be our 6000 Series tractors. I would point out that those 6000 Series tractors come from Germany. And as a result, they aren't a build-to-retail order type of product as our large equipment -- large tractors would be in the U.S. and Canada. So you do get some shifts, timing-wise, from that perspective. I'd also point out, similar to the previous question, we did have some higher level of shipments in the third quarter, even on the larger equipment, so there's some timing difference there as well. Maybe most importantly, as we think about year-end, again, think about the quarter end as a timing issue in terms of inventory and the field on new equipment. When you look forward, what's in our forecast today, assuming our retail sales forecast is accurate and our shipment forecast is accurate, we will end the year with that ""100-horsepower and above"" inventory-to-sales ratio, very much in line with where we ended 2015, even inclusive of those 6000 Series tractors. Certainly, from a large ag perspective, we're expecting even a bit more of a decrease in that particular product. Again, we work in a lot of ways on used equipment with our dealers. Certainly, we leverage what we use as pool funds that provide availability to that dealer. And again, much of that is with a focus on the level of new equipment that they're willing to sell, given the level of use. As you know, every new piece of equipment comes with a used trade-in, and so we do try to balance that and talk through that with our dealers. So but again, I think what you're seeing today in those inventories is largely some seasonality type of differences. So okay? Hopefully that gave you some additional color. Thanks, Ann."

They came into this downturn having come through a strong environment with balance sheets in good order. But you're seeing those creep up. And some of that -- or a good portion of that is assets coming down, and specifically land value. So you are seeing some of that, and it's coming down slowly. We don't anticipate any kind of precipitous decline in land values. We're certainly not seeing signals of that. It's coming down, but at moderate -- modest to moderate pace, and as a result, financing ratios are creeping up a bit. But again, we don't sense any major financial upheaval in the farm sector at this point. Again, I would point out also, at these levels, while farmer profitability is significantly lower, broadly speaking, farmers are still profitable at these corn prices. And again, not that they aren't being pinched but are still being profitable. So if corn prices stay at this level, I would point out, as cash rent comes down, that helps the profitability of most farmers as well. So there's a little bit of double-edged sword on those land values in terms of the impact it has on farmers. Thank you. Appreciate the question."

Things are still -- the market's still pretty tough there. But to your point, there are -- have been a couple signs recently of potential positives. Certainly, the fact that FINAME financing rates have been announced, while they're higher than what we've been at, they're still at very attractive levels for farmer customers. I'd point out below -- continue to be below inflation. So that is very helpful from that perspective, and actually, in the short term, we'd point out, could result in a little bit of a pull-ahead. So farmers have until, I believe it's June 9 to make their applications under the current rates before the rates move up those -- a couple of points. So again, in the short term, we would expect to see some nice activity. But again, as Josh pointed out in the opening comments, a lot of that uncertainty around what will happen, will we even have a FINAME program? What's going to happen with down payment requirements? All of those sorts of things have, at least for the time being, largely been alleviated. But we'll see as we move forward, because the -- there's still some uncertainty. I think, again, we're getting the sense that the agricultural community is viewing these changes positively, but it is early. And I would say the same thing in Argentina. Again, some very positive changes for farmer customers, their ability to export their product, those sorts of things, but it's still early. So we could potentially expose later in the year, you could see some benefit, but I would argue, most of that, we would view as a 2017 opportunity versus a 2016 opportunity."

Year-over-year, if you look at 2015, in the first half, about 45% of our shipments occurred in the first half and 55% in the back half. 2016, that actually flips. And again, that was just the -- really more reflective of, as that factory looked at the best way to line up the production for the year, that's what made the most sense for 2016. So we are seeing a little bit of shift in some of those products as we move forward. Certainly, as you look at construction, things aren't getting easier there. And our forecast, as we talked about last year, does not look for the back half of the year to improve. And seasonally, you'll see some sales increases.

So our A is the highest priority. And then, we look at strategic options. And with respect to strategic growth options, you've seen us keep organic R&D spend at a pretty healthy rate. And you've also seen us announce some inorganic acquisitions. And you've seen us talk about precision planting, Monosem, and more recently, Hagie. So in this type of an industry environment where we have a pretty strong financial position, some of these inorganic options become more actionable for us. And if they are in the long-term interest of our shareholders for profitable growth in the long term, we will act on some of those. And then, dividends are our next priority, and then finally, share repurchases. And we've always said, share repurchases are a residual use of cash. And as you just mentioned, we have higher -- if there are higher-priority uses, we will apply it to those. Now I will say this: With respect to share repurchases, we've also said we will do those only if it's in the long-term interest of long-term shareholders. We still think it's very good value for long-term shareholders but we want to first allocate cash for other higher priorities."

I would point out this isn't all about FX benefit in terms of the competitive pressures that we're seeing. I mean, it's not just people who are leveraging a yen benefit, specifically. And so I'll probably leave it at that. But remember, as -- the impact in the second quarter on price was greater than what you would see as a run rate going forward in the third and fourth quarter, simply because of the accrual that you have to make when you perceive higher levels of discounts in the future. Because you now have to increase your accrual on all of the field inventory that's already been shipped in prior quarters. So again, the quarter in which you see -- the way the accounting works, the quarter in which you see that higher level of incentives going forward does tend to take a more significant hit. And so that was the impact for construction in the second quarter."

But I would point out, to your comment, I mean, obviously, the current forecast is for a pretty high corn crop to be planted short of a significant weather event that would impact production. And I would argue, that's a comment from, really, any of the key growing regions. If you see a significant weather impact, we would continue to believe you would see a pretty responsive change in pricing, and the environment could shift pretty quickly. But at this point, that's primarily about weather, and we're not going to make a call on weather at this point in the process. So let's go with the assumption that you're seeing a flattish kind of environment or -- let's go with, I think, your question was more about down. If you're talking about large ag seeing another significant downturn, as we've talked about last year, I mean, it will be challenging for us. Given the levels we're at with our production capacity today, it will be very difficult for us to maintain this level of decremental margin, especially to the comment earlier that I think Adam asked about with steel pricing. If you start to get headwinds on some of the material cost, that adds pressure as well, right? But even if all of those costs are -- those sort of external costs, if you will, remain flat, another significant downturn in large ag would make it very difficult for us to maintain these low decremental margins. Now I want to shift. It does not mean that we aren't continuing to look for ways that we can reduce cost. We've talked before, we haven't done a lot on R&D. If we continue to see a further weakening or even continue at these levels, we would take a much harder look at those projects. Certainly, from an SA&G perspective as well, I would say, clearly, we're looking -- continue to look at ways that we can streamline our processes and streamline our operations in order to reduce those costs. But the ability to do that at a level that would offset another significant step down in large ag would not be likely."

So it's -- continue to increase globally, which is a very positive signal for the long term for us. And as we look at the future, we have said, if there is a change in our overall thesis in terms of long-term demand, that would make us take some drastic changes in terms of our strategy. But we haven't seen that. Otherwise, it's basically localized weather. We have said weather can impact it. You've seen the prices come back -- corn prices and especially soybean prices come back up sharply with just some of the weather scenarios in Argentina and Brazil. Now with respect to your question on decrementals, it clearly is going to depend on which part of the ag or C&F segment goes down or goes up. So if it is small ag, there's -- that's what is more and more left with, small ag, if that goes down, then our decrementals can be managed at the current levels or -- around the current levels. If it's going to be more on the large ag, it's going to be harder for us to manage, but it's still going to be much better than in previous downturns, okay? And then, we do have continuing efforts in terms of structural cost reduction, whether they be on the material cost side, overhead side or SA&G side.

John Deere today reported solid financial results for the third quarter and did so in spite of the continuing impact of the global farm recession and difficult conditions in the construction equipment sector. All of Deere's businesses remained profitable for the quarter, and earnings per share was slightly higher than last year. 
Operating profit for our Ag & Turf division and for the equipment businesses overall was above last year's levels even though sales were down nearly $1 billion. Our results were helped by the sound execution of our operating plans, the impact of a broad product portfolio and our success in keeping a tight rein on costs and assets. 
Now let's take a closer look at the third quarter in detail beginning on Slide 3. Net sales and revenues were down 11% to about $6.7 billion. Net income attributable to Deere & Company was $489 million. EPS was $1.55 in the quarter. 
On Slide 4, we see that worldwide, equipment operations net sales were down 14% to just under $5.9 billion. Price realization in the quarter was positive by 2 points. Currency translation is negative by 2 points. 
Turning to our review of our individual businesses, let's start with Agriculture & Turf on Slide 5. Net sales for the division were down 11% in the quarter-over-quarter comparison, with the decrease primarily due to lower shipment volumes in the United States and Canada. Also affecting sales was the negative impact of foreign currency exchange. 
Operating profit was $571 million. Ag & Turf operating margins were 12.1% in the quarter. The gain on the sale of a partial interest in SiteOne Landscape Supply contributed nearly 2 points of operating margin in the quarter. Even, excluding the SiteOne impact, operating margins were above the levels of last year's third quarter.

266112,326112456,1037466,"Deere & Company, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 19, 2016",2016-08-19,"Earnings Calls","Deere & Company","Executives","Thanks, Josh. I would begin with a bit of context that might be useful as we ponder the outlook. Slide #6 shows the strong tailwinds that now drive the global agricultural economy. Major changes in agriculture and food markets began occurring sometime aro",1384,"Thanks, Josh. I would begin with a bit of context that might be useful as we ponder the outlook. Slide #6 shows the strong tailwinds that now drive the global agricultural economy. Major changes in agriculture and food markets began occurring sometime around the turn of the century, and that ushered in a dozen or so unparalleled years characterized by strong demand growth, record-high prices and farm incomes, food price spikes, expanded investment in innovation and increased trade. 
A convergence of forces was responsible: global population growth; widespread global economic growth, especially in emerging market and developing countries; rapid urbanization and biofuels. Now in 2000, the UN was projecting that the population would grow from 6.1 billion in that year to 9.3 billion by 2050. Today, that projection for 2050 is 9.7 billion. So that's another 2.4 billion from today's 7.3 billion people. 
Although having slowed somewhat, the global expansion continues especially across much of the developing world, bringing millions more into the middle class and enabling ongoing improvements in diet. On urbanization, we passed the 50% mark of population sometime around 2010, and that is now expected to approach 70% by 2050, with implications for food production and trade. 
Now Slide #7 reflects global ag as a whole, showing the production and consumption of all global grades. Now perhaps the most noteworthy point of the slide and one often overlooked with all the focus on supply, acreage and yield, and that is the persistent consumption growth. Consumption remains very strong, still rising steadily year after year, and it has risen without fail every year since 1994, '95, even including the Great Recession of 2009. 
Now fueled by earlier high prices and after 4 consecutive great growing seasons worldwide, commodity supplies now are fully adequate to meet all needs. Prices, of course, have moved off the previously high levels and farmer margins have narrowed. 
Slide #8 provides more details showing global stockholdings and the supply-to-use ratio. While carryover stocks have reached levels of 15 years ago in physical quantities, it is important to remember that we are now consuming 1/3 more grains so the supply-use ratio is the key indicator. 
While it has moved above the average of recent years, it remains in a sensitive area and especially so when viewed with Chinese grain stocks excluded. Notably, the Chinese are thought to hold about 45% of the global stocks, and the supply-use ratio actually had ticked down the last couple of years when the Chinese stocks are excluded. 
Now Slide 9 illustrates that even with abundant supply, the production consumption balance still could shift rather quickly. Any significant production disruption will tilt the supply-use ratio downward and prices will immediately move higher. The recent price movements, in response to reports of relatively minor weather events, certainly highlight this continued sensitivity. 
You will note from the slide that both corn and soy futures were trading in a rather narrow range in the first 4 months of this year. Then we saw some reports of adverse weather in Brazil and Argentina in April. Prices quickly reflected the uncertainty that brought. Corn moved almost $0.90 a bushel or higher. Soy moved $3.25 a bushel or higher. That's an increase of 25% for corn, 36% for soy. 
Then by late June, the South American weather conditions abated, followed by the early July USDA report indicating larger acreages of both corn and soy. The weather premium quickly disappeared from the corn price and it was reduced for soy. 
Now just for reference, the U.S. drought in 2012 reduced corn yields 22% below trend, pushing ending stocks to barely 800 million bushels and prices to a new-record high. But this year, a corn yield reduction of only 4% would have been sufficient to reduce ending stocks to 1 billion bushels and pushed prices to $5 per bushel or higher, a further illustration of the sensitive supply utilization balance. 
Now there was some expectation that farmers would reduce acreage in response to the softer prices as we came into the northern hemisphere planting season. On Slide 10, we note that despite the softer prices, farmers worldwide did not reduce acreage. Now in the United States, farmer supply response this year was influenced by market prices, of course, which provided a but still positive margin. But they were also influenced by foreign program subsidies, revenue insurance and production cost declines. 
For example of the subsidy, the agricultural program, ARC County, forecast 2015 payments for Illinois is $0.37 per bushel on corn-based acres and $0.98 per bushel on soybean-based acres. So as a result of this combination, U.S. farmers this year expanded planted area for all major crops, except wheat, illustrating continued profitability despite softer prices. 
Now we also expected a similar reduction in other parts of the world, but we noted there that farmer supply response was influenced largely by currency values and also some cost issues, notably in Argentina. And this crop year, major exporters expanded grain and oilseed area all around the world. And grains and oilseeds were up 3.7% in South America. As an example, Brazilian farmers saw corn prices in real of $5.24 per bushel in September 2015 compared to $3.43 per bushel the year before, indicating that it was still very profitable to continue to expand. 
Now Slide #11 speaks to the financial condition of the U.S. farm sector. Overall, the farm sector balance sheet remains strong. Farmer debt has been well managed. The financial indicators are still solid. It was not until 2000 that farm sector equity reached $1 trillion. But then it took only 10 more years to add a second $1 trillion, and 5 years later, we've added another $0.5 trillion. 
Now a major part of that balance sheet, of course, is farmland, and USDA forecast land prices to decline in 2016, crop land to decline 1%. This is the first time since 2009 and only the second time in almost 3 decades. 
Now Slide 12 summarizes the situation across the global ag sector. As I noted, supplies are fully adequate. The risk premia have been erased from the grain markets. We saw very little reduction coming into the year in response to the lower prices. And that was because of the aberrational forces at play, the subsidies, the risk measures and also currency values, which boosted commodity prices. 
And we're in the fourth consecutive favorable weather year. So adding all of those things together, barring adverse weather events, little near-term improvement in ag market condition is anticipated. But we would note that the long-term drivers: population growth, incomes growth and urbanization are still impacted. 
Now Slide 13 pertains to the U.S. ag sector. And we note that farming is still profitable despite softer prices, as evidenced by the continued expansion of planted acres this year, and financial conditions across the sector remain solid. There is some individual farmers stress to be sure but no widespread stress is yet evident. 
And finally, Slide #14 lists some key factors that are worth watching in the coming months. And in the short term, of course, weather is key. We know that demand is strong. We now know that supply depends upon the weather. So it's still weather is the major market disruptor and it's still one season at a time. Attention now will turn from North America to the southern hemisphere as the planting growing season gets underway there in late September and October. We'll continue to watch that until next spring in the northern hemisphere when we'll start focusing on planting and growing conditions here. 
And over the longer term, I would just note that any of these geopolitical hotspots that could erupt and become a drag on global GDP would be a negative. Lots of other things to watch include relative currency values, the political situation in several countries, Central Bank behavior all over the world. 
And so I would just conclude by noting that after a dozen years of unprecedented prosperity, planting, commodity price, food price and trading patterns are now stabilizing. A new commodity price trading range with favorable weather is emerging, and weather remains the major commodity market disruptor. The outlook is still one year at a time depending upon the weather. I will now turn the call back to Josh."

Our 2016 Ag & Turf industry outlooks are summarized on Slide 15. You'll note there are no changes from our previous forecast. Low commodity prices, weakening farm incomes and elevated used equipment levels in the U.S. and Canada are continuing to pressure demand for farm equipment, especially high horsepower models. 
We expect industry sales in the U.S. and Canada to be down about 15% to 20% for 2016, with sales of large ag equipment down 25% to 30%. The EU 28 industry outlook remains flat to down 5% due to lower crop prices and farm incomes as well as persistent pressure on the dairy sector. 
In South America, industry sales of tractors and combines are expected to be down 15% to 20% in 2016. This is a reflection of a downturn in Brazil and other commodity-driven markets in the region. 
Shifting to Asia. The industry sales outlook continues to be flat to down slightly. This is due in part to weakness in China, partially offset by improving conditions in India where the monsoon rains have been higher than normal. 
Turning to another product category. Industry retail sales of turf and utility equipment in the U.S. and Canada are projected to be flat to up 5% in 2016, again, no change from our prior forecast. 
Putting this all together on Slide 16. Fiscal year 2016 Deere sales of worldwide Ag & Turf equipment are forecast to be down about 8%, including about 2 points of negative currency translation. This is unchanged from the previous forecast. Our forecast for the Ag & Turf division's operating margin is now about 7.7% for the year, with an implied detrimental margin of about 15%. 
Now let's focus on Construction & Forestry on Slide 17. Net sales were down 24% in the quarter, and operating profit was down 58%, due mainly to lower shipment volumes and an unfavorable product mix. The division's decremental margin was 20%. 
Moving to Slide 18. The economic indicators noted at the bottom of the slide, although down somewhat from the previous quarter, remained positive. Notwithstanding this positive signals, the market demand for construction equipment continued to soften. Among the factors contributing to the weakness: conditions in oil and gas sector continued to be slow, with the impact mosts pronounced in the energy-producing region of the U.S. and Canada; contractors are less to replenish or grow their machine fleets when faced with uncertain markets; rental utilization rates continued to decline, leading to a reduction in fleet sizes and higher levels of used equipment; also, housing starts in the U.S. for single-family homes, which require more [indiscernible] equipment, remain well below the long-term average. 
As a result, Deere's Construction & Forestry sales are now forecast to be down about 18% in 2016. Currency translation is forecast to be negative by about 1 point. The global forestry market forecast remains down 5% to 10%, primarily as a result of lower sales in the U.S. and Canada. C&F's full year operating margin is now projected to be about 4.1%. The implied decremental margin for the year is about 31%. 
Let's move now to our Financial Services. Slide 19 shows the annualized provision for credit losses as a percent of the average owned portfolio, which was 24 basis points at the end of July. This reflects the continued excellent quality of our portfolios. The financial forecast for 2016 contemplates a loss provision of about 23 basis points, unchanged from the previous forecast. The provision remains below the 10-year average of 26 basis points and well below the 15-year average of 39 basis points. 
Moving to Slide 20. Worldwide Financial Services net income attributable to the Deere & Company was $126 million in the third quarter versus $153 million last year. Lower results for the quarter were primarily due to less favorable financing spreads, a higher provision for credit losses and higher losses on lease residual values. The division's forecast net income attributable to Deere & Company remains at $480 million for the year. 
Slide 21 outlines receivables and inventories. For the company as a whole, receivables and inventories ended the quarter down $764 million. We expect to end the year with total receivables and inventories down about $500 million with reductions coming from both divisions. Field inventory to sales for new large ag equipment are expected to end the year in line with 2015 year-end levels, which is consistent with our previous forecast. C&F's inventory and receivables to sales ratios are forecast to end the year roughly in line with last year's level as well. 
Our 2016 guidance for cost of sales as a percent of net sales shown on Slide 22 is about 78.7%. When modeling 2016, keep these unfavorable factors in mind; an unfavorable product mix and engine emission costs. On the favorable side, we expect: price realization of about 1 point; favorable raw material costs; lower pension and expense and lower incentive compensation expense. 
Now let's look at a few housekeeping items. With respect to R&D on Slide 23, R&D was down 2% in the third quarter. Our forecast calls for R&D to be down about 1% for the full year, including about 1 point of negative currency translation. This is consistent with our previous forecast. 
Moving now to Slide 24. SA&G expense for the equipment operations was down 10% in the third quarter. Most of the decline was attributable to incentive compensation, commissions to dealers, pension and OPEB and currency translation. 
Turning to Slide 25. Our 2016 forecast contemplates SA&G expense being down about 5%, with incentive compensation, currency translation and pension and OPEB accounting for about 6 points of the full year change. 
On Slide 26, pension and OPEB expense was down $53 million in the quarter and is now forecast to be down about $210 million in 2016. 
On Slide 27, the equipment operations tax rate was 31% in the quarter and is now forecast to be in the range of 29% to 31% for the full year. 
Slide 28 shows our equipment operations history of strong cash flow. Cash flow from the equipment operations is forecast to be about $2.1 billion in 2016. The company's fourth quarter financial outlook is on Slide 29. Net sales for the quarter are forecast to be down about 8% compared with 2015. This includes about 1 point of price realization and unfavorable currency translation of about 1 point. 
Turning to Slide 30 in the full year outlook. The forecast now calls for net sales to be down about 10%. Price realization is expected to be positive by about 1 point, with negative currency translation of about 2 points. Finally, our forecast now calls for net income attributable to Deere & Company to be about $1.35 billion for the full year. 
In closing, Deere continues to perform well in the face of challenging market conditions, and this is particularly true in relation to previous farm recessions. Our performance in the third quarter and for the year-to-date underscores our success developing a more durable business model and a wider range of revenue sources. 
At the same time, we're continuing to look for ways to make our operations more profitable and efficient by seeking out further structural cost reductions. All in all, we remain confident in the company's present direction and believe Deere is on the right track to deliver significant value to its customers and investors in the years ahead. I'll now turn the call back over to Tony."

And as you mentioned there, that can change in a hurry. And it certainly, with the commodity prices coming down, I think it's fair to say that the overall move would be less positive than it was a couple of months ago even. Related to the spring seasonal equipment, we just finished the first phase -- remember, there are multi-phase early order programs. So I want to stress that this is still quite early. But we did see, on some of those key products like planters and sprayers, as well as spring building equipment, we are seeing those early order programs down year-over-year. But if you think about the magnitude of that decrease, considerably less of a reduction versus where we were a year ago. In fact, if you look at just planter in particular, which is obviously, considered a good indicator for large ag in this current environment, orders are down in the single-digit range. So just to give you an idea again, I would stress that it is quite early."

On lower sales, the operating margins were higher. Obviously, price realization continues to be very strong. You point out the SiteOne gain. That was about $75 million. I think Josh indicated just under 2 points of margin there. But really, a lot of it was cost management. And so we had lower production costs, things like obviously incentive comp. Material costs continued to be a tailwind for us. Obviously had a little higher Tier 4 emissions cost. SA&G was also lower. So those were some of the positives. Obviously, volume and FX continue to be drags on the profitability as well. If you look out into fourth quarter, I think a couple of things to keep in mind. One is mix shifts. So as you think about the production, a couple of our key factories in particular, you think about Waterloo with large tractors as well as harvester works, will see considerably lower production in the fourth quarter of '16 versus '15. Just to put some context around that harvester works for combines would be about a 60% reduction in output hours, and Waterloo is about a 20% reduction in output hours. So a couple of very profitable products for us that the production will be down pretty significantly. The other thing that I think is worth noting is material costs. That's been a nice tailwind for us through the first 3 quarters of the year. That actually becomes more flattish. It's slightly negative, that really is more flattish in the fourth quarter. So you lose the tailwind in the quarter would be the other item I'd point out. So those are probably the biggest differences as you move into the fourth quarter."

We would hope to see and certainly expect to see progress continue to resume in fourth quarter, with that number continuing to move back down. to your point, we still have a significant amount of work to do yet this year but even into 2017. That kind of inventory balance a bit. I think when you look at the balance sheet of dealers in pricing and the valuation of ag equipment, generally, what we're hearing is the dealers are feeling a little better about the income -- or the equipment that they do have and the value that it's had on their balance sheet. We've seen some pricing stabilization on used equipment. So again, I think things are stabilizing but I want to be clear.

So again, the reason we're clarifying that is because we talked earlier in the year, when you're looking at total ag inventories and receivables, you had small ag in there as well and we've seen some increases there.

When we refer to pool funds at least in the U.S. and Canada, those funds are only for used equipment. They earn them on the sale of new equipment, but it's really the funds that are available for them to provide incentives for the sale of used. So we often talk about one way they can use those is for helping to subsidize the floor planning that they have of used equipment as well as actual retail. And so we do tend to manage that. There was a period of time where we were starting to see a shift towards more use of wholesale financing and floor planning. But that has shifted back to a very attractive use on actual retail and pretty much in line with what you would expect. So that's been a positive trend that we saw really early in the year, and it's continued through the year on pool funds. So another question around there that I'll throw in as a bonus is if you look at pool funds in aggregate, we would say certainly, as we look at that relative to used inventory, we would be comfortable in aggregate. But as we said before, there are clearly some dealers who we would look at and say their pool funds are too light relative to the used equipment that they have. And that's when we have those individual conversations with those specific dealers. But in aggregate, still at healthy levels."

I mean, if you ask me today which market was likely, if I had to pick one, which one had the best likelihood of being up, I would likely say Brazil or South America in general. One of the things to keep in mind is as we talked about this throughout the year is, a lot of the downturn there has been related to the uncertainty around the government and the overall economy. Farmers have been pretty profitable with the government leased to date, there appears to be more positive sentiment. Inflation is coming down as an example. So the overall economy seems to be showing some level of improvement. And when in the short term, we're seeing you that in the order books as well. Now the question there is remember, there is a conversion to Tier 3, what we considered to be Tier 3 on January 1 in Brazil on large ag equipment. So that will let dealers to customers know that will come with a price increase. So undoubtedly, some of at least short-term order book activity we're seeing is the strength around that buying equipment ahead of the Tier 3 conversion. So the real question remains, will we continue to see that demand surge as we go into calendar 2017 or not?

So we have been working on reducing our SA&G, overhead expenses and also structurally reducing our material costs. We have the diverted more of our R&D resources to focus on cost reductions in the last 2 years, and we have increased focus on efficiency improvement and structural cost reduction activities broadly and in general. 
Now with such as of reduction activities, we expect to improve our pretax income by at least $500 million by the end of 2018 if large ag downturn persists at current levels. Now I should also say our internal goals and targets are even larger. Having said this, you should also note that we are balancing structural cost reductions with investments for the future, and we remain committed to maintaining manufacturing capacity to board the support the eventual turnaround."

John Deere today reported solid financial results for the third quarter, and did so in spite of the continuing impact of the global farm recession and difficult conditions in the construction equipment sector. All of Deere's businesses remained profitable for the quarter and earnings per share was slightly higher than last year. 
Operating profit for our Ag & Turf division and for the equipment businesses overall was above last year's levels, even though sales were down nearly $1 billion. Our results were helped by the sound execution of our operating plans, the impact of a broad product portfolio and our success keeping a tight rein on costs and assets. 
Now let's take a closer look at the third quarter in detail, beginning on Slide 3. Net sales and revenues were down 11% to about $6.7 billion. Net income attributable to Deere & Company was $489 million. EPS was $1.55 in the quarter. 
On Slide 4, we see that worldwide, equipment operations net sales were down 14% to just under $5.9 billion. Price realization in the quarter was positive by 2 points. Currency translation was negative by 2 points. 
Turning to our review of our individual businesses, let's start with Agriculture & Turf on Slide 5. Net sales for the division were down 11% in the quarter-over-quarter comparison, with the decrease primarily due to lower shipment volumes in the United States and Canada. Also affecting sales was the negative impact of foreign currency exchange. 
Operating profit was $571 million. Ag & Turf operating margins were 12.1% in the quarter. The gain on the sale of a partial interest in SiteOne Landscape Supply contributed nearly 2 points of operating margin in the quarter. Even excluding the SiteOne impact, operating margins were above the levels of last year's third quarter. 
Before we review the industry sales outlook, we're pleased to welcome Deere's Chief Economist, Dr. J.B. Penn. He will spend a few minutes sharing his thoughts on the state of the global ag economy. J.B.?"

I would begin with a bit of context that might be useful as we ponder the outlook. Slide #6 shows the strong tailwinds that now drive the global agricultural economy. Major changes in agriculture and food markets began occurring sometime aro",1385,"Thanks, Josh. I would begin with a bit of context that might be useful as we ponder the outlook. Slide #6 shows the strong tailwinds that now drive the global agricultural economy. Major changes in agriculture and food markets began occurring sometime around the turn of the century, and that ushered in a dozen or so unparalleled years characterized by strong demand growth, record-high prices and farm incomes, food price spikes, expanded investment in innovation and increased trade. 
A convergence of forces was responsible: global population growth; widespread global economic growth, especially in emerging market and developing countries; rapid urbanization and biofuels. Now in 2000, the UN was projecting that the population would grow from 6.1 billion in that year to 9.3 billion by 2050. Today, that projection for 2050 is 9.7 billion. So that's another 2.4 billion from today's 7.3 billion people. 
Although having slowed somewhat, the global expansion continues, especially across much of the developing world, bringing millions more into the middle class and enabling ongoing improvements in diet. On urbanization, we passed the 50% mark of population sometime around 2010, and that is now expected to approach 70% by 2050, with implications for food production and trade. 
Now Slide #7 reflects global ag as a whole, showing the production and consumption of all global grains. Now perhaps the most noteworthy point of the slide, and one often overlooked with all the focus on supply, acreage and yield, and that is the persistent consumption growth. Consumption remains very strong, still rising steadily year after year, and it has risen without fail every year since 1994, '95, even including the Great Recession of 2009. 
Now fueled by earlier high prices and after 4 consecutive great growing seasons worldwide, commodity supplies now are fully adequate to meet all needs. Prices, of course, have moved off the previously high levels and farmer margins have narrowed. 
Slide #8 provides more details, showing global stockholdings and the supply-to-use ratio. While carryover stocks have reached levels of 15 years ago in physical quantities, it is important to remember that we are now consuming 1/3 more grains. So the supply-use ratio is the key indicator. 
While it has moved above the average of recent years, it remains in a sensitive area and especially so when viewed with Chinese grain stocks excluded. Notably, the Chinese are thought to hold about 45% of the global stocks, and the supply-use ratio actually had ticked down the last couple of years when the Chinese stocks are excluded. 
Now Slide 9 illustrates that even with abundant supply, the production consumption balance still could shift rather quickly. Any significant production disruption will tilt the supply-use ratio downward and prices will immediately move higher. The recent price movements, in response to reports of relatively minor weather events, certainly highlight the continued sensitivity. 
You will note from the slide that both corn and soy futures were trading in a rather narrow range in the first 4 months of this year, then we saw some reports of adverse weather in Brazil and Argentina in April. Prices quickly reflected the uncertainty that brought. Corn moved almost $0.90 a bushel or higher. Soy moved $3.25 a bushel or higher. That's an increase of 25% for corn, 36% for soy. 
Then by late June, the South American weather conditions abated, followed by the early July USDA WASDE report indicating larger acreages of both corn and soy. The weather premium quickly disappeared from the corn price and it was reduced for soy. 
Now just for reference, the U.S. drought in 2012 reduced corn yields 22% below trend, pushing ending stocks to barely 800 million bushels and prices to a new-record high. But this year, a corn yield reduction of only 4% would have been sufficient to reduce ending stocks to 1 billion bushels and pushed prices to $5 per bushel or higher, a further illustration of the sensitive supply utilization balance. 
Now there was some expectation that farmers would reduce acreage in response to the softer prices as we came into the Northern Hemisphere planting season. On Slide 10, we note that despite the softer prices, farmers worldwide did not reduce acreage. Now in the United States, farmer supply response this year was influenced by market prices, of course, which provided a pared but still positive margin. But they were also influenced by foreign program subsidies, revenue insurance and production cost declines. 
For example of the subsidy, the agricultural program ARC-County forecast of 2015 payments for Illinois is $0.37 per bushel on corn-based acres and $0.98 per bushel on soybean-based acres. So as a result of this combination, U.S. farmers this year expanded planted area for all major crops, except wheat, illustrating continued profitability despite softer prices. 
Now we also expected a similar reduction in other parts of the world, but we noted there that farmer supply response was influenced largely by currency values and also some cost issues, notably in Argentina. And this crop year, major exporters expanded grain and oilseed area all around the world. And grains and oilseeds were up 3.7% in South America. As an example, Brazilian farmers saw corn prices in real of $5.24 per bushel in September 2015 compared to $3.43 per bushel the year before, indicating that it was still very profitable to continue to expand. 
Now Slide #11 speaks to the financial condition of the U.S. farm sector. Overall, the farm sector balance sheet remains strong. Farmer debt has been well managed. The financial indicators are still solid. It was not until 2000 that farm sector equity reached $1 trillion. But then it took only 10 more years to add a second $1 trillion, and 5 years later we've added another $0.5 trillion. 
Now a major part of that balance sheet, of course, is farmland, and USDA forecast land prices to decline in 2016, crop land to decline 1%. This is the first time since 2009 and only the second time in almost 3 decades. 
Now Slide 12 summarizes the situation across the global ag sector. As I noted, supplies are fully adequate. The risk premia have been erased from the grain markets. We saw very little reduction coming into the year in response to the lower prices. And that was because of the aberrational forces at play, the subsidies, the risk measures and also currency values, which boosted commodity prices. And we're in the fourth consecutive favorable weather year. So adding all of those things together, barring adverse weather events, little near-term improvement in ag market condition is anticipated. But we would note that the long-term drivers: population growth, incomes growth and urbanization are still intact. 
Now Slide 13 pertains to the U.S. ag sector. And we note that farming is still profitable despite softer prices, as evidenced by the continued expansion of planted acres this year, and financial conditions across the sector remain solid. There is some individual farmer stress to be sure, but no widespread stress is yet evident. 
And finally, Slide #14 lists some key factors that are worth watching in the coming months. And in the short term, of course, weather is key. We know that demand is strong. We now know that supply depends upon the weather. So it's still weather is the major market disruptor and it's still one season at a time. Attention now will turn from North America to the Southern Hemisphere as the planting/growing season gets underway there in late September and October. We'll continue to watch that until next spring in the northern hemisphere when we'll start focusing on planting and growing conditions here. 
And over the longer term, I would just note that any of these geopolitical hotspots that could erupt and become a drag on global GDP would be a negative. Lots of other things to watch include relative currency values, the political situation in several countries, Central Bank behavior all over the world. 
And so I would just conclude by noting that after a dozen years of unprecedented prosperity, planting, commodity price, food price and trading patterns are now stabilizing. A new commodity price trading range with favorable weather is emerging, and weather remains the major commodity market disruptor. The outlook is still one year at a time, depending upon the weather. 
I will now turn the call back to Josh."

Our 2016 Ag & Turf industry outlooks are summarized on Slide 15. You'll note there are no changes from our previous forecast. Low commodity prices, weakening farm incomes and elevated used equipment levels in the U.S. and Canada are continuing to pressure demand for farm equipment, especially high horsepower models. 
We expect industry sales in the U.S. and Canada to be down about 15% to 20% for 2016, with sales of large ag equipment down 25% to 30%. The EU 28 industry outlook remains flat to down 5%, due to lower crop prices and farm incomes as well as persistent pressure on the dairy sector. 
In South America, industry sales of tractors and combines are expected to be down 15% to 20% in 2016. This is a reflection of a downturn in Brazil and other commodity-driven markets in the region. 
Shifting to Asia. The industry sales outlook continues to be flat to down slightly. This is due in part to weakness in China, partially offset by improving conditions in India, where the monsoon rains have been higher than normal. 
Turning to another product category. Industry retail sales of turf and utility equipment in the U.S. and Canada are projected to be flat to up 5% in 2016, again, no change from our prior forecast. 
Putting this all together on Slide 16. Fiscal year 2016 Deere sales of worldwide Ag & Turf equipment are forecast to be down about 8%, including about 2 points of negative currency translation. This is unchanged from the previous forecast. Our forecast for the Ag & Turf division's operating margin is now about 7.7% for the year, with an implied detrimental margin of about 15%. 
Now let's focus on Construction & Forestry on Slide 17. Net sales were down 24% in the quarter and operating profit was down 58%, due mainly to lower shipment volumes and an unfavorable product mix. The division's decremental margin was 20%. 
Moving to Slide 18. The economic indicators noted at the bottom of the slide, although down somewhat from the previous quarter, remained positive. Notwithstanding these positive signals, the market demand for construction equipment continued to soften. Among the factors contributing to the weakness: conditions in oil and gas sector continued to be slow, with the impacts most pronounced in the energy-producing regions of the U.S. and Canada; contractors are less apt to replenish or grow their machine fleets when faced with uncertain markets; rental utilization rates continued to decline, leading to a reduction in fleet sizes and higher levels of used equipment; also, housing starts in the U.S. for single-family homes, which require more earthmoving equipment, remain well below the long-term average. 
As a result, Deere's Construction & Forestry sales are now forecast to be down about 18% in 2016. Currency translation is forecast to be negative by about 1 point. The global forestry market forecast remain down 5% to 10%, primarily as a result of lower sales in the U.S. and Canada. C&F's full year operating margin is now projected to be about 4.1%. The implied decremental margin for the year is about 31%. 
Let's move now to our Financial Services. Slide 19 shows the annualized provision for credit losses as a percent of the average owned portfolio, which was 24 basis points at the end of July. This reflects the continued excellent quality of our portfolios. The financial forecast for 2016 contemplates a loss provision of about 23 basis points, unchanged from the previous forecast. The provision remains below the 10-year average of 26 basis points and well below the 15-year average of 39 basis points. 
Moving to Slide 20. Worldwide Financial Services net income attributable to the Deere & Company was $126 million in the third quarter versus $153 million last year. Lower results for the quarter were primarily due to less favorable financing spreads, a higher provision for credit losses and higher losses on lease residual values. The division's forecast net income attributable to Deere & Company remains at $480 million for the year. 
Slide 21 outlines receivables and inventories. For the company as a whole, receivables and inventories ended the quarter down $764 million. We expect to end the year with total receivables and inventories down about $500 million, with reductions coming from both divisions. Field inventory to sales ratios for new large ag equipment are expected to end the year in line with 2015 year-end levels, which is consistent with our previous forecast. C&F's inventory and receivables to sales ratios are forecast to end the year roughly in line with last year's level as well. 
Our 2016 guidance for cost of sales as a percent of net sales shown on Slide 22 is about 78.7%. When modeling 2016, keep these unfavorable factors in mind: an unfavorable product mix and engine emission costs. On the favorable side, we expect: price realization of about 1 point; favorable raw material costs; lower pension and expense OPEB and lower incentive compensation expense. 
Now let's look at a few housekeeping items. With respect to R&D on Slide 23, R&D was down 2% in the third quarter. Our forecast calls for R&D to be down about 1% for the full year, including about 1 point of negative currency translation. This is consistent with our previous forecast. 
Moving now to Slide 24. SA&G expense for the equipment operations was down 10% in the third quarter. Most of the decline was attributable to incentive compensation, commissions to dealers, pension and OPEB and currency translation. 
Turning to Slide 25. Our 2016 forecast contemplates SA&G expense being down about 5%, with incentive compensation, currency translation and pension and OPEB accounting for about 6 points of the full year change. 
On Slide 26, pension and OPEB expense was down $53 million in the quarter and is now forecast to be down about $210 million in 2016. 
On Slide 27, the equipment operations tax rate was 31% in the quarter and is now forecast to be in the range of 29% to 31% for the full year. 
Slide 28 shows our equipment operations history of strong cash flow. Cash flow from the equipment operations is forecast to be about $2.1 billion in 2016. 
The company's fourth quarter financial outlook is on Slide 29. Net sales for the quarter are forecast to be down about 8% compared with 2015. This includes about 1 point of price realization and favorable currency translation of about 1 point. 
Turning to Slide 30 and the full year outlook. The forecast now calls for net sales to be down about 10%. Price realization is expected to be positive by about 1 point, with negative currency translation of about 2 points. Finally, our forecast now calls for net income attributable to Deere & Company to be about $1.35 billion for the full year. 
In closing, Deere continues to perform well in the face of challenging market conditions, and this is particularly true in relation to previous farm recessions. Our performance in the third quarter and for the year-to-date underscores our success developing a more durable business model and a wider range of revenue sources. 
At the same time, we're continuing to look for ways to make our operations more profitable and efficient by seeking out further structural cost reductions. All in all, we remain confident in the company's present direction and believe Deere is on the right track to deliver significant value to its customers and investors in the years ahead. 
I'll now turn the call back over to Tony."

And",211,"Thanks, Tim. Yes, I mean, as you might imagine, and we talked last quarter and even the early part of the third quarter where sentiment was a bit more positive as those commodity prices were up, and as you mentioned there, that can change in a hurry. And it certainly, with the commodity prices coming down, I think it's fair to say that the overall mood would be less positive than it was a couple of months ago even. Related to the spring seasonal equipment, we just finished the first phase -- remember, these are multi-phase early order programs. So I want to stress this is -- it's still quite early. But we did see, on some of those key products like planters and sprayers, as well as spring tillage equipment, we are seeing those early order programs down year-over-year. But if you think about the magnitude of that decrease, considerably less of a reduction versus where we were a year ago. In fact, if you look at just planter EOP in particular, which is often considered a good indicator for large ag in this current environment, orders are down in the single-digit range. So just to give you an idea, but again, I would stress that it is quite early."

On lower sales, the operating margins were higher. Obviously, price realization continues to be very strong. You point out the SiteOne gain. That was about $75 million. I think Josh indicated just under 2 points of margin there. But really, a lot of it was cost management. And so we have lower production costs, things like, obviously, incentive comp. Material costs continued to be a tailwind for us. Obviously, we have a little higher Tier 4 emissions cost. SA&G was also lower. So those were some of the positives. Obviously, volume and FX continue to be drags on the profitability as well. If you look out in the fourth quarter, I think a couple of things to keep in mind. One is mix shifts. So as you think about the production, a couple of our key factories in particular, you think about Waterloo with large tractors, as well as Harvester Works, will see a considerably lower production in the fourth quarter of '16 versus '15. Just to put some context around that, Harvester Works for combines would be about a 60% reduction in output hours, and Waterloo is about a 20% reduction in output hours. So a couple of very profitable products for us that the production will be down pretty considerably. The other thing that I think that's worth noting is material costs. That's been a nice tailwind for us through the first 3 quarters of the year. That actually becomes more flattish. It's slightly negative, but really more flattish in the fourth quarter. So you lose the tailwind in the quarter would be the other item I'd point out. So those are probably the biggest differences as you move into the fourth quarter."

But keep in mind, seasonality does create a challenge in terms of even keeping things flat. So I would say that is kind of as expected, at least in line with what we would expect. We would hope to see and certainly expect to see progress continue to resume in fourth quarter, with that number continuing to move back down. But to your point, we still have a significant amount of work to do yet this year, but even into 2017. So that kind of talks to the inventory balance a bit. I think when you look at the balance sheet of dealers in the pricing and the valuation of ag equipment, generally, what we're hearing is the dealers are feeling a little better about the income -- or the equipment that they do have and the value that it's had on their balance sheet. We've seen some pricing stabilization on used equipment. So again, I think things are stabilizing, but I want to be clear. We have a lot of work on the actual level of used inventory at our dealers that will continue into 2017."

My question really is looking at production levels as we're going through the fourth quarter and actually into next year.

So it suggests that there's either plant shutdowns coming now or in early '17. And that has -- will probably have some weight on the $0.35 that you're sort of projecting for the fourth quarter.

We're saying ag are going to be in line. As a percent of sales, they'll be in line. So that's implying large ag is down pretty considerably when you look at field inventory. So again, the reason we're clarifying that is since we talked earlier in the year, when you're looking at total ag inventories and receivables, you have small ag in there as well and we've seen some increases there. But if you look at just large ag, we have taken pretty considerable reductions in the year to keep those inventory and receivable levels in line with the sales when we get to the end of October. So I think that that's probably the most important statement. In regard to 2017 shutdowns and production schedule, we'll talk more about that next quarter when we have the 2017 outlook.

When we refer to pool funds, at least in the U.S. and Canada, those funds are only for used equipment. They earn them on the sale of new equipment, but it's really the funds that are available for them to provide incentives for the sale of used. So we often talk about one way they can use those is for helping to subsidize the floor planning that they have of used equipment as well as actual retail. And so we do tend to manage that. There was a period of time where we were starting to see a shift towards more use of wholesale financing and floor planning, but that has shifted back to a very attractive use on actual retail and pretty much in line with what we would expect. So that's been a positive trend that we saw really early in the year, and it's continued through the year on pool funds. So another question around there that I'll throw in as a bonus, if you look at pool funds in aggregate, we would say, certainly, as we look at that relative to used inventory, we would be comfortable in aggregate. But as we said before, there are clearly some dealers who we would look at and say their pool funds are too light relative to the used equipment that they have. And that's when we have those individual conversations with those specific dealers. But in aggregate, still at healthy levels."

I mean, if you ask me today which market was likely, if I had to pick one, which one has the best likelihood of being up, I think  I'd have to say Brazil or South America in general. One of the things to keep in mind is, and we talked about this throughout the year is, a lot of the downturn there has been related to the uncertainty around the government and the overall economy. Farmers have been pretty profitable. As a result of that, with the new government, at least today, there appears to be a more positive sentiment. The inflation is coming down as an example. So the overall economy seems to be showing some level of improvement. And in the short term, we're seeing that in the order book as well. Now the question there is remember, there is a conversion to Tier 3, what we consider Tier 3 in -- on January 1 in Brazil on large ag equipment. So that will let dealers know and customers know that will come with a price increase. So undoubtedly, some of the, at least, short-term order book activity we're seeing is the strength around that buying equipment ahead of the Tier 3 conversion. So the real question remains, will we continue to see that demand surge as we go into calendar 2017 or not? But again, I think there's some fairly favorable signs that would indicate that, that could possibly be the case."

We have mentioned in the past that each of our units planned for the mid-cycle trough and peak scenarios in addition to the following years' forecast. And you will note -- you will have noted, our decremental margin performance in the last 3 years show how well we have executed in this downturn. Now as a result of our disciplined process, our margins have improved about 300 basis points at mid-cycle volumes now compared to mid-cycle volumes in 2010. So we have been working on reducing our SA&G, overhead expenses and also structurally reducing our material costs. We have diverted more of our R&D resources to focus on cost reductions in the last 2 years, and we have increased focus on efficiency improvement and structural cost reduction activities broadly and in general. Now with such structural cost reduction activities, we expect to improve our pretax income by at least $500 million by the end of 2018 if large ag downturn persists at current levels. Now I should also say our internal goals and targets are even larger. Having said this, you should also note that we are balancing structural cost reductions with investments for the future, and we remain committed to maintaining manufacturing capacity to support an eventual turnaround.

John Deere today reported solid financial results for the third quarter, and did so in spite of the continuing impact of the global farm recession and difficult conditions in the construction equipment sector. All of Deere's businesses remained profitable for the quarter and earnings per share was slightly higher than last year. 
Operating profit for our Ag & Turf division and for the equipment businesses overall was above last year's levels, even though sales were down nearly $1 billion. Our results were helped by the sound execution of our operating plans, the impact of a broad product portfolio and our success keeping a tight rein on costs and assets. 
Now let's take a closer look at the third quarter in detail, beginning on Slide 3. Net sales and revenues were down 11% to about $6.7 billion. Net income attributable to Deere & Company was $489 million. EPS was $1.55 in the quarter. 
On Slide 4, we see that worldwide, equipment operations net sales were down 14% to just under $5.9 billion. Price realization in the quarter was positive by 2 points. Currency translation was negative by 2 points. 
Turning to our review of our individual businesses, let's start with Agriculture & Turf on Slide 5. Net sales for the division were down 11% in the quarter-over-quarter comparison, with the decrease primarily due to lower shipment volumes in the United States and Canada. Also affecting sales was the negative impact of foreign currency exchange. 
Operating profit was $571 million. Ag & Turf operating margins were 12.1% in the quarter. The gain on the sale of a partial interest in SiteOne Landscape Supply contributed nearly 2 points of operating margin in the quarter. Even excluding the SiteOne impact, operating margins were above the levels of last year's third quarter. 
Before we review the industry sales outlook, we're pleased to welcome Deere's Chief Economist, Dr. J.B. Penn. He will spend a few minutes sharing his thoughts on the state of the global ag economy. J.B.?"

Major changes in agriculture and food markets began occurring sometime aro",1384,"Thanks, Josh. I would begin with a bit of context that might be useful as we ponder the outlook. Slide #6 shows the strong tailwinds that now drive the global agricultural economy. Major changes in agriculture and food markets began occurring sometime around the turn of the century, and that ushered in a dozen or so unparalleled years characterized by strong demand growth, record-high prices and farm incomes, food price spikes, expanded investment in innovation and increased trade. 
A convergence of forces was responsible: global population growth; widespread global economic growth, especially in emerging market and developing countries; rapid urbanization and biofuels. Now in 2000, the UN was projecting that the population would grow from 6.1 billion in that year to 9.3 billion by 2050. Today, that projection for 2050 is 9.7 billion. So that's another 2.4 billion from today's 7.3 billion people. 
Although having slowed somewhat, the global expansion continues, especially across much of the developing world, bringing millions more into the middle class and enabling ongoing improvements in diet. On urbanization, we passed the 50% mark of population sometime around 2010, and that is now expected to approach 70% by 2050, with implications for food production and trade. 
Now Slide #7 reflects global ag as a whole, showing the production and consumption of all global grains. Now perhaps the most noteworthy point of the slide, and one often overlooked with all the focus on supply, acreage and yield, and that is the persistent consumption growth. Consumption remains very strong, still rising steadily year after year, and it has risen without fail every year since 1994, '95, even including the Great Recession of 2009. 
Now fueled by earlier high prices and after 4 consecutive great growing seasons worldwide, commodity supplies now are fully adequate to meet all needs. Prices, of course, have moved off the previously high levels and farmer margins have narrowed. 
Slide #8 provides more details, showing global stockholdings and the supply-to-use ratio. While carryover stocks have reached levels of 15 years ago in physical quantities, it is important to remember that we are now consuming 1/3 more grains, so the supply-use ratio is the key indicator. While it has moved above the average of recent years, it remains in a sensitive area and especially so when viewed with Chinese grain stocks excluded. Notably, the Chinese are thought to hold about 45% of the global stocks, and the supply-use ratio actually had ticked down the last couple of years when the Chinese stocks are excluded. 
Now Slide 9 illustrates that even with abundant supply, the production consumption balance still could shift rather quickly. Any significant production disruption will tilt the supply-use ratio downward and prices will immediately move higher. The recent price movements, in response to reports of relatively minor weather events, certainly highlight this continued sensitivity. 
You will note from the slide that both corn and soy futures were trading at a rather narrow range in the first 4 months of this year, then we saw some reports of adverse weather in Brazil and Argentina in April. Prices quickly reflected the uncertainty that brought. Corn moved almost $0.90 a bushel or higher. Soy moved $3.25 a bushel or higher. That's an increase of 25% for corn, 36% for soy. 
Then by late June, the South American weather conditions abated, followed by the early July USDA WASDE report indicating larger acreages of both corn and soy. The weather premium quickly disappeared from the corn price and it was reduced for soy. 
Now just for reference, the U.S. drought in 2012 reduced corn yields 22% below trend, pushing ending stocks to barely 800 million bushels and prices to new-record highs. But this year, a corn yield reduction of only 4% would have been sufficient to reduce ending stocks to 1 billion bushels and pushed prices to $5 per bushel or higher, a further illustration of the sensitive supply utilization balance. 
Now there was some expectation that farmers would reduce acreage in response to the softer prices as we came into the Northern Hemisphere planting season. On Slide 10, we note that despite the softer prices, farmers worldwide did not reduce acreage. Now in the United States, farmer supply response this year was influenced by market prices, of course, which provided a pared but still positive margin. But they were also influenced by foreign program subsidies, revenue insurance and production cost declines. 
For example of the subsidy, the agricultural program ARC-County forecast of 2015 payments for Illinois is $0.37 per bushel on corn-based acres and $0.98 per bushel on soybean-based acres. So as a result of this combination, U.S. farmers this year expanded planted area for all major crops, except wheat, illustrating continued profitability despite softer prices. 
Now we also expected a similar reduction in other parts of the world, but we noted there that farmer supply response was influenced largely by currency values and also some policy shifts, notably in Argentina. In this crop year, major exporters expanded grain and oilseed area all around the world. And grains and oilseeds were up 3.7% in South America. As an example, Brazilian farmers saw corn prices in real of $5.24 per bushel in September 2015 compared to $3.43 per bushel the year before, indicating that it was still very profitable to continue to expand. 
Now Slide #11 speaks to the financial condition of the U.S. farm sector. Overall, the farm sector balance sheet remains strong. Farmer debt has been well managed. The financial indicators are still solid. It was not until 2000 that farm sector equity reached $1 trillion. But then it took only 10 more years to add a second $1 trillion, and 5 years later we've added another $0.5 trillion. 
Now a major part of that balance sheet, of course, is farmland, and USDA forecasts land prices to decline in 2016, crop land to decline 1%. This is the first time since 2009 and only the second time in almost 3 decades. 
Now Slide 12 summarizes the situation across the global ag sector. As I noted, supplies are fully adequate. The risk premia have been erased from the grain markets. We saw very little reduction coming into the year in response to the lower prices. And that was because of the aberrational forces at play, the subsidies, the risk measures and also currency values, which boosted commodity prices. And we're in the fourth consecutive favorable weather year. So adding all of those things together, barring adverse weather events, little near-term improvement in ag market condition is anticipated. But we would note that the long-term drivers: population growth, incomes growth and urbanization are still intact. 
Now Slide 13 pertains to the U.S. ag sector. And we note that farming is still profitable despite softer prices, as evidenced by the continued expansion of planted acres this year, and financial conditions across the sector remain solid. There is some individual farmer stress to be sure, but no widespread stress is yet evident. 
And finally, Slide #14 lists some key factors that are worth watching in the coming months. And in the short term, of course, weather is key. We know that demand is strong. We now know that supply depends upon the weather. So it's still weather is the major market disruptor and it's still one season at a time. Attention now will turn from North America to the Southern Hemisphere as the planting/growing season gets underway there in late September and October. We'll continue to watch that until next spring in the northern hemisphere when we'll start focusing on planting and growing conditions here. 
And over the longer term, I would just note that any of these geopolitical hotspots that could erupt and become a drag on global GDP would be a negative. Lots of other things to watch include relative currency values, the political situation in several countries, Central Bank behavior all over the world. 
And so I would just conclude by noting that after a dozen years of unprecedented prosperity, planting, commodity price, food price and trading patterns are now stabilizing. A new commodity price trading range with favorable weather is emerging, and weather remains the major commodity market disruptor. The outlook is still one year at a time, depending upon the weather. 
I will now turn the call back to Josh."

Our 2016 Ag & Turf industry outlooks are summarized on Slide 15. You'll note there are no changes from our previous forecast. Low commodity prices, weakening farm incomes and elevated used equipment levels in the U.S. and Canada are continuing to pressure demand for farm equipment, especially high horsepower models. 
We expect industry sales in the U.S. and Canada to be down about 15% to 20% for 2016, with sales of large ag equipment down 25% to 30%. The EU 28 industry outlook remains flat to down 5%, due to lower crop prices and farm incomes as well as persistent pressure on the dairy sector. 
In South America, industry sales of tractors and combines are expected to be down 15% to 20% in 2016. This is a reflection of a downturn in Brazil and other commodity-driven markets in the region. 
Shifting to Asia. The industry sales outlook continues to be flat to down slightly. This is due in part to weakness in China, partially offset by improving conditions in India, where the monsoon rains have been higher than normal. 
Turning to another product category. Industry retail sales of turf and utility equipment in the U.S. and Canada are projected to be flat to up 5% in 2016, again, no change from our prior forecast. 
Putting this all together on Slide 16. Fiscal year 2016 Deere sales of worldwide Ag & Turf equipment are forecast to be down about 8%, including about 2 points of negative currency translation. This is unchanged from the previous forecast. Our forecast for the Ag & Turf division's operating margin is now about 7.7% for the year, with an implied decremental margin of about 15%. 
Now let's focus on Construction & Forestry on Slide 17. Net sales were down 24% in the quarter and operating profit was down 58%, due mainly to lower shipment volumes and an unfavorable product mix. The division's decremental margin was 20%. 
Moving to Slide 18. The economic indicators noted at the bottom of the slide, although down somewhat from the previous quarter, remained positive. Notwithstanding these positive signals, the market demand for construction equipment continued to soften. Among the factors contributing to the weakness: conditions in oil and gas sector continued to be slow, with the impacts most pronounced in the energy-producing regions of the U.S. and Canada; contractors are less apt to replenish or grow their machine fleets when faced with uncertain markets; rental utilization rates continued to decline, leading to a reduction in fleet sizes and higher levels of used equipment; also, housing starts in the U.S. for single-family homes, which require more earthmoving equipment, remain well below the long-term average. 
As a result, Deere's Construction & Forestry sales are now forecast to be down about 18% in 2016. Currency translation is forecast to be negative by about 1 point. The global forestry market forecast remains down 5% to 10%, primarily as a result of lower sales in the U.S. and Canada. C&F's full year operating margin is now projected to be about 4.1%. The implied decremental margin for the year is about 31%. 
Let's move now to our Financial Services. Slide 19 shows the annualized provision for credit losses as a percent of the average owned portfolio, which was 24 basis points at the end of July. This reflects the continued excellent quality of our portfolios. The financial forecast for 2016 contemplates a loss provision of about 23 basis points, unchanged from the previous forecast. The provision remains below the 10-year average of 26 basis points and well below the 15-year average of 39 basis points. 
Moving to Slide 20. Worldwide Financial Services net income attributable to the Deere & Company was $126 million in the third quarter versus $153 million last year. Lower results for the quarter were primarily due to less favorable financing spreads, a higher provision for credit losses and higher losses on lease residual values. The division's forecast net income attributable to Deere & Company remains at $480 million for the year. 
Slide 21 outlines receivables and inventories. For the company as a whole, receivables and inventories ended the quarter down $764 million. We expect to end the year with total receivables and inventories down about $500 million, with reductions coming from both divisions. Field inventory to sales ratios for new large ag equipment are expected to end the year in line with 2015 year-end levels, which is consistent with our previous forecast. C&F's inventory and receivables to sales ratios are forecast to end the year roughly in line with last year's level as well. 
Our 2016 guidance for cost of sales as a percent of net sales shown on Slide 22 is about 78.7%. When modeling 2016, keep these unfavorable factors in mind: an unfavorable product mix and engine emission costs. On the favorable side, we expect: price realization of about 1 point; favorable raw material costs; lower pension and expense OPEB and lower incentive compensation expense. 
Now let's look at a few housekeeping items. With respect to R&D on Slide 23, R&D was down 2% in the third quarter. Our forecast calls for R&D to be down about 1% for the full year, including about 1 point of negative currency translation. This is consistent with our previous forecast. 
Moving now to Slide 24. SA&G expense for the equipment operations was down 10% in the third quarter. Most of the decline was attributable to incentive compensation, commissions to dealers, pension and OPEB and currency translation. 
Turning to Slide 25. Our 2016 forecast contemplates SA&G expense being down about 5%, with incentive compensation, currency translation and pension and OPEB accounting for about 6 points of the full year change. 
On Slide 26, pension and OPEB expense was down $53 million in the quarter and is now forecast to be down about $210 million in 2016. 
On Slide 27, the equipment operations tax rate was 31% in the quarter and is now forecast to be in the range of 29% to 31% for the full year. 
Slide 28 shows our equipment operations history of strong cash flow. Cash flow from the equipment operations is forecast to be about $2.1 billion in 2016. 
The company's fourth quarter financial outlook is on Slide 29. Net sales for the quarter are forecast to be down about 8% compared with 2015. This includes about 1 point of price realization and favorable currency translation of about 1 point. 
Turning to Slide 30 and the full year outlook. The forecast now calls for net sales to be down about 10%. Price realization is expected to be positive by about 1 point, with negative currency translation of about 2 points. Finally, our forecast now calls for net income attributable to Deere & Company to be about $1.35 billion for the full year. 
In closing, Deere continues to perform well in the face of challenging market conditions, and this is particularly true in relation to previous farm recessions. Our performance in the third quarter and for the year-to-date underscores our success developing a more durable business model and a wider range of revenue sources. 
At the same time, we're continuing to look for ways to make our operations more profitable and efficient by seeking out further structural cost reductions. All in all, we remain confident in the company's present direction and believe Deere is on the right track to deliver significant value to its customers and investors in the years ahead. 
I'll now turn the call back over to Tony."

Yes, I mean, as you might imagine, and we talked last quarter and even the early part of the third quarter where sentiment was a bit more positive as those commodity prices were up, and as you mentioned there, that can change in a hurry. And it certainly, with the commodity prices coming down, I think it's fair to say that the overall mood would be less positive than it was a couple of months ago even. Related to the spring seasonal equipment, we just finished the first phase -- remember, these are multi-phase early order programs. So I want to stress this is -- it's still quite early. But we did see, on some of those key products like planters and sprayers, as well as spring tillage equipment, we are seeing those early order programs down year-over-year. But if you think about the magnitude of that decrease, considerably less of a reduction versus where we were a year ago. In fact, if you look at just planter EOP in particular, which is often considered a good indicator for large ag in this current environment, orders are down in the single-digit range. So just to give you an idea, but again, I would stress that it is quite early."

On lower sales, the operating margins were higher. Obviously, price realization continues to be very strong. You point out the SiteOne gain. That was about $75 million. I think Josh indicated just under 2 points of margin there. But really, a lot of it was cost management. And so we had lower production costs, things like, obviously, incentive comp. Material costs continued to be a tailwind for us. Obviously, we had a little higher Tier 4 emissions cost. SA&G was also lower. So those were some of the positives. Obviously, volume and FX continue to be drags on the profitability as well. If you look out in the fourth quarter, I think a couple of things to keep in mind. One is mix shifts. So as you think about the production, a couple of our key factories in particular, you think about Waterloo with large tractors, as well as Harvester Works, will see a considerably lower production in the fourth quarter of '16 versus '15. Just to put some context around that, Harvester Works for combines would be about a 60% reduction in output hours, and Waterloo is about a 20% reduction in output hours. So a couple of very profitable products for us that the production will be down pretty considerably. The other thing that I think that's worth noting is material costs. That's been a nice tailwind for us through the first 3 quarters of the year. That actually becomes more flattish. It's slightly negative, but really more flattish in the fourth quarter. So you lose the tailwind in the quarter would be the other item I'd point out. So those are probably the biggest differences as you move into the fourth quarter."

We would hope to see and certainly expect to see progress continue to resume in fourth quarter, with that number continuing to move back down. But to your point, we still have a significant amount of work to do yet this year, but even into 2017. So that kind of talks to the inventory balance a bit. I think when you look at the balance sheet of dealers in the pricing and the valuation of ag equipment, generally, what we're hearing is that dealers are feeling a little better about the income -- or the equipment that they do have and the value that it's had on their balance sheet. We've seen some pricing stabilization on used equipment. So again, I think things are stabilizing, but I want to be clear. We have a lot of work on the actual level of used inventory at our dealers that will continue into 2017."

I mean, it was really money managers that drove it more than the free market. That's public data, by the way. My question really is looking at production levels as we going into the fourth quarter and actually into next year. You've indicated your inventory level will be sort of about the same place in '15, but we're talking about a U.S. market that's down 20%, 25% and almost 30% in big tractors and probably may have some minor fall next year. So it suggests that there's either plant shutdowns coming now or in early '17. And that has -- will probably have some weight on the $0.35 that you're sort of projecting for the fourth quarter. Can you give us some color on how production levels -- you started a little bit on how far down the fourth quarter will be -- but the inventory is not going to go away. The big shock in -- for farmers..."

We're not saying that the field inventory levels are the same. We're saying ag [ph] are going to be in line, as a percent of sales, they'll be in line. So that's implying large ag is down pretty considerably when you look at field inventory. So again, the reason we're clarifying that is since we talked earlier in the year, when you're looking at total ag inventories and receivables, you have small ag in there as well and we've seen some increases there. But if you look at just large ag, we have taken pretty considerable reductions in the year to keep those inventory and receivable levels in line with the sales when we get to the end of October. So I think that that's probably the most important statement. In regard to 2017 shutdowns and production schedule, we'll talk more about that next quarter when we have the 2017 outlook. So anyway, appreciate the question and we'll move on to the next caller."

When we refer to pool funds, at least in the U.S. and Canada, those funds are only for used equipment. They earn them on the sale of new equipment, but it's really the funds that are available for them to provide incentives for the sale of used. So we often talk about one way they can use those is for helping to subsidize the floor planning that they have of used equipment as well as actual retail. And so we do tend to manage that. There was a period of time where we were starting to see a shift towards more use of wholesale financing and floor planning, but that has shifted back to a very attractive use on actual retail and pretty much in line with what we would expect. So that's been a positive trend that we saw really early in the year, and it's continued through the year on pool funds. So another question around there that I'll throw in as a bonus, if you look at pool funds in aggregate, we would say, certainly, as we look at that relative to used inventory, we would be comfortable in aggregate. But as we said before, there are clearly some dealers who we would look at and say their pool funds are too light relative to the used equipment that they have. And that's when we have those individual conversations with those specific dealers. But in aggregate, still at healthy levels."

Obviously, the forecasted income for Financial Services stayed the same, all positive signs. But to your point, I would say, in the near term, short to midterm, there's still certainly risk. As we look at future maturities, we continue to work hard to reduce the return rate on those maturities as well as finding more effective ways to dispose of those when they get returned so that the loss rates are not as significant. But as long as we stay at these lower levels, as long as used equipment prices continue to be at more depressed levels, I think that continues to bear watching and certainly has risks. So while we take some comfort in the short term with the stabilization we saw in the quarter, it's going to be a while before we're willing to say we're out of the woods there. And so to your point, stay tuned. And certainly, we would be begin to cite that as some additional risk."

One of the things to keep in mind is, and we talked about this throughout the year is, a lot of the downturn there has been related to the uncertainty around the government and the overall economy. Farmers have been pretty profitable. As a result of that, with the new government, at least today, there appears to be a more positive sentiment. The inflation is coming down as an example. So the overall economy seems to be showing some level of improvement. And in the short term, we're seeing that in the order book as well. Now the question there is remember, there is a conversion to Tier 3, what we consider Tier 3 in -- on January 1 in Brazil on large ag equipment. So that will let dealers know and customers know that will come with a price increase. So undoubtedly, some of the, at least, short-term order book activity we're seeing is the strength around that buying equipment ahead of the Tier 3 conversion. So the real question remains, will we continue to see that demand surge as we go into calendar 2017 or not?

And so as a result, we've decided that we will wait. We do expect in November that we'll have -- again, it'll still be pretty -- it'll still be very preliminary. But we will have our first 2007 (sic) [ 2017 ] cash receipts outlook. I would tell you if you look at our number, I would call it flattish at this point, year-over-year.

We have mentioned in the past that each of our units planned for the mid-cycle trough and peak scenarios in addition to the following years' forecast. And you will note -- you will have noted, our decremental margin performance in the last 3 years show how well we have executed in this downturn. Now as a result of our disciplined process, our margins have improved about 300 basis points at mid-cycle volumes now compared to mid-cycle volumes in 2010. So we have been working on reducing our SA&G, overhead expenses and also structurally reducing our material costs. We have diverted more of our R&D resources to focus on cost reductions in the last 2 years, and we have increased focus on efficiency improvement and structural cost reduction activities broadly and in general. Now with such structural cost reduction activities, we expect to improve our pretax income by at least $500 million by the end of 2018 if large ag downturn persists at current levels. Now I should also say our internal goals and targets are even larger.

John Deere today reported solid financial results for the third quarter, and did so in spite of the continuing impact of the global farm recession and difficult conditions in the construction equipment sector. All of Deere's businesses remained profitable for the quarter and earnings per share was slightly higher than last year. 
Operating profit for our Ag & Turf division and for the equipment businesses overall was above last year's levels, even though sales were down nearly $1 billion. Our results were helped by the sound execution of our operating plans, the impact of a broad product portfolio and our success keeping a tight rein on costs and assets. 
Now let's take a closer look at the third quarter in detail, beginning on Slide 3. Net sales and revenues were down 11% to about $6.7 billion. Net income attributable to Deere & Company was $489 million. EPS was $1.55 in the quarter. 
On Slide 4, we see that worldwide, equipment operations net sales were down 14% to just under $5.9 billion. Price realization in the quarter was positive by 2 points. Currency translation was negative by 2 points. 
Turning to our review of our individual businesses, let's start with Agriculture & Turf on Slide 5. Net sales for the division were down 11% in the quarter-over-quarter comparison, with the decrease primarily due to lower shipment volumes in the United States and Canada. Also affecting sales was the negative impact of foreign currency exchange. 
Operating profit was $571 million. Ag & Turf operating margins were 12.1% in the quarter. The gain on the sale of a partial interest in SiteOne Landscape Supply contributed nearly 2 points of operating margin in the quarter. Even excluding the SiteOne impact, operating margins were above the levels of last year's third quarter. 
Before we review the industry sales outlook, we're pleased to welcome Deere's Chief Economist, Dr. J.B. Penn. He will spend a few minutes sharing his thoughts on the state of the global ag economy. J.B.?"
266112,326112456,1037694,"Deere & Company, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 19, 2016",2016-08-19,"Earnings Calls","Deere & Company","Executives","Thanks, Josh. I would begin with a bit of context that might be useful as we ponder the outlook. Slide #6 shows the strong tailwinds that now drive the global agricultural economy. Major changes in agriculture and food markets began occurring sometime aro",1384,"Thanks, Josh. I would begin with a bit of context that might be useful as we ponder the outlook. Slide #6 shows the strong tailwinds that now drive the global agricultural economy. Major changes in agriculture and food markets began occurring sometime around the turn of the century, and that ushered in a dozen or so unparalleled years characterized by strong demand growth, record-high prices and farm incomes, food price spikes, expanded investment in innovation and increased trade. 
A convergence of forces was responsible: global population growth; widespread global economic growth, especially in emerging market and developing countries; rapid urbanization and biofuels. Now in 2000, the UN was projecting that the population would grow from 6.1 billion in that year to 9.3 billion by 2050. Today, that projection for 2050 is 9.7 billion. So that's another 2.4 billion from today's 7.3 billion people. 
Although having slowed somewhat, the global expansion continues, especially across much of the developing world, bringing millions more into the middle class and enabling ongoing improvements in diet. On urbanization, we passed the 50% mark of population sometime around 2010, and that is now expected to approach 70% by 2050, with implications for food production and trade. 
Now Slide #7 reflects global ag as a whole, showing the production and consumption of all global grains. Now perhaps the most noteworthy point of the slide, and one often overlooked with all the focus on supply, acreage and yield, and that is the persistent consumption growth. Consumption remains very strong, still rising steadily year after year, and it has risen without fail every year since 1994, '95, even including the Great Recession of 2009. 
Now fueled by earlier high prices and after 4 consecutive great growing seasons worldwide, commodity supplies now are fully adequate to meet all needs. Prices, of course, have moved off the previously high levels and farmer margins have narrowed. 
Slide #8 provides more details, showing global stockholdings and the supply-to-use ratio. While carryover stocks have reached levels of 15 years ago in physical quantities, it is important to remember that we are now consuming 1/3 more grains, so the supply-use ratio is the key indicator. While it has moved above the average of recent years, it remains in a sensitive area and especially so when viewed with Chinese grain stocks excluded. Notably, the Chinese are thought to hold about 45% of the global stocks, and the supply-use ratio actually had ticked down the last couple of years when the Chinese stocks are excluded. 
Now Slide 9 illustrates that even with abundant supply, the production consumption balance still could shift rather quickly. Any significant production disruption will tilt the supply-use ratio downward and prices will immediately move higher. The recent price movements, in response to reports of relatively minor weather events, certainly highlight this continued sensitivity. 
You will note from the slide that both corn and soy futures were trading at a rather narrow range in the first 4 months of this year, then we saw some reports of adverse weather in Brazil and Argentina in April. Prices quickly reflected the uncertainty that brought. Corn moved almost $0.90 a bushel or higher. Soy moved $3.25 a bushel or higher. That's an increase of 25% for corn, 36% for soy. 
Then by late June, the South American weather conditions abated, followed by the early July USDA WASDE report indicating larger acreages of both corn and soy. The weather premium quickly disappeared from the corn price and it was reduced for soy. 
Now just for reference, the U.S. drought in 2012 reduced corn yields 22% below trend, pushing ending stocks to barely 800 million bushels and prices to new-record highs. But this year, a corn yield reduction of only 4% would have been sufficient to reduce ending stocks to 1 billion bushels and pushed prices to $5 per bushel or higher, a further illustration of the sensitive supply utilization balance. 
Now there was some expectation that farmers would reduce acreage in response to the softer prices as we came into the Northern Hemisphere planting season. On Slide 10, we note that despite the softer prices, farmers worldwide did not reduce acreage. Now in the United States, farmer supply response this year was influenced by market prices, of course, which provided a pared but still positive margin. But they were also influenced by foreign program subsidies, revenue insurance and production cost declines. 
For example of the subsidy, the agricultural program ARC-County forecast of 2015 payments for Illinois is $0.37 per bushel on corn-based acres and $0.98 per bushel on soybean-based acres. So as a result of this combination, U.S. farmers this year expanded planted area for all major crops, except wheat, illustrating continued profitability despite softer prices. 
Now we also expected a similar reduction in other parts of the world, but we noted there that farmer supply response was influenced largely by currency values and also some policy shifts, notably in Argentina. In this crop year, major exporters expanded grain and oilseed area all around the world. And grains and oilseeds were up 3.7% in South America. As an example, Brazilian farmers saw corn prices in real of $5.24 per bushel in September 2015 compared to $3.43 per bushel the year before, indicating that it was still very profitable to continue to expand. 
Now Slide #11 speaks to the financial condition of the U.S. farm sector. Overall, the farm sector balance sheet remains strong. Farmer debt has been well managed. The financial indicators are still solid. It was not until 2000 that farm sector equity reached $1 trillion. But then it took only 10 more years to add a second $1 trillion, and 5 years later we've added another $0.5 trillion. 
Now a major part of that balance sheet, of course, is farmland, and USDA forecasts land prices to decline in 2016, crop land to decline 1%. This is the first time since 2009 and only the second time in almost 3 decades. 
Now Slide 12 summarizes the situation across the global ag sector. As I noted, supplies are fully adequate. The risk premia have been erased from the grain markets. We saw very little reduction coming into the year in response to the lower prices. And that was because of the aberrational forces at play, the subsidies, the risk measures and also currency values, which boosted commodity prices. And we're in the fourth consecutive favorable weather year. So adding all of those things together, barring adverse weather events, little near-term improvement in ag market condition is anticipated. But we would note that the long-term drivers: population growth, incomes growth and urbanization are still intact. 
Now Slide 13 pertains to the U.S. ag sector. And we note that farming is still profitable despite softer prices, as evidenced by the continued expansion of planted acres this year, and financial conditions across the sector remain solid. There is some individual farmer stress to be sure, but no widespread stress is yet evident. 
And finally, Slide #14 lists some key factors that are worth watching in the coming months. And in the short term, of course, weather is key. We know that demand is strong. We now know that supply depends upon the weather. So it's still weather is the major market disruptor and it's still one season at a time. Attention now will turn from North America to the Southern Hemisphere as the planting/growing season gets underway there in late September and October. We'll continue to watch that until next spring in the northern hemisphere when we'll start focusing on planting and growing conditions here. 
And over the longer term, I would just note that any of these geopolitical hotspots that could erupt and become a drag on global GDP would be a negative. Lots of other things to watch include relative currency values, the political situation in several countries, Central Bank behavior all over the world. 
And so I would just conclude by noting that after a dozen years of unprecedented prosperity, planting, commodity price, food price and trading patterns are now stabilizing. A new commodity price trading range with favorable weather is emerging, and weather remains the major commodity market disruptor. The outlook is still one year at a time, depending upon the weather. 
I will now turn the call back to Josh."

Our 2016 Ag & Turf industry outlooks are summarized on Slide 15. You'll note there are no changes from our previous forecast. Low commodity prices, weakening farm incomes and elevated used equipment levels in the U.S. and Canada are continuing to pressure demand for farm equipment, especially high horsepower models. 
We expect industry sales in the U.S. and Canada to be down about 15% to 20% for 2016, with sales of large ag equipment down 25% to 30%. The EU 28 industry outlook remains flat to down 5%, due to lower crop prices and farm incomes as well as persistent pressure on the dairy sector. 
In South America, industry sales of tractors and combines are expected to be down 15% to 20% in 2016. This is a reflection of a downturn in Brazil and other commodity-driven markets in the region. 
Shifting to Asia. The industry sales outlook continues to be flat to down slightly. This is due in part to weakness in China, partially offset by improving conditions in India, where the monsoon rains have been higher than normal. 
Turning to another product category. Industry retail sales of turf and utility equipment in the U.S. and Canada are projected to be flat to up 5% in 2016, again, no change from our prior forecast. 
Putting this all together on Slide 16. Fiscal year 2016 Deere sales of worldwide Ag & Turf equipment are forecast to be down about 8%, including about 2 points of negative currency translation. This is unchanged from the previous forecast. Our forecast for the Ag & Turf division's operating margin is now about 7.7% for the year, with an implied decremental margin of about 15%. 
Now let's focus on Construction & Forestry on Slide 17. Net sales were down 24% in the quarter and operating profit was down 58%, due mainly to lower shipment volumes and an unfavorable product mix. The division's decremental margin was 20%. 
Moving to Slide 18. The economic indicators noted at the bottom of the slide, although down somewhat from the previous quarter, remained positive. Notwithstanding these positive signals, the market demand for construction equipment continued to soften. Among the factors contributing to the weakness: conditions in oil and gas sector continued to be slow, with the impacts most pronounced in the energy-producing regions of the U.S. and Canada; contractors are less apt to replenish or grow their machine fleets when faced with uncertain markets; rental utilization rates continued to decline, leading to a reduction in fleet sizes and higher levels of used equipment; also, housing starts in the U.S. for single-family homes, which require more earthmoving equipment, remain well below the long-term average. 
As a result, Deere's Construction & Forestry sales are now forecast to be down about 18% in 2016. Currency translation is forecast to be negative by about 1 point. The global forestry market forecast remains down 5% to 10%, primarily as a result of lower sales in the U.S. and Canada. C&F's full year operating margin is now projected to be about 4.1%. The implied decremental margin for the year is about 31%. 
Let's move now to our Financial Services. Slide 19 shows the annualized provision for credit losses as a percent of the average owned portfolio, which was 24 basis points at the end of July. This reflects the continued excellent quality of our portfolios. The financial forecast for 2016 contemplates a loss provision of about 23 basis points, unchanged from the previous forecast. The provision remains below the 10-year average of 26 basis points and well below the 15-year average of 39 basis points. 
Moving to Slide 20. Worldwide Financial Services net income attributable to the Deere & Company was $126 million in the third quarter versus $153 million last year. Lower results for the quarter were primarily due to less favorable financing spreads, a higher provision for credit losses and higher losses on lease residual values. The division's forecast net income attributable to Deere & Company remains at $480 million for the year. 
Slide 21 outlines receivables and inventories. For the company as a whole, receivables and inventories ended the quarter down $764 million. We expect to end the year with total receivables and inventories down about $500 million, with reductions coming from both divisions. Field inventory to sales ratios for new large ag equipment are expected to end the year in line with 2015 year-end levels, which is consistent with our previous forecast. C&F's inventory and receivables to sales ratios are forecast to end the year roughly in line with last year's level as well. 
Our 2016 guidance for cost of sales as a percent of net sales shown on Slide 22 is about 78.7%. When modeling 2016, keep these unfavorable factors in mind: an unfavorable product mix and engine emission costs. On the favorable side, we expect: price realization of about 1 point; favorable raw material costs; lower pension and expense OPEB and lower incentive compensation expense. 
Now let's look at a few housekeeping items. With respect to R&D on Slide 23, R&D was down 2% in the third quarter. Our forecast calls for R&D to be down about 1% for the full year, including about 1 point of negative currency translation. This is consistent with our previous forecast. 
Moving now to Slide 24. SA&G expense for the equipment operations was down 10% in the third quarter. Most of the decline was attributable to incentive compensation, commissions to dealers, pension and OPEB and currency translation. 
Turning to Slide 25. Our 2016 forecast contemplates SA&G expense being down about 5%, with incentive compensation, currency translation and pension and OPEB accounting for about 6 points of the full year change. 
On Slide 26, pension and OPEB expense was down $53 million in the quarter and is now forecast to be down about $210 million in 2016. 
On Slide 27, the equipment operations tax rate was 31% in the quarter and is now forecast to be in the range of 29% to 31% for the full year. 
Slide 28 shows our equipment operations history of strong cash flow. Cash flow from the equipment operations is forecast to be about $2.1 billion in 2016. 
The company's fourth quarter financial outlook is on Slide 29. Net sales for the quarter are forecast to be down about 8% compared with 2015. This includes about 1 point of price realization and favorable currency translation of about 1 point. 
Turning to Slide 30 and the full year outlook. The forecast now calls for net sales to be down about 10%. Price realization is expected to be positive by about 1 point, with negative currency translation of about 2 points. Finally, our forecast now calls for net income attributable to Deere & Company to be about $1.35 billion for the full year. 
In closing, Deere continues to perform well in the face of challenging market conditions, and this is particularly true in relation to previous farm recessions. Our performance in the third quarter and for the year-to-date underscores our success developing a more durable business model and a wider range of revenue sources. 
At the same time, we're continuing to look for ways to make our operations more profitable and efficient by seeking out further structural cost reductions. All in all, we remain confident in the company's present direction and believe Deere is on the right track to deliver significant value to its customers and investors in the years ahead. 
I'll now turn the call back over to Tony."

And it certainly, with the commodity prices coming down, I think it's fair to say that the overall mood would be less positive than it was a couple of months ago even. Related to the spring seasonal equipment, we just finished the first phase -- remember, these are multi-phase early order programs. So I want to stress this is -- it's still quite early. But we did see, on some of those key products like planters and sprayers, as well as spring tillage equipment, we are seeing those early order programs down year-over-year. But if you think about the magnitude of that decrease, considerably less of a reduction versus where we were a year ago. In fact, if you look at just planter EOP in particular, which is often considered a good indicator for large ag in this current environment, orders are down in the single-digit range. So just to give you an idea, but again, I would stress that it is quite early."

On lower sales, the operating margins were higher. Obviously, price realization continues to be very strong. You point out the SiteOne gain. That was about $75 million. I think Josh indicated just under 2 points of margin there. But really, a lot of it was cost management. And so we had lower production costs, things like, obviously, incentive comp. Material costs continued to be a tailwind for us. Obviously, we had a little higher Tier 4 emissions cost. SA&G was also lower. So those were some of the positives. Obviously, volume and FX continue to be drags on the profitability as well. If you look out in the fourth quarter, I think a couple of things to keep in mind. One is mix shifts. So as you think about the production, a couple of our key factories in particular, you think about Waterloo with large tractors, as well as Harvester Works, will see a considerably lower production in the fourth quarter of '16 versus '15. Just to put some context around that, Harvester Works for combines would be about a 60% reduction in output hours, and Waterloo is about a 20% reduction in output hours. So a couple of very profitable products for us that the production will be down pretty considerably. The other thing that I think that's worth noting is material costs. That's been a nice tailwind for us through the first 3 quarters of the year. That actually becomes more flattish. It's slightly negative, but really more flattish in the fourth quarter. So you lose the tailwind in the quarter would be the other item I'd point out. So those are probably the biggest differences as you move into the fourth quarter."

But keep in mind, seasonality does create a challenge in terms of even keeping things flat. So I would say that is kind of as expected, at least in line with what we would expect. We would hope to see and certainly expect to see progress continue to resume in fourth quarter, with that number continuing to move back down. But to your point, we still have a significant amount of work to do yet this year, but even into 2017. So that kind of talks to the inventory balance a bit. I think when you look at the balance sheet of dealers in the pricing and the valuation of ag equipment, generally, what we're hearing is that dealers are feeling a little better about the income -- or the equipment that they do have and the value that it's had on their balance sheet. We've seen some pricing stabilization on used equipment. So again, I think things are stabilizing, but I want to be clear. We have a lot of work on the actual level of used inventory at our dealers that will continue into 2017."

So it suggests that there's either plant shutdowns coming now or in early '17. And that has -- will probably have some weight on the $0.35 that you're sort of projecting for the fourth quarter.

So that's implying large ag is down pretty considerably when you look at field inventory. So again, the reason we're clarifying that is since we talked earlier in the year, when you're looking at total ag inventories and receivables, you have small ag in there as well and we've seen some increases there. But if you look at just large ag, we have taken pretty considerable reductions in the year to keep those inventory and receivable levels in line with the sales when we get to the end of October. So I think that that's probably the most important statement. In regard to 2017 shutdowns and production schedule, we'll talk more about that next quarter when we have the 2017 outlook.

When we refer to pool funds, at least in the U.S. and Canada, those funds are only for used equipment. They earn them on the sale of new equipment, but it's really the funds that are available for them to provide incentives for the sale of used. So we often talk about one way they can use those is for helping to subsidize the floor planning that they have of used equipment as well as actual retail. And so we do tend to manage that. There was a period of time where we were starting to see a shift towards more use of wholesale financing and floor planning, but that has shifted back to a very attractive use on actual retail and pretty much in line with what we would expect. So that's been a positive trend that we saw really early in the year, and it's continued through the year on pool funds. So another question around there that I'll throw in as a bonus, if you look at pool funds in aggregate, we would say, certainly, as we look at that relative to used inventory, we would be comfortable in aggregate. But as we said before, there are clearly some dealers who we would look at and say their pool funds are too light relative to the used equipment that they have.

One of the things to keep in mind is, and we talked about this throughout the year is, a lot of the downturn there has been related to the uncertainty around the government and the overall economy. Farmers have been pretty profitable. As a result of that, with the new government, at least today, there appears to be a more positive sentiment. The inflation is coming down as an example. So the overall economy seems to be showing some level of improvement. And in the short term, we're seeing that in the order book as well. Now the question there is remember, there is a conversion to Tier 3, what we consider Tier 3 in -- on January 1 in Brazil on large ag equipment. So that will let dealers know and customers know that will come with a price increase. So undoubtedly, some of the, at least, short-term order book activity we're seeing is the strength around that buying equipment ahead of the Tier 3 conversion. So the real question remains, will we continue to see that demand surge as we go into calendar 2017 or not?

I think was also a worth noting is the short-term leases and the activity there is down significantly. And so a lot of the actions that we were taking at the end of second quarter and into third quarter were focused on reducing those short-term leases. And that has been effective, and so we're pleased with that. Certainly, I think again, we -- and we said this before. Our preference would always be a retail note over an operating lease. But to the extent our customers continue to prefer an operating lease, our obligation there is to make sure we're structuring those in a way that John Deere Financial continues to be profitable. So that's what we're focused on. Last quarter, we did raise residual values, can't say across the board, but pretty much across the board, not just on short-term leases. But -- I'm sorry, we reduced residual values pretty much across the board last quarter to try to correct some of those challenges that we have been facing."

And if you look at some of the eastern part of the -- in the EU 28 with subsidies and timing of when subsidies were released again. And then when you look at France, I mean, you're starting to see some indication that the crop there is certainly not what many had hoped. And so you've seen some weakness there.

So there have been some questions around our third quarter margins and fourth quarter margins and around 2017, what to expect. And I just wanted to make a few comments along those lines. We have mentioned in the past that each of our units planned for the mid-cycle trough and peak scenarios in addition to the following years' forecast. And you will note -- you will have noted, our decremental margin performance in the last 3 years show how well we have executed in this downturn. Now as a result of our disciplined process, our margins have improved about 300 basis points at mid-cycle volumes now compared to mid-cycle volumes in 2010. So we have been working on reducing our SA&G, overhead expenses and also structurally reducing our material costs. We have diverted more of our R&D resources to focus on cost reductions in the last 2 years, and we have increased focus on efficiency improvement and structural cost reduction activities broadly and in general. Now with such structural cost reduction activities, we expect to improve our pretax income by at least $500 million by the end of 2018 if large ag downturn persists at current levels. Now I should also say our internal goals and targets are even larger. Having said this, you should also note that we are balancing structural cost reductions with investments for the future, and we remain committed to maintaining manufacturing capacity to support an eventual turnaround.

As in prior quarters, our performance was helped by the sound execution of our operating plans, the impact of a broad product portfolio and our success keeping a tight rein on costs and assets. 
For the full year, the company had earnings of $1.52 billion, a top 10-year [ph]. In our view, that's a noteworthy achievement in light of tough business conditions and certainly well above the levels we've experienced in previous downturns. For 2017, we're looking for similar overall market conditions with a slight decline being forecast for sales and earnings. 
Now let's take a closer look at the fourth quarter in detail, beginning on Slide 4. Net sales and revenues were down 3% to $6.52 billion. Net income attributable to Deere & Company was $285 million. EPS was $0.90 in the quarter. 
On Slide 5, total worldwide equipment operations net sales were down 5% to $5.65 billion. Price realization in the quarter was positive by 3 points. Currency translation was favorable by 1 point. 
Turning to a review of our individual businesses. Let's start with Agriculture & Turf on Slide 6. Net sales were down 5% in the quarter-over-quarter comparison. Lower sales were recorded in most regions of the world, mainly in the U.S. and Canada. One notable exception was South America, which experienced higher sales led by Brazil and Argentina. Operating profit was $371 million and operating margins were 8.4% in the quarter. The increase in operating profit was primarily driven by price realization, and to a lesser extent, by lower pension and OPEB expense, material and production cost. 
Before we review the industry sales outlook, let's look at some of the fundamentals affecting the ag business. Slide 7 outlines U.S. farm cash receipts. Given the large crop harvest in 2015, and consequently to lower commodity prices we're seeing today, our 2016 forecast calls for cash receipts to be down about 6% from 2015's levels. 
Moving to 2017. We expect total cash receipts to be approximately $367 billion, about the same as in 2016, as lower livestock cash receipts are offset by higher crop receipts. 
On Slide 8. Global grain and oilseed stocks-to-use ratios are forecast to remain at elevated but generally unchanged levels in 2016 and '17, as abundant crops are mostly offset by strong demand conditions around the world. Chinese grain and oilseed stocks have continued to increase in 2016 with supply, domestic production plus imports outpacing demand. Chinese stocks of grains and oilfields now represents almost half of the world's stocks. Given these stocks are unlikely to be exported, the world market is sensitive to any production setbacks or major geopolitical disruptions. World cotton stocks have now fallen for second consecutive season and to the lowest level in 5 seasons, reflecting lower planting and stronger global demand. 
Our economic outlook for the EU 28 is on Slide 9. Geopolitical risks, such as Brexit, remain elevated, contributing to the outlook for slow economic growth. Farm incomes remain under pressure and is below long-term average especially after a poor harvest in France. The dairy sector continues to experience weakness, although there are signs the market is bottoming out. As a result, industry farm machinery demand in the EU region is expected to be down about 5% in 2017. 
On Slide 10. You'll see economic fundamentals outlined for other targeted growth markets. In China, slower economic growth persists and ag policy changes are causing short-term uncertainty for most domestic and global markets. As a result, we anticipate lower industry sales. 
Turning to India. The government continues to focus on reviving growth in the ag sector and improving farm incomes. The value of agricultural production is expected to increase as a result of normal rains after 2 years of below average monsoons. These factors are expected to drive increased industry demand in India. 
Shifting to Brazil. Slide 11 illustrates the crop value of agricultural production, a good proxy for the health of agri business. Ag production is expected to increase about 7% in 2017 in U.S. dollar terms due to a recovering corn and the continued increase in ethanol demand. From a local currency perspective, the change is about 6%. Ag fundamentals remain positive, and farmer confidence is at its highest levels since 2013 due to improved political stability and signs of economic progress. We expect these factors to lead to higher industry equipment sales. 
Staying in Brazil, Slide 12 illustrates the finance rates for ag equipment. Moderfrota rates announced earlier this year remain at 8.5% for small and midsized farmers, and 10.5% for large farmers. The government's ongoing commitment to agricultural [ph] continues, and indications of shifting budgets to ensure availability of funds for Moderfrota are positive signals for the farm sector in Brazil. 
Our 2017 Ag & Turf industry outlooks are summarized on Slide 13. Industry sales in the U.S. and Canada are forecasted to be down 5% to 10%, with the effects being felt in both large and small models of equipment. Still, there are signs the large ag market is nearing bottom, as indicated by the fact that the declines expected in 2017 is less than we saw in 2016. The EU 28 industry outlook is forecasted to be down about 5% in 2017 due to low crop prices and farm incomes, as well as persistent pressure on the dairy sector. In South America, industry sales of tractors and combines are projected to be up about 15% in 2017, a reflection of the factors already discussed for Brazil, as well as positive industry sentiment in Argentina. Shifting to Asia. Sales are expected to be flat to up slightly with growth in India being the main driver. 
Turning to another product category. Industry retail sales of turf and utility equipment in the U.S. and Canada are projected to be roughly flat in 2017, with Deere sales outpacing the industry. Putting this all together, on Slide 14, fiscal year 2017 Deere sales of worldwide Ag & Turf equipment are forecasted to be down about 1%, including about 1 point of positive currency translation. The Ag & Turf division operating margin is forecast to be about 8.5% in 2017. 
Now let's focus on Construction & Forestry on Slide 15. Net sales were down 5% in the quarter due to lower shipment volumes and higher sales incentive costs, both mainly driven by the U.S. market. The U.S. and Canadian markets continue to be extremely competitive and the pricing environment remains challenging. The division incurred an operating loss of $17 million in the quarter due to higher sales incentive costs and impairment charge for international operations of $25 million and higher production costs. The division's decremental margin was 33% for the full year. 
Moving to Slide 16, and looking at the economic indicators on the bottom part of the slide. GDP growth is positive. Construction spending is increasing and housing starts are expected to exceed 1 million units again this year. In spite of these positive signals, the market demand for construction equipment continues to be weak. Factors contributing to the weakness have not changed dramatically over the past quarter. Conditions in the oil and gas sector, for example, continue to be slow. Also, construction contractors are delaying fleet replenishment because of the uncertain markets. Rental utilization rate declines persist, leading to a reduction in fleet and elevated levels of used inventory. Housing starts in the U.S. for single-family homes remain below the long-term average, and multifamily home construction is flowing due to overbuilding in some parts of the country. On balance, [ph] Deere's Construction & Forestry sales are expected to be up about 1% in 2017, with positive currency translation of about 1 point. 
Global forestry markets are expected to be roughly flat in 2017. C&F's full year operating margin is projected to be about 3.5%. Let's move now to our Financial Services operations. Slide 17 shows the provision for credit losses as a percent of the average owned portfolio. The provision at the end of 2016 was 23 basis points, reflecting the continued excellent quality of our portfolios. The 2017 forecast anticipates a loss provision of about 29 basis points, up somewhat from historically low levels of recent years. This puts the provision just above [ph] the 10-year average of 26 basis points, though below the 15-year average of 34 basis points. 
Moving to Slide 18. Worldwide Financial Services net income attributable to Deere & Company was $110 million in the fourth quarter versus $153 million last year. 2016 net income attributable to Deere & Company was $468 million compared with $633 million in 2015. The lower results for both periods were primarily due to less favorable financing spreads, higher losses on residual values and the higher provision for credit losses. Also, remember that full year 2015 results benefited from a gain on the sale of our crop insurance business of about $30 million. Deere's worldwide Financial Services operations is expected to earn about $480 million in 2017. The outlook reflects lower losses on lease residual values, partially offset by less favorable financing spreads and an increased provision for credit losses. 
Slide 19 outlines receivables and inventories. For the company as a whole, receivables and inventories ended the year down $517 million. They're expected to decline again in 2017 by about $250 million. For the year ahead, we expect to produce in line with retail demand for large ag equipment, while underproducing in the small ag sector, which is mostly related to midsized tractors and other livestock related products. 
Before getting into cost of sales, let's discuss the voluntary separation programs initiated during the fourth quarter of 2016 as part of efforts to improve our cost structure. As noted in today's earnings announcement, pretax expenses related to the program were $11 million in 2016, and will be about $105 million in 2017, most of which will be incurred in the first quarter. These expenses are recorded in the period employees accept the offer. While the voluntary separation programs up slide [ph] to salaried employees throughout the U.S., a vast majority of those accepting offers were within the equipment divisions. These cost have an impact on cost of sales, R&D and SA&G. Savings from the programs are expected to be about $75 million in 2017. 
Moving to Slide 20. Cost of sales as a percent of net sales for 2016 was 78% versus previous guidance of 78.7%, a result of structural cost reduction efforts. Our guidance for 2017 cost of sales is about 78%. When modeling 2017, keep these unfavorable impacts in mind: an unfavorable product mix, overhead spending and Tier 4 product cost. On the favorable side, we expect price realization of about 1 point and lower incentive compensation expense. Please note that our cost of sales guidance is flat with 2016 in spite of increasing commodity cost, higher pension and OPEB expenses and lower volume. 
Now let's look at some additional details, with respect to R&D expense on Slide 21. R&D was down 4% in the fourth quarter and 3% for the full year. Currency translation had a negative impact of 1% for the full year. Our 2017 forecast calls for R&D to be down about 3%. 
Moving now to Slide 22. SA&G expense for the equipment operations was up 3% in the fourth quarter, with commissions paid to dealers, incentive compensation, the voluntary separation programs and pension and OPEB expense accounting for 2 points of the change on a net basis. SA&G expense for the full year was down 5%, with currency translation, pension and OPEB expense and incentive compensation accounting for most of the change. Our 2017 forecast on Slide 23 shows SA&G expense being up about 1% with a net impact of about 2 points from the voluntary separation program, currency translation and incentive compensation. 
Turning to Slide 24. Pension and OPEB expense was down $53 million for the quarter, and down $200 million for the full year. The forecast for pension and OPEB expense for 2017 is up about $30 million. 
On Slide 25. The equipment operations tax rate was 32% in the quarter and 30% for the full year. The lower rate resulted mainly from discrete items. For 2017, the projected effective tax rate is forecast to be in the range of 33% to 35%. 
Slide 26 shows our equipment operations history of strong cash flow. Cash flow from the equipment operations was $2.9 billion in 2016, and is forecast to be about $2.5 billion in 2017.  
This 2017 outlook for the first quarter and full year is on Slide 27. Net sales for the quarter are forecast to be down about 4% compared with 2016. This includes about 1 point of price realization, and about 2 points of favorable currency translation. The full year forecast calls for net sales to be down about 1%. Price realization and favorable currency translation are each expected to be about 1 point. Finally, our full year 2017 net income forecast is about $1.4 billion. 
Comparing 2016 and 2017, Slide 28 shows a high-level reconciliation of operating profit for the equipment operations adjusted for special items. Operating profit was $1.88 billion for the equipment operations in 2016. Included were special items which require consideration. A $75 million pretax gain from the sale of a partial interest in SiteOne Landscape Supply, impairment charges for the C&F operations internationally of about $25 million and voluntary separation programs of $11 million. Adjusted for these factors, 2016 operating profit would have been $1.841 billion. 
Based on the guidance provided for net sales changes in 2017 and operating margins by segment, the implied operating profit for the equipment operations is forecast to be between $1.7 billion and $1.75 billion. Included were the following items of note: voluntary separation program cost of $96 million related to the equipment operations, pension and OPEB expenses of about $30 million, and other nonrecurring cost of about $55 million. After adjusting for these items, implied operating profit for 2017 is in the range of $1.88 billion to $1.93 billion. On an adjusted basis, the comparison shows an improvement between $40 million to $90 million for 2017 even with lower sales volumes, which are projected to be down about 3%. The lower volumes negatively impact the 2017 forecast. When considering these special and nonrecurring items, as well as the impact of lower volumes, they show the company is continuing to deliver improved operational performance due in part to structural cost reduction initiatives. 
I'll now turn the call over to our CFO, Raj Kalathur, for additional comments."

Last quarter, we talked about our plans to improve pretax profit by at least $500 million to a structural cost reduction by the end of 2018. Now these benefits would apply to 2016 volume levels. We expect to see the full benefit of the $500 million improvement in the year 2019 and beyond. These cost reduction efforts began in March of 2016, and contributed in excess of $90 million for the year 2016. The 2017 forecast includes an additional about $190 million of structural cost reduction. Here's some detail about where the $500 million in improvement is expected to come from. 
Number one, structural direct and indirect material cost reduction is the largest contributor of improvement, roughly 1/3. Now this is the result of leveraging existing supplier relationships, resourcing and designing costs out of [ph] our products. Second, people-related cost are the second largest category of reduction, about 1/5 of the total improvement. The warranty separation program, as just discussed, is a significant example. Other areas of improvement include changes to our variable pay structure, especially under trough conditions, as well as lower R&D spending and lower depreciation associated with lower capital expenditures. 
Overall, our teams are making good progress towards the 500-plus million goal, and we have confidence it will be realized, in conjunction with sound execution, disciplined cost management that allow us to continue delivering significantly better performance than in downturns of the past. And of course, these same factors will provide a continued benefit when market conditions strengthen. All in all then, we remain confident in our company's present direction, and believe Deere is well positioned to provide significant value to our customers and investors in the future."

We did have a significant level of maturities that occurred in the fourth quarter. In fact, if you look at October alone, the month of October in terms of what sales we had of matured leases, about 2 to 3x, the typical month that we've had, and again, that's on the sales side. So we did see again on our maturity, a pretty significant peak in the fall. We will, as we go forward, as you think about lease maturities, you'll continue to see some of those seasonal increases. So as we mentioned before, you'll see some increase in the spring generally, and then, again, in the fall. So typically, our second and fourth quarters is -- are the quarters that we'll see those. But at this point, we would anticipate what we thought fourth quarter 2016 would be the highest peak from a maturity perspective. Certainly, we continue to see customers continuing to elect operating leases at a bit higher levels than what we would have seen on a more historic basis. I think the current market conditions explained much of that. But I would also point out, it isn't at some of the extreme levels that I see being reported. If you look over the last 12 months, for example, so for 2016, if you look at just the retail financing of equipment, so comparing retail notes versus operating leases. Operating leases in terms of volumes coming in the door were about 25% of the total. That's up historically, we'd be in the mid to upper teens, so it's certainly at a more elevated level but not to the degree you're seeing expenses that some perhaps have reported. So hopefully give you a little bit of color on where we're at with the operating leases. But to your point, as we move forward especially when we get past second quarter with some of the changes that were made, at that point in time on the short-term leases, we would feel and then you're seeing is reflected in the forecast, a bit more confident on that front as we go into '17."

To your point, a portion of what we talked about with the structural cost reduction is going back to some of those applications on Final Tier 4 where we have first and foremost, found the most reliable solution. Now going back and looking at, are there ways we can still clearly meet those requirements that do so on a less expensive basis.

Keep in mind the challenge always on residual values is that's more about the wholesale perspective and the ability for dealers to purchase those -- that used equipment coming off, of lease and adding it to their use inventory level.

But again, very supportive order position on the North American large ag versus our forecast. If you think about outside and I think, maybe the most significant one is Brazil and South America, I think the question there that we talked about last quarter was, how much of that is simply pull ahead of Tier 3 conversion that I mentioned previously. And we are seeing strength in the order book beyond the January 1 date, so that really is where we're reflecting that higher level of sales for the full fiscal year. Certainly, you'll see some strength in the next couple of months, this month and December, ahead of that Tier 3.

And you see that reflected in our lower receivables and inventory next year for the ag deficient. Much of that is kind of that midsized equipment getting pulled down further in 2017. And some of that candidly as we ended the year, up higher than we would have liked on the 6,000 [ph] in particular. We talked a lot about that issue in the past.

And so what you're seeing in some of that underproduction, as I mentioned earlier, a lot of that underproduction is coming out of that midsized product, which again from a mix perspective, would be a bit more negative. So as you think about year-over-year strengths and weaknesses in the business, you're still seeing a fair level of weakness in some of that mid- to large equipment at least year-over-year with continued strength in the smaller end of the portfolio. So that's just from a product mix perspective and given where South American volumes are today, that geographic mix would be as attractive as what it would be if we were in more normal levels. So keep in mind, their productivity is significantly down as well and so that does put pressure there. So it's kind of a combination of those things.

I'll start with dairy though. I mean really what we're seeing there is in some of the dairy pricing, you're certainly starting to see some of that level -- you see some periods where dairy pricing was up pretty nicely. But it's early, but again, I think that's what we characterize it as we did. There are signs that it's bottoming, that doesn't mean it bottoms or things like recover, but that is a positive versus where we would have been even as early as last quarter incrementally in Europe. But if you think about more broadly, I mean clearly, I think maybe 2 of the more noteworthy regions there, France, which is our largest market, went through a very difficult harvest and harvest is down. Farm incomes are going to be lower. That's going to put pressure clearly on sales there, and coupled with that, as you're probably aware, there's a tax incentive program earlier in the year in France that did drive a lot of sales. And now, while it's still in place, not a lot of income for those French farmers. So unlikely to have anywhere near the type of advantages that did last year. So arguably, France will be a more challenged market. In the very short term, I want to emphasize that, it concerns around Brexit and so on could -- is expected to drive some benefit for the U.K. You've seen exports of the used equipment become much more attractive with the FX shifts. And in the short term, likely to see some higher level of sales as most of those customers that are expecting that there'll be some price increases. As most manufacturers are importing into the U.K. and so again, with the FX shift, that's likely to drive higher pricing and so they're buying ahead of that. So there would be some benefit again in the short term there. Longer term, obviously, that would likely have more downside than upside. So I think those are maybe a couple of the more significant and especially when you throw the dairy commentary, the more significant pieces of Europe as you think about 2017."

We've talked before about capacity being below 50% in most of those really across the board in large ag facilities. That wouldn't change with the ability to build the retail. Just keep in mind, while we did draw field inventory down last year, it wasn't as significant of a draw down as what we experienced for example in 2015. So again, you get benefit, but it's not like all of a sudden, those factories are running at highly efficient levels. So I think that's probably the most important thing to keep in mind. We haven't talked about the level of specifically what the underproduction was last year. But I think again, you're seeing that reflected in the overall outlook. If you look at the sales, while most of our markets especially our largest markets are now down 5 [ph] to 10 [ph] on a retail basis, you're seeing our sales reflecting a more positive trend than that.

As in prior quarters, our performance was he",2449,"John Deere today reported solid financial results for the fourth quarter, and did so in spite of the continuing impact of the global farm recession and difficult conditions in the construction equipment sector. As in prior quarters, our performance was helped by the sound execution of our operating plans, the impact of a broad product portfolio and our success keeping a tight rein on costs and assets. 
For the full year, the company had earnings of $1.52 billion, a top 10 year. In our view, that's a noteworthy achievement in light of tough business conditions, and certainly well above the levels we've experienced in previous downturns. For 2017, we're looking for similar overall market conditions with a slight decline being forecast for sales and earnings. 
Now let's take a closer look at the fourth quarter in detail, beginning on Slide 4. Net sales and revenues were down 3% to $6.52 billion. Net income attributable to Deere & Company was $285 million. EPS was $0.90 in the quarter. 
On Slide 5, total worldwide equipment operations net sales were down 5% to $5.65 billion. Price realization in the quarter was positive by 3 points. Currency translation was favorable by 1 point. 
Turning to a review of our individual businesses. Let's start with Agriculture & Turf on Slide 6. Net sales were down 5% in the quarter-over-quarter comparison. Lower sales were recorded in most regions of the world, mainly in the U.S. and Canada. One notable exception was South America, which experienced higher sales led by Brazil and Argentina. Operating profit was $371 million and operating margins were 8.4% in the quarter. The increase in operating profit was primarily driven by price realization, and to a lesser extent, by lower pension and OPEB expense, material and production cost. 
Before we review the industry sales outlook, let's look at some of the fundamentals affecting the ag business. Slide 7 outlines U.S. farm cash receipts. Given the large crop harvest in 2015, and consequently to lower commodity prices we're seeing today, our 2016 forecast calls for cash receipts to be down about 6% from 2015's levels. 
Moving to 2017. We expect total cash receipts to be approximately $367 billion, about the same as in 2016, as lower livestock cash receipts are offset by higher crop receipts. 
On Slide 8. Global grain and oilseed stocks-to-use ratios are forecast to remain at elevated but generally unchanged levels in 2016 and '17, as abundant crops are mostly offset by strong demand conditions around the world. Chinese grain and oilseed stocks have continued to increase in 2016 with supply, domestic production plus imports outpacing demand. Chinese stocks of grains and oilfields now represents almost half of the world's stocks. Given these stocks are unlikely to be exported, the world market is sensitive to any production setbacks or major geopolitical disruptions. World cotton stocks have now fallen for second consecutive season and to the lowest level in 5 seasons, reflecting lower planting and stronger global demand. 
Our economic outlook for the EU 28 is on Slide 9. Geopolitical risks, such as Brexit, remain elevated, contributing to the outlook for slow economic growth. Farm incomes remain under pressure and is below long-term average especially after a poor harvest in France. The dairy sector continues to experience weakness, although there are signs the market is bottoming out. As a result, industry farm machinery demand in the EU region is expected to be down about 5% in 2017. 
On Slide 10. You'll see economic fundamentals outlined for other targeted growth markets. In China, slower economic growth persists and ag policy changes are causing short-term uncertainty for most domestic and global markets. As a result, we anticipate lower industry sales. 
Turning to India. The government continues to focus on reviving growth in the ag sector and improving farm incomes. The value of agricultural production is expected to increase as a result of normal rains after 2 years of below average monsoons. These factors are expected to drive increased industry demand in India. 
Shifting to Brazil. Slide 11 illustrates the crop value of agricultural production, a good proxy for the health of agri business. Ag production is expected to increase about 7% in 2017 in U.S. dollar terms due to a recovering corn and the continued increase in ethanol demand. From a local currency perspective, the change is about 6%. Ag fundamentals remain positive, and farmer confidence is at its highest levels since 2013 due to improved political stability and signs of economic progress. We expect these factors to lead to higher industry equipment sales. 
Staying in Brazil, Slide 12 illustrates the finance rates for ag equipment. Moderfrota rates announced earlier this year remain at 8.5% for small and midsized farmers, and 10.5% for large farmers. The government's ongoing commitment to agricultural continues, and indications of shifting budgets to ensure availability of funds for Moderfrota are positive signals for the farm sector in Brazil. 
Our 2017 Ag & Turf industry outlooks are summarized on Slide 13. Industry sales in the U.S. and Canada are forecasted to be down 5% to 10%, with the effects being felt in both large and small models of equipment. Still, there are signs the large ag market is nearing bottom, as indicated by the fact that the declines expected in 2017 is less than we saw in 2016. The EU 28 industry outlook is forecasted to be down about 5% in 2017 due to low crop prices and farm incomes, as well as persistent pressure on the dairy sector. In South America, industry sales of tractors and combines are projected to be up about 15% in 2017, a reflection of the factors already discussed for Brazil, as well as positive industry sentiment in Argentina. Shifting to Asia. Sales are expected to be flat to up slightly with growth in India being the main driver. 
Turning to another product category. Industry retail sales of turf and utility equipment in the U.S. and Canada are projected to be roughly flat in 2017, with Deere sales outpacing the industry. Putting this all together, on Slide 14, fiscal year 2017 Deere sales of worldwide Ag & Turf equipment are forecasted to be down about 1%, including about 1 point of positive currency translation. The Ag & Turf division operating margin is forecast to be about 8.5% in 2017. 
Now let's focus on Construction & Forestry on Slide 15. Net sales were down 5% in the quarter due to lower shipment volumes and higher sales incentive costs, both mainly driven by the U.S. market. The U.S. and Canadian markets continue to be extremely competitive and the pricing environment remains challenging. The division incurred an operating loss of $17 million in the quarter due to higher sales incentive costs and impairment charge for international operations of $25 million and higher production costs. The division's decremental margin was 33% for the full year. 
Moving to Slide 16, and looking at the economic indicators on the bottom part of the slide. GDP growth is positive. Construction spending is increasing and housing starts are expected to exceed 1 million units again this year. In spite of these positive signals, the market demand for construction equipment continues to be weak. Factors contributing to the weakness have not changed dramatically over the past quarter. Conditions in the oil and gas sector, for example, continue to be slow. Also, construction contractors are delaying fleet replenishment because of the uncertain markets. Rental utilization rate declines persist, leading to a reduction in fleet and elevated levels of used inventory. Housing starts in the U.S. for single-family homes remain below the long-term average, and multifamily home construction is flowing due to overbuilding in some parts of the country. On balance, Deere's Construction & Forestry sales are forecasted to be up about 1% in 2017, with positive currency translation of about 1 point. Global forestry markets are expected to be roughly flat in 2017. C&F's full year operating margin is projected to be about 3.5%. 
Let's move now to our Financial Services operations. Slide 17 shows the provision for credit losses as a percent of the average owned portfolio. The provision at the end of 2016 was 23 basis points, reflecting the continued excellent quality of our portfolios. The 2017 forecast anticipates a loss provision of about 29 basis points, up somewhat from historically low levels of recent years. This puts the provision just above the 10-year average of 26 basis points, though below the 15-year average of 34 basis points. 
Moving to Slide 18. Worldwide Financial Services net income attributable to Deere & Company was $110 million in the fourth quarter versus $153 million last year. 2016 net income attributable to Deere & Company was $468 million compared with $633 million in 2015. The lower results for both periods were primarily due to less favorable financing spreads, higher losses on residual values and the higher provision for credit losses. Also, remember that full year 2015 results benefited from a gain on the sale of our crop insurance business of about $30 million. Deere's worldwide Financial Services operations is expected to earn about $480 million in 2017. The outlook reflects lower losses on lease residual values, partially offset by less favorable financing spreads and an increased provision for credit losses. 
Slide 19 outlines receivables and inventories. For the company as a whole, receivables and inventories ended the year down $517 million. They're expected to decline again in 2017 by about $250 million. For the year ahead, we expect to produce in line with retail demand for large ag equipment, while underproducing in the small ag sector, which is mostly related to midsized tractors and other livestock related products. 
Before getting into cost of sales, let's discuss the voluntary separation programs initiated during the fourth quarter of 2016 as part of efforts to improve our cost structure. As noted in today's earnings announcement, pretax expenses related to the program were $11 million in 2016, and will be about $105 million in 2017, most of which will be incurred in the first quarter. These expenses are recorded in the period employees accept the offer. While the voluntary separation programs up slide to salaried employees throughout the U.S., a vast majority of those accepting offers were within the equipment divisions. These costs have an impact on cost of sales, R&D and SA&G. Savings from the programs are expected to be about $75 million in 2017. 
Moving to Slide 20. Cost of sales as a percent of net sales for 2016 was 78% versus previous guidance of 78.7%, a result of structural cost reduction efforts. Our guidance for 2017 cost of sales is about 78%. When modeling 2017, keep these unfavorable impacts in mind: an unfavorable product mix, overhead spending and Tier 4 product cost. On the favorable side, we expect price realization of about 1 point and lower incentive compensation expense. Please note that our cost of sales guidance is flat with 2016 in spite of increasing commodity cost, higher pension and OPEB expenses and lower volume. 
Now let's look at some additional details, with respect to R&D expense on Slide 21. R&D was down 4% in the fourth quarter and 3% for the full year. Currency translation had a negative impact of 1% for the full year. Our 2017 forecast calls for R&D to be down about 3%. 
Moving now to Slide 22. SA&G expense for the equipment operations was up 3% in the fourth quarter, with commissions paid to dealers, incentive compensation, the voluntary separation programs and pension and OPEB expense accounting for 2 points of the change on a net basis. SA&G expense for the full year was down 5%, with currency translation, pension and OPEB expense and incentive compensation accounting for most of the change. Our 2017 forecast on Slide 23 shows SA&G expense being up about 1% with a net impact of about 2 points from the voluntary separation program, currency translation and incentive compensation. 
Turning to Slide 24. Pension and OPEB expense was down $53 million for the quarter, and down $200 million for the full year. The forecast for pension and OPEB expense for 2017 is up about $30 million. 
On Slide 25. The equipment operations tax rate was 32% in the quarter and 30% for the full year. The lower rate resulted mainly from discrete items. For 2017, the projected effective tax rate is forecast to be in the range of 33% to 35%. 
Slide 26 shows our equipment operations history of strong cash flow. Cash flow from the equipment operations was $2.9 billion in 2016, and is forecast to be about $2.5 billion in 2017.  
This 2017 outlook for the first quarter and full year is on Slide 27. Net sales for the quarter are forecast to be down about 4% compared with 2016. This includes about 1 point of price realization, and about 2 points of favorable currency translation. The full year forecast calls for net sales to be down about 1%. Price realization and favorable currency translation are each expected to be about 1 point. Finally, our full year 2017 net income forecast is about $1.4 billion. 
Comparing 2016 and 2017, Slide 28 shows a high-level reconciliation of operating profit for the equipment operations adjusted for special items. Operating profit was $1.88 billion for the equipment operations in 2016. Included were special items which require consideration. A $75 million pretax gain from the sale of a partial interest in SiteOne Landscape Supply, impairment charges for the C&F operations internationally of about $25 million and voluntary separation programs of $11 million. Adjusted for these factors, 2016 operating profit would have been $1.841 billion. 
Based on the guidance provided for net sales changes in 2017 and operating margins by segment, the implied operating profit for the equipment operations is forecast to be between $1.7 billion and $1.75 billion. Included were the following items of note: voluntary separation program cost of $96 million related to the equipment operations, pension and OPEB expenses of about $30 million, and other nonrecurring cost of about $55 million. After adjusting for these items, implied operating profit for 2017 is in the range of $1.88 billion to $1.93 billion. On an adjusted basis, the comparison shows an improvement between $40 million to $90 million for 2017 even with lower sales volumes, which are projected to be down about 3%. The lower volumes negatively impact the 2017 forecast. When considering these special and nonrecurring items, as well as the impact of lower volumes, they show the company is continuing to deliver improved operational performance due in part to structural cost reduction initiatives. 
I'll now turn the call over to our CFO, Raj Kalathur, for additional comments."

We expect to see the full benefit of the $500",282,"Thanks, Josh. Last quarter, we talked about our plans to improve pretax profit by at least $500 million to a structural cost reduction by the end of 2018. Now these benefits would apply to 2016 volume levels. We expect to see the full benefit of the $500 million improvement in the year 2019 and beyond. These cost reduction efforts began in March of 2016, and contributed in excess of $90 million for the year 2016. The 2017 forecast includes an additional about $190 million of structural cost reduction. Here's some detail about where the $500 million in improvement is expected to come from. 
Number one, structural direct and indirect material cost reduction is the largest contributor of improvement, roughly 1/3. Now this is the result of leveraging existing supplier relationships, resourcing and designing cost out of our products. Second, people-related cost are the second largest category of reduction, about 1/5 of the total improvement. The warranty separation program, as just discussed, is a significant example. Other areas of improvement include changes to our variable pay structure, especially under trough conditions, as well as lower R&D spending and lower depreciation associated with lower capital expenditures. 
Overall, our teams are making good progress towards the 500-plus million goal, and we have confidence it will be realized, in conjunction with sound execution, disciplined cost management that allow us to continue delivering significantly better performance than in downturns of the past. And of course, these same factors will provide a continued benefit when market conditions strengthen. All in all then, we remain confident in our company's present direction, and believe Deere is well positioned to provide significant value to our customers and investors in the future."

We did have a significant level of maturities that occurred in the fourth quarter. In fact, if you look at October alone, the month of October in terms of what sales we had of matured leases, about 2 to 3x, the typical month that we've had, and again, that's on the sales side. So we did see again on our maturity, a pretty significant peak in the fall. We will, as we go forward, as you think about lease maturities, you'll continue to see some of those seasonal increases. So as we mentioned before, you'll see some increase in the spring generally, and then, again, in the fall. So typically, our second and fourth quarters is -- are the quarters that we'll see those. But at this point, we would anticipate what we thought fourth quarter 2016 would be the highest peak from a maturity perspective. Certainly, we continue to see customers continuing to elect operating leases at a bit higher levels than what we would have seen on a more historic basis. I think the current market conditions explained much of that. But I would also point out, it isn't at some of the extreme levels that I've seen being reported. If you look over the last 12 months, for example, so for 2016, if you look at just the retail financing of equipment, so comparing retail notes versus operating leases, operating leases in terms of volumes coming in the door were about 25% of the total. That's up. Historically, we'd be in the mid to upper teens. So it's certainly at a more elevated level, but not to the degree or to the extent that some, perhaps, have reported. So hopefully, it gives you a little bit of color on where we're at with the operating leases. But to your point, as we move forward, especially when we get past second quarter with some of the changes that were made, at that point in time on the short-term leases, we would feel, and then you're seeing it reflected in the forecast, a bit more confidence on that front as we go into '17."

So emissions does continue to be an increase year-over-year. Now that's on the one side. To your point, a portion of what we've talked about with the structural cost reduction is going back to some of those applications on Final Tier 4, where we have first and foremost, found the most reliable solution. Now going back and looking at, are there ways we can still clearly meet those requirements that do so on a less expensive basis? And so that really goes to -- and would contribute to some of that kind of 1/3 of the cost reduction that we're targeting on product cost.

I'd say that, and particularly true for the ag business, as we've talked about with construction, that continues to be actually the opposite story. That's -- it's a very challenged market from a competition perspective and a pricing perspective. With used pricing, I would say more of what we said last quarter where we really have seen, I would say, stabilization of that used pricing as we speak with dealers, much higher confidence as they're negotiating trade-in, the value that they're able to put on that trade-in and what they feel they can accept. Keep in mind the challenge always on residual values is that's more about the wholesale perspective and the ability for dealers to purchase those -- that used equipment coming off of lease and adding it to their used inventory level. So we do continue to see some lower residual values on leasing, and you saw that reflected in the results for the quarter.

During the quarter, we would have ended our second phase of a multiphase program. I would tell you, the order intake there was very supportive of the forecast in that regard. And again on large tractors, we continue to be pretty much in line, slightly both behind on the AR tractors, if you think about availability year-over-year. But again, very supportive order position on the North American large ag versus our forecast. If you think about outside, and I think, maybe the most significant one is Brazil and South America, and I think the question there that we talked about last quarter was how much of that is simply pull ahead of that Tier 3 conversion that I mentioned previously. And we are seeing strength in the order book beyond the January 1 date, and so that really is why we're reflecting that higher level of sales for the full fiscal year. Certainly, you'll see some strength in the next couple of months, this month and December, ahead of that Tier 3.

I'll start with dairy though. I mean, really, what we're seeing there is in some of the dairy pricing, you're certainly starting to see some of that level out. You can see in some periods where dairy pricing was up pretty nicely, but it's early. But again, I think there -- that's what we characterize it as we did. There are signs that it's bottoming. That doesn't mean that it bottoms or how soon things might recover, but that is a positive versus where we would have been even as early as last quarter incrementally in Europe. But if you think about more broadly, I mean, clearly, I think maybe the 2 of the more noteworthy regions there, France, which is our largest market, went through a very difficult harvest and the harvest is down. Farm incomes are going to be lower. That's going to put pressure clearly on sales there, and coupled with that, as you're probably aware, there was a tax incentive program earlier in the year in France that did drive a lot of sales, and now while it's still in place, not a lot of income for those French farmers. So it's unlikely to have this anywhere near the type of advantages it did last year. So arguably, France would be a more challenged market. In the very short term, and I want to emphasize that, concerns around Brexit and so on could -- is expected to drive some benefit for the U.K. You've seen exports of used equipment become much more attractive with the FX shifts. And in the short term, likely to see some higher level of sales as most of those customers that are expecting that there'll see some price increases, as most manufacturers are importing into the U.K. And so again, with the FX shift, that's likely to drive higher pricing, and so they're buying ahead of that. So there would be some benefit again in the short term there. Longer term, obviously, that would likely have more downside than upside. So I think those are maybe a couple of the more significant, and especially, when you throw the dairy commentary, and the more significant pieces of Europe as you think about 2017."

We've talked before about capacity being below 50% in most of those at really across the board in large ag facilities. That wouldn't change with the ability to build the retail. Just keep in mind, while we did draw field inventory down last year, it wasn't as significant of a drawdown as what we experienced, for example, in 2015. So again, you get benefit, but it's not like all of a sudden, those factories are running at highly efficient levels. So I think that's probably the most important thing to keep in mind. We haven't talked about the level of specifically what the underproduction was last year. But I think, again, you're seeing that reflected in the overall outlook. If you look at the sales, while most of our markets, especially our largest markets, down 5 to 10 on a retail basis, you're seeing our sales reflecting a more positive trend than that. I think that's part of that story. So probably not much more I can say on that, but hopefully, gives you a little bit of additional color."

As in prior quarters, our performance was he",2449,"John Deere today reported solid financial results for the fourth quarter, and did so in spite of the continuing impact of the global farm recession and difficult conditions in the construction equipment sector. As in prior quarters, our performance was helped by the sound execution of our operating plans, the impact of a broad product portfolio and our success keeping a tight rein on costs and assets. 
For the full year, the company had earnings of $1.52 billion, a top 10 year. In our view, that's a noteworthy achievement in light of tough business conditions, and certainly well above the levels we've experienced in previous downturns. For 2017, we're looking for similar overall market conditions with a slight decline being forecast for sales and earnings. 
Now let's take a closer look at the fourth quarter in detail, beginning on Slide 4. Net sales and revenues were down 3% to $6.52 billion. Net income attributable to Deere & Company was $285 million. EPS was $0.90 in the quarter. 
On Slide 5, total worldwide equipment operations net sales were down 5% to $5.65 billion. Price realization in the quarter was positive by 3 points. Currency translation was favorable by 1 point. 
Turning to a review of our individual businesses. Let's start with Agriculture & Turf on Slide 6. Net sales were down 5% in the quarter-over-quarter comparison. Lower sales were recorded in most regions of the world, mainly in the U.S. and Canada. One notable exception was South America, which experienced higher sales led by Brazil and Argentina. Operating profit was $371 million and operating margins were 8.4% in the quarter. The increase in operating profit was primarily driven by price realization, and to a lesser extent, by lower pension and OPEB expense, material and production cost. 
Before we review the industry sales outlook, let's look at some of the fundamentals affecting the ag business. Slide 7 outlines U.S. farm cash receipts. Given the large crop harvest in 2015, and consequently, the lower commodity prices we're seeing today, our 2016 forecast calls for cash receipts to be down about 6% from 2015's levels. 
Moving to 2017. We expect total cash receipts to be approximately $367 billion, about the same as in 2016, as lower livestock cash receipts are offset by higher crop receipts. 
On Slide 8. Global grain and oilseed stocks-to-use ratios are forecast to remain at elevated but generally unchanged levels in 2016 and '17, as abundant crops are mostly offset by strong demand conditions around the world. Chinese grain and oilseed stocks have continued to increase in 2016 with supply, domestic production plus imports outpacing demand. Chinese stocks of grains and oilseeds now represent almost half of the world's stocks. Given these stocks are unlikely to be exported, the world market is sensitive to any production setbacks or major geopolitical disruptions. World cotton stocks have now fallen for a second consecutive season and to the lowest level in 5 seasons, reflecting lower planting and stronger global demand. 
Our economic outlook for the EU 28 is on Slide 9. Geopolitical risks, such as Brexit, remain elevated, contributing to the outlook for slow economic growth. Farm incomes remain under pressure and is below long-term averages, especially after a poor harvest in France. The dairy sector continues to experience weakness, although there are signs the market is bottoming out. As a result, industry farm machinery demand in the EU region is expected to be down about 5% in 2017. 
On Slide 10. You'll see economic fundamentals outlined for other targeted growth markets. In China, slower economic growth persists and ag policy changes are causing short-term uncertainty for most domestic and global markets. As a result, we anticipate lower industry sales. 
Turning to India. The government continues to focus on reviving growth in the ag sector and improving farm incomes. The value of agricultural production is expected to increase as a result of normal rains after 2 years of below average monsoons. These factors are expected to drive increased industry demand in India. 
Shifting to Brazil. Slide 11 illustrates the crop value of agricultural production, a good proxy for the health of agro business. Ag production is expected to increase about 7% in 2017 in U.S. dollar terms due to a recovering corn and the continued increase in ethanol demand. From a local currency perspective, the change is about 6%. Ag fundamentals remain positive, and farmer confidence is at its highest levels since 2013 due to improved political stability and signs of economic progress. We expect these factors to lead to higher industry equipment sales. 
Staying in Brazil, Slide 12 illustrates the finance rates for ag equipment. Moderfrota rates announced earlier this year remain at 8.5% for small and midsized farmers, and 10.5% for large farmers. The government's ongoing commitment to agricultural continues, and indications of shifting budgets to ensure availability of funds for Moderfrota are positive signals for the farm sector in Brazil. 
Our 2017 Ag & Turf industry outlooks are summarized on Slide 13. Industry sales in the U.S. and Canada are forecasted to be down 5% to 10%, with the effects being felt in both large and small models of equipment. Still, there are signs the large ag market is nearing bottom, as indicated by the fact that the declines expected in 2017 is less than we saw in 2016. The EU 28 industry outlook is forecasted to be down about 5% in 2017 due to low crop prices and farm incomes, as well as persistent pressure on the dairy sector. In South America, industry sales of tractors and combines are projected to be up about 15% in 2017, a reflection of the factors already discussed for Brazil, as well as positive industry sentiment in Argentina. Shifting to Asia. Sales are expected to be flat to up slightly with growth in India being the main driver. 
Turning to another product category. Industry retail sales of turf and utility equipment in the U.S. and Canada are projected to be roughly flat in 2017, with Deere sales outpacing the industry. Putting this all together, on Slide 14, fiscal year 2017 Deere sales of worldwide Ag & Turf equipment are forecasted to be down about 1%, including about 1 point of positive currency translation. The Ag & Turf division operating margin is forecast to be about 8.5% in 2017. 
Now let's focus on Construction & Forestry on Slide 15. Net sales were down 5% in the quarter due to lower shipment volumes and higher sales incentive costs, both mainly driven by the U.S. market. The U.S. and Canadian markets continue to be extremely competitive and the pricing environment remains challenging. The division incurred an operating loss of $17 million in the quarter due to higher sales incentive costs and impairment charge for international operations of $25 million and higher production costs. The division's decremental margin was 33% for the full year. 
Moving to Slide 16, and looking at the economic indicators on the bottom part of the slide. GDP growth is positive. Construction spending is increasing and housing starts are expected to exceed 1 million units again this year. In spite of these positive signals, the market demand for construction equipment continues to be weak. Factors contributing to the weakness have not changed dramatically over the past quarter. Conditions in the oil and gas sector, for example, continue to be slow. Also, construction contractors are delaying fleet replenishment because of the uncertain markets. Rental utilization rate declines persist, leading to a reduction in fleet and elevated levels of used inventory. Housing starts in the U.S. for single-family homes remain below the long-term average, and multifamily home construction is flowing due to overbuilding in some parts of the country. On balance, Deere's Construction & Forestry sales are forecasted to be up about 1% in 2017, with positive currency translation of about 1 point. Global forestry markets are expected to be roughly flat in 2017. C&F's full year operating margin is projected to be about 3.5%. 
Let's move now to our Financial Services operations. Slide 17 shows the provision for credit losses as a percent of the average owned portfolio. The provision at the end of 2016 was 23 basis points, reflecting the continued excellent quality of our portfolios. The 2017 forecast anticipates a loss provision of about 29 basis points, up somewhat from historically low levels of recent years. This puts the provision just above the 10-year average of 26 basis points, though below the 15-year average of 34 basis points. 
Moving to Slide 18. Worldwide Financial Services net income attributable to Deere & Company was $110 million in the fourth quarter versus $153 million last year. 2016 net income attributable to Deere & Company was $468 million compared with $633 million in 2015. The lower results for both periods were primarily due to less favorable financing spreads, higher losses on residual values and the higher provision for credit losses. Also, remember that full year 2015 results benefited from a gain on the sale of our crop insurance business of about $30 million. Deere's worldwide Financial Services operation is expected to earn about $480 million in 2017. The outlook reflects lower losses on lease residual values, partially offset by less favorable financing spreads and an increased provision for credit losses. 
Slide 19 outlines receivables and inventories. For the company as a whole, receivables and inventories ended the year down $517 million. They're expected to decline again in 2017 by about $250 million. For the year ahead, we expect to produce in line with retail demand for large ag equipment, while underproducing in the small ag sector, which is mostly related to midsized tractors and other livestock related products. 
Before getting into cost of sales, let's discuss the voluntary separation programs initiated during the fourth quarter of 2016 as part of efforts to improve our cost structure. As noted in today's earnings announcement, pretax expenses related to the programs were $11 million in 2016, and will be about $105 million in 2017, most of which will be incurred in the first quarter. These expenses are recorded in the period employees accept the offer. While the voluntary separation programs apply to salaried employees throughout the U.S., a vast majority of those accepting offers were within the equipment divisions. These costs have an impact on cost of sales, R&D and SA&G. Savings from the programs are expected to be about $75 million in 2017. 
Moving to Slide 20. Cost of sales as a percent of net sales for 2016 was 78% versus previous guidance of 78.7%, a result of structural cost reduction efforts. Our guidance for 2017 cost of sales is about 78%. When modeling 2017, keep these unfavorable impacts in mind: an unfavorable product mix, overhead spending and Tier 4 product cost. On the favorable side, we expect price realization of about 1 point and lower incentive compensation expense. Please note that our cost of sales guidance is flat with 2016 in spite of increasing commodity cost, higher pension and OPEB expenses and lower volume. 
Now let's look at some additional details, with respect to R&D expense on Slide 21. R&D was down 4% in the fourth quarter and 3% for the full year. Currency translation had a negative impact of 1% for the full year. Our 2017 forecast calls for R&D to be down about 3%. 
Moving now to Slide 22. SA&G expense for the equipment operations was up 3% in the fourth quarter, with commissions paid to dealers, incentive compensation, the voluntary separation programs and pension and OPEB expense accounting for 2 points of the change on a net basis. SA&G expense for the full year was down 5%, with currency translation, pension and OPEB expense and incentive compensation accounting for most of the change. Our 2017 forecast on Slide 23 shows SA&G expense being up about 1% with a net impact of about 2 points from the voluntary separation program, currency translation and incentive compensation. 
Turning to Slide 24. Pension and OPEB expense was down $53 million for the quarter, and down $200 million for the full year. The forecast for pension and OPEB expense for 2017 is up about $30 million. 
On Slide 25. The equipment operations tax rate was 32% in the quarter and 30% for the full year. The lower rate resulted mainly from discrete items. For 2017, the projected effective tax rate is forecast to be in the range of 33% to 35%. 
Slide 26 shows our equipment operations history of strong cash flow. Cash flow from the equipment operations was $2.9 billion in 2016, and is forecast to be about $2.5 billion in 2017.  
This 2017 outlook for the first quarter and full year is on Slide 27. Net sales for the quarter are forecast to be down about 4% compared with 2016. This includes about 1 point of price realization, and about 2 points of favorable currency translation. The full year forecast calls for net sales to be down about 1%. Price realization and favorable currency translation are each expected to be about 1 point. Finally, our full year 2017 net income forecast is about $1.4 billion. 
Comparing 2016 and 2017, Slide 28 shows a high-level reconciliation of operating profit for the equipment operations adjusted for special items. Operating profit was $1.88 billion for the equipment operations in 2016. Included were special items which require consideration. A $75 million pretax gain from the sale of a partial interest in SiteOne Landscape Supply, impairment charges for the C&F operations internationally of about $25 million and voluntary separation programs of $11 million. Adjusted for these factors, 2016 operating profit would have been $1.841 billion. 
Based on the guidance provided for net sales changes in 2017 and operating margins by segment, the implied operating profit for the equipment operations is forecast to be between $1.7 billion and $1.75 billion. Included were the following items of note: voluntary separation program cost of $96 million related to the equipment operations, pension and OPEB expenses of about $30 million, and other nonrecurring costs of about $55 million. After adjusting for these items, implied operating profit for 2017 is in the range of $1.88 billion to $1.93 billion. On an adjusted basis, the comparison shows an improvement between $40 million to $90 million for 2017 even with lower sales volumes, which are projected to be down about 3%. The lower volumes negatively impact the 2017 forecast. When considering these special and nonrecurring items, as well as the impact of lower volumes, they show the company is continuing to deliver improved operational performance due in part to structural cost reduction initiatives. 
I'll now turn the call over to our CFO, Raj Kalathur, for additional comments."

We expect to see the full benefit of the $500",282,"Thanks, Josh. Last quarter, we talked about our plans to improve pretax profit by at least $500 million to a structural cost reduction by the end of 2018. Now these benefits would apply to 2016 volume levels. We expect to see the full benefit of the $500 million improvement in the year 2019 and beyond. These cost reduction efforts began in March of 2016, and contributed in excess of $90 million for the year 2016. The 2017 forecast includes an additional about $190 million of structural cost reduction. Here's some detail about where the $500 million in improvement is expected to come from. 
Number one, structural direct and indirect material cost reduction is the largest contributor of improvement, roughly 1/3. Now this is the result of leveraging existing supplier relationships, resourcing and designing cost out of our products. Second, people-related costs are the second largest category of reduction, about 1/5 of the total improvement. The voluntary separation program, as Josh discussed, is a significant example. Other areas of improvement include changes to our variable pay structure, especially under trough conditions, as well as lower R&D spending and lower depreciation associated with lower capital expenditures. 
Overall, our teams are making good progress towards the 500-plus million goal, and we have confidence it will be realized. In conjunction with sound execution, disciplined cost management will allow us to continue delivering significantly better performance than in downturns of the past. And of course, these same factors will provide a continued benefit when market conditions strengthen. All in all then, we remain confident in our company's present direction, and believe Deere is well positioned to provide significant value to our customers and investors in the future."

We did have a significant level of maturities that occurred in the fourth quarter. In fact, if you look at October alone, the month of October in terms of what sales we had of matured leases, about 2 to 3x, the typical month that we've had, and again, that's on the sales side. So we did see again on maturity, a pretty significant peak in the fall. We will, as we go forward, as you think about lease maturities, you'll continue to see some of those seasonal increases. So as we mentioned before, you'll see some increase in the spring generally, and then, again, in the fall. So typically, our second and fourth quarters is -- are the quarters that we'll see those. But at this point, we would anticipate what we saw fourth quarter 2016 would be the highest peak from a maturity perspective. Certainly, we continue to see customers continuing to elect operating leases at a bit higher level than what we would have seen on a more historic basis. I think the current market conditions explained much of that. But I would also point out, it isn't at some of the extreme levels that I've seen being reported. If you look over the last 12 months, for example, so for 2016, if you look at just the retail financing of equipment, so comparing retail notes versus operating leases, operating leases in terms of volumes coming in the door were about 25% of the total. That's up. Historically, we'd be in the mid to upper teens. So it's certainly at a more elevated level, but not to the degree or to the extent that some, perhaps, have reported. So hopefully, it gives you a little bit of color on where we're at with the operating leases. But to your point, as we move forward, especially when we get past second quarter with some of the changes that were made, at that point in time on the short-term leases, we would feel, and then you're seeing it reflected in the forecast, a bit more confidence on that front as we go into '17."

So emissions does continue to be an increase year-over-year. Now that's on the one side. To your point, a portion of what we've talked about with the structural cost reduction is going back to some of those applications on Final Tier 4, where we have first and foremost, found the most reliable solution. Now going back and looking at, are there ways we can still clearly meet those requirements that do so on a less expensive basis? And so that really goes to -- and would contribute to some of that kind of 1/3 of the cost reduction that we're targeting on product cost.

That's -- it's a very challenged market from a competition perspective and a pricing perspective. With used pricing, I would say more of what we said last quarter where we really have seen, I would say, stabilization of that used pricing as we speak with dealers, much higher confidence as they're negotiating trade-ins, the value that they're able to put on that trade-in and what they feel they can accept. Keep in mind the challenge always on residual values is that's more about the wholesale perspective and the ability for dealers to purchase those -- that used equipment coming off of lease and adding it to their used inventory level.

But again, I think the good news there is generally stabilization on that used equipment pricing."

You see it in limited form and in some of the other parts of the world. As you think about the combined early order program, keep in mind, it's still in process. So that actually ends in January. During the quarter, we would have ended our second phase of a multiphase program. I would tell you, the order intake there was very supportive of the forecast in that regard. And again on large tractors, we continue to be pretty much in line, slightly, both behind on the AR tractors, if you think about availability year-over-year. But again, very supportive order position on the North American large ag versus our forecast. If you think about outside, and I think, maybe the most significant one is Brazil in South America, and I think the question there that we talked about last quarter was how much of that is simply pull ahead of that Tier 3 conversion that I mentioned previously. And we are seeing strength in the order book beyond the January 1 date, and so that really is why we're reflecting that higher level of sales for the full fiscal year. Certainly, you'll see some strength in the next couple of months, this month and December, ahead of that Tier 3. But our belief is what we're seeing in the order book that, that strength will continue beyond December 31. So the short answer to your question on South America is, yes, we are seeing it in the order book."

So that's just from a product mix perspective. And given where South American volumes are today, that geographic mix wouldn't be as attractive as what it would be if we were in more normal levels. So keep in mind, their production is significantly down as well, and so that does put pressure there. So it's kind of a combination of those things.

I'll start with dairy though. I mean, really, what we're seeing there is in some of the dairy pricing, you're certainly starting to see some of that level out. You can see in some periods where dairy pricing was up pretty nicely, but it's early. But again, I think there -- that's what we characterize it as we did. There are signs that it's bottoming. That doesn't mean it's bottomed or how soon things might recover, but that is a positive versus where we would have been even as early as last quarter, incrementally, in Europe. But if you think about more broadly, I mean, clearly, I think maybe the 2 of the more noteworthy regions there, France, which is our largest market, went through a very difficult harvest and the harvest is down. Farm incomes are going to be lower. That's going to put pressure clearly on sales there, and coupled with that, as you're probably aware, there was a tax incentive program earlier in the year in France that did drive a lot of sales, and now while it's still in place, not a lot of income for those French farmers. So it's unlikely to have this anywhere near the type of advantage it did last year. So arguably, France would be a more challenged market. In the very short term, and I want to emphasize that, concerns around Brexit and so on could -- is expected to drive some benefit for the U.K. You've seen exports of used equipment become much more attractive with the FX shifts. And in the short term, likely to see some higher level of sales as most of those customers there are expecting that they'll see some price increases as most manufacturers are importing into the U.K. And so again, with the FX shift, that's likely to drive higher pricing, and so they're buying ahead of that. So there would be some benefit again in the short term there. Longer term, obviously, that would likely have more downside than upside. So I think those are maybe a couple of the more significant, and especially when you throw the dairy commentary in, the more significant pieces of Europe as you think about 2017."

We, as you saw really in our numbers, for receivables and inventory last year, our dealers drew their inventory level down pretty dramatically in '16. As a result, while we're still on an inventory and receivable level, bringing C&F down further, that's almost all inventory for C&F. There's very little receivable reduction in that division, and it's really just reflective of, from a new equipment perspective, we think our dealers are in very, very good shape. Now the good news there is if we ever do start seeing more positive trends in that market for us, I think we'd be in a position where our dealers would likely need to add to their inventory from current levels. So again, I think that's reflective of the good work the division and our dealers did in 2016 that we're able to put that type of forecast for sales in 2017."

As in prior quarters, our performance was he",2449,"John Deere today reported solid financial results for the fourth quarter, and did so in spite of the continuing impact of the global farm recession and difficult conditions in the construction equipment sector. As in prior quarters, our performance was helped by the sound execution of our operating plans, the impact of a broad product portfolio and our success keeping a tight rein on costs and assets. 
For the full year, the company had earnings of $1.52 billion, a top 10 year. In our view, that's a noteworthy achievement in light of tough business conditions, and certainly well above the levels we've experienced in previous downturns. For 2017, we're looking for similar overall market conditions with a slight decline being forecast for sales and earnings. 
Now let's take a closer look at the fourth quarter in detail, beginning on Slide 4. Net sales and revenues were down 3% to $6.52 billion. Net income attributable to Deere & Company was $285 million. EPS was $0.90 in the quarter. 
On Slide 5, total worldwide equipment operations net sales were down 5% to $5.65 billion. Price realization in the quarter was positive by 3 points. Currency translation was favorable by 1 point. 
Turning to a review of our individual businesses. Let's start with Agriculture & Turf on Slide 6. Net sales were down 5% in the quarter-over-quarter comparison. Lower sales were recorded in most regions of the world, mainly in the U.S. and Canada. One notable exception was South America, which experienced higher sales led by Brazil and Argentina. Operating profit was $371 million and operating margins were 8.4% in the quarter. The increase in operating profit was primarily driven by price realization, and to a lesser extent, by lower pension and OPEB expense, material and production cost. 
Before we review the industry sales outlook, let's look at some of the fundamentals affecting the ag business. Slide 7 outlines U.S. farm cash receipts. Given the large crop harvest in 2015, and consequently, the lower commodity prices we're seeing today, our 2016 forecast calls for cash receipts to be down about 6% from 2015's levels. 
Moving to 2017. We expect total cash receipts to be approximately $367 billion, about the same as in 2016, as lower livestock cash receipts are offset by higher crop receipts. 
On Slide 8. Global grain and oilseed stocks-to-use ratios are forecast to remain at elevated but generally unchanged levels in 2016 and '17, as abundant crops are mostly offset by strong demand conditions around the world. Chinese grain and oilseed stocks have continued to increase in 2016 with supply, domestic production plus imports outpacing demand. Chinese stocks of grains and oilseeds now represent almost half of the world's stocks. Given these stocks are unlikely to be exported, the world market is sensitive to any production setbacks or major geopolitical disruptions. World cotton stocks have now fallen for a second consecutive season and to the lowest level in 5 seasons, reflecting lower planting and stronger global demand. 
Our economic outlook for the EU 28 is on Slide 9. Geopolitical risks, such as Brexit, remain elevated, contributing to the outlook for slow economic growth. Farm incomes remain under pressure and is below long-term averages, especially after a poor harvest in France. The dairy sector continues to experience weakness, although there are signs the market is bottoming out. As a result, industry farm machinery demand in the EU region is expected to be down about 5% in 2017. 
On Slide 10. You'll see economic fundamentals outlined for other targeted growth markets. In China, slower economic growth persists and ag policy changes are causing short-term uncertainty for most domestic and global markets. As a result, we anticipate lower industry sales. 
Turning to India. The government continues to focus on reviving growth in the ag sector and improving farm incomes. The value of agricultural production is expected to increase as a result of normal rains after 2 years of below average monsoons. These factors are expected to drive increased industry demand in India. 
Shifting to Brazil. Slide 11 illustrates the crop value of agricultural production, a good proxy for the health of agro business. Ag production is expected to increase about 7% in 2017 in U.S. dollar terms due to a recovering corn and the continued increase in ethanol demand. From a local currency perspective, the change is about 6%. Ag fundamentals remain positive, and farmer confidence is at its highest levels since 2013 due to improved political stability and signs of economic progress. We expect these factors to lead to higher industry equipment sales. 
Staying in Brazil, Slide 12 illustrates the finance rates for ag equipment. Moderfrota rates announced earlier this year remain at 8.5% for small and midsized farmers, and 10.5% for large farmers. The government's ongoing commitment to agricultural continues, and indications of shifting budgets to ensure availability of funds for Moderfrota are positive signals for the farm sector in Brazil. 
Our 2017 Ag & Turf industry outlooks are summarized on Slide 13. Industry sales in the U.S. and Canada are forecasted to be down 5% to 10%, with the effects being felt in both large and small models of equipment. Still, there are signs the large ag market is nearing bottom, as indicated by the fact that the declines expected in 2017 is less than we saw in 2016. The EU 28 industry outlook is forecasted to be down about 5% in 2017 due to low crop prices and farm incomes, as well as persistent pressure on the dairy sector. In South America, industry sales of tractors and combines are projected to be up about 15% in 2017, a reflection of the factors already discussed for Brazil, as well as positive industry sentiment in Argentina. Shifting to Asia. Sales are expected to be flat to up slightly with growth in India being the main driver. 
Turning to another product category. Industry retail sales of turf and utility equipment in the U.S. and Canada are projected to be roughly flat in 2017, with Deere sales outpacing the industry. Putting this all together, on Slide 14, fiscal year 2017 Deere sales of worldwide Ag & Turf equipment are forecasted to be down about 1%, including about 1 point of positive currency translation. The Ag & Turf division operating margin is forecast to be about 8.5% in 2017. 
Now let's focus on Construction & Forestry on Slide 15. Net sales were down 5% in the quarter due to lower shipment volumes and higher sales incentive costs, both mainly driven by the U.S. market. The U.S. and Canadian markets continue to be extremely competitive and the pricing environment remains challenging. The division incurred an operating loss of $17 million in the quarter due to higher sales incentive costs and impairment charge for international operations of $25 million and higher production costs. The division's decremental margin was 33% for the full year. 
Moving to Slide 16, and looking at the economic indicators on the bottom part of the slide. GDP growth is positive. Construction spending is increasing and housing starts are expected to exceed 1 million units again this year. In spite of these positive signals, the market demand for construction equipment continues to be weak. Factors contributing to the weakness have not changed dramatically over the past quarter. Conditions in the oil and gas sector, for example, continue to be slow. Also, construction contractors are delaying fleet replenishment because of the uncertain markets. Rental utilization rate declines persist, leading to a reduction in fleet and elevated levels of used inventory. Housing starts in the U.S. for single-family homes remain below the long-term average, and multifamily home construction is flowing due to overbuilding in some parts of the country. On balance, Deere's Construction & Forestry sales are forecasted to be up about 1% in 2017, with positive currency translation of about 1 point. Global forestry markets are expected to be roughly flat in 2017. C&F's full year operating margin is projected to be about 3.5%. 
Let's move now to our Financial Services operations. Slide 17 shows the provision for credit losses as a percent of the average owned portfolio. The provision at the end of 2016 was 23 basis points, reflecting the continued excellent quality of our portfolios. The 2017 forecast anticipates a loss provision of about 29 basis points, up somewhat from historically low levels of recent years. This puts the provision just above the 10-year average of 26 basis points, though below the 15-year average of 34 basis points. 
Moving to Slide 18. Worldwide Financial Services net income attributable to Deere & Company was $110 million in the fourth quarter versus $153 million last year. 2016 net income attributable to Deere & Company was $468 million compared with $633 million in 2015. The lower results for both periods were primarily due to less favorable financing spreads, higher losses on residual values and the higher provision for credit losses. Also, remember that full year 2015 results benefited from a gain on the sale of our crop insurance business of about $30 million. Deere's worldwide Financial Services operation is expected to earn about $480 million in 2017. The outlook reflects lower losses on lease residual values, partially offset by less favorable financing spreads and an increased provision for credit losses. 
Slide 19 outlines receivables and inventories. For the company as a whole, receivables and inventories ended the year down $517 million. They're expected to decline again in 2017 by about $250 million. For the year ahead, we expect to produce in line with retail demand for large ag equipment, while underproducing in the small ag sector, which is mostly related to midsized tractors and other livestock related products. 
Before getting into cost of sales, let's discuss the voluntary separation programs initiated during the fourth quarter of 2016 as part of efforts to improve our cost structure. As noted in today's earnings announcement, pretax expenses related to the programs were $11 million in 2016, and will be about $105 million in 2017, most of which will be incurred in the first quarter. These expenses are recorded in the period employees accept the offer. While the voluntary separation programs apply to salaried employees throughout the U.S., a vast majority of those accepting offers were within the equipment divisions. These costs have an impact on cost of sales, R&D and SA&G. Savings from the programs are expected to be about $75 million in 2017. 
Moving to Slide 20. Cost of sales as a percent of net sales for 2016 was 78% versus previous guidance of 78.7%, a result of structural cost reduction efforts. Our guidance for 2017 cost of sales is about 78%. When modeling 2017, keep these unfavorable impacts in mind: an unfavorable product mix, overhead spending and Tier 4 product cost. On the favorable side, we expect price realization of about 1 point and lower incentive compensation expense. Please note that our cost of sales guidance is flat with 2016 in spite of increasing commodity cost, higher pension and OPEB expenses and lower volume. 
Now let's look at some additional details, with respect to R&D expense on Slide 21. R&D was down 4% in the fourth quarter and 3% for the full year. Currency translation had a negative impact of 1% for the full year. Our 2017 forecast calls for R&D to be down about 3%. 
Moving now to Slide 22. SA&G expense for the equipment operations was up 3% in the fourth quarter, with commissions paid to dealers, incentive compensation, the voluntary separation programs and pension and OPEB expense accounting for 2 points of the change on a net basis. SA&G expense for the full year was down 5%, with currency translation, pension and OPEB expense and incentive compensation accounting for most of the change. Our 2017 forecast on Slide 23 shows SA&G expense being up about 1% with a net impact of about 2 points from the voluntary separation program, currency translation and incentive compensation. 
Turning to Slide 24. Pension and OPEB expense was down $53 million for the quarter, and down $200 million for the full year. The forecast for pension and OPEB expense for 2017 is up about $30 million. 
On Slide 25. The equipment operations tax rate was 32% in the quarter and 30% for the full year. The lower rate resulted mainly from discrete items. For 2017, the projected effective tax rate is forecast to be in the range of 33% to 35%. 
Slide 26 shows our equipment operations history of strong cash flow. Cash flow from the equipment operations was $2.9 billion in 2016, and is forecast to be about $2.5 billion in 2017.  
This 2017 outlook for the first quarter and full year is on Slide 27. Net sales for the quarter are forecast to be down about 4% compared with 2016. This includes about 1 point of price realization, and about 2 points of favorable currency translation. The full year forecast calls for net sales to be down about 1%. Price realization and favorable currency translation are each expected to be about 1 point. Finally, our full year 2017 net income forecast is about $1.4 billion. 
Comparing 2016 and 2017, Slide 28 shows a high-level reconciliation of operating profit for the equipment operations adjusted for special items. Operating profit was $1.88 billion for the equipment operations in 2016. Included were special items which require consideration. A $75 million pretax gain from the sale of a partial interest in SiteOne Landscape Supply, impairment charges for the C&F operations internationally of about $25 million and voluntary separation programs of $11 million. Adjusted for these factors, 2016 operating profit would have been $1.841 billion. 
Based on the guidance provided for net sales changes in 2017 and operating margins by segment, the implied operating profit for the equipment operations is forecast to be between $1.7 billion and $1.75 billion. Included were the following items of note: voluntary separation program cost of $96 million related to the equipment operations, pension and OPEB expenses of about $30 million, and other nonrecurring costs of about $55 million. After adjusting for these items, implied operating profit for 2017 is in the range of $1.88 billion to $1.93 billion. On an adjusted basis, the comparison shows an improvement between $40 million to $90 million for 2017 even with lower sales volumes, which are projected to be down about 3%. The lower volumes negatively impact the 2017 forecast. When considering these special and nonrecurring items, as well as the impact of lower volumes, they show the company is continuing to deliver improved operational performance due in part to structural cost reduction initiatives. 
I'll now turn the call over to our CFO, Raj Kalathur, for additional comments."

The 2017 forecast includes an additional about $190 million of structural cost reduction. Here's some detail about where the $500 million in improvement is expected to come from. 
Number one, structural direct and indirect material cost reduction is the largest contributor of improvement, roughly 1/3. Now this is the result of leveraging existing supplier relationships, resourcing and designing cost out of our products. Second, people-related costs are the second largest category of reduction, about 1/5 of the total improvement. The voluntary separation program, as Josh discussed, is a significant example. Other areas of improvement include changes to our variable pay structure, especially under trough conditions, as well as lower R&D spending and lower depreciation associated with lower capital expenditures. 
Overall, our teams are making good progress towards the 500-plus million goal, and we have confidence it will be realized. In conjunction with sound execution, disciplined cost management will allow us to continue delivering significantly better performance than in downturns of the past. And of course, these same factors will provide a continued benefit when market conditions strengthen. All in all then, we remain confident in our company's present direction, and believe Deere is well positioned to provide significant value to our customers and investors in the future."

We did have a significant level of maturities that occurred in the fourth quarter. In fact, if you look at October alone, the month of October in terms of what sales we had of matured leases, about 2 to 3x, the typical month that we've had, and again, that's on the sales side. So we did see again on maturity, a pretty significant peak in the fall. We will, as we go forward, as you think about lease maturities, you'll continue to see some of those seasonal increases. So as we mentioned before, you'll see some increase in the spring generally, and then, again, in the fall. So typically, our second and fourth quarters is -- are the quarters that we'll see those. But at this point, we would anticipate what we saw fourth quarter 2016 would be the highest peak from a maturity perspective. Certainly, we continue to see customers continuing to elect operating leases at a bit higher level than what we would have seen on a more historic basis. I think the current market conditions explained much of that. But I would also point out, it isn't at some of the extreme levels that I've seen being reported. If you look over the last 12 months, for example, so for 2016, if you look at just the retail financing of equipment, so comparing retail notes versus operating leases, operating leases in terms of volumes coming in the door were about 25% of the total. That's up. Historically, we'd be in the mid to upper teens. So it's certainly at a more elevated level, but not to the degree or to the extent that some, perhaps, have reported. So hopefully, it gives you a little bit of color on where we're at with the operating leases. But to your point, as we move forward, especially when we get past second quarter with some of the changes that were made, at that point in time on the short-term leases, we would feel, and then you're seeing it reflected in the forecast, a bit more confidence on that front as we go into '17."

So emissions does continue to be an increase year-over-year. Now that's on the one side. To your point, a portion of what we've talked about with the structural cost reduction is going back to some of those applications on Final Tier 4, where we have first and foremost, found the most reliable solution. Now going back and looking at, are there ways we can still clearly meet those requirements that do so on a less expensive basis? And so that really goes to -- and would contribute to some of that kind of 1/3 of the cost reduction that we're targeting on product cost.

That's -- it's a very challenged market from a competition perspective and a pricing perspective. With used pricing, I would say more of what we said last quarter where we really have seen, I would say, stabilization of that used pricing as we speak with dealers, much higher confidence as they're negotiating trade-ins, the value that they're able to put on that trade-in and what they feel they can accept. Keep in mind the challenge always on residual values is that's more about the wholesale perspective and the ability for dealers to purchase those -- that used equipment coming off of lease and adding it to their used inventory level. So we do continue to see some lower residual values on leasing, and you saw that reflected in the results for the quarter.

During the quarter, we would have ended our second phase of a multiphase program. I would tell you, the order intake there was very supportive of the forecast in that regard. And again on large tractors, we continue to be pretty much in line, slightly, both behind on the AR tractors, if you think about availability year-over-year. But again, very supportive order position on the North American large ag versus our forecast. If you think about outside, and I think, maybe the most significant one is Brazil in South America, and I think the question there that we talked about last quarter was how much of that is simply pull ahead of that Tier 3 conversion that I mentioned previously. And we are seeing strength in the order book beyond the January 1 date, and so that really is why we're reflecting that higher level of sales for the full fiscal year. Certainly, you'll see some strength in the next couple of months, this month and December, ahead of that Tier 3.

And some of that candidly, as we ended the year, higher than we would have liked on the 6,000, in particular. We talked a lot about that issue in the past.

And so what you're seeing in some of that underproduction, as I mentioned earlier, a lot of that underproduction is coming in at mid-sized product, which again from a mix perspective, would be a bit more negative. So as you think about year-over-year strengths and weaknesses in the business, you're still seeing a fair level of weakness in some of that mid to large equipment, at least year-over-year, with continued strength in the smaller end of the portfolio. So that's just from a product mix perspective. And given where South American volumes are today, that geographic mix wouldn't be as attractive as what it would be if we were in more normal levels. So keep in mind, their production is significantly down as well, and so that does put pressure there. So it's kind of a combination of those things. Volume, candidly though, year-over-year volume for Ag and Turf is the bigger headwind. There is some mix impact as well."

I'll start with dairy though. I mean, really, what we're seeing there is in some of the dairy pricing, you're certainly starting to see some of that level out. You can see in some periods where dairy pricing was up pretty nicely, but it's early. But again, I think there -- that's what we characterize it as we did. There are signs that it's bottoming. That doesn't mean it's bottomed or how soon things might recover, but that is a positive versus where we would have been even as early as last quarter, incrementally, in Europe. But if you think about more broadly, I mean, clearly, I think maybe the 2 of the more noteworthy regions there, France, which is our largest market, went through a very difficult harvest and the harvest is down. Farm incomes are going to be lower. That's going to put pressure clearly on sales there, and coupled with that, as you're probably aware, there was a tax incentive program earlier in the year in France that did drive a lot of sales, and now while it's still in place, not a lot of income for those French farmers. So it's unlikely to have this anywhere near the type of advantage it did last year. So arguably, France would be a more challenged market. In the very short term, and I want to emphasize that, concerns around Brexit and so on could -- is expected to drive some benefit for the U.K. You've seen exports of used equipment become much more attractive with the FX shifts. And in the short term, likely to see some higher level of sales as most of those customers there are expecting that they'll see some price increases as most manufacturers are importing into the U.K. And so again, with the FX shift, that's likely to drive higher pricing, and so they're buying ahead of that. So there would be some benefit again in the short term there. Longer term, obviously, that would likely have more downside than upside. So I think those are maybe a couple of the more significant, and especially when you throw the dairy commentary in, the more significant pieces of Europe as you think about 2017."

We've talked before about capacity being below 50% in most of those, really across the board in the large ag facilities. That wouldn't change with the ability to build to retail. Just keep in mind, while we did draw field inventory down last year, it wasn't as significant of a drawdown as what we experienced, for example, in 2015. So again, you get benefit, but it's not like all of a sudden, those factories are running at highly efficient levels. So I think that's probably the most important thing to keep in mind. We haven't talked about the level of specifically what the underproduction was last year. But I think, again, you're seeing that reflected in the overall outlook. If you look at the sales, while most of our markets, especially our largest market, down 5 to 10 on a retail basis, you're seeing our sales reflecting a more positive trend than that.
