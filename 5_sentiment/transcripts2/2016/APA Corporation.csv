In conjunction with this morning's press release, I hope you have had the opportunity to review our quarterly earnings supplement, which summarizes key financial and operational data for the fourth quarter and full year 2015, along with details regarding our 2016 production and capital spending outlook. We have revised and streamlined the structure and content of our earnings supplement and believe you will find it more useful. 
Also, please note that we have changed our capital expenditure guidance convention to reflect a more comprehensive picture of our spending. Specifically, the 2016 capital spending range we've provided in this morning's press release includes all exploration, development, gathering, transportation and processing expenditures. It also includes budgeted lease hold acquisition costs and capitalized interest and capitalized G&A. The only element of our 2016 program that our guidance will continue to exclude is capital attributable to our minority interest partner in Egypt. As a result of this guidance change, references made on today's call to 2015 and 2016 capital spending may not be directly comparable.
Our earnings release, the accompanying financial tables and non-GAAP reconciliations, along with our quarterly earnings supplement, can all be found on our website at www..apache.com/financial data. We also plan to post on our website a section which contains responses to any questions that arise on today's call for which we do not have readily available information to answer.
I'd like to remind everyone that today's discussions will contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions based on our current views and reasonable expectations. However, a number of factors could cause actual results to materially differ from what we discuss today. A full disclaimer is located with the supplemental data on our website. 
And I would now like to turn the call over to John."

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. I would like to begin with a recap of the significant progress Apache made in 2015. I will then provide some highlights from our fourth quarter and full year results and conclude with so",3513,"Thank you, Gary. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. I would like to begin with a recap of the significant progress Apache made in 2015. I will then provide some highlights from our fourth quarter and full year results and conclude with some specific thoughts on what to expect for 2016. 
Apache underwent a significant transition in 2015. While the external environment remains challenging, we entered 2016 better positioned to operate and thrive in a lower for longer commodity price environment. In addition to completing an extensive refocusing on the portfolio, we have taken other decisive actions to position Apache for an extended low-price environment, which included: aligning our capital spending with cash flows, attacking the cost structure, continuing to high-grade and build an inventory of attractive opportunities that will deliver strong returns under a low oil price environment and strengthening our financial position and liquidity. While we have made tremendous progress, we are not yet finished with these efforts. 
We streamlined our portfolio, exiting Argentina, Australia, much of the Gulf of Mexico in 2 world-scale LNG projects. We are now focused on 3 principal areas: a substantial onshore North American acreage position, with an abundant inventory of high-value growth opportunities, anchored by our extensive Permian footprint; and sustainable free cash flow generators and our higher cash margin North Sea and Egypt businesses, each with many years of low-risk drilling opportunities and significant exploration potential still ahead. 
In the current low oil price environment, our more conventional international assets continue to generate strong cash flows and better rates of return than many of our operations in North America.
In the North Sea, we are uniquely positioned. We have 2 large-scale hydrocarbon accumulations at Forties [indiscernible] barrel available high-quality platform and pipeline infrastructure and per-unit cash operating costs that are 1/2 the industry average. These advantages make tiebacks to existing infrastructure very economic even at current oil prices.
In Egypt, we benefit from a cost recovery aspect of our production-sharing contracts such that they help to mitigate the impact of declining oil prices on our cash flows. Our international positions clearly differentiate our portfolio, play to Apache's long-standing strengths and remain economically attractive in this low oil price environment.
A year ago, Apache took more decisive action than many of our peers and reduced activity levels that pursuit of cash flow neutrality. We anticipated the lower-for-longer oil price scenario and recognize the importance of protecting value through more disciplined investment. Accordingly, we reduced capital by more than 60% in 2015 from 2014 levels and focused on bringing cost into alignment with the current oil price environment.
Specifically, this time last year on our fourth quarter 2014 conference call, I stated that, ""We would consider using our balance sheet only to capitalize on lower acreage cost and other potential opportunities that may occur rather than to drill wells and chase production in a depressed and volatile oil price environment."" We stuck to that view throughout 2015 and continue to do so today 1 year later.
At the same time, we instituted an even more rigorous capital allocation process through which we continuingly monitor the delivery of the capital programs and reallocate capital as value-maximization demands. Motivated by the deteriorating oil price environment and a goal to achieve cash flow neutrality, we attacked our cost structure in 2015 with a thorough review of G&A, LOE and capital costs. Specifically, we rationalized our entire organizational structure, eliminating layers of management and consolidating office locations. And we reduced staffing levels to more closely align with forward-looking activity levels. As a result, today, our run rate gross G&As cost are more than 30% below where they were in the fourth quarter of 2014. And we are a much more streamlined and efficient organization. 
Our lease operating costs, on a per-BOE basis, were down approximately 10% year-over-year when excluding the tax barrel impact of our Egyptian impairment charges. Our lease operating costs, on a per-BOE basis, were down approximately 10% year-over-year when excluding the tax barrel impact of our Egyptian impairment charges.
Our average drilled and completed well costs in North America were down 35% from fourth quarter of '14 to fourth quarter of '15. 
Furthermore, we strengthened our financial position and liquidity in 2015. A portion of our asset divestment proceeds were used to reduce debt by $2.5 billion and to build our cash balance. Apache began 2016 with approximately $5 billion of liquidity, including nearly $1.5 billion [ph] in cash. We value this position highly, and we'll be very thoughtful in this price environment as to when and how we utilize it. 
One of our primary operational objectives, both last year and in 2016, is to assess, refining, optimize and add to our extensive inventory of captured drilling locations in North America in the context of lower-for-longer oil prices. This is a comprehensive process that involves acreage delineation, wellbore redesign, completion optimization, spacing and landing zone tests, acreage swaps, purchases and sales and the creation of full field development plans. 
In addition to these activities, extensive science and testing continues on our new play concepts, which could lead to significant growth opportunities down the road. The goal of this work us to fully define and prioritize the highest rate of return, highest growth and most efficient North American opportunities to leverage in a better investment environment.
Apache is now a very well positioned for whatever lies ahead. We are living with our means and anticipate being cash flow-neutral in 2016 and beyond until such time that the pricing environment warrants higher investment levels. We have a very competitive cost structure and continue to drive overhead, LOE and capital costs lower. We are building high-quality drilling and exploratory inventory for the future. We have the financial strength and liquidity to sustain us through a prolonged period of potentially lower oil prices and to propel us into a better investment environment. 
Our sound decisions and decisive actions in 2015 leave us much better positioned today. We have improved our financial position without raising equity and without reducing or eliminating the dividend. At this time, we plan to be cash flow-neutral in 2016 and to invest primarily to enhance our long-term prospects for future growth. Maintaining strong credit quality through disciplined capital allocation is a prudent approach in this environment. Thus, we are targeting either unchanged or lower net debt levels by the end of this year. 
Now I would like to turn to the fourth quarter and full year 2015 results. We are very pleased with our delivery around items that were within our control. We exceeded our production goals across all of our regions in both the fourth quarter and for the full year 2015. We accomplished this on a capital program of $3.6 billion, which was at the low end of the original guidance range we established on our earnings call a year ago. During the fourth quarter, North America Onshore production averaged 308,000 BOEs per day, which, as expected, was a sequential increase from the third quarter production of 306,000 BOEs per day. The increase was primarily due to the timing of completions and solid well performance. 
In the Permian Basin, despite some fairly significant weather downtime in December, our fourth quarter production achieved an all-time quarterly high of 174,000 BOEs per day, up 2% sequentially from the third quarter. Growth was driven by the Delaware Basin where we completed 13 new wells, primarily targeting the Bone Spring formation at Pecos Bend. 
In the Midland Basin, Central Basin Platform and Northwest Shelf, we completed 61 new wells and delivered very good results in the Wildfire area with our first 3 lower Spraberry tests as well as 3 strong wells in the Wolfcamp in the June tippet pad. 
We also drilled some excellent wells on the Northwest Shale at the prolific Cedar Lake play. Please refer to our quarterly earnings supplement for details on some of these key wells. 
As we look ahead to 2016, our Permian rig count will fall from 10 at the beginning of January to 4 by mid-year. Permian well completions are expected to be down 75% year-over-year. These actions clearly demonstrate that we are willing to let our Permian production decline until we are in a better investment environment.
Turning to the North Sea. Volumes were approximately 72,000 BOEs per day in the fourth quarter, a 2% decline sequentially from third quarter production levels. We brought 3 new development wells online during the fourth quarter at very good rates, but these were offset by a maintenance turnaround at the Beryl Bravo platform. 
2015 was an excellent year for Apache with the drill bit in the North Sea. We brought online line 19 new development wells with an average drilling success rate of 83%. We also confirmed 3 significant new exploratory successes with the previously disclosed caliber, or K, Corona and Seagull discoveries, which we expect will contribute very material reserve and production adds in the coming years. 
In 2016, we are significantly curtailing our North Sea development drilling program and plan to employ no platform rigs during the second half of the year. As a result, North Sea production will decline slightly in 2016 compared to 2015 production of just over 71,000 BOEs per day. 
In Egypt, gross production declined roughly 3% sequentially from the third quarter. Total liquids volumes declined 2%, while downtime and bottlenecks at certain gas processing facilities reduced our natural gas volumes by 5%. On a net basis, excluding sign-up tax minority interest and the effective tax barrels, production actually increased 5% sequentially to 102,000 BOEs per day. This is a function of the significant oil price decline from third quarter to fourth quarter, which resulted in Apache receiving more cost recovery barrels under our production sharing contract agreements.
The key driver in Egypt during 2015 was the tremendous success of our drilling program and production ramp-up at [indiscernible] and Berenice. As of year-end, we had 12 wells producing in this prolific load GOR oilfields. Since November 2014, Beta and Berenice have produced 8 million barrels of oil. In 2016, we plan to stabilize gross production from these fields near [ph] 30,000 BOEs per day. Overall, our gross production volumes are expected to decline in Egypt this year. However, net volumes should increase as falling oil prices drive an increase in cost recovery barrels per our PSCs. 
On the cost side, I noted earlier that our average North American Onshore well costs were down approximately 35% from a year ago. We are continuously improving on this front and continue to see significant well cost decreases since the beginning of the year. Some of the key plays where we are seeing exceptionally low drilling and completion costs include: the Delaware Basin where we have visibility of Bone Springs and Wolfcamp wells of approximately $4.5 million; the Midland Basin where horizontal Wolfcamp and Lower Spraberry wells are projected to be drilled and completed for less than $4 million; the horizontal Yeso play in the Northwest Shelf in the Permian where our well costs record below $2.3 million; and the Woodford Scoop where our latest [indiscernible] was drilled and completed for only $7.5 million. 
In 2015, we reinvigorated Apache's culture of cost and returns discipline. While we have made great progress on costs, they are not yet fully aligned with the current price environment. Further reductions are planned for 2016, and it is imperative that we remain relentless in our efforts to drive costs down further. To achieve this, we will foster innovation and utilize technology that redefines the cost structure of both Apache and the industry.
The key takeaway is that these are not just belt-tightening efforts in response to price weakness. Apache is implementing structural changes that will continue to accrue to our bottom line number regardless of where oil prices and service costs go in the future. To that end, we believe that approximately 1/2 of the well cost reductions achieved over the past year are permanent, while the other half will fluctuate with future service cost changes. Regardless, Apache will always focus intently on controlling what we can control and remaining highly disciplined through the cycle. 
As we turn our focus for 2016, strip oil prices are now roughly 30% to 35% below where they were a year ago. This underscores the importance of continuing to foster a new mindset and approach to capital allocation and managing our cost structure. Similar to our approach in 2015, we are using a conservative price deck for 2016 budgeting and produces the risk of inadvertently putting ourselves in a position of a material outspend and helps to sustain our credit quality.
Our capital allocation process for 2016 is built around 4 key themes: living within our means and achieving cash flow neutrality for the year at $35 oil; focusing capital spending on protecting the asset base and optimizing and building inventory; maintaining our relentless focus on both capital cost and operational expenses; and remaining flexible, opportunistic and ready to react as conditions change.
With this in mind, we announced in this morning's press release 2016 capital budget of $1.4 billion to $1.8 billion, the mid-point of which represents over a 60% decrease from 2015 and over an 80% decrease from 2014 levels. 
In our North American Onshore portfolio, Apache's fortunate to have the vast majority of our high-value leasehold already held by production and only 4 rigs under longer-term higher day rate contracts. As a result, our obligation spending is relatively limited this year. At $35 oil, we do not believe spending on development wells and attempting to maintain production levels is a prudent or economic use of our precious capital dollars.
We would rather leave those barrels on the ground and come back to them in a higher price environment or as drilling and completion costs become more aligned with oil prices.
The majority of our capital spending on these onshore regions will focus on strategic testing and delineating our vast acreage position such that we optimize our growth potential and efficiencies when it is appropriate to put more rigs back into the field.
In light of these considerations, our capital allocation to North American Onshore plays is approximately $700 million or 45% of our total capital budget. At this level of investment, we anticipate a pro forma production decline of 12% to 15% in North America Onshore compared to 2015. Our decision to reduce North American Onshore investment by more than 70% and to allow production to decline in 2016 is simply due to our desire to preserve our financial position in the current investment environment. 
It is not indicative of our asset depth or quality. We are confident that our North American asset base can withstand this reduction in investment without any deterioration for the future opportunity set or impact our ability to arrest the decline and begin to grow again at the appropriate time in the future.
To provide some context around the sustainability of our onshore North American asset base, we estimate that in the current price environment, it would require a spending level of approximately $1.6 billion or an incremental $900 million of capital above our planned 2016 program in order to hold North America Onshore flat with the 2015 average of 309,000 BOEs per day. This $900 million of incremental capital is roughly equivalent to the amount of incremental cash flow Apache generates annually with a $10 per barrel increase in oil prices. This implies, with an average oil price of $45 per barrel, Apache's North American production base could be held flat with 2015 levels. At current drilling and completion costs, this maintenance spend would equate to an incremental annual average program of approximately 20 rigs in North America. 
I mentioned earlier that Apache is looking for a better investment environment before we materially increase our capital program, let alone consider outspending cash flow on an annual basis.
We have the luxury of waiting for an environment in which oil prices and service costs are fully synchronized such that fully burdened and full-cycle economics in our North American drilling programs achieve double-digit rates of return. It is not enough to deliver the 15% to 30% unburdened wellhead returns at $35 per barrel oil that are routinely quoted in industry presentations. 
At Apache, we have elevated our standard for investment of shareholders capital. Our drilling programs must deliver full-cycle, fully burdened rates of return in the mid- to high double digits in order to deliver an acceptable return on capital employed for the shareholder. That said, we are thoroughly assessing our entire North American footprint and will be prepared to put rig lines back in the each of the Pecos Bend, Evergreen and [indiscernible] areas of the Delaware Basin and our high rate of return horizontal Yeso plant in the Northwest Shale. We could add several incremental rigs in our Midland Basin and Wolfcamp and Lower Spraberry plays, where we have 200,000-plus net acres in 4 core counties. 
Our [indiscernible] position will support an incremental drilling program for several years to come, and we have numerous high-volume, multi-well development pad locations ready to go in the Duvernay and Montney in Canada. When oil prices rally further, our Eagle Ford and Canyon Lime will come back into play and contribute to North American growth. 
On the international side, Egypt and the North Sea continue to deliver projects with solid rates of return and strong net present values. Because both are economically advantaged under our assumed $35 oil price, we are allocating approximately $800 million or 50% of our 2016 capital budget to these regions.
We project pro forma production from our international and offshore regions this year will be relatively flat compared to 2015. The budget I've just described is based on specific oil price and service cost assumptions. If oil prices recover or if average well costs decline such as that our cash flow is higher than we have budgeted, we anticipate directing the majority of the incremental dollars to Onshore North America. This could, in turn, mitigate a portion of the decline implied by our guidance. 
Before I conclude, I would like to outline some of Apache's potential future growth drivers as we look beyond 2016.
With higher oil prices and access to more internally generated cash flow, our North American Onshore production will stabilize and return to growth. This growth will come from lower cost wells that generate better returns than Apache's historical North American programs. Hydrated plays with years of running room across our 3.3 million gross legacy acres in the Permian will drive growth from the Bone Springs Upper, Wolfcamp, Lower Spraberry, Yeso and other formations. This will be supplemented by the Woodford SCOOP, Montney and Duvernay post-2016. 
Additionally, we have acquired a substantial amount of relatively low-cost acreage since early 2015 that could be incremental to the growth potential that resides in our legacy Permian and Anadarko positions.
In the North Sea, will also see excellent growth potential. In mid-2017, we plan to bring our Caliber discovery online in a 30-day IP rate of approximately 15,000 BOEs per day, net to Apache. Following that, in mid-2018, we anticipate bringing online our first tertiary inject type discovery, Corona, at a rate of 5,000 to 10,000 BOEs per day net. 
Looking out a bit longer term, corona has de-risked a string of exploration prospects that will be drilled in the future. Over this same time frame, we will conduct exploration activities on our 2.3 gross million acres offshore Serono. While it is still early, we are excited about the potential for this area, which lies in the newly confirmed oil province. We have included a map of our [indiscernible] position in our quarterly earnings supplement for your information. 
In closing, Apache is well-prepared for a lower-for-even-longer oil price environment. As experts debate, when or if oil prices increase into what levels, Apache will continue to focus on the things we can control. Our primary strategic objectives in 2016 are: manage the cash flow neutrality after dividends and in the year with unchanged or lower net debt levels; preserve our strong financial position; protect our asset base; and optimize and expand our high-quality inventory of growth opportunities through strategic testing and exploration.
Our goal is to emerge from this commodity price downturn with top-tier financial strength, a robust inventory of high rate of return growing opportunities in North America and a sustained capacity to generate free cash flow from our international assets in Egypt and the North Sea. 
While we don't know when prices will recover, we do know that the prudent choices we are making today will enhance our long-term success. Quite often, it is during downturns like these that the choices companies make either set them up for long-term success or set them back. I believe we have significantly strengthened Apache Corporation despite the challenging price environment. And we are positioning ourselves to succeed through the recovery. 
I will now turn the call over to Steve Riney."

As John indicated, Apache had a very good year in 2015. We made outstanding progress high-grading the portfolio, driving down costs, aligning capital programs with cash flows and proactively strengthening our financial position. We entered 2016 well positioned for the challenges our industry will face.
Today, I will highlight Apache's financial progress, which includes our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2015; progress with our ongoing cost-reduction efforts; a review of our financial strength and liquidity; and our outlook for 2016 production and capital spending.
So let's begin with the fourth quarter financial results. As noted in our press release, under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, Apache reported a loss of $7.2 billion or $19.07 per common share. Our results for the quarter include a number of items outside of our core earnings that are typically excluded by the investment community in published earnings estimates, the most significant of which are ceiling test write-down, impairments and tax adjustments associated with these items. 
As in prior periods, these write-downs resulted from the continued low commodity price environment. Our loss for the quarter, adjusted for these items, was $24 million or $0.06 per share. 
Before I turn to other items, I'd like to comment on the reported production volumes, which include a significant downward adjustment related to Egyptian tax barrels. The terms of our Egyptian PSCs provide that the payment of income taxes attributable to our entitlement will be made by EGPC from their share of production. We then gross up our results for these taxes, which are paid on our behalf. Egyptian income taxes are calculated based on book income and are recorded as tax expense with an equal and offsetting amount in oil and gas revenues. Since there is no impact on net income as the revenues and tax expense we record each quarter offset one another. The revenue effect of this gross-up is also recorded as production volume in our operating results. These are referred to as Egypt tax barrels. 
In the first 3 quarters of 2015, we recognized book income, tax expense and thus tax barrel production volumes. In the fourth quarter, we incurred a $1.3 billion charge related to impairments and write-downs in Egypt, driven by the continued fall in oil prices, which resulted in a significant loss for the quarter. This loss has the effect of offsetting nearly all of the previously recorded tax expense and tax barrels in the first 3 quarters, thereby resulting in a large negative income tax expense and negative tax barrel production in the fourth quarter. The total impact of the impairment is a loss of 38,280 barrels of oil equivalent per day of volumes in the fourth quarter or 9,649 barrels of oil equivalent per day for the full year 2015. 
Because the Egypt tax barrel volumes have no economic impact to Apache and, as we see in the fourth quarter, can fluctuate materially from quarter-to-quarter, our pro forma production guidance always excludes tax barrels. We believe this non-GAAP view of production is more reflective of underlying economic production volumes. 
Now let me turn to capital expenditures and costs. In 2015, Apache's intense focus on driving internal efficiencies, along with the significant downward pressure on third-party service costs, resulted in substantial efficiency gains in both capital and operating costs. Capital spending came in at $678 million for the fourth quarter and $3.6 billion for the full year. This was at the low end of our original guidance range. As a reminder, our 2015 capital spending guidance excluded capital attributable to our 1/3 partner in Egypt, capitalized interest, opportunistic leasehold purchases and capital associated with divested LNG and associated operations.
As Gary noted at the outset of this call, we are changing our CapEx guidance convention in 2016. Our guidance now includes all anticipated capital spending categories, except capital attributable to our minority partner in Egypt. This should make it easier to track our capital spending plans for the year. 
On the lease operating expense side, our fourth quarter LOE was $10.04 per BOE, which is 3% higher than the fourth quarter of 2014. For the year, LOE averaged $9.49 per BOE, which is 9% lower than 2014. Underlying improvement in these metrics is masked by the negative Egypt tax barrel volumes in the fourth quarter. On a like-for-like basis, excluding this impact, our lease operating expenses were down 4% and 10% per BOE, respectively, in the fourth quarter and the full year 2015.
We have also spoken to you about progress on our G&A costs. As a reminder, we consider G&A to be our gross cash expenditures for all costs above field operations. Stated goal was to exit 2015 with a G&A run rate of $700 million, a decrease of over 30% from our run rate in the fourth quarter of 2014.
I'm happy to say we achieved this goal. As we look ahead to 2016, we continue to find overhead efficiencies, and we are reducing our G&A cost estimate for this year to a range of $650 million to $700 million. 
Next I would like to make a few comments regarding our financial strength and liquidity position. In 2015, we reduced our debt levels from year-end 2014 by $2.5 billion, ending the year with $8.8 billion of total debt. We retained $1.5 billion of cash, which we may utilize to further pay down debt. We ended the year with net debt of $7.3 billion. Our latest 12 months net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio as of December 31, 2015 was just under 2x. Apache's nearest long-term debt maturity is in 2018, and only $700 million or 8% of our total debt portfolio matures prior to 2021. We restructured and refreshed our $3.5 billion credit facility, which now matures in June 2020. And combined with our cash position, we now have total liquidity of approximately $5 billion. 
At this time, our financial condition and liquidity are very strong. And we have accomplished this without issuing equity, without reducing the dividend and without selling core strategic assets. And to ensure that we sustain this strong position, we have chosen to reduce our capital spending this year to a level where we can attain cash flow neutrality at $35 oil.
Both John and I have mentioned the term cash flow neutrality a few times in reference to our overarching goals. So let me be clear what we mean by this. Cash flow neutrality means the capital program, debt service and the dividend are all funded through cash from operations, with little or no underpinning from financing or portfolio actions. Cash from operations includes all operating costs, including corporate overhead and includes movement in working capital. At this time, we anticipate only small, noncore, nonproducing asset sales will be necessary to achieve cash flow neutrality in 2016, assuming $35 oil prices. 
We could choose to spend more capital, but as John outlined, we believe that preserving our strong financial position and our credit quality through cash flow neutrality is the best approach for our shareholders in this price environment. In the event prices improve during the year, we stand prepared to ramp up our investment activity within the constraint of cash flow neutrality. 
Now I'd like to provide some more detail on our 2016 capital program. As John discussed, our budget of $1.4 billion to $1.8 billion is the product of a $35 oil price assumption for the year. Since we are in a very volatile price environment and our overarching goal is for cash flow neutrality, the capital budget will flex up or down with price movements. Capital in 2016 will be allocated on a prioritized basis to protect the asset base; further optimize and build high-quality inventory for the future; conduct certain longer-cycle, high-impact exploration activities; and to pursue higher-return development activities, which remain economically very attractive at these low prices.
There are 2 types of spend required to protect the asset base. First, we have to maintain the assets and keep them running efficiently. This includes workovers, recompletions and maintenance and will represent approximately 30% of our capital program. 
Second, in some places, we have to engage in activity to maintain ownership of the mineral rights or to preserve leases. This includes continuous drilling activity or leasehold and production maintenance and will represent approximately 5% of our capital program.
We will allocate roughly 30% of our capital to key exploration activities and new play tests to continue building and high-grading our drilling inventory for the future. This will include continuing our highly successful North Sea excursion program, key play tests on some of our existing acreage in the Permian and Anadarko Basins and seismic commitments in Offshore Surinam. The remaining 35% of our capital program will go to development activity. Most of this will be allocated to the North Sea and Egypt, where we continue to see development opportunities that work very well at low oil prices. This is primarily due to contract structures and tax regimes that provide favorable capital recovery mechanisms and higher average cash margins. We suggest our investors review our earnings supplement for additional detail regarding regional-by-region netbacks.
We also have a number of onshore North America drilling locations in the Permian Basin and Woodford SCOOP that remain economically attractive. However, these areas will receive less allocated capital due to capital budget being constrained by cash flow. While we have reduced development activity on these assets, the leases are preserved and development will ramp back up in these assets in several other areas when oil prices and costs are better aligned to deliver more attractive return.
Our reduced 2016 capital spending level is appropriate and prudent for a $35 oil environment. The end result is that we expect our total pro forma production to be in the range of 433,000 to 453,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. This will represent a decline of 7% to 11% from a comparative pro forma volume of 486,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2015. These volumes exclude Egypt minority interest, Egypt tax barrels and the effect of divested volumes from the 2015 base. If prices rise, allowing more capital to be deployed, we anticipate most incremental investment would be directed to onshore North America. And this would offset some of this anticipated decline.
In 2016, we will continue to optimize LOE to gain our expected production decline and a mix shift to slightly higher cost international production. In 2016, we will continue to optimize LOE by giving our expected production decline and a mixed shift to slightly higher cost international production. We do not anticipate materially lower operating costs on a per barrel of oil equivalent per basis. 
In terms of 2016 income taxes, we expect our adjusted earnings global effective tax rate to currently be in the range of 15% to 20%. Obviously lower than what we would typically expect, our effective tax rate is being driven primarily by an expectation of very low book income. Going forward, we will be able to provide updates to this rate as the year progresses.
Also, we can provide some guidance around expected cash tax payments. We will pay the remainder of the income tax accrued for repatriating 2015 foreign sales proceeds of $85 million in the first quarter. Given the low commodity price environment, we currently believe that our cash tax payments in 2016, including cash taxes associated with the petroleum revenue tax in the U.K., will be minimal. 
For the first quarter, we are providing pro forma production guidance for North American Onshore of 290,000 to 295,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Our international and offshore production is guided to 180,000 to 185,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, which excludes Egypt tax barrels and the Egypt minority interest.
Our projected capital spend in the first quarter is $500 million to $550 million or approximately 1/3 of our full year 2016 budget. 
In closing, our prudent approach in 2015 has put us on firm ground and helps ensure resiliency in this difficult and unpredictable environment. As a result, we are prepared to endure a potentially lower for even longer commodity cycle while retaining our ability to dynamically manage our activity levels, up or down, as commodity prices and service costs dictate. Through all of this, our primary goals will remain unchanged. We will live within our means, maintain our strong financial position, build quality development inventory for the future and invest to improve returns and grow value for our shareholders.
We look forward to the successful 2016. And I would now like to turn the call over to the operator for Q&A."

As I said earlier on the call, in the prepared notes, that an additional $900 million, the incremental capital in North America, we keep North America flat to slightly growing, which translates to about a $45 world. So 2016, we could live within cash flow and be flat to relatively slight growth. So as we look ahead into '17, there's a  couple of things going on. First and foremost, we're in the second year now of a significantly reduced CapEx budget. We reduced aggressively last year, again this year. So we've got fewer wells that were brought on than historical. So our rates will be flatting slightly as we go into '17. Secondly, it will not take us much capital in 2017 to keep it flat, especially with North America. We're already investing at levels right now in the international side. Additionally, we've got some catalysts that will be coming on in '17. If you look at the North Sea, our calendar well, potentially more than 1 well there could be coming on. So we've got some catalysts, and quite frankly, now is with the capital efficiency we're seeing, anything I'll say is we look at that 2016 budget, we've already seen well costs coming in significantly under what we've planned this year. So that capital efficiency is the other big thing. So I think as we get out into '17, it's going to take a lower oil price for us to be able to stay flat and potentially grow."

We've done all the things that strengthen the financial position, the liquidity position, our refinance risk on the debt portfolio.

There are some good ones now that we believe are going to be even better. So we've chosen to be cash flow-neutral. So we've got about $1.5 billion of cash on the balance sheet, chosen to be cash flow-neutral. We don't really need to reduce the dividend at this point in time. And we do discuss that with the Board. We discuss it with them every quarter, and I imagine we'll continue to discuss that with them every quarter.

In conjunction with this morning's press release, I hope you have had the opportunity to review our quarterly earnings supplement, which summarizes key financial and operational data for the fourth quarter and full year 2015, along with details regarding our 2016 production and capital spending outlook. We have revised and streamlined the structure and content of our earnings supplement and believe you will find it more useful. 
Also, please note that we have changed our capital expenditure guidance convention to reflect a more comprehensive picture of our spending. Specifically, the 2016 capital spending range we've provided in this morning's press release includes all exploration, development, gathering, transportation and processing expenditures. It also includes budgeted leasehold acquisition costs and capitalized interest and capitalized G&A. The only element of our 2016 program that our guidance will continue to exclude is capital attributable to our minority interest partner in Egypt. As a result of this guidance change, references made on today's call to 2015 and 2016 capital spending may not be directly comparable.
Our earnings release, the accompanying financial tables and non-GAAP reconciliations, along with our quarterly earnings supplement, can all be found on our website at www.apachecorp.com/financial data. We also plan to post on our website a section, which contains responses to any questions that arise on today's call for which we do not have readily available information to answer.
I'd like to remind everyone that today's discussions will contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions based on our current views and reasonable expectations. However, a number of factors could cause actual results to materially differ from what we discuss today. A full disclaimer is located with the supplemental data on our website. 
And I would now like to turn the call over to John."

I would like to begin with a recap of the significant progress Apache made in 2015. I will then provide some highlights from our fourth quarter and full year results and conclude with some specific thoughts on what to expect for 2016. 
Apache underwent a significant transition in 2015. While the external environment remains challenging, we entered 2016 better positioned to operate and thrive in a lower-for-longer commodity price environment. In addition to completing an extensive refocusing on the portfolio, we have taken other decisive actions to position Apache for an extended low-price environment, which included: aligning our capital spending with cash flows, attacking the cost structure, continuing the high grade and build an inventory of attractive opportunities that will deliver strong returns under a low oil price environment and strengthening our financial position and liquidity. While we have made tremendous progress, we are not yet finished with these efforts. 
We streamlined our portfolio, exiting Argentina, Australia, much of the Gulf of Mexico and 2 world-scale LNG projects. We are now focused on 3 principal areas: a substantial onshore North American acreage position with an abundant inventory of high-value growth opportunities, anchored by our extensive Permian footprint and sustainable free cash flow generators; and our higher cash margin North Sea and Egypt businesses, each with many years of low-risk drilling opportunities and significant exploration potential still ahead. 
In the current low oil price environment, our more conventional international assets continue to generate strong cash flows and better rates of return than many of our operations in North America.
In the North Sea, we are uniquely positioned. We have 2 large-scale hydrocarbon accumulations at Forties and Beryl, available high-quality platform and pipeline infrastructure and per-unit cash operating costs that are 1/2 the industry average. These advantages make tiebacks to existing infrastructure very economic even at current oil prices.
In Egypt, we benefit from the cost recovery aspect of our production-sharing contracts such that they help to mitigate the impact of declining oil prices on our cash flows. Our international positions clearly differentiate our portfolio, play to Apache's long-standing strengths and remain economically attractive in this low oil price environment.
A year ago, Apache took more decisive action than many of our peers and reduced activity levels in pursuit of cash flow neutrality. We anticipated the lower-for-longer oil price scenario and recognize the importance of protecting value through more disciplined investment. Accordingly, we reduced capital by more than 60% in 2015 from 2014 levels and focused on bringing cost into alignment with the current oil price environment. Specifically, this time last year on our fourth quarter 2014 conference call, I stated that, ""We would consider using our balance sheet only to capitalize on lower acreage cost and other potential opportunities that may occur rather than to drill wells and chase production in a depressed and volatile oil price environment."" We stuck to that view throughout 2015 and continued to do so today 1 year later. At the same time, we instituted an even more rigorous capital allocation process through which we continually monitor the delivery of the capital programs and reallocate capital as value maximization demands. 
Motivated by the deteriorating oil price environment and a goal to achieve cash flow neutrality, we attacked our cost structure in 2015 with a thorough review of G&A, LOE and capital costs. Specifically, we rationalized our entire organizational structure, eliminating layers of management and consolidating office locations, and we reduced staffing levels to more closely align with forward-looking activity levels. As a result, today, our run rate gross G&A costs are more than 30% below where they were in the fourth quarter of 2014, and we are a much more streamlined and efficient organization. 
Our lease operating costs, on a per-BOE basis, were down approximately 10% year-over-year when excluding the tax barrel impact of our Egyptian impairment charges. Our lease operating costs, on a per-BOE basis, were down approximately 10% year-over-year when excluding the tax barrel impact of our Egyptian impairment charges.
Our average drilled and completed well costs in North America were down 35% from fourth quarter of '14 to fourth quarter of '15. Furthermore, we strengthened our financial position and liquidity in 2015. A portion of our asset divestment proceeds were used to reduce debt by $2.5 billion and to build our cash balance. Apache began 2016 with approximately $5 billion of liquidity, including nearly $1.5 billion in cash. We value this position highly, and we'll be very thoughtful in this price environment as to when and how we utilize it. 
One of our primary operational objectives, both last year and in 2016, is to assess, refine, optimize and add to our extensive inventory of captured drilling locations in North America in the context of lower-for-longer oil prices. This is a comprehensive process that involves acreage delineation, wellbore redesign, completion optimization, spacing and landing zone tests, acreage swaps, purchases and sales and the creation of full field development plans. 
In addition to these activities, extensive science and testing continues on our new play concepts, which could lead to significant growth opportunities down the road. The goal of this work is to fully define and prioritize the highest rate of return, highest growth and most efficient North American opportunities to leverage in a better investment environment.
Apache is now very well positioned for whatever lies ahead. We are living with our means and anticipate being cash flow neutral in 2016 and beyond until such time that the pricing environment warrants higher investment levels. We have a very competitive cost structure and continue to drive overhead, LOE and capital costs lower. We are building high-quality drilling and exploratory inventory for the future. We have the financial strength and liquidity to sustain us through a prolonged period of potentially lower oil prices and to propel us into a better investment environment. 
Our sound decisions and decisive actions in 2015 leave us much better positioned today. We have improved our financial position without raising equity and without reducing or eliminating the dividend. At this time, we plan to be cash flow neutral in 2016 and to invest primarily to enhance our long-term prospects for future growth. Maintaining strong credit quality through disciplined capital allocation is a prudent approach in this environment. Thus, we are targeting either unchanged or lower net debt levels by the end of this year. 
Now I would like to turn to the fourth quarter and full year 2015 results. We are very pleased with our delivery around items that were within our control. We exceeded our production goals across all of our regions in both the fourth quarter and for the full year 2015. We accomplished this on a capital program of $3.6 billion, which was at the low end of the original guidance range we established on our earnings call a year ago. 
During the fourth quarter, North America Onshore production averaged 308,000 BOEs per day, which, as expected, was a sequential increase from the third quarter production of 306,000 BOEs per day. The increase was primarily due to the timing of completions and solid well performance. 
In the Permian Basin, despite some fairly significant weather downtime in December, our fourth quarter production achieved an all-time quarterly high of 174,000 BOEs per day, up 2% sequentially from the third quarter. Growth was driven by the Delaware Basin where we completed 13 new wells, primarily targeting the Bone Springs formation at Pecos Bend. 
In the Midland Basin, Central Basin Platform and Northwest Shelf, we completed 61 new wells and delivered very good results in the Wildfire area with our first 3 Lower Spraberry tests as well as 3 strong wells in the Wolfcamp on our June Tippett pad. We also drilled some excellent wells on the Northwest Shelf at our prolific Cedar Lake Yeso play. Please refer to our quarterly earnings supplement for details on some of these key wells. 
As we look ahead to 2016, our Permian rig count will fall from 10 at the beginning of January to 4 by mid-year. Permian well completions are expected to be down 75% year-over-year. These actions clearly demonstrate that we are willing to let our Permian production decline until we are in a better investment environment.
Turning to the North Sea. Volumes were approximately 72,000 BOEs per day in the fourth quarter, a 2% decline sequentially from third quarter production levels. We brought 3 new development wells online during the fourth quarter at very good rates, but these were offset by a maintenance turnaround at the Beryl Bravo platform. 
2015 was an excellent year for Apache with the drillbit in the North Sea. We brought online 19 new development wells with an average drilling success rate of 83%. We also confirmed 3 significant new exploratory successes with the previously disclosed caliber or K, Corona and Seagull discoveries, which we expect will contribute very material reserve and production adds in the coming years. 
In 2016, we are significantly curtailing our North Sea development drilling program and plan to employ no platform rigs during the second half of the year. As a result, North Sea production will decline slightly in 2016 compared to 2015 production of just over 71,000 BOEs per day. 
In Egypt, gross production declined roughly 3% sequentially from the third quarter. Total liquids volumes declined 2%, while downtime and bottlenecks at certain gas processing facilities reduced our natural gas volumes by 5%. On a net basis, excluding sign-up tax minority interest and the effective tax barrels, production actually increased 5% sequentially to 102,000 BOEs per day. This is a function of the significant oil price decline from third quarter to fourth quarter, which resulted in Apache receiving more cost recovery barrels under our production-sharing contract agreements.
The key driver in Egypt during 2015 was the tremendous success of our drilling program and production ramp-up at Ptah and Berenice. As of year-end, we had 12 wells producing in this prolific low-GOR oilfields. Since November 2014, Ptah and Berenice have produced more than 8 million barrels of oil. In 2016, we plan to stabilize gross production from these fields near 30,000 BOEs per day. Overall, our gross production volumes are expected to decline in Egypt this year. However, net volumes should increase as falling oil prices drive an increase in cost recovery barrels per our PSCs. 
On the cost side, I noted earlier that our average North American Onshore well costs were down approximately 35% from a year ago. We are continuously improving on this front and continue to see significant well cost decreases since the beginning of the year. Some of the key plays where we are seeing exceptionally low drilling and completion costs include: the Delaware Basin where we have visibility of Bone Springs and Wolfcamp wells of approximately $4.5 million; the Midland Basin where horizontal Wolfcamp and Lower Spraberry wells are projected to be drilled and completed for less than $4 million; the horizontal Yeso play and the Northwest Shelf in the Permian where our well costs are trending below $2.3 million; and the Woodford/SCOOP where our latest pacesetter was drilled and completed for only $7.5 million. 
In 2015, we reinvigorated Apache's culture of costs and returns discipline. While we have made great progress on costs, they are not yet fully aligned with the current price environment. Further reductions are planned for 2016, and it is imperative that we remain relentless in our efforts to drive costs down further. To achieve this, we will foster innovation and utilize technology that redefines the cost structure of both Apache and the industry.
The key takeaway is that these are not just belt-tightening efforts in response to price weakness. Apache is implementing structural changes that will continue to accrue to our bottom line regardless of where oil prices and service costs go in the future. To that end, we believe that approximately 1/2 of the well cost reductions achieved over the past year are permanent, while the other half will fluctuate with future service cost changes. Regardless, Apache will always focus intently on controlling what we can control and remaining highly disciplined through the cycle. 
As we turn our focus to 2016, strip oil prices are now roughly 30% to 35% below where they were a year ago. This underscores the importance of continuing to foster a new mindset and approach to capital allocation and managing our cost structure. Similar to our approach in 2015, we are using a conservative price deck for 2016 budgeting. It reduces the risk of inadvertently putting ourselves in a position of a material outspend and helps to sustain our credit quality.
Our capital allocation process for 2016 is built around 4 key themes: living within our means and achieving cash flow neutrality for the year at $35 oil; focusing capital spending on protecting the asset base and optimizing and building inventory; maintaining a relentless focus on both capital costs and operational expenses; and remaining flexible, opportunistic and ready to react as conditions change.
With this in mind, we announced in this morning's press release 2016 capital budget of $1.4 billion to $1.8 billion, the midpoint of which represents over a 60% decrease from 2015 and over an 80% decrease from 2014 levels. 
In our North American Onshore portfolio, Apache's fortunate to have the vast majority of our high-value leasehold already held by production and only 4 rigs under longer-term higher day rate contracts. As a result, our obligation spending is relatively limited this year. At $35 oil, we do not believe spending on development wells and attempting to maintain production levels is a prudent or economic use of our precious capital dollars. We would rather leave those barrels in the ground and come back to them in a higher price environment or as drilling and completion costs become more aligned with oil prices. The majority of our capital spending on these onshore regions will focus on strategic testing and delineating our vast acreage position such that we optimize our growth potential and efficiencies when it is appropriate to put more rigs back into the field.
In light of these considerations, our capital allocation to North American Onshore plays is approximately $700 million or 45% of our total capital budget. At this level of investment, we anticipate a pro forma production decline of 12% to 15% in North America Onshore compared to 2015. Our decision to reduce North American Onshore investment by more than 70% and to allow production to decline in 2016 is simply due to our desire to preserve our financial position in the current investment environment. It is not indicative of our asset depth or quality. We are confident that our North American asset base can withstand this reduction in investment without any deterioration for the future opportunity set or impact our ability to arrest the decline and begin to grow again at the appropriate time in the future.
To provide some context around the sustainability of our onshore North American asset base, we estimate that in the current price environment, it would require a spending level of approximately $1.6 billion or an incremental $900 million of capital above our planned 2016 program in order to hold North America Onshore flat with the 2015 average of 309,000 BOEs per day. This $900 million of incremental capital is roughly equivalent to the amount of incremental cash flow Apache generates annually with a $10 per barrel increase in oil prices. This implies, with an average oil price of $45 per barrel, Apache's North American production base could be held flat with 2015 levels. At current drilling and completion costs, this maintenance spend would equate to an incremental annual average program of approximately 20 rigs in North America. 
I mentioned earlier that Apache is looking for a better investment environment before we materially increase our capital program, let alone consider outspending cash flow on an annual basis. We have the luxury of waiting for an environment in which oil prices and service costs are fully synchronized such that fully burdened and full-cycle economics in our North American drilling programs achieve double-digit rates of return. It is not enough to deliver the 15% to 30% unburdened wellhead returns at $35 per barrel oil that are routinely quoted in industry presentations. 
At Apache, we have elevated our standard for investment of shareholders' capital. Our drilling programs must deliver full-cycle, fully burdened rates of return in the mid- to high double digits in order to deliver an acceptable return on capital employed for the shareholder. That said, we are thoroughly assessing our entire North American footprint and will be prepared to put rig lines back in each of the Pecos Bend, Evergreen and Waha areas of the Delaware Basin and our high rate of return horizontal Yeso play in the Northwest Shelf. We could add several incremental rig in our Midland Basin and Wolfcamp and Lower Spraberry plays, where we have 200,000-plus net acres in 4 core counties. 
Our Woodford/SCOOP position will support an incremental drilling program for several years to come, and we have numerous high-volume, multi-well development pad locations ready to go in the Duvernay and Montney in Canada. When oil prices rally further, our Eagle Ford and Canyon Lime will come back into play and contribute to North American growth. 
On the international side, Egypt and the North Sea continue to deliver projects with solid rates of return and strong net present values. Because both are economically advantaged under our assumed $35 oil price, we are allocating approximately $800 million or 50% of our 2016 capital budget to these regions.
We project pro forma production from our international and offshore regions this year will be relatively flat compared to 2015. The budget I just described is based on specific oil price and service cost assumptions. If oil prices recover or if average well costs decline such that our cash flow is higher than we have budgeted, we anticipate directing the majority of the incremental dollars to onshore North America. This could, in turn, mitigate a portion of the decline implied by our guidance. 
Before I conclude, I would like to outline some of Apache's potential future growth drivers as we look beyond 2016. With higher oil prices and access to more internally generated cash flow, our North American Onshore production will stabilize and return to growth. This growth will come from lower-cost wells that generate better returns than Apache's historical North American programs. High-graded plays with years of running room across our 3.3 million gross legacy acres in the Permian will drive growth from the Bone Springs, Wolfcamp, Lower Spraberry, Yeso and other formations. This will be supplemented by the Woodford/SCOOP, Montney and Duvernay post-2016. Additionally, we have acquired a substantial amount of relatively low-cost acreage since early 2015 that could be incremental to the growth potential that resides in our legacy Permian and Anadarko positions.
In the North Sea, we'll also see excellent growth potential. In mid-2017, we plan to bring our Callater discovery online in a 30-day IP rate of approximately 15,000 BOEs per day net to Apache. Following that, in mid-2018, we anticipate bringing online our first Tertiary injectite discovery, Corona, at a rate of 5,000 to 10,000 BOEs per day net. 
Looking out a bit longer term, Corona has de-risked a string of exploration prospects that will be drilled in the future. Over this same time frame, we will conduct exploration activities on our 2.3 gross million acres offshore Suriname. While it is still early, we are excited about the potential for this area, which lies in the newly confirmed oil province. We have included a map of our Suriname position in our quarterly earnings supplement for your information. 
In closing, Apache is well prepared for a lower-for-even-longer oil price environment. As experts debate when or if oil prices will increase into what levels, Apache will continue to focus on the things we can control. Our primary strategic objectives in 2016 are: manage the cash flow neutrality after dividends and in the year with unchanged or lower net debt levels, preserve our strong financial position, protect our asset base and optimize and expand our high-quality inventory of growth opportunities through strategic testing and exploration. 
Our goal is to emerge from this commodity price downturn with top-tier financial strength, a robust inventory of high rate of return growing opportunities in North America and a sustained capacity to generate free cash flow from our international assets in Egypt and the North Sea. While we don't know when prices will recover, we do know that the prudent choices we are making today will enhance our long-term success. Quite often, it is during downturns like these that the choices companies make can either set them up for long-term success or set them back. I believe we have significantly strengthened Apache Corporation despite the challenging price environment, and we are positioning ourselves to succeed through the recovery. 
I will now turn the call over to Steve Riney."

As John indicated, Apache had a very good year in 2015. We made outstanding progress high-grading the portfolio, driving down costs, aligning capital programs with cash flows and proactively strengthening our financial position. We entered 2016 well positioned for the challenges our industry will face.
Today, I will highlight Apache's financial progress, which includes our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2015, progress with our ongoing cost-reduction efforts, a review of our financial strength and liquidity and our outlook for 2016 production and capital spending.
So let's begin with the fourth quarter financial results. As noted in our press release, under generally accepted accounting principles, Apache reported a loss of $7.2 billion or $19.07 per common share. Our results for the quarter include a number of items outside of our core earnings that are typically excluded by the investment community in published earnings estimates, the most significant of which are ceiling test write-downs, impairments and tax adjustments associated with these items. As in prior periods, these write-downs resulted from the continued low commodity price environment. Our loss for the quarter, adjusted for these items, was $24 million or $0.06 per share. 
Before I turn to other items, I'd like to comment on the reported production volumes, which include a significant downward adjustment related to Egyptian tax barrels. The terms of our Egyptian PSCs provide that the payment of income taxes attributable to our entitlement will be made by EGPC from their share of production. We then gross up our results for these taxes, which are paid on our behalf. Egyptian income taxes are calculated based on book income and are recorded as tax expense with an equal and offsetting amount in oil and gas revenues. Thus, there is no impact on net income as the revenues and tax expense we record each quarter offset one another. The revenue effect of this gross-up is also recorded as production volume in our operating results. These are referred to as Egypt tax barrels. 
In the first 3 quarters of 2015, we recognized book income, tax expense and, thus, tax barrel production volumes. In the fourth quarter, we incurred a $1.3 billion charge related to impairments and write-downs in Egypt, driven by the continued fall in oil prices, which resulted in a significant loss for the quarter. This loss has the effect of offsetting nearly all of the previously recorded tax expense and tax barrels in the first 3 quarters, thereby resulting in a large negative income tax expense and negative tax barrel production in the fourth quarter. The total impact of the impairment is a loss of 38,280 barrels of oil equivalent per day of volumes in the fourth quarter or 9,649 barrels of oil equivalent per day for the full year of 2015. 
Because the Egypt tax barrel volumes have no economic impact to Apache and, as we see in the fourth quarter, can fluctuate materially from quarter-to-quarter, our pro forma production guidance always excludes tax barrels. We believe this non-GAAP view of production is more reflective of underlying economic production volumes. 
Now let me turn to capital expenditures and costs. In 2015, Apache's intense focus on driving internal efficiencies, along with the significant downward pressure on third-party service costs, resulted in substantial efficiency gains in both capital and operating costs. Capital spending came in at $678 million for the fourth quarter and $3.6 billion for the full year. This was at the low end of our original guidance range. As a reminder, our 2015 capital spending guidance excluded capital attributable to our 1/3 partner in Egypt, capitalized interest, opportunistic leasehold purchases and capital associated with divested LNG and associated operations.
As Gary noted at the outset of this call, we are changing our CapEx guidance convention in 2016. Our guidance now includes all anticipated capital spending categories, except capital attributable to our minority partner in Egypt. This should make it easier to track our capital spending plans for the year. 
On the lease operating expense side, our fourth quarter LOE was $10.04 per BOE, which is 3% higher than the fourth quarter of 2014. For the year, LOE averaged $9.49 per BOE, which is 9% lower than 2014. Underlying improvement in these metrics is masked by the negative Egypt tax barrel volumes in the fourth quarter. On a like-for-like basis, excluding this impact, our lease operating expenses were down 4% and 10% per BOE, respectively, in the fourth quarter and the full year 2015.
We have also spoken to you about progress on our G&A costs. As a reminder, we consider G&A to be our gross cash expenditures for all costs above field operations. Stated goal was to exit 2015 with a G&A run rate of $700 million, a decrease of over 30% from our run rate in the fourth quarter of 2014.
I'm happy to say we achieved this goal. As we look ahead to 2016, we continue to find overhead efficiencies, and we are reducing our G&A cost estimate for this year to a range of $650 million to $700 million. 
Next, I would like to make a few comments regarding our financial strength and liquidity position. In 2015, we reduced our debt levels from year-end 2014 by $2.5 billion, ending the year with $8.8 billion of total debt. We retained $1.5 billion of cash, which we may utilize to further pay down debt. We ended the year with net debt of $7.3 billion. Our latest 12 months net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio as of December 31, 2015, was just under 2x. Apache's nearest long-term debt maturity is in 2018, and only $700 million or 8% of our total debt portfolio matures prior to 2021. We restructured and refreshed our $3.5 billion credit facility, which now matures in June 2020. And combined with our cash position, we now have total liquidity of approximately $5 billion. 
At this time, our financial condition and liquidity are very strong, and we have accomplished this without issuing equity, without reducing the dividend and without selling core strategic assets. And to ensure that we sustain this strong position, we have chosen to reduce our capital spending this year to a level where we can attain cash flow neutrality at $35 oil.
Both John and I have mentioned the term cash flow neutrality a few times in reference to our overarching goals, so let me be clear what we mean by this. Cash flow neutrality means the capital program, debt service and the dividend are all funded through cash from operations, with little or no underpinning from financing or portfolio actions. Cash from operations includes all operating costs, including corporate overhead and includes movements in working capital. At this time, we anticipate only small, non-core, nonproducing asset sales will be necessary to achieve cash flow neutrality in 2016, assuming $35 oil prices. 
We could choose to spend more capital, but as John outlined, we believe that preserving our strong financial position and our credit quality through cash flow neutrality is the best approach for our shareholders in this price environment. In the event prices improve during the year, we stand prepared to ramp up our investment activity within the constraint of cash flow neutrality. 
Now I'd like to provide some more detail on our 2016 capital program. As John discussed, our budget of $1.4 billion to $1.8 billion is the product of a $35 oil price assumption for the year. Since we are in a very volatile price environment and our overarching goal is for cash flow neutrality, the capital budget will flex up or down with price movements. Capital in 2016 will be allocated on a prioritized basis to protect the asset base; further optimize and build high-quality inventory for the future; conduct certain longer-cycle, high-impact exploration activities; and to pursue higher-return development activities, which remain economically very attractive at these low prices.
There are 2 types of spend required to protect the asset base: First, we have to maintain the assets and keep them running efficiently. This includes workovers, recompletions and maintenance and will represent approximately 30% of our capital program. Second, in some places, we have to engage in activity to maintain ownership of the mineral rights or to preserve leases. This includes continuous drilling activity or leasehold and production maintenance and will represent approximately 5% of our capital program.  
We will allocate roughly 30% of our capital to key exploration activities and new play tests to continue building and high-grading our drilling inventory for the future. This will include continuing our highly successful North Sea exploration program, key play tests on some of our existing acreage in the Permian and Anadarko Basins and seismic commitments in Offshore Suriname. The remaining 35% of our capital program will go to development activity. Most of this will be allocated to the North Sea and Egypt, where we continue to see development opportunities that work very well at low oil prices. This is primarily due to contract structures and tax regimes that provide favorable capital recovery mechanisms and higher average cash margins. We suggest our investors review our earnings supplement for additional detail regarding region-by-region netbacks.
We also have a number of onshore North America drilling locations in the Permian Basin and Woodford/SCOOP that remain economically attractive. However, these areas will receive less allocated capital due to the capital budget being constrained by cash flow. While we have reduced development activity on these assets, the leases are preserved and development will ramp back up in these assets and several other areas when oil prices and costs are better aligned to deliver more attractive return.
Our reduced 2016 capital spending level is appropriate and prudent for a $35 oil environment. The end result is that we expect our total pro forma production to be in the range of 433,000 to 453,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. This will represent a decline of 7% to 11% from a comparative pro forma volume of 486,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2015. These volumes exclude Egypt minority interest, Egypt tax barrels and the effect of divested volumes from the 2015 base. If prices rise, allowing more capital to be deployed, we anticipate most incremental investment would be directed to onshore North America and this would offset some of this anticipated decline.
In 2016, we will continue to optimize LOE by giving our expected production decline and a mixed shift to slightly higher cost international production. We do not anticipate materially lower operating costs on a per barrel of oil equivalent basis. 
In terms of 2016 income taxes, we expect our adjusted earnings global effective tax rate to currently be in the range of 15% to 20%. Obviously lower than what we would typically expect, our effective tax rate is being driven primarily by an expectation of very low book income. Going forward, we will be able to provide updates to this rate as the year progresses.
Also, we can provide some guidance around expected cash tax payments. We will pay the remainder of the income tax accrued for repatriating 2015 foreign sales proceeds of $85 million in the first quarter. Given the low commodity price environment, we currently believe that our cash tax payments in 2016, including cash taxes associated with the petroleum revenue tax in the U.K., will be minimal. 
For the first quarter, we are providing pro forma production guidance for North American Onshore of 290,000 to 295,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Our international and offshore production is guided to 180,000 to 185,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, which excludes Egypt tax barrels and the Egypt minority interest.
Our projected capital spend in the first quarter is $500 million to $550 million or approximately 1/3 of our full year 2016 budget. 
In closing, our prudent approach in 2015 has put us on firm ground and helps ensure resiliency in this difficult and unpredictable environment. As a result, we are prepared to endure a potentially lower-for-even-longer commodity cycle while retaining our ability to dynamically manage our activity levels up or down, as commodity prices and service costs dictate. Through all of this, our primary goals will remain unchanged. We will live within our means, maintain our strong financial position, build quality development inventory for the future and invest to improve returns and grow value for our shareholders. We look forward to a successful 2016. 
And I would now like to turn the call over to the operator for Q&A."

We -- as I said earlier on the call, in the prepared notes, that on additional $900 million, the incremental capital in North America, we'd keep North America flat to slightly growing, which translates to about a $45 world. So 2016, we could live within cash flow and be flat to relatively slight growth. So as we look ahead into '17, there's a  couple of things going on. First and foremost, we're in the second year now of a significantly reduced CapEx budget. We reduced aggressively last year, again this year. So we've got fewer wells that were brought on than historical. So our rates will be flatting slightly as we go into '17. Secondly, it will not take as much capital in 2017 to keep it flat, especially with North America. We're already investing at levels right now in the international side. Additionally, we've got some catalysts that will be coming on in '17. If you look at the North Sea, our calendar well, potentially more than one well there could be coming on. So we've got some catalysts. And quite frankly, now is -- with the capital efficiency we're seeing, the other thing I'll say is we look at the 2016 budget. We've already seen well costs coming in significantly under what we've planned this year. So the capital efficiency is the other big thing.

We discuss it with them every quarter, and I imagine we'll continue to discuss that with them every quarter, though we just don't think we need to be doing that now. We'll probably reconsider it at some point in time in the future when prices and costs are better aligned and we all kind of figure out whatever the new normal, if we ever get to normal, in our industry will be in the future, then we can look at what our dividend yield is and whether that's appropriate for the situation that we're in at that point in time.

In conjunction with this morning's press release, I hope you have had the opportunity to review our quarterly earnings supplement, which summarizes key financial and operational data for the fourth quarter and full year 2015, along with details regarding our 2016 production and capital spending outlook. We have revised and streamlined the structure and content of our earnings supplement and believe you will find it more useful. 
Also, please note that we have changed our capital expenditure guidance convention to reflect a more comprehensive picture of our spending. Specifically, the 2016 capital spending range we've provided in this morning's press release includes all exploration, development, gathering, transportation and processing expenditures. It also includes budgeted leasehold acquisition costs and capitalized interest and capitalized G&A. The only element of our 2016 program that our guidance will continue to exclude is capital attributable to our minority interest partner in Egypt. As a result of this guidance change, references made on today's call to 2015 and 2016 capital spending may not be directly comparable.
Our earnings release, the accompanying financial tables and non-GAAP reconciliations, along with our quarterly earnings supplement, can all be found on our website at www.apachecorp.com/financial data. We also plan to post on our website a section which contains responses to any questions that arise on today's call for which we do not have readily available information to answer.
I'd like to remind everyone that today's discussions will contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions based on our current views and reasonable expectations. However, a number of factors could cause actual results to materially differ from what we discuss today. A full disclaimer is located with the supplemental data on our website. 
And I would now like to turn the call over to John."

I would like to begin with a recap of the significant progress Apache made in 2015. I will then provide some highlights from our fourth quarter and full year results and conclude with some specific thoughts on what to expect for 2016. 
Apache underwent a significant transition in 2015. While the external environment remains challenging, we entered 2016 better positioned to operate and thrive in a lower-for-longer commodity price environment. In addition to completing an extensive refocusing of the portfolio, we have taken other decisive actions to position Apache for an extended low-price environment, which included: aligning our capital spending with cash flows, attacking the cost structure, continuing to high-grade and build an inventory of attractive opportunities that will deliver strong returns under a low oil price environment and strengthening our financial position and liquidity. While we have made tremendous progress, we are not yet finished with these efforts. 
We streamlined our portfolio, exiting Argentina, Australia, much of the Gulf of Mexico and 2 world-scale LNG projects. We are now focused on 3 principal areas: a substantial onshore North American acreage position with an abundant inventory of high-value growth opportunities, anchored by our extensive Permian footprint; and sustainable free cash flow generators  in our higher cash margin North Sea and Egypt businesses, each with many years of low-risk drilling opportunities and significant exploration potential still ahead. 
In the current low oil price environment, our more conventional international assets continued to generate strong cash flows and better rates of return than many of our operations in North America.
In the North Sea, we are uniquely positioned. We have 2 large-scale hydrocarbon accumulations at Forties and Beryl, available high-quality platform and pipeline infrastructure and per-unit cash operating costs that are 1/2 the industry average. These advantages make tiebacks to existing infrastructure very economic even at current oil prices.
In Egypt, we benefit from the cost recovery aspect of our production-sharing contracts such that they help to mitigate the impact of declining oil prices on our cash flows. Our international positions clearly differentiate our portfolio, play to Apache's long-standing strengths and remain economically attractive in this low oil price environment.
A year ago, Apache took more decisive action than many of our peers and reduced activity levels in pursuit of cash flow neutrality. We anticipated the lower-for-longer oil price scenario and recognized the importance of protecting value through more disciplined investment. Accordingly, we reduced capital by more than 60% in 2015 from 2014 levels and focused on bringing cost into alignment with the current oil price environment. Specifically, this time last year on our fourth quarter 2014 conference call, I stated that, ""We would consider using our balance sheet only to capitalize on lower acreage cost and other potential opportunities that may occur rather than to drill wells and chase production in a depressed and volatile oil price environment."" We stuck to that view throughout 2015 and continue to do so today 1 year later. At the same time, we instituted an even more rigorous capital allocation process through which we continually monitor the delivery of the capital programs and reallocate capital as value maximization demands. 
Motivated by the deteriorating oil price environment and a goal to achieve cash flow neutrality, we attacked our cost structure in 2015 with a thorough review of G&A, LOE and capital costs. Specifically, we rationalized our entire organizational structure, eliminating layers of management and consolidating office locations, and we reduced staffing levels to more closely align with forward-looking activity levels. As a result, today, our run rate gross G&A costs are more than 30% below where they were in the fourth quarter of 2014, and we are a much more streamlined and efficient organization. 
Our lease operating costs, on a per-BOE basis, were down approximately 10% year-over-year when excluding the tax barrel impact of our Egyptian impairment charges. Our lease operating costs, on a per-BOE basis, were down approximately 10% year-over-year when excluding the tax barrel impact of our Egyptian impairment charges.
Our average drilled and completed well costs in North America were down 35% from fourth quarter of '14 to fourth quarter of '15. Furthermore, we strengthened our financial position and liquidity in 2015. A portion of our asset divestment proceeds were used to reduce debt by $2.5 billion and to build our cash balance. Apache began 2016 with approximately $5 billion of liquidity, including nearly $1.5 billion in cash. We value this position highly, and we'll be very thoughtful in this price environment as to when and how we utilize it. 
One of our primary operational objectives, both last year and in 2016, is to assess, refine, optimize and add to our extensive inventory of captured drilling locations in North America in the context of lower-for-longer oil prices. This is a comprehensive process that involves acreage delineation, wellbore redesign, completion optimization, spacing and landing zone tests, acreage swaps, purchases and sales and the creation of full field development plans. 
In addition to these activities, extensive science and testing continues on our new play concepts, which could lead to significant growth opportunities down the road. The goal of this work is to fully define and prioritize the highest rate of return, highest growth and most efficient North American opportunities to leverage in a better investment environment.
Apache is now very well positioned for whatever lies ahead. We are living within our means and anticipate being cash flow neutral in 2016 and beyond until such time that the price environment warrants higher investment levels. We have a very competitive cost structure and continue to drive overhead, LOE and capital costs lower. We are building high-quality drilling and exploratory inventory for the future. We have the financial strength and liquidity to sustain us through a prolonged period of potentially lower oil prices and to propel us into a better investment environment. 
Our sound decisions and decisive actions in 2015 leave us much better positioned today. We have improved our financial position without raising equity and without reducing or eliminating the dividend. At this time, we plan to be cash flow neutral in 2016 and to invest primarily to enhance our long-term prospects for future growth. Maintaining strong credit quality through disciplined capital allocation is a prudent approach in this environment. Thus, we are targeting either unchanged or lower net debt levels by the end of this year. 
Now I would like to turn to the fourth quarter and full year 2015 results. We are very pleased with our delivery around items that were within our control. We exceeded our production goals across all of our regions in both the fourth quarter and for the full year 2015. We accomplished this on a capital program of $3.6 billion, which was at the low end of the original guidance range we established on our earnings call a year ago. 
During the fourth quarter, North America Onshore production averaged 308,000 BOEs per day, which, as expected, was a sequential increase from the third quarter production of 306,000 BOEs per day. The increase was primarily due to the timing of completions and solid well performance. 
In the Permian Basin, despite some fairly significant weather downtime in December, our fourth quarter production achieved an all-time quarterly high of 174,000 BOEs per day, up 2% sequentially from the third quarter. Growth was driven by the Delaware Basin where we completed 13 new wells, primarily targeting the Bone Springs formation at Pecos Bend. 
In the Midland Basin, Central Basin Platform and Northwest Shelf, we completed 61 new wells and delivered very good results in the Wildfire area with our first 3 Lower Spraberry tests as well as 3 strong wells in the Wolfcamp on our June Tippett pad. We also drilled some excellent wells on the Northwest Shelf at our prolific Cedar Lake Yeso play. Please refer to our quarterly earnings supplement for details on some of these key wells. 
As we look ahead to 2016, our Permian rig count will fall from 10 at the beginning of January to 4 by mid-year. Permian well completions are expected to be down 75% year-over-year. These actions clearly demonstrate that we are willing to let our Permian production decline until we are in a better investment environment.
Turning to the North Sea. Volumes were approximately 72,000 BOEs per day in the fourth quarter, a 2% decline sequentially from third quarter production levels. We brought 3 new development wells online during the fourth quarter at very good rates, but these were offset by a maintenance turnaround at the Beryl Bravo platform. 
2015 was an excellent year for Apache with the drill bit in the North Sea. We brought online 19 new development wells with an average drilling success rate of 83%. We also confirmed 3 significant new exploratory successes with the previously disclosed Callater or K, Corona and Seagull discoveries, which we expect will contribute very material reserve and production adds in the coming years. 
In 2016, we are significantly curtailing our North Sea development drilling program and plan to employ no platform rigs during the second half of the year. As a result, North Sea production will decline slightly in 2016 compared to 2015 production of just over 71,000 BOEs per day. 
In Egypt, gross production declined roughly 3% sequentially from the third quarter. Total liquids volumes declined 2%, while downtime and bottlenecks at certain gas processing facilities reduced our natural gas volumes by 5%. On a net basis, excluding sign-up tax [ph] minority interest and the effective tax barrels, production actually increased 5% sequentially to 102,000 BOEs per day. This is a function of the significant oil price decline from third quarter to fourth quarter, which resulted in Apache receiving more cost recovery barrels under our production-sharing contract agreements.
The key driver in Egypt during 2015 was the tremendous success of our drilling program and production ramp-up at Ptah and Berenice. As of year-end, we had 12 wells producing in these prolific low-GOR oilfields. Since November 2014, Ptah and Berenice have produced more than 8 million barrels of oil. In 2016, we plan to stabilize gross production from these fields near 30,000 BOEs per day. Overall, our gross production volumes are expected to decline in Egypt this year. However, net volumes should increase as falling oil prices drive an increase in cost recovery barrels per our PSCs. 
On the cost side, I noted earlier that our average North American Onshore well costs were down approximately 35% from a year ago. We are continuously improving on this front and continue to see significant well cost decreases since the beginning of the year. Some of the key plays where we are seeing exceptionally low drilling and completion costs include: the Delaware Basin where we have visibility at Bone Springs and Wolfcamp wells of approximately $4.5 million; the Midland Basin where horizontal Wolfcamp and Lower Spraberry wells are projected to be drilled and completed for less than $4 million; the horizontal Yeso play and the Northwest Shelf in the Permian where our well costs are trending below $2.3 million; and the Woodford/SCOOP where our latest pacesetter was drilled and completed for only $7.5 million. 
In 2015, we reinvigorated Apache's culture of costs and returns discipline. While we have made great progress on costs, they are not yet fully aligned with the current price environment. Further reductions are planned for 2016, and it is imperative that we remain relentless in our efforts to drive costs down further. To achieve this, we will foster innovation and utilize technology that redefines the cost structure of both Apache and the industry.
The key takeaway is that these are not just belt-tightening efforts in response to price weakness. Apache is implementing structural changes that will continue to accrue to our bottom line regardless of where oil prices and service costs go in the future. To that end, we believe that approximately 1/2 of the well cost reductions achieved over the past year are permanent, while the other half will fluctuate with future service cost changes. Regardless, Apache will always focus intently on controlling what we can control and remaining highly disciplined through the cycle. 
As we turn our focus to 2016, strip oil prices are now roughly 30% to 35% below where they were a year ago. This underscores the importance of continuing to foster a new mindset and approach to capital allocation and managing our cost structure. Similar to our approach in 2015, we are using a conservative price deck for 2016 budgeting. It reduces the risk of inadvertently putting ourselves in a position of a material outspend and helps to sustain our credit quality.
Our capital allocation process for 2016 is built around 4 key themes: living within our means and achieving cash flow neutrality for the year at $35 oil; focusing capital spending on protecting the asset base and optimizing and building inventory; maintaining a relentless focus on both capital costs and operational expenses; and remaining flexible, opportunistic and ready to react as conditions change.
With this in mind, we announced in this morning's press release 2016 capital budget of $1.4 billion to $1.8 billion, the midpoint of which represents over a 60% decrease from 2015 and over an 80% decrease from 2014 levels. 
In our North American Onshore portfolio, Apache's fortunate to have the vast majority of our high-value leasehold already held by production and only 4 rigs under longer-term higher day rate contracts. As a result, our obligation spending is relatively limited this year. At $35 oil, we do not believe spending on development wells and attempting to maintain production levels is a prudent or economic use of our precious capital dollars. We would rather leave those barrels in the ground and come back to them in a higher price environment or as drilling and completion costs become more aligned with oil prices. The majority of our capital spending in these onshore regions will focus on strategic testing and delineating our vast acreage position such that we optimize our growth potential and efficiencies when it is appropriate to put more rigs back into the field.
In light of these considerations, our capital allocation to North American Onshore plays is approximately $700 million or 45% of our total capital budget. At this level of investment, we anticipate a pro forma production decline of 12% to 15% in North America Onshore compared to 2015. Our decision to reduce North American Onshore investment by more than 70% and to allow production to decline in 2016 is simply due to our desire to preserve our financial position in the current investment environment. It is not indicative of our asset depth or quality. We are confident that our North American asset base can withstand this reduction in investment without any deterioration for the future opportunity set or impact our ability to arrest the decline and begin to grow again at the appropriate time in the future.
To provide some context around the sustainability of our onshore North American asset base, we estimate that in the current price environment, it would require a spending level of approximately $1.6 billion or an incremental $900 million of capital above our planned 2016 program in order to hold North America Onshore flat with the 2015 average of 309,000 BOEs per day. This $900 million of incremental capital is roughly equivalent to the amount of incremental cash flow Apache generates annually with a $10 per barrel increase in oil prices. This implies, with an average oil price of $45 per barrel, Apache's North American production base could be held flat with 2015 levels. At current drilling and completion costs, this maintenance spend would equate to an incremental annual average program of approximately 20 rigs in North America. 
I mentioned earlier that Apache is looking for a better investment environment before we materially increase our capital program, let alone consider outspending cash flow on an annual basis. We have the luxury of waiting for an environment in which oil prices and service costs are fully synchronized such that fully burdened and full-cycle economics in our North American drilling programs achieve double-digit rates of return. It is not enough to deliver the 15% to 30% unburdened wellhead returns at $35 per barrel oil that are routinely quoted in industry presentations. 
At Apache, we have elevated our standard for investment of shareholders' capital. Our drilling programs must deliver full-cycle, fully burdened rates of return in the mid- to high double digits in order to deliver an acceptable return on capital employed for the shareholder. That said, we are thoroughly assessing our entire North American footprint and will be prepared to put rig lines back into each of the Pecos Bend, Evergreen and Waha areas of the Delaware Basin and our high rate of return horizontal Yeso play in the Northwest Shelf. We could add several incremental rigs in our Midland Basin and Wolfcamp and Lower Spraberry plays, where we have 200,000-plus net acres in 4 core counties. 
Our Woodford/SCOOP position will support an incremental drilling program for several years to come, and we have numerous high-volume, multi-well development pad locations ready to go in the Duvernay and Montney in Canada. When oil prices rally further, our Eagle Ford and Canyon Lime will come back into play and contribute to North American growth. 
On the international side, Egypt and the North Sea continue to deliver projects with solid rates of return and strong net present values. Because both are economically advantaged under our assumed $35 oil price, we are allocating approximately $800 million or 50% of our 2016 capital budget to these regions.
We project pro forma production from our international and offshore regions this year will be relatively flat compared to 2015. The budget I just described is based on specific oil price and service cost assumptions. If oil prices recover or if average well costs decline such that our cash flow is higher than we have budgeted, we anticipate directing a majority of the incremental dollars to onshore North America. This could, in turn, mitigate a portion of the decline implied by our guidance. 
Before I conclude, I would like to outline some of Apache's potential future growth drivers as we look beyond 2016. With higher oil prices and access to more internally generated cash flow, our North American Onshore production will stabilize and return to growth. This growth will come from lower-cost wells that generate better returns than Apache's historical North American programs. High-graded plays with years of running room across our 3.3 million gross legacy acres in the Permian will drive growth from the Bone Springs, Wolfcamp, Lower Spraberry, Yeso and other formations. This will be supplemented by the Woodford/SCOOP, Montney and Duvernay post-2016. Additionally, we have acquired a substantial amount of relatively low-cost acreage since early 2015 that could be incremental to the growth potential that resides in our legacy Permian and Anadarko positions.
In the North Sea, we also see excellent growth potential. In mid-2017, we plan to bring our Callater discovery online at a 30-day IP rate of approximately 15,000 BOEs per day net to Apache. Following that, in mid-2018, we anticipate bringing online our first Tertiary injectite discovery, Corona, at a rate of 5,000 to 10,000 BOEs per day net. 
Looking out a bit longer term, Corona has de-risked a string of exploration prospects that will be drilled in the future. Over this same time frame, we will conduct exploration activities on our 2.3 gross million acres offshore Suriname. While it is still early, we are excited about the potential for this area, which lies in a newly confirmed oil province. We have included a map of our Suriname position in our quarterly earnings supplement for your information. 
In closing, Apache is well prepared for a lower-for-even-longer oil price environment. As experts debate when or if oil prices will increase and to what level, Apache will continue to focus on the things we can control. Our primary strategic objectives in 2016 are: manage to cash flow neutrality after dividends and in the year with unchanged or lower net debt levels, preserve our strong financial position, protect our asset base and optimize and expand our high-quality inventory of growth opportunities through strategic testing and exploration. 
Our goal is to emerge from this commodity price downturn with top-tier financial strength, a robust inventory of high rate of return growing opportunities in North America and a sustained capacity to generate free cash flow from our international assets in Egypt and the North Sea. While we don't know when prices will recover, we do know that the prudent choices we are making today will enhance our long-term success. Quite often, it is during downturns like these that the choices companies make can either set them up for long-term success or set them back. I believe we have significantly strengthened Apache Corporation despite the challenging price environment, and we are positioning ourselves to succeed through the recovery. 
I will now turn the call over to Steve Riney."

As John indicated, Apache had a very good year in 2015. We made outstanding progress high-grading the portfolio, driving down costs, aligning capital programs with cash flows and proactively strengthening our financial position. We entered 2016 well positioned for the challenges our industry will face.
Today, I will highlight Apache's financial progress, which includes our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2015, progress with our ongoing cost-reduction efforts, a review of our financial strength and liquidity and our outlook for 2016 production and capital spending.
So let's begin with the fourth quarter financial results. As noted in our press release, under generally accepted accounting principles, Apache reported a loss of $7.2 billion or $19.07 per common share. Our results for the quarter include a number of items outside of our core earnings that are typically excluded by the investment community in published earnings estimates, the most significant of which are ceiling test write-downs, impairments and tax adjustments associated with these items. As in prior periods, these write-downs resulted from the continued low commodity price environment. Our loss for the quarter, adjusted for these items, was $24 million or $0.06 per share. 
Before I turn to other items, I'd like to comment on the reported production volumes, which include a significant downward adjustment related to Egyptian tax barrels. The terms of our Egyptian PSCs provide that the payment of income taxes attributable to our entitlement will be made by EGPC from their share of production. We then gross up our results for these taxes, which are paid on our behalf. Egyptian income taxes are calculated based on book income and are recorded as tax expense with an equal and offsetting amount in oil and gas revenues. Thus, there is no impact on net income as the revenues and tax expense we record each quarter offset one another. The revenue effect of this gross-up is also recorded as production volume in our operating results. These are referred to as Egypt tax barrels. 
In the first 3 quarters of 2015, we recognized book income, tax expense and, thus, tax barrel production volumes. In the fourth quarter, we incurred a $1.3 billion charge related to impairments and write-downs in Egypt, driven by the continued fall in oil prices, which resulted in a significant loss for the quarter. This loss has the effect of offsetting nearly all of the previously recorded tax expense and tax barrels in the first 3 quarters, thereby resulting in a large negative income tax expense and negative tax barrel production in the fourth quarter. The total impact of the impairment is a loss of 38,280 barrels of oil equivalent per day of volumes in the fourth quarter or 9,649 barrels of oil equivalent per day for the full year of 2015. 
Because the Egypt tax barrel volumes have no economic impact to Apache and, as we see in the fourth quarter, can fluctuate materially from quarter-to-quarter, our pro forma production guidance always excludes tax barrels. We believe this non-GAAP view of production is more reflective of underlying economic production volumes. 
Now let me turn to capital expenditures and costs. In 2015, Apache's intense focus on driving internal efficiencies, along with the significant downward pressure on third-party service costs, resulted in substantial efficiency gains in both capital and operating costs. Capital spending came in at $678 million for the fourth quarter and $3.6 billion for the full year. This was at the low end of our original guidance range. As a reminder, our 2015 capital spending guidance excluded capital attributable to our 1/3 partner in Egypt, capitalized interest, opportunistic leasehold purchases and capital associated with divested LNG and associated operations.
As Gary noted at the outset of this call, we are changing our CapEx guidance convention in 2016. Our guidance now includes all anticipated capital spending categories, except capital attributable to our minority partner in Egypt. This should make it easier to track our capital spending plans for the year. 
On the lease operating expense side, our fourth quarter LOE was $10.04 per BOE, which is 3% higher than the fourth quarter of 2014. For the year, LOE averaged $9.49 per BOE, which is 9% lower than 2014. Underlying improvement in these metrics is masked by the negative Egypt tax barrel volumes in the fourth quarter. On a like-for-like basis, excluding this impact, our lease operating expenses were down 4% and 10% per BOE, respectively, in the fourth quarter and the full year 2015.
We have also spoken to you about progress on our G&A costs. As a reminder, we consider G&A to be our gross cash expenditures for all costs above field operations. Stated goal was to exit 2015 with a G&A run rate of $700 million, a decrease of over 30% from our run rate in the fourth quarter of 2014.
I'm happy to say we achieved this goal. As we look ahead to 2016, we continue to find overhead efficiencies, and we are reducing our G&A cost estimate for this year to a range of $650 million to $700 million. 
Next, I would like to make a few comments regarding our financial strength and liquidity position. In 2015, we reduced our debt levels from year-end 2014 by $2.5 billion, ending the year with $8.8 billion of total debt. We retained $1.5 billion of cash, which we may utilize to further pay down debt. We ended the year with net debt of $7.3 billion. Our latest 12 months net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio as of December 31, 2015, was just under 2x. Apache's nearest long-term debt maturity is in 2018, and only $700 million or 8% of our total debt portfolio matures prior to 2021. We restructured and refreshed our $3.5 billion credit facility, which now matures in June 2020. And combined with our cash position, we now have total liquidity of approximately $5 billion. 
At this time, our financial condition and liquidity are very strong, and we have accomplished this without issuing equity, without reducing the dividend and without selling core strategic assets. And to ensure that we sustain this strong position, we have chosen to reduce our capital spending this year to a level where we can attain cash flow neutrality at $35 oil.
Both John and I have mentioned the term cash flow neutrality a few times in reference to our overarching goals, so let me be clear what we mean by this. Cash flow neutrality means the capital program, debt service and the dividend are all funded through cash from operations, with little or no underpinning from financing or portfolio actions. Cash from operations includes all operating costs, including corporate overhead and includes movements in working capital. At this time, we anticipate only small, non-core, nonproducing asset sales will be necessary to achieve cash flow neutrality in 2016, assuming $35 oil prices. 
We could choose to spend more capital, but as John outlined, we believe that preserving our strong financial position and our credit quality through cash flow neutrality is the best approach for our shareholders in this price environment. In the event prices improve during the year, we stand prepared to ramp up our investment activity within the constraint of cash flow neutrality. 
Now I'd like to provide some more detail on our 2016 capital program. As John discussed, our budget of $1.4 billion to $1.8 billion is the product of a $35 oil price assumption for the year. Since we are in a very volatile price environment and our overarching goal is for cash flow neutrality, the capital budget will flex up or down with price movements. Capital in 2016 will be allocated on a prioritized basis to protect the asset base; further optimize and build high-quality inventory for the future; conduct certain longer-cycle, high-impact exploration activities; and to pursue higher-return development activities, which remain economically very attractive at these low prices.
There are 2 types of spend required to protect the asset base: First, we have to maintain the assets and keep them running efficiently. This includes workovers, recompletions and maintenance and will represent approximately 30% of our capital program. Second, in some places, we have to engage in activity to maintain ownership of the mineral rights or to preserve leases. This includes continuous drilling activity or leasehold and production maintenance and will represent approximately 5% of our capital program.  
We will allocate roughly 30% of our capital to key exploration activities and new play tests to continue building and high-grading our drilling inventory for the future. This will include continuing our highly successful North Sea exploration program, key play tests on some of our existing acreage in the Permian and Anadarko Basins and seismic commitments in Offshore Suriname. The remaining 35% of our capital program will go to development activity. Most of this will be allocated to the North Sea and Egypt, where we continue to see development opportunities that work very well at low oil prices. This is primarily due to contract structures and tax regimes that provide favorable capital recovery mechanisms and higher average cash margins. We suggest our investors review our earnings supplement for additional detail regarding region-by-region netbacks.
We also have a number of onshore North America drilling locations in the Permian Basin and Woodford/SCOOP that remain economically attractive. However, these areas will receive less allocated capital due to the capital budget being constrained by cash flow. While we have reduced development activity on these assets, the leases are preserved and development will ramp back up in these assets and several other areas when oil prices and costs are better aligned to deliver more attractive returns.
Our reduced 2016 capital spending level is appropriate and prudent for a $35 oil environment. The end result is that we expect our total pro forma production to be in a range of 433,000 to 453,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. This will represent a decline of 7% to 11% from a comparative pro forma volume of 486,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2015. These volumes exclude Egypt minority interest, Egypt tax barrels and the effect of divested volumes from the 2015 base. If prices rise, allowing more capital to be deployed, we anticipate most incremental investment would be directed to onshore North America and this would offset some of this anticipated decline.
In 2016, we will continue to optimize LOE. But given our expected production decline and a mix shift to slightly higher cost international production, we do not anticipate materially lower operating costs on a per barrel of oil equivalent basis. 
In terms of 2016 income taxes, we expect our adjusted earnings global effective tax rate to currently be in a range of 15% to 20%. Obviously lower than what we would typically expect, our effective tax rate is being driven primarily by an expectation of very low book income. Going forward, we will be able to provide updates to this rate as the year progresses.
Also, we can provide some guidance around expected cash tax payments. We will pay the remainder of the income tax accrued for repatriating 2015 foreign sales proceeds of $85 million in the first quarter. Given the low commodity price environment, we currently believe that our cash tax payments in 2016, including cash taxes associated with the petroleum revenue tax in the U.K., will be minimal. 
For the first quarter, we are providing pro forma production guidance for North American Onshore of 290,000 to 295,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Our international and offshore production is guided to 180,000 to 185,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, which excludes Egypt tax barrels and the Egypt minority interest.
Our projected capital spend in the first quarter is $500 million to $550 million or approximately 1/3 of our full year 2016 budget. 
In closing, our prudent approach in 2015 has put us on firm ground and helps ensure resiliency in this difficult and unpredictable environment. As a result, we are prepared to endure a potentially lower-for-even-longer commodity cycle while retaining our ability to dynamically manage our activity levels up or down, as commodity prices and service costs dictate. Through all of this, our primary goals will remain unchanged. We will live within our means, maintain our strong financial position, build quality development inventory for the future and invest to improve returns and grow value for our shareholders. We look forward to a successful 2016.

We've done a lot of stuff in 2015 in the last year to strengthen the financial position, build liquidity, make sure that we don't have a lot of refinance risk. And so S&P has already come out with their rating, BBB -- a downgrade to BBB and stable. Fitch continues to have us at BBB+. And we're waiting on Moody's. And I think we've done the things that we need to do, and we'll continue to do the things that we need to do to remain investment grade. And we've got $1.5 billion of cash on the balance sheet, and if we need to use some of that, as I said in my script, to pay down a little bit of debt in order to protect that then we would certainly be willing to do that.

As I said earlier on the call, in the prepared notes, that an additional $900 million of incremental capital in North America, we'd keep North America flat to slightly growing, which translates to about a $45 world. So 2016, we could live within cash flow and be flat to relatively slight growth. So as we look ahead into '17, there's a  couple of things going on. First and foremost, we're in the second year now of a significantly reduced CapEx budget. We reduced aggressively last year, again this year. So we've got fewer wells that were brought on than historical. So our rates will be flatting slightly as we go into '17. Secondly, it will not take as much capital in 2017 to keep it flat, especially with North America. We're already investing at levels right now on the international side. Additionally, we've got some catalysts that will be coming on in '17. If you look at the North Sea, our Callater well, potentially more than one well there could be coming on. So we've got some catalysts. And quite frankly, now is -- with the capital efficiency we're seeing, the other thing I'll say is we look at the 2016 budget we've already seen well costs coming in significantly under what we've planned this year. So the capital efficiency is the other big thing. So I think as we get out into '17, it's going to take a lower oil price for us to be able to stay flat and potentially grow."

Today, I would like to start with a brief recap of first quarter results and an update to Apache's 2016 production guidance. I will then provide an operational overview with particular emphasis on some of the exceptional well cost reductions we're achieving on our key North American onshore plays. I will conclude with thoughts on our current activity levels and the potential for increasing capital investment in the near future. 
As noted in this morning's press release, company-wide pro forma production of 479,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day was at the high-end of our currently guidance range of 470,000 to 480,000 BOEs per day. The outperformance came primarily from North American Onshore, which produced 298,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, and exceeded our 290,000 to 295,000 BOE per day guidance range. Each other Apache's North American operating areas performed well despite a significant reduction in capital. 
The Permian, in particular, delivered robust results with strong performance from the underlying base, coupled with solid contributions from both newly drilled wells and base maintenance projects. In light of first quarter productions strength, we are raising our full year 2016 North American Onshore guidance range by 5,000 BOEs per day to 268,000 to 278,000 BOEs per day. 
On International and Offshore side, pro forma production was 180,000 BOEs per day, which was at the low end of our guidance range of 180,000 to 185,000 BOEs per day. This primarily attributable to unplanned third-party plant and pipeline outages in the North Sea. We remain on track to achieve our full year 2016 international and offshore guidance of 170,000 to 180,000 BOEs per day. 
As we've stated previously, our 2016 North American Onshore drilling program is primarily focused on strategic testing and acreage delineation to building high-grade inventory. Nevertheless, we are continuing to see some remarkable progress on growing efficiencies. 
For example, in key areas of North America where Apache was actively drilling during the first quarter, the average drilled and completed well costs were down approximately 45% as compared to average well cost in 2014. On the expense side, continuing with our efforts from last year, we saw further reductions in both lease operating expenses and gross G&A. Looking ahead, we anticipate further benefits from aligning our cost with the scale of our business and the commodity price environment. 
As you will recall, Apache is targeting cash flow neutrality in 2016 under our current budget, which assumes flat $35 oil and 2 35 gas. As expected, we were not cash flow neutral in the first quarter. However, we do anticipate generating a net cash flow surplus to the remainder of the year. As such, we remain on track for unchanged or lower net debt levels at year-end. Steve Riney will elaborate further on this in his prepared remarks. 
With the recent improvements in strip oil prices, we are prepared to increase capital spending but will refrain until we're confident cash flow sustainably improved relative to our 2016 plan. Although we have the financial capacity to increase capital spending today, we believe that preserving our strong financial position and our quality through cash flow neutrality is the best approach for our shareholders in this price environment. I will provide more color on our thinking around this in a few minutes. 
Turning to our operations. In the Permian Basin, first quarter production held up well despite a significant decrease in the number of wells placed on production. We produced 171,000 BOE per day, which represents a 2% sequential decrease from the fourth quarter. In the Delaware, we placed 5 gross operated wells on production, primarily targeting Bone Springs formation in the Pecos Bend area. One very notable well, the Seagull 103 HR produced an exceptional 30-day average peak rate of nearly 2,800 barrels of oil equivalent per day from a lateral length of approximately 4,600 feet. In its first 60 days of production, the Seagull 103 HR accumulated 78,000 barrels of oil, which makes it Apache's best well today in the Delaware Basin. The success of the Seagull 103-HR is a function of our thorough understanding of the hydrocarbon system and continuous efforts to improve our results in these complex reservoirs. 
Thus far, our efforts in the Pecos Bend area at the Delaware have been focused on 2 primary landing zones in the 3rd Bone Spring formation: During the first quarter, we test a promising new landing zone within the 3rd Bone Spring that could significantly enhance our running room in the area. In the Midland Basin, Central Basin Platform and Northwest Shelf, we placed 25 gross operated wells on production, which is approximately 40% fewer wells than in the fourth quarter. During the first quarter, Apache generated good results from 6 Wolfcamp wells in the Powell area, 2 Wolfcamp completions at Wildfire and 4 horizontal Yeso wells on the Northwest Shelf, all of which are summarized in our quarterly earnings supplement. 
Before moving on to Egypt and the North Sea, I would like to highlight our North American well cost-reduction efforts, which continue to exceed our expectations. Last quarter, I noted that we have dedicated a considerable amount of time, energy and resources toward reinvigorating Apache's strong culture of costs and returns discipline. This quarter, we are seeing some very tangible result from these initiatives, which I would like to share with you. 
As I mentioned earlier, in key areas of North America where Apache is actively drilling, our average drilled and completed well costs were down approximately 45% in the first quarter compared to average 2014 levels. Notably, in the Delaware Basin, our most recent well cost were now down approximately 60%. Although we have made great strides throughout 2015, I am truly amazed by the ongoing positive cost trends on North American onshore of drilling program. 6 quarters into the downturn, we are still achieving significant quarter-on-quarter cost improvements. For example, in the Delaware Basin, we recently drilled and completed a Third Bone spring well for $3.5 million. In the Midland Basin, 1-mile horizontal Wolfcamp and 1.5 mile Lower Spraberry drilling and completion costs are now projected to be less than $4 million and $4.5 million, respectively. In the horizontal Yeso play, on the Northwest Shelf in the Permian, recent well cost are trending below $2.3 million. And in the Woodford/SCOOP, our latest pacesetter well was drilled and completed for only $6.6 million. Achieving these lower well costs, both expands our drillable inventory and significantly enhances our returns for future development programs. 
Recently, we have received questions about the sustainability of our well cost improvements once demand for oilfield services begins to rebound. The high-level answer is that more than 50% of our average well cost decreased since the 2014 peak has come from design and efficiency improvements and should, therefore, be viewed as permanent cost saves. 
In our earnings supplement of this quarter, we have provided exhibits for our key North American Onshore plays that highlight the breakdown between service price and efficiency improvements. 
Apache's cost achievements to date are more than just belt-tightening efforts in response to the downturn. We seek to continuously implement structural changes and improvements, which accrue to the bottom line and enhance our long-term returns regardless of where oil prices and service cost close in the future. 
Now turning to our international operations. In the North Sea, first quarter production was slightly above 70,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, which represents a 2% decline sequentially from the fourth quarter of 2015. Unplanned downtime, associated with outages, on the third-party operated pipeline system negatively impacted our sales volumes by approximately 1,700 BOEs per day during the quarter. These averages reduced our production uptime from what would have been 94% down to 90%. As a reminder, U.K. North Sea industry average production uptime has been between 60% and 70% over the last several years. Therefore, Apache maintains a significant competitive advantage in this regard. Despite the higher-than-expected downtime during the quarter, Apache still achieved exceptional LOE cost of approximately $11 per BOE. 
Our first quarter development drilling program in the North Sea delivered 4 successful new wells, all of which were placed online in the second half of the quarter. This set up strong product rebound during the month of April. The nature of the North Sea operations and production is such that they're always be monthly and quarterly lumpiness, but we are confident in our full year 2016 production guidance, which we stated would decline slightly year-over-year from 2015 levels. 
Our subsea tieback of the Callater discovery is proceeding on-time and on budget, and we continued to expect this project will begin production in the 2017. We're also looking forward to drilling our store and Corona expiration prospects, which we highlighted in our North Sea webcast last November. 
In Egypt, our gross production of approximately 353,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day was essentially flat with the fourth quarter. Steve will provide more color on Egypt production reporting in a few minutes, but excluding tax barrels and the [indiscernible] interest, pro forma production in Egypt was up slightly versus the fourth quarter. 
Apache's drilling program in Egypt continues to deliver successful and reliable results. We placed 23 wells on production during the first quarter and achieved a drilling success rate of 88%, which is in line with our historical success rates in Egypt. 
At our prolific Ptah and Berenice deals, we placed 2 more wells on production, bringing the total level of producing wells in the complex to 13. We have a few additional locations remaining to fully develop Ptah and Berenice, but facilities are currently constrained. 
Before I move on, I would like to leave you with a few high-level observations on Egypt. Apache's operation in Egypt remains stable. Our drilling work over and water flood programs continue to deliver quarter-after-quarter. When compared to North America, our well costs were relatively low and our netbacks and margins are relatively high. And lastly, cash flow generation in Egypt demonstrates much less price-related volatility the North America despite reported net production volatility from quarter-to-quarter. As we all contemplate the timing and magnitude of an oil price recovery, I want to leave you with a few key points around our thinking with regard to 2016 capital spending and the potential for incremental activity above our current plan. Cash flow is the governor of Apache's capital spending and activity levels in 2016. We still plan to manage cash flow neutrality, and exit the year with unchanged or lower net debt levels. We entered 2016 with an industry cost structure that was still out of sync with the low oil price environment. The recent rally in oil prices, coupled with our cost reductions, means that development drilling in North America is now generating acceptable returns in many areas. We believe these returns will continue to improve as cost come into better alignment with price. Recent improvements in oil prices are encouraging. We're now looking for a sustainably improved pricing structure that will generate the cash flow visibility for us to confidently increase our capital program. The potential timing and magnitude of this increase is the topic of significant planning and discussion right now at Apache and with our board. In the meantime, the vast majority of Apache North American Onshore spending is focused on target testing, acreage evaluation and expanding our low-cost inventory locations to be exported environment that offers higher returns. When the time is appropriate, our first priority is for increased investment will be to add development rigs in the Permian, we will also accelerate North American acreage testing and we will keep our 2 platform rigs running in the North Sea. Beyond that, the Woodford/SCOOP play and Egypt are next in line for incremental capital. Importantly, Apache has maintained the organizational capacity and personnel to operate a significantly higher number of rigs, and we're well prepared to ramp up activity when appropriate. Lastly, we are very mindful of the fact that we're in a highly cyclical and highly capital-intensive business. As such, any ramp in investment activity will pass rigorous hurdles on returns and net present value. 
In closing, Apache's portfolio and capital allocation approach is designed to withstand volatility over the long term, which is evident in our results. We look forward to demonstrating the capability of our North American assets and efficiency of our capital allocation process in the next upturn. 
I want to reiterate what I said at our last quarter's earnings call. Our plan is to emerge from this commodity price downturn with top-tier financial strength, a robust inventory of higher drilling opportunities and a sustained capacity to generate free cash flow from our international assets in Egypt and the North Sea. We have made great progress in these efforts. 
Over the long term, our goal is to offer a competitive debt adjusted per share production reserve and cash flow growth rates and to achieve a top quartile cost position in terms of average well cost, G&A and LOE per BOE. We will accomplish this with an intense focus on long-term full cycle returns for our investment programs. Through the cycle, we believe this will translate into significantly improved returns and appreciation in our share price. 
I will now turn the call over to Steve Riney."

In addition to reviewing our financial results for the first quarter of 2016, I would like to highlight our progress on several key financial objectives. These include: Continuing to aggressively drive down well cost lease, operating expense and G&A; achieving cash flow neutrality inclusive of dividends under our flat $35 oil price; protecting our strong liquidity and financial position; and ending the year with unchanged or reduced net debt.  Additionally, I will speak to our 2016 outlook for capital spending, LOE and G&A. And finally, I would like to review Egypt production volume reporting to address some potential confusion about the difference between reported volumes and the pro forma volumes we typically reference. 
So let's begin with the first quarter financial results. As noted in our press release, under generally accepted accounting principles, Apache reported a loss of $489 million or $1.29 per common share. Our results for the quarter include a number of items outside of our core earnings and are typically excluded by the investment community in published earnings estimates. The most significant of which are ceiling test write-downs. These items totaled $337 million after-tax in the first quarter. And as in prior prudes, resulted primarily from the continued low commodity price environment. Our loss for the quarter, adjusted for these items, was $152 million or $0.40 per diluted share. As John mentioned, better-than-expected onshore North America production and solid operating cost performance worldwide were key contributors to our first quarter 2016 financial results. Apache's continuing focus on driving cost efficiencies resulted in capital spending of $466 million during the first quarter, which excludes noncontrolling interest. This is well below our guidance range of $500 million to $550 million. Capital cost in all of our North American regions were lower than we budgeted, with Permian leading the way. Our capital spending guidance of $1.4 billion to $1.8 billion for the full year 2016 remains unchanged. We are clearly achieving better-than-expected capital efficiency, thus, absent an increase in planned activity, I would expect us to end the year somewhere in the bottom half of this range. That said, if the current oil price environment prevails, it is more likely that we will maintain or even increase drilling and completion activity from current levels, which would result in increased capital spending. 
Lease operating expenses in the first quarter were $7.81 per barrel of oil equivalent, 22% lower than the fourth quarter of 2015. Underlying improvement in this metric is primarily attributable to greater efficiency in North American onshore production and the timing of workovers and other expenditures in the Permian and North Sea. While we are very pleased with this cost performance, certain one-time items and timing issues benefited us in a way that will not continue through the year. 
Last quarter, we've provided guidance that full year 2016 LOE per BOE would be roughly flat compared to full year 2015. This implied a target of approximately $9.50 per BOE. With the progress we have already seen this year, we now believe 2016 LOE will be closer to $9.25 per BOE. 
On the G&A side, total cost continue to decline as we remain diligently focused on aligning overhead with capital spending levels. Our goal for the year was to further reduce gross cash overhead cost to a range of $650 million to $700 million. We are currently tracking toward the low end of this range, and we continue finding opportunities to further reduce these costs. 
In the first quarter of 2016, recurring DD&A was $11.42 per BOE, 34% lower than the fourth quarter of 2015. Our DD&A cost over the last several quarters have been on a clear downward trend as a result of price-related asset write-downs. 
Lastly, on cost, we incurred $90 million of net interest expense in the first quarter. You will note a trend of increasing expense interest and decreasing capitalized interest over the last several quarters. This is a result of unproved property impairments and reduced capital investment activity. 
Next, I would like to make a few comments regarding our financial strength and liquidity position. In 2015, we worked very hard to strengthen our financial position and maintain our investment-grade credit rating with the 3 primary rating agencies. Having accomplished this, one of our key financial objective is to protect this position by maintaining unchanged or even reduced net debt by year end 2016. 
During the first quarter, cash uses exceeded sources by approximately $463 million. This was primarily the result of commodity realizations coming in below our plan, our front-end loaded capital program, and a build in working capital due to the timing of some nonrecurring working capital items. We anticipated these negative impacts early in the year will be more than offset later in the year. 
Even with the shortfall in first quarter cash flows, we ended the quarter with approximately $1 billion in cash.  In summary, our financial condition and liquidity remain very strong. We have created this position through disciplined capital spending and aggressive cost management rather than issuing equity, reducing the dividend or selling core assets. Importantly, we still have good visibility to cash flow neutrality of our $35 planned level. 
Finally, I would like to take a moment to discuss Egypt production volume reporting. As you're aware, we most often refer you to pro forma production volumes, which, for Egypt, excludes 2 items: The 1/3 minority share of volumes attributable to our partner; and tax barrels. Throughout 2014, and the first 3 quarters of 2015, our reported tax barrel production averaged approximately 26,500 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Asset impairments in the fourth quarter of 2015 and in the first quarter of 2016, combined with low oil prices, created a significant amount of noise in these tax barrel volumes. In the fourth quarter of 2015, these items resulted in negative tax barrel reported production of 47,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. In the first quarter of 2016, they resulted in Apache recording only 1,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day of production. As a reminder, tax barrels have no economic effect on our net cash flow from the business. Combined with the fact that they lead to this type of recording volatility, we believe investors should focus primarily on pro forma production in Egypt. A more thorough description of this will be on our website, along with a brief history of the difference between Egypt reported and pro forma volumes. We have also included this information for your reference in this quarter's earnings supplement. 
In closing, we took great efforts over the past 18 months to position Apache prudently for a prolonged downturn. After successfully navigating the challenges that confronted the industry in 2015, Apache is well prepared to capitalize on the opportunities that we believe will ultimately emerge. We have delivered a strong start to 2016 and look forward to continued progress throughout the year. Our primary goals for 2016 remain unchanged: We will live within our means; maintain our strong financial position; continue to build high-quality development inventory for the future; and invest to improve long-term returns and add shareholder value. While we remain conservative in our budgeting and planned activity, we are prepared to respond when the environment is right to increase investment.

So if we assume we don't pay down any debt this year, we expect to end this closer to the $1.5 billion of cash where we started.

So if we assume we don't pay down any debt this year, we expect to end this closer to the $1.5 billion of cash where we started. We had about a little over $450 million of cash consumption in the first quarter. Roughly 2/3 of that, if you just take -- if you look at first quarter actual versus the plan that it would take for the year to get to cash flow neutrality. Of that $450 million, about 2/3 of that is because we built working capital in the first quarter. And we had practically in 0 sale proceeds in the first quarter. We expect both of those items to be cash flow generators for us by the time we get to the end of the year. So about 2/3 of the $450 million is simply because of that. We have a pretty significant build in working capital during the quarter. The other 1/3 of the $450 million would be split roughly 50-50 between the overspending capital in the year versus kind of an average quarterly run rate for the year, and the shortfall on revenues less OpEx because of the fact that prices were below our $35 2 35 [ph] Henry Hub plan for the year. On the working capital side. I mean, so we built working capital in the first quarter? The primary reason for that is because of the paydown of payables and accrued cost between the end of the fourth quarter last year and the end of first quarter this year. And that's primarily because activity is slowing down so much, so our payables are coming down. Activity won't continue to slow down quite at a pace that it did through the time frame. And we expect inventory and accounts receivables, which tends to lag a bit the paydown the payables, those also come down through the year. And then we've got some pretty significant unique items, if you will, on the working capital side that we expect late this year, probably in the fourth quarter. Those are primarily in the form of tax refunds on loss carry backs that one has been filed, one is about to be filed. And then also we do anticipate some asset sales, which will also take place later this year, the proceeds of which will come late in 2015. So all of those things combined to offset the $460 million cash deficit that we incurred in the first quarter. A  very long winded way of saying yes, with anticipate getting back to $1.5 billion cash with the same debt level by the end of this year."

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. 
In the first quarter, Apache delivered solid operational results, strong financial performance and notable drilling outcomes, all of which were supported by our relentless focus on continuous improvement and cost reductions. 
Today, I would like to start with a brief recap of first quarter results and an update to Apache's 2016 production guidance. I will then provide an operational overview with particular emphasis on some of the exceptional well cost reductions we are achieving in our key North American onshore plays. I will conclude with thoughts on our current activity level and the potential for increasing capital investment in the near future. 
As noted in this morning's press release, company-wide pro forma production of 479,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day was at the high end of our quarterly guidance range of 470,000 to 480,000 BOEs per day. The outperformance came primarily from North American Onshore, which produced 298,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and exceeded our 290,000 to 295,000 BOE per day guidance range. Each of Apache's North American operating areas performed well despite a significant reduction in capital. The Permian, in particular, delivered robust results with strong performance from the underlying base, coupled with solid contributions from both newly drilled wells and base maintenance projects. In light of first quarter production strength, we are raising our full year 2016 North American Onshore guidance range by 5,000 BOEs per day to 268,000 to 278,000 BOEs per day. 
On international and offshore side, pro forma production was 180,000 BOEs per day, which was at the low end of our guidance range of 180,000 to 185,000 BOEs per day. This is primarily attributable to unplanned third-party plant and pipeline outages in the North Sea. We remain on track to achieve our full year 2016 international and offshore guidance of 170,000 to 180,000 BOEs per day. 
As we have stated previously, our 2016 North American Onshore drilling program is primarily focused on strategic testing and acreage delineation to building high-grade inventory. Nevertheless, we are continuing to see some remarkable progress on growing efficiencies. For example, in key areas of North America where Apache was actively drilling during the first quarter, the average drilled and completed well costs were down approximately 45% as compared to average well costs in 2014. On the expense side, continuing with our efforts from last year, we saw further reductions in both lease operating expenses and gross G&A. Looking ahead, we anticipate further benefits from aligning our cost with the scale of our business and the commodity price environment. 
As you will recall, Apache is targeting cash flow neutrality in 2016 under our current budget, which assumes flat $35 oil and $2.35 gas. As expected, we were not cash flow neutral in the first quarter. However, we do anticipate generating a net cash flow surplus through the remainder of the year. As such, we remain on track for unchanged or lower net debt levels at year-end. Steve Riney will elaborate further on this in his prepared remarks. 
With the recent improvements in strip oil prices, we are prepared to increase capital spending but we'll refrain until we are confident cash flows have sustainably improved relative to our 2016 plan. Although we have the financial capacity to increase capital spending today, we believe that preserving our strong financial position and our credit quality through cash flow neutrality is the best approach for our shareholders in this price environment. I will provide more color on our thinking around this in a few minutes. 
Turning to our operations. In the Permian Basin, first quarter production held up well despite a significant decrease in the number of wells placed on production. We produced 171,000 BOE per day, which represents a 2% sequential decrease from the fourth quarter. In the Delaware, we placed 5 gross-operated wells on production, primarily targeting Bone Spring formation in the Pecos Bend area. One very notable well, the Seagull 103-HR produced an exceptional 30-day average peak rate of nearly 2,800 barrels of oil equivalent per day from a lateral length of approximately 4,600 feet. In its first 60 days of production, the Seagull 103-HR accumulated 78,000 barrels of oil, which makes it Apache's best well to date in the Delaware Basin. The success of the Seagull 103-HR is a function of our thorough understanding of the hydrocarbon system and continuous efforts to improve our results in these complex reservoirs. Thus far, our efforts in the Pecos Bend area at the Delaware have been focused on 2 primary landing zones in the third Bone Spring formation. 
During the first quarter, we tested a promising new landing zone within the third Bone Spring that could significantly enhance our running room in the area. In the Midland Basin, Central Basin Platform and Northwest Shelf, we placed 25 gross-operated wells on production, which is approximately 40% fewer wells than in the fourth quarter. During the first quarter, Apache generated good results from 6 Wolfcamp wells in the Powell area, 2 Wolfcamp completions at Wildfire and 4 horizontal Yeso wells on the Northwest Shelf, all of which are summarized in our quarterly earnings supplement. 
Before moving on to Egypt and the North Sea, I would like to highlight our North American well cost reduction efforts, which continue to exceed our expectations. Last quarter, I noted that we have dedicated a considerable amount of time, energy and resources toward reinvigorating Apache's strong culture of costs and returns discipline. This quarter, we are seeing some very tangible result from these initiatives, which I would like to share with you. As I mentioned earlier, in key areas of North America where Apache was actively drilling, our average drilled and completed well costs were down approximately 45% in the first quarter compared to average 2014 levels. Notably, in the Delaware Basin, our most recent well costs are now down approximately 60%. 
Although we have made great strides throughout 2015, I am truly amazed by the ongoing positive cost trends in our North American Onshore drilling program. 6 quarters into the downturn, we are still achieving significant quarter-on-quarter cost improvements. For example, in the Delaware Basin, we recently drilled and completed a third Bone Spring well for $3.5 million. In the Midland Basin, 1-mile horizontal Wolfcamp and 1.5-mile Lower Spraberry drilling and completion costs are now projected to be less than $4 million and $4.5 million, respectively. In the horizontal Yeso play, on the Northwest Shelf in the Permian, recent well costs are trending below $2.3 million. And in the Woodford/SCOOP, our latest pacesetter well was drilled and completed for only $6.6 million. Achieving these lower well costs both expands our drillable inventory and significantly enhances our returns for future development programs. 
Recently, we have received questions about the sustainability of our well cost improvements once demand for oilfield services begins to rebound. The high-level answer is that more than 50% of our average well cost decreased since the 2014 peak has come from design and efficiency improvements and should, therefore, be viewed as permanent cost savings. In our earnings supplement this quarter, we have provided exhibits for our key North American Onshore plays that highlight the breakdown between service price and efficiency improvements. Apache's cost achievements to date are more than just belt-tightening efforts in response to the downturn. We seek to continuously implement structural changes and improvements, which accrue to the bottom line and enhance our long-term returns regardless of where oil prices and service costs go in the future. 
Now turning to our international operations. In the North Sea, first quarter production was slightly above 70,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, which represents a 2% decline sequentially from the fourth quarter of 2015. Unplanned downtime associated with outages on the third party-operated Forties pipeline system negatively impacted our sales volumes by approximately 1,700 BOEs per day during the quarter. These averages reduced our production uptime from what would have been 94% down to 90%. As a reminder, U.K. North Sea industry average production uptime has been between 60% and 70% over the last several years. Therefore, Apache maintains a significant competitive advantage in this regard. Despite the higher-than-expected downtime during the quarter, Apache still achieved exceptional LOE costs of approximately $11 per BOE. 
Our first quarter development drilling program in the North Sea delivered 4 successful new wells, all of which were placed online in the second half of the quarter. This set up a strong production rebound during the month of April. The nature of North Sea operations and production is such that there will always be monthly and quarterly lumpiness, but we are confident in our full year 2016 production guidance, which we stated would decline slightly year-over-year from 2015 levels. 
Our subsea tieback of the Callater discovery is proceeding on time and on budget, and we continue to expect this project will begin production in mid-2017. We are also looking forward to drilling our Store [ph] and Canord [ph] exploration prospects, which we highlighted in our North Sea webcast last November. 
In Egypt, our gross production of approximately 353,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day was essentially flat with the fourth quarter. Steve will provide more color on Egypt production reporting in a few minutes, but excluding tax barrels and minority interest pro forma production in Egypt was up slightly versus the fourth quarter. Apache's drilling program in Egypt continues to deliver successful and reliable results. We placed 23 wells on production during the first quarter and achieved a drilling success rate of 88%, which is in line with our historical success rates in Egypt. 
At our prolific Ptah and Berenice fields, we placed 2 more wells on production, bringing the total number of producing wells in the complex to 13. We have a few additional locations remaining to fully develop Ptah and Berenice, but facilities are currently constrained. 
Before I move on, I would like to leave you with a few high-level observations on Egypt. Apache's operation in Egypt remains stable. Our drilling, workover and waterflood programs continue to deliver quarter-after-quarter. When compared to North America, our well costs are relatively low and our netbacks and margins are relatively high. And lastly, cash flow generation in Egypt demonstrates much less price-related volatility than America despite reported net production volatility from quarter-to-quarter. 
As we all contemplate the timing and magnitude of an oil price recovery, I want to leave you with a few key points around our thinking with regard to 2016 capital spending and the potential for incremental activity above our current plan. Cash flow is the governor of Apache's capital spending and activity levels in 2016. We still plan to manage the cash flow neutrality and exit the year with unchanged or lower net debt levels. We entered 2016 with an industry cost structure that was still out of sync with the low oil price environment. The recent rally in oil prices, coupled with our cost reductions, means that development drilling in North America is now generating acceptable returns in many areas. We believe these returns will continue to improve as costs come into better alignment with price. 
Recent improvements in oil prices are encouraging. We are now looking for a sustainably improved pricing structure that would generate the cash flow visibility for us to confidently increase our capital program. The potential timing and magnitude of this increase is the topic of significant planning and discussion right now at Apache and with our board. In the meantime, the vast majority of Apache's North American Onshore spending is focused on target testing, acreage evaluation and expanding our low-cost inventory locations to be exported in an environment that offers higher returns. When the time is appropriate, our first priorities for increased investment will be to add development rigs in the Permian. We will also accelerate North American acreage testing, and we will keep our 2 platform rigs running in the North Sea. Beyond that, the Woodford/SCOOP play and Egypt are next in line for incremental capital. Importantly, Apache has maintained the organizational capacity and personnel to operate a significantly higher number of rigs, and we are well prepared to ramp up activity when appropriate. Lastly, we are very mindful of the fact that we are in a highly cyclical and highly capital-intensive business. As such, any ramp in investment activity will pass rigorous hurdles on returns and net present value. 
In closing, Apache's portfolio and capital allocation approach is designed to withstand volatility over the long term, which is evident in our results. We look forward to demonstrating the capability of our North American assets and efficiency of our capital allocation process in the next upturn. 
I want to reiterate what I said in our last quarter's earnings call. Our plan is to emerge from this commodity price downturn with top-tier financial strength, a robust inventory of higher rate of return growing opportunities and a sustained capacity to generate free cash flow from our international assets in Egypt and the North Sea. We have made great progress in these efforts. Over the long term, our goal is to offer a competitive debt-adjusted per-share production reserve and cash flow growth rates and to achieve a top-quartile cost position in terms of average well cost, G&A and LOE per BOE. We will accomplish this with an intense focus on long-term full-cycle returns for our investment programs. Through the cycle, we believe this will translate into significantly improved returns and an appreciation in our share price. 
I will now turn the call over to Steve Riney."

In addition to reviewing our financial results for the first quarter of 2016, I would like to highlight our progress on several key financial objectives. These include: continuing to aggressively drive down well costs,",1230,"Thank you, John, and good afternoon. In addition to reviewing our financial results for the first quarter of 2016, I would like to highlight our progress on several key financial objectives. These include: continuing to aggressively drive down well costs, lease operating expense and G&A; achieving cash flow neutrality, inclusive of dividends under a flat $35 oil price; protecting our strong liquidity and financial position; and ending the year with unchanged or reduced net debt.  Additionally, I will speak to our 2016 outlook for capital spending, LOE and G&A. And finally, I would like to review Egypt production volume reporting to address some potential confusion about the difference between reported volumes and the pro forma volumes we typically reference. 
So let's begin with the first quarter financial results. As noted in our press release, under generally accepted accounting principles, Apache reported a loss of $489 million or $1.29 per common share. Our results for the quarter include a number of items outside of our core earnings that are typically excluded by the investment community in published earnings estimates, the most significant of which are ceiling test write-downs. These items totaled $337 million after tax in the first quarter and, as in prior periods, resulted primarily from the continued low commodity price environment. Our loss for the quarter, adjusted for these items, was $152 million or $0.40 per diluted share. 
As John mentioned, better-than-expected onshore North American production and solid operating cost performance worldwide were key contributors to our first quarter 2016 financial results. Apache's continuing focus on driving cost efficiencies resulted in capital spending of $466 million during the first quarter, which excludes noncontrolling interest. This is well below our guidance range of $500 million to $550 million. Capital costs in all of our North American regions were lower than we budgeted, with Permian leading the way. Our capital spending guidance of $1.4 billion to $1.8 billion for the full year of 2016 remains unchanged. We are clearly achieving better-than-expected capital efficiencies. Thus, absent an increase in planned activity, I would expect us to end the year somewhere in the bottom half of this range. That said, if the current oil price environment prevails, it is more likely that we will maintain or even increase drilling and completion activity from current levels, which would result in increased capital spending. 
Lease operating expenses in the first quarter were $7.81 per barrel of oil equivalent, 22% lower than the fourth quarter of 2015. Underlying improvement in this metric is primarily attributable to greater efficiency in North American Onshore production and the timing of workovers and other expenditures in the Permian and North Sea. While we are very pleased with this cost performance, certain onetime items and timing issues benefited us in a way that will not continue through the year. 
Last quarter, we provided guidance that full year 2016 LOE per BOE would be roughly flat compared to full year 2015. This implied a target of approximately $9.50 per BOE. With the progress we have already seen this year, we now believe 2016 LOE will be closer to $9.25 per BOE. 
On the G&A side, total costs continue to decline as we remain diligently focused on aligning overhead with capital spending levels. Our goal for the year was to further reduce gross cash overhead costs to a range of $650 million to $700 million. We are currently tracking toward the low end of this range, and we continue finding opportunities to further reduce these costs. 
In the first quarter of 2016, recurring DD&A was $11.42 per BOE, 34% lower than the fourth quarter of 2015. Our DD&A costs over the last several quarters have been on a clear downward trend as the result of price-related asset write-downs. 
Lastly, on costs, we incurred $90 million of net interest expense in the first quarter. You will note a trend of increasing expense interest and decreasing capitalized interest over the last several quarters. This is a result of unproved property impairments and reduced capital investment activity. 
Next, I would like to make a few comments regarding our financial strength and liquidity position. In 2015, we worked very hard to strengthen our financial position and maintain our investment-grade credit rating with the 3 primary rating agencies. Having accomplished this, one of our key financial objectives is to protect this position by maintaining unchanged or even reduced net debt by year-end 2016. 
During the first quarter, cash uses exceeded sources by approximately $463 million. This was primarily the result of commodity realizations coming in below our plan, a front-end loaded capital program and a building working capital due to the timing of some nonrecurring working capital items. We anticipate these negative impacts early in the year will be more than offset later in the year. Even with the shortfall in first quarter cash flows, we ended the quarter with approximately $1 billion in cash.  
In summary, our financial condition and liquidity remain very strong. We have created this position through disciplined capital spending and aggressive cost management rather than issuing equity, reducing the dividend or selling core assets. Importantly, we still have good visibility to cash flow neutrality at our $35 planned level. 
Finally, I would like to take a moment to discuss Egypt production volume reporting. As you are aware, we most often refer you to pro forma production volumes, which, for Egypt, excludes 2 items: the 1/3 minority share of volumes attributable to our partner and tax barrels. Throughout 2014 and the first 3 quarters of 2015, our reported tax barrel production averaged approximately 26,500 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Asset impairments in the fourth quarter of 2015 and in the first quarter of 2016, combined with low oil prices, created a significant amount of noise in these tax barrel volumes. In the fourth quarter of 2015, these items resulted in negative tax barrel reported production of 47,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. In the first quarter of 2016, they resulted in Apache recording only 1,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day of production. As a reminder, tax barrels have no economic effect on our net cash flow from the business. Combined with the fact that they can lead to this type of reporting volatility, we believe investors should focus primarily on pro forma production in Egypt. A more thorough description of this will be on our website, along with a brief history of the difference between Egypt reported and pro forma volumes. We have also included this information for your reference in this quarter's earnings supplement. 
In closing, we took great efforts over the past 18 months to position Apache prudently for a prolonged downturn. After successfully navigating the challenges that confronted the industry in 2015, Apache is well prepared to capitalize on the opportunities that we believe will ultimately emerge. We have delivered a strong start to 2016 and look forward to continued progress throughout the year. Our primary goals for 2016 remain unchanged: We will live within our means, maintain our strong financial position, continue to build high-quality development inventory for the future and invest to improve long-term returns and add shareholder value. While we remain conservative in our budgeting and planned activity, we are prepared to respond when the environment is right to increase investment.

Our decline on our base is flattening, is a function of -- we're now 18 months into a slowdown in terms of the numbers of wells we've been bringing on, so that helps. Plus the base rate is a little lower that you've got to keep flat. So we see, clearly, less capital in '17 to keep it flat, but it's got kind of a moving target at this point.

I think that, obviously, the issue with the price that would break even, so how much lower can the price go either breakeven from an accounting perspective, I think that's obviously very difficult to do because of the cost-sharing arrangement in the PSC. So I'm not really prepared to say how far down prices would have to go in order for that number to become 0. But suffice it to say, we'd have to go down a bit more from where it is in the first quarter in order for that to happen."

So if we assume we don't pay down any debt this year, we expect to end closer to the $1.5 billion of cash where we started. We had about a little over $450 million of cash consumption in the first quarter. Roughly 2/3 of that, if you just take -- if you look at first quarter actual versus the plan that it would take for the year to get to cash flow neutrality. In -- of that $450 million, about 2/3 of that is because we built working capital in the first quarter and we had practically in 0 sale proceeds in the first quarter. We expect both of those items to be cash flow generators for us by the time we get to the end of the year, so about 2/3 of the $450 million is simply because of that. We have a pretty significant build in working capital during the quarter. The other 1/3 of the $450 million would be split roughly 50-50 between the overspend on capital in the year versus kind of an average quarterly run rate for the year and the shortfall on revenues less OpEx because of the fact that prices were below our $35, $2.35 Henry Hub plan for the year. On the working capital side, I mean, so why do we build working capital in the first quarter? The primary reason for that is because of the pay-down of payables and accrued costs between the end of the fourth quarter last year and the end of first quarter this year. And that's primarily because activity is slowing down so much, so our payables are coming down. Activity won't continue to slow down quite at a pace that it did through that time frame. And we expect inventory and accounts receivables, which tends to lag a bit the pay-down of payables, those to also come down through the year. And then we've got some pretty significant unique items, if you will, on the working capital side that we expect late this year, probably in the fourth quarter. Those are primarily in the form of tax refunds on lost carrybacks that one has been filed. One is about to be filed. And then also we do anticipate some asset sales, which will also take place later this year, the proceeds of which will come in late in 2015. So all of those things combined to offset the $460 million cash deficit that we incurred in the first quarter. A  very -- sorry, a very long-winded way of saying yes, we anticipate getting back to $1.5 billion cash with the same debt level by the end of this year."

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. 
In the first quarter, Apache delivered solid operational results, strong financial performance and notable drilling outcomes, all of which were supported by our relentless focus on continuous improvement and cost reductions. 
Today, I would like to start with a brief recap of first quarter results and an update to Apache's 2016 production guidance. I will then provide an operational overview with particular emphasis on some of the exceptional well cost reductions we are achieving in our key North American onshore plays. I will conclude with thoughts on our current activity level and the potential for increasing capital investment in the near future. 
As noted in this morning's press release, company-wide pro forma production of 479,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day was at the high end of our quarterly guidance range of 470,000 to 480,000 BOEs per day. The outperformance came primarily from North America Onshore, which produced 298,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and exceeded our 290,000 to 295,000 BOE per day guidance range. Each of Apache's North American operating areas performed well despite a significant reduction in capital. The Permian, in particular, delivered robust results with strong performance from the underlying base, coupled with solid contributions from both newly drilled wells and base maintenance projects. In light of first quarter production strength, we are raising our full year 2016 North American Onshore guidance range by 5,000 BOEs per day to 268,000 to 278,000 BOEs per day. 
On international and offshore side, pro forma production was 180,000 BOEs per day, which was at the low end of our guidance range of 180,000 to 185,000 BOEs per day. This is primarily attributable to unplanned third-party plant and pipeline outages in the North Sea. We remain on track to achieve our full year 2016 international and offshore guidance of 170,000 to 180,000 BOEs per day. 
As we have stated previously, our 2016 North American Onshore drilling program is primarily focused on strategic testing and acreage delineation to build and high-grade inventory. Nevertheless, we are continuing to see some remarkable progress on drilling efficiencies. For example, in key areas of North America where Apache was actively drilling during the first quarter, the average drilled and completed well costs were down approximately 45% as compared to average well costs in 2014. On the expense side, continuing with our efforts from last year, we saw further reductions in both lease operating expenses and gross G&A. Looking ahead, we anticipate further benefits from aligning our cost with the scale of our business and the commodity price environment. 
As you will recall, Apache is targeting cash flow neutrality in 2016 under our current budget, which assumes flat $35 oil and $2.35 gas. As expected, we were not cash flow neutral in the first quarter. However, we do anticipate generating a net cash flow surplus through the remainder of the year. As such, we remain on track for unchanged or lower net debt levels at year-end. Steve Riney will elaborate further on this in his prepared remarks. 
With the recent improvements in strip oil prices, we are prepared to increase capital spending but we'll refrain until we are confident cash flows have sustainably improved relative to our 2016 plan. Although we have the financial capacity to increase capital spending today, we believe that preserving our strong financial position and our credit quality through cash flow neutrality is the best approach for our shareholders in this price environment. I will provide more color on our thinking around this in a few minutes. 
Turning to our operations. In the Permian Basin, first quarter production held up well despite a significant decrease in the number of wells placed on production. We produced 171,000 BOE per day, which represents a 2% sequential decrease from the fourth quarter. In the Delaware, we placed 5 gross-operated wells on production, primarily targeting Bone Spring formations in the Pecos Bend area. One very notable well, the Seagull 103-HR produced an exceptional 30-day average peak rate of nearly 2,800 barrels of oil equivalent per day from a lateral length of approximately 4,600 feet. In its first 60 days of production, the Seagull 103-HR accumulated 78,000 barrels of oil, which makes it Apache's best well to date in the Delaware Basin. The success of the Seagull 103-HR is a function of our thorough understanding of the hydrocarbon system and continuous efforts to improve our results in these complex reservoirs. Thus far, our efforts in the Pecos Bend area of the Delaware have been focused on 2 primary landing zones in the third Bone Spring formation. 
During the first quarter, we tested a promising new landing zone within the third Bone Spring that could significantly enhance our running room in the area. In the Midland Basin, Central Basin Platform and Northwest Shelf, we placed 25 gross-operated wells on production, which is approximately 40% fewer wells than in the fourth quarter. During the first quarter, Apache generated good results from 6 Wolfcamp wells in the Powell area, 2 Wolfcamp completions at Wildfire and 4 horizontal Yeso wells on the Northwest Shelf, all of which are summarized in our quarterly earnings supplement. 
Before moving on to Egypt and the North Sea, I would like to highlight our North American well cost reduction efforts, which continue to exceed our expectations. Last quarter, I noted that we have dedicated a considerable amount of time, energy and resources toward reinvigorating Apache's strong culture of cost and returns discipline. This quarter, we are seeing some very tangible results from these initiatives, which I would like to share with you. As I mentioned earlier, in key areas of North America where Apache was actively drilling, our average drilled and completed well costs were down approximately 45% in the first quarter compared to average 2014 levels. Notably, in the Delaware Basin, our most recent well costs are now down approximately 60%. 
Although we have made great strides throughout 2015, I am truly amazed by the ongoing positive cost trends in our North American Onshore drilling program. Six quarters into the downturn, we are still achieving significant quarter-on-quarter cost improvements. For example, in the Delaware Basin, we recently drilled and completed a third Bone Spring well for $3.5 million. In the Midland Basin, 1-mile horizontal Wolfcamp and 1.5-mile Lower Spraberry drilling and completion costs are now projected to be less than $4 million and $4.5 million, respectively. In the horizontal Yeso play, on the Northwest Shelf in the Permian, recent well costs are trending below $2.3 million. And in the Woodford/SCOOP, our latest pacesetter well was drilled and completed for only $6.6 million. Achieving these lower well costs both expands our drillable inventory and significantly enhances our returns for future development programs. 
Recently, we have received questions about the sustainability of our well cost improvements once demand for oilfield services begins to rebound. The high-level answer is that more than 50% of our average well cost decreased since the 2014 peak has come from design and efficiency improvements and should, therefore, be viewed as permanent cost savings. In our earnings supplement this quarter, we have provided exhibits for our key North American Onshore plays that highlight the breakdown between service price and efficiency improvements. Apache's cost achievements to date are more than just belt-tightening efforts in response to the downturn. We seek to continuously implement structural changes and improvements, which accrue to the bottom line and enhance our long-term returns regardless of where oil prices and service costs go in the future. 
Now turning to our international operations. In the North Sea, first quarter production was slightly above 70,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, which represents a 2% decline sequentially from the fourth quarter of 2015. Unplanned downtime associated with outages on the third party-operated Forties pipeline system negatively impacted our sales volumes by approximately 1,700 BOEs per day during the quarter. These outages reduced our production uptime from what would have been 94% down to 90%. As a reminder, U.K. North Sea industry average production uptime has been between 60% and 70% over the last several years. Therefore, Apache maintains a significant competitive advantage in this regard. Despite the higher-than-expected downtime during the quarter, Apache still achieved exceptional LOE costs of approximately $11 per BOE. 
Our first quarter development drilling program in the North Sea delivered 4 successful new wells, all of which were placed online in the second half of the quarter. This set up a strong production rebound during the month of April. The nature of North Sea operations and production is such that there will always be monthly and quarterly lumpiness, but we are confident in our full year 2016 production guidance, which we stated would decline slightly year-over-year from 2015 levels. 
Our subsea tieback of the Callater discovery is proceeding on time and on budget, and we continue to expect this project will begin production in mid-2017. We are also looking forward to drilling our Storr and Kinord exploration prospects, which we highlighted in our North Sea webcast last November. 
In Egypt, our gross production of approximately 353,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day was essentially flat with the fourth quarter. Steve will provide more color on Egypt production reporting in a few minutes, but excluding tax barrels and minority interest pro forma production in Egypt was up slightly versus the fourth quarter. Apache's drilling program in Egypt continues to deliver successful and reliable results. We placed 23 wells on production during the first quarter and achieved a drilling success rate of 88%, which is in line with our historical success rates in Egypt. 
At our prolific Ptah and Berenice fields, we placed 2 more wells on production, bringing the total number of producing wells in the complex to 13. We have a few additional locations remaining to fully develop Ptah and Berenice, but facilities are currently constrained. 
Before I move on, I would like to leave you with a few high-level observations on Egypt. Apache's operation in Egypt remains stable. Our drilling, workover and waterflood programs continue to deliver quarter-after-quarter. When compared to North America, our well costs are relatively low and our netbacks and margins are relatively high. And lastly, cash flow generation in Egypt demonstrates much less price-related volatility than North America despite reported net production volatility from quarter-to-quarter. 
As we all contemplate the timing and magnitude of an oil price recovery, I want to leave you with a few key points around our thinking with regard to 2016 capital spending and the potential for incremental activity above our current plan. 
Cash flow is the governor on Apache's capital spending and activity levels in 2016. We still plan to manage to cash flow neutrality and exit the year with unchanged or lower net debt levels. We entered 2016 with an industry cost structure that was still out of sync with the low oil price environment. The recent rally in oil prices, coupled with our cost reductions, means that development drilling in North America is now generating acceptable returns in many areas. We believe these returns will continue to improve as costs come into better alignment with price. 
Recent improvements in oil prices are encouraging. We are now looking for a sustainably improved pricing structure that would generate the cash flow visibility for us to confidently increase our capital program. The potential timing and magnitude of this increase is the topic of significant planning and discussion right now at Apache and with our board. In the meantime, the vast majority of Apache's North American Onshore spending is focused on target testing, acreage evaluation and expanding our low-cost inventory of locations to be exploited in an environment that offers higher returns. When the time is appropriate, our first priorities for increased investment will be to add development rigs in the Permian. We will also accelerate North American acreage testing, and we will keep our 2 platform rigs running in the North Sea. Beyond that, the Woodford/SCOOP play and Egypt are next in line for incremental capital. Importantly, Apache has maintained the organizational capacity and personnel to operate a significantly higher number of rigs, and we are well prepared to ramp up activity when appropriate. Lastly, we are very mindful of the fact that we are in a highly cyclical and highly capital-intensive business. As such, any ramp in investment activity will pass rigorous hurdles on returns and net present value. 
In closing, Apache's portfolio and capital allocation approach is designed to withstand volatility over the long term, which is evident in our results. We look forward to demonstrating the capability of our North American assets and efficiency of our capital allocation process in the next upturn. 
I want to reiterate what I said in our last quarter's earnings call. Our plan is to emerge from this commodity price downturn with top-tier financial strength, a robust inventory of high rate of return drilling opportunities and a sustained capacity to generate free cash flow from our international assets in Egypt and the North Sea. We have made great progress in these efforts. Over the long term, our goal is to offer a competitive debt-adjusted per-share production reserve and cash flow growth rates and to achieve a top-quartile cost position in terms of average well costs, G&A and LOE per BOE. We will accomplish this with an intense focus on long-term full-cycle returns for our investment programs. Through the cycle, we believe this will translate into significantly improved returns and an appreciation in our share price. 
I will now turn the call over to Steve Riney."

In addition to reviewing our financial results for the first quarter of 2016, I would like to highlight our progress on several key financial objectives. These include: continuing to aggressively drive down well costs, lease operating expense and G&A; achieving cash flow neutrality, inclusive of dividends under a flat $35 oil price; protecting our strong liquidity and financial position; and ending the year with unchanged or reduced net debt. Additionally, I will speak to our 2016 outlook for capital spending, LOE and G&A. And finally, I would like to review Egypt production volume reporting to address some potential confusion about the difference between reported volumes and the pro forma volumes we typically reference. 
So let's begin with the first quarter financial results. As noted in our press release, under generally accepted accounting principles, Apache reported a loss of $489 million or $1.29 per common share. Our results for the quarter include a number of items outside of our core earnings that are typically excluded by the investment community in published earnings estimates, the most significant of which are ceiling test write-downs. These items totaled $337 million after tax in the first quarter and, as in prior periods, resulted primarily from the continued low commodity price environment. Our loss for the quarter, adjusted for these items, was $152 million or $0.40 per share. 
As John mentioned, better-than-expected onshore North America production and solid operating cost performance worldwide were key contributors to our first quarter 2016 financial results. Apache's continuing focus on driving cost efficiencies resulted in capital spending of $466 million during the first quarter, which excludes noncontrolling interest. This is well below our guidance range of $500 million to $550 million. Capital costs in all of our North American regions were lower than we budgeted, with Permian leading the way. Our capital spending guidance of $1.4 billion to $1.8 billion for the full year of 2016 remains unchanged. We are clearly achieving better-than-expected capital efficiencies. Thus, absent an increase in planned activity, I would expect us to end the year somewhere in the bottom half of this range. That said, if the current oil price environment prevails, it is more likely that we will maintain or even increase drilling and completion activity from current levels, which would result in increased capital spending. 
Lease operating expenses in the first quarter were $7.81 per barrel of oil equivalent, 22% lower than the fourth quarter of 2015. Underlying improvement in this metric is primarily attributable to greater efficiency in North American Onshore production and the timing of workovers and other expenditures in the Permian and North Sea. While we are very pleased with this cost performance, certain onetime items and timing issues benefited us in a way that will not continue through the year. 
Last quarter, we provided guidance that full year 2016 LOE per BOE would be roughly flat compared to full year 2015. This implied a target of approximately $9.50 per BOE. With the progress we have already seen this year, we now believe 2016 LOE will be closer to $9.25 per BOE. 
On the G&A side, total costs continue to decline as we remain diligently focused on aligning overhead with capital spending levels. Our goal for the year was to further reduce gross cash overhead costs to a range of $650 million to $700 million. We are currently tracking toward the low end of this range, and we continue finding opportunities to further reduce these costs. 
In the first quarter of 2016, recurring DD&A was $11.42 per BOE, 34% lower than the fourth quarter of 2015. Our DD&A costs over the last several quarters have been on a clear downward trend as the result of price-related asset write-downs. 
Lastly, on costs, we incurred $90 million of net interest expense in the first quarter. You will note a trend of increasing expense interest and decreasing capitalized interest over the last several quarters. This is a result of unproved property impairments and reduced capital investment activity. 
Next, I would like to make a few comments regarding our financial strength and liquidity position. In 2015, we worked very hard to strengthen our financial position and maintain our investment-grade credit rating with the 3 primary rating agencies. Having accomplished this, one of our key financial objectives is to protect this position by maintaining unchanged or even reduced net debt by year-end 2016. 
During the first quarter, cash uses exceeded sources by approximately $463 million. This was primarily the result of commodity realizations coming in below our plan, a front-end loaded capital program and a build in working capital due to the timing of some nonrecurring working capital items. We anticipate these negative impacts early in the year will be more than offset later in the year. Even with the shortfall in first quarter cash flows, we ended the quarter with approximately $1 billion in cash. 
In summary, our financial condition and liquidity remain very strong. We have created this position through disciplined capital spending and aggressive cost management rather than issuing equity, reducing the dividend or selling core assets. Importantly, we still have good visibility to cash flow neutrality at our $35 plan level. 
Finally, I would like to take a moment to discuss Egypt production volume reporting. As you are aware, we most often refer you to pro forma production volumes, which, for Egypt, excludes 2 items: the 1/3 minority share of volumes attributable to our partner and tax barrels. Throughout 2014 and the first 3 quarters of 2015, our reported tax barrel production averaged approximately 26,500 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Asset impairments in the fourth quarter of 2015 and in the first quarter of 2016, combined with low oil prices, created a significant amount of noise in these tax barrel volumes. In the fourth quarter of 2015, these items resulted in negative tax barrel reported production of 47,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. In the first quarter of 2016, they resulted in Apache recording only 1,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day of production. As a reminder, tax barrels have no economic effect on our net cash flow from the business. Combined with the fact that they can lead to this type of reporting volatility, we believe investors should focus primarily on pro forma production in Egypt. A more thorough description of this will be on our website, along with a brief history of the difference between Egypt reported and pro forma volumes. We have also included this information for your reference in this quarter's earnings supplement. 
In closing, we took great efforts over the past 18 months to position Apache prudently for a prolonged downturn. After successfully navigating the challenges that confronted the industry in 2015, Apache is well prepared to capitalize on the opportunities that we believe will ultimately emerge. We have delivered a strong start to 2016 and look forward to continued progress throughout the year. Our primary goals for 2016 remain unchanged: We will live within our means, maintain our strong financial position, continue to build high-quality development inventory for the future and invest to improve long-term returns and add shareholder value. While we remain conservative in our budgeting and planned activity, we are prepared to respond when the environment is right to increase investment. 
I would now like to turn the call over to the operator for Q&A."

Our decline on our base is flattening, is a function of -- we're now 18 months into a slowdown in terms of the numbers of wells we've been bringing on, so that helps. Plus the base rate is a little lower that you've got to keep flat. So we see, clearly, less capital in '17 to keep it flat, but it's kind of a moving target at this point. And then obviously, the other factor is we've got some projects that we're advancing. Callater in the North Sea is on track, which will give us a big kick in the middle of '17.

And clearly, in terms of flattening and then also all these projects help, too. So I think you'll see us continue to focus on that. It gets back to the quality of having some conventional -- and a big chunk of our Permian as waterfloods and CO2 floods and things that just don't decline as rapidly. There's a lot of things you can do. Scale, cleanouts, all kinds of things, moving more water. There's just a lot of -- you have a lot more options to pull on your conventional asset base and you're seeing us pull those, so I think you will see it flatten."

So if we assume we don't pay down any debt this year, we expect to end closer to the $1.5 billion of cash where we started.

So if we assume we don't pay down any debt this year, we expect to end closer to the $1.5 billion of cash where we started. We had about a little over $450 million of cash consumption in the first quarter. Roughly 2/3 of that, if you just take -- if you look at first quarter actual versus the plan that it would take for the year to get to cash flow neutrality. In -- of that $450 million, about 2/3 of that is because we built working capital in the first quarter and we had practically 0 sale proceeds in the first quarter. We expect both of those items to be cash flow generators for us by the time we get to the end of the year, so about 2/3 of the $450 million is simply because of that. We had a pretty significant build in working capital during the quarter. The other 1/3 of the $450 million would be split roughly 50-50 between the overspend on capital in the year versus kind of an average quarterly run rate for the year and the shortfall on revenues less OpEx because of the fact that prices were below our $35, $2.35 Henry Hub plan for the year. On the working capital side, I mean, so why did we build working capital in the first quarter? The primary reason for that is because of the pay-down of payables and accrued costs between the end of the fourth quarter last year and the end of first quarter this year. And that's primarily because activity is slowing down so much, so our payables are coming down. Activity won't continue to slow down quite at the pace that it did through that time frame. And we expect inventory and accounts receivables, which tend to lag a bit the pay-down of payables, those to also come down through the year. And then we've got some pretty significant unique items, if you will, on the working capital side that we expect late this year, probably in the fourth quarter. Those are primarily in the form of tax refunds on lost carrybacks that one has been filed. One is about to be filed. And then also we do anticipate some asset sales, which will also take place later this year, the proceeds of which will come in late in 2015. So all of those things combine to offset the $460 million cash deficit that we incurred in the first quarter. A very -- sorry, a very long-winded way of saying yes, we anticipate getting back to $1.5 billion cash with the same debt level by the end of this year."

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. 
In the first quarter, Apache delivered solid operational results, strong financial performance and notable drilling outcomes, all of which were supported by our relentless focus on continuous improvement and cost reductions. 
Today, I would like to start with a brief recap of first quarter results and an update to Apache's 2016 production guidance. I will then provide an operational overview with particular emphasis on some of the exceptional well cost reductions we are achieving in our key North American onshore plays. I will conclude with thoughts on our current activity level and the potential for increasing capital investment in the near future. 
As noted in this morning's press release, company-wide pro forma production of 479,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day was at the high end of our quarterly guidance range of 470,000 to 480,000 BOEs per day. The outperformance came primarily from North America Onshore, which produced 298,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and exceeded our 290,000 to 295,000 BOE per day guidance range. Each of Apache's North American operating areas performed well despite a significant reduction in capital. The Permian, in particular, delivered robust results with strong performance from the underlying base, coupled with solid contributions from both newly drilled wells and base maintenance projects. In light of first quarter production strength, we are raising our full year 2016 North American Onshore guidance range by 5,000 BOEs per day to 268,000 to 278,000 BOEs per day. 
On international and offshore side, pro forma production was 180,000 BOEs per day, which was at the low end of our guidance range of 180,000 to 185,000 BOEs per day. This is primarily attributable to unplanned third-party plant and pipeline outages in the North Sea. We remain on track to achieve our full year 2016 international and offshore guidance of 170,000 to 180,000 BOEs per day. 
As we have stated previously, our 2016 North American Onshore drilling program is primarily focused on strategic testing and acreage delineation to building high-grade inventory. Nevertheless, we are continuing to see some remarkable progress on drilling efficiencies. For example, in key areas of North America where Apache was actively drilling during the first quarter, the average drilled and completed well costs were down approximately 45% as compared to average well costs in 2014. On the expense side, continuing with our efforts from last year, we saw further reductions in both lease operating expenses and gross G&A. Looking ahead, we anticipate further benefits from aligning our cost with the scale of our business and the commodity price environment. 
As you will recall, Apache is targeting cash flow neutrality in 2016 under our current budget, which assumes flat $35 oil and $2.35 gas. As expected, we were not cash flow neutral in the first quarter. However, we do anticipate generating a net cash flow surplus through the remainder of the year. As such, we remain on track for unchanged or lower net debt levels at year-end. Steve Riney will elaborate further on this in his prepared remarks. 
With the recent improvements in strip oil prices, we are prepared to increase capital spending but we'll refrain until we are confident cash flows have sustainably improved relative to our 2016 plan. Although we have the financial capacity to increase capital spending today, we believe that preserving our strong financial position and our credit quality through cash flow neutrality is the best approach for our shareholders in this price environment. I will provide more color on our thinking around this in a few minutes. 
Turning to our operations. In the Permian Basin, first quarter production held up well despite a significant decrease in the number of wells placed on production. We produced 171,000 BOE per day, which represents a 2% sequential decrease from the fourth quarter. In the Delaware, we placed 5 gross-operated wells on production, primarily targeting Bone Spring formations in the Pecos Bend area. One very notable well, the Seagull 103-HR produced an exceptional 30-day average peak rate of nearly 2,800 barrels of oil equivalent per day from a lateral length of approximately 4,600 feet. In its first 60 days of production, the Seagull 103-HR accumulated 78,000 barrels of oil, which makes it Apache's best well to date in the Delaware Basin. The success of the Seagull 103-HR is a function of our thorough understanding of the hydrocarbon system and continuous efforts to improve our results in these complex reservoirs. Thus far, our efforts in the Pecos Bend area of the Delaware have been focused on 2 primary landing zones in the third Bone Spring formation. 
During the first quarter, we tested a promising new landing zone within the third Bone Spring that could significantly enhance our running room in the area. In the Midland Basin, Central Basin Platform and Northwest Shelf, we placed 25 gross-operated wells on production, which is approximately 40% fewer wells than in the fourth quarter. During the first quarter, Apache generated good results from 6 Wolfcamp wells in the Powell area, 2 Wolfcamp completions at Wildfire and 4 horizontal Yeso wells on the Northwest Shelf, all of which are summarized in our quarterly earnings supplement. 
Before moving on to Egypt and the North Sea, I would like to highlight our North American well cost reduction efforts, which continue to exceed our expectations. Last quarter, I noted that we have dedicated a considerable amount of time, energy and resources toward reinvigorating Apache's strong culture of cost and returns discipline. This quarter, we are seeing some very tangible results from these initiatives, which I would like to share with you. As I mentioned earlier, in key areas of North America where Apache was actively drilling, our average drilled and completed well costs were down approximately 45% in the first quarter compared to average 2014 levels. Notably, in the Delaware Basin, our most recent well costs are now down approximately 60%. 
Although we have made great strides throughout 2015, I am truly amazed by the ongoing positive cost trends in our North American Onshore drilling program. Six quarters into the downturn, we are still achieving significant quarter-on-quarter cost improvements. For example, in the Delaware Basin, we recently drilled and completed a third Bone Spring well for $3.5 million. In the Midland Basin, 1-mile horizontal Wolfcamp and 1.5-mile Lower Spraberry drilling and completion costs are now projected to be less than $4 million and $4.5 million, respectively. In the horizontal Yeso play, on the Northwest Shelf in the Permian, recent well costs are trending below $2.3 million. And in the Woodford/SCOOP, our latest pacesetter well was drilled and completed for only $6.6 million. Achieving these lower well costs both expands our drillable inventory and significantly enhances our returns for future development programs. 
Recently, we have received questions about the sustainability of our well cost improvements once demand for oilfield services begins to rebound. The high-level answer is that more than 50% of our average well cost decreased since the 2014 peak has come from design and efficiency improvements and should, therefore, be viewed as permanent cost savings. In our earnings supplement this quarter, we have provided exhibits for our key North American Onshore plays that highlight the breakdown between service price and efficiency improvements. Apache's cost achievements to date are more than just belt-tightening efforts in response to the downturn. We seek to continuously implement structural changes and improvements, which accrue to the bottom line and enhance our long-term returns regardless of where oil prices and service costs go in the future. 
Now turning to our international operations. In the North Sea, first quarter production was slightly above 70,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, which represents a 2% decline sequentially from the fourth quarter of 2015. Unplanned downtime associated with outages on the third party-operated Forties pipeline system negatively impacted our sales volumes by approximately 1,700 BOEs per day during the quarter. These outages reduced our production uptime from what would have been 94% down to 90%. As a reminder, U.K. North Sea industry average production uptime has been between 60% and 70% over the last several years. Therefore, Apache maintains a significant competitive advantage in this regard. Despite the higher-than-expected downtime during the quarter, Apache still achieved exceptional LOE costs of approximately $11 per BOE. 
Our first quarter development drilling program in the North Sea delivered 4 successful new wells, all of which were placed online in the second half of the quarter. This set up a strong production rebound during the month of April. The nature of North Sea operations and production is such that there will always be monthly and quarterly lumpiness, but we are confident in our full year 2016 production guidance, which we stated would decline slightly year-over-year from 2015 levels. 
Our subsea tieback of the Callater discovery is proceeding on time and on budget, and we continue to expect this project will begin production in mid-2017. We are also looking forward to drilling our Storr and Kinord exploration prospects, which we highlighted in our North Sea webcast last November. 
In Egypt, our gross production of approximately 353,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day was essentially flat with the fourth quarter. Steve will provide more color on Egypt production reporting in a few minutes, but excluding tax barrels and minority interest pro forma production in Egypt was up slightly versus the fourth quarter. Apache's drilling program in Egypt continues to deliver successful and reliable results. We placed 23 wells on production during the first quarter and achieved a drilling success rate of 88%, which is in line with our historical success rates in Egypt. 
At our prolific Ptah and Berenice fields, we placed 2 more wells on production, bringing the total number of producing wells in the complex to 13. We have a few additional locations remaining to fully develop Ptah and Berenice, but facilities are currently constrained. 
Before I move on, I would like to leave you with a few high-level observations on Egypt. Apache's operation in Egypt remains stable. Our drilling, workover and waterflood programs continue to deliver quarter-after-quarter. When compared to North America, our well costs are relatively low and our netbacks and margins are relatively high. And lastly, cash flow generation in Egypt demonstrates much less price-related volatility than North America despite reported net production volatility from quarter-to-quarter. 
As we all contemplate the timing and magnitude of an oil price recovery, I want to leave you with a few key points around our thinking with regard to 2016 capital spending and the potential for incremental activity above our current plan. 
Cash flow is the governor on Apache's capital spending and activity levels in 2016. We still plan to manage to cash flow neutrality and exit the year with unchanged or lower net debt levels. We entered 2016 with an industry cost structure that was still out of sync with the low oil price environment. The recent rally in oil prices, coupled with our cost reductions, means that development drilling in North America is now generating acceptable returns in many areas. We believe these returns will continue to improve as costs come into better alignment with price. 
Recent improvements in oil prices are encouraging. We are now looking for a sustainably improved pricing structure that would generate the cash flow visibility for us to confidently increase our capital program. The potential timing and magnitude of this increase is the topic of significant planning and discussion right now at Apache and with our board. In the meantime, the vast majority of Apache's North American Onshore spending is focused on target testing, acreage evaluation and expanding our low-cost inventory of locations to be exploited in an environment that offers higher returns. When the time is appropriate, our first priorities for increased investment will be to add development rigs in the Permian. We will also accelerate North American acreage testing, and we will keep our 2 platform rigs running in the North Sea. Beyond that, the Woodford/SCOOP play and Egypt are next in line for incremental capital. Importantly, Apache has maintained the organizational capacity and personnel to operate a significantly higher number of rigs, and we are well prepared to ramp up activity when appropriate. Lastly, we are very mindful of the fact that we are in a highly cyclical and highly capital-intensive business. As such, any ramp in investment activity will pass rigorous hurdles on returns and net present value. 
In closing, Apache's portfolio and capital allocation approach is designed to withstand volatility over the long term, which is evident in our results. We look forward to demonstrating the capability of our North American assets and efficiency of our capital allocation process in the next upturn. 
I want to reiterate what I said in our last quarter's earnings call. Our plan is to emerge from this commodity price downturn with top-tier financial strength, a robust inventory of high rate of return drilling opportunities and a sustained capacity to generate free cash flow from our international assets in Egypt and the North Sea. We have made great progress in these efforts. Over the long term, our goal is to offer a competitive debt-adjusted per-share production reserve and cash flow growth rates and to achieve a top-quartile cost position in terms of average well costs, G&A and LOE per BOE. We will accomplish this with an intense focus on long-term full-cycle returns for our investment programs. Through the cycle, we believe this will translate into significantly improved returns and an appreciation in our share price. 
I will now turn the call over to Steve Riney."

In addition to reviewing our financial results for the first quarter of 2016, I would like to highlight our progress on several key financial objectives. These include: continuing to aggressively drive down well costs,",1230,"Thank you, John, and good afternoon. In addition to reviewing our financial results for the first quarter of 2016, I would like to highlight our progress on several key financial objectives. These include: continuing to aggressively drive down well costs, lease operating expense and G&A; achieving cash flow neutrality, inclusive of dividends under a flat $35 oil price; protecting our strong liquidity and financial position; and ending the year with unchanged or reduced net debt. Additionally, I will speak to our 2016 outlook for capital spending, LOE and G&A. And finally, I would like to review Egypt production volume reporting to address some potential confusion about the difference between reported volumes and the pro forma volumes we typically reference. 
So let's begin with the first quarter financial results. As noted in our press release, under generally accepted accounting principles, Apache reported a loss of $489 million or $1.29 per common share. Our results for the quarter include a number of items outside of our core earnings that are typically excluded by the investment community in published earnings estimates, the most significant of which are ceiling test write-downs. These items totaled $337 million after tax in the first quarter and, as in prior periods, resulted primarily from the continued low commodity price environment. Our loss for the quarter, adjusted for these items, was $152 million or $0.40 per share. 
As John mentioned, better-than-expected onshore North America production and solid operating cost performance worldwide were key contributors to our first quarter 2016 financial results. Apache's continuing focus on driving cost efficiencies resulted in capital spending of $466 million during the first quarter, which excludes noncontrolling interest. This is well below our guidance range of $500 million to $550 million. Capital costs in all of our North American regions were lower than we budgeted, with Permian leading the way. Our capital spending guidance of $1.4 billion to $1.8 billion for the full year of 2016 remains unchanged. We are clearly achieving better-than-expected capital efficiencies. Thus, absent an increase in planned activity, I would expect us to end the year somewhere in the bottom half of this range. That said, if the current oil price environment prevails, it is more likely that we will maintain or even increase drilling and completion activity from current levels, which would result in increased capital spending. 
Lease operating expenses in the first quarter were $7.81 per barrel of oil equivalent, 22% lower than the fourth quarter of 2015. Underlying improvement in this metric is primarily attributable to greater efficiency in North American Onshore production and the timing of workovers and other expenditures in the Permian and North Sea. While we are very pleased with this cost performance, certain onetime items and timing issues benefited us in a way that will not continue through the year. 
Last quarter, we provided guidance that full year 2016 LOE per BOE would be roughly flat compared to full year 2015. This implied a target of approximately $9.50 per BOE. With the progress we have already seen this year, we now believe 2016 LOE will be closer to $9.25 per BOE. 
On the G&A side, total costs continue to decline as we remain diligently focused on aligning overhead with capital spending levels. Our goal for the year was to further reduce gross cash overhead costs to a range of $650 million to $700 million. We are currently tracking toward the low end of this range, and we continue finding opportunities to further reduce these costs. 
In the first quarter of 2016, recurring DD&A was $11.42 per BOE, 34% lower than the fourth quarter of 2015. Our DD&A costs over the last several quarters have been on a clear downward trend as the result of price-related asset write-downs. 
Lastly, on costs, we incurred $90 million of net interest expense in the first quarter. You will note a trend of increasing expense interest and decreasing capitalized interest over the last several quarters. This is a result of unproved property impairments and reduced capital investment activity. 
Next, I would like to make a few comments regarding our financial strength and liquidity position. In 2015, we worked very hard to strengthen our financial position and maintain our investment-grade credit rating with the 3 primary rating agencies. Having accomplished this, one of our key financial objectives is to protect this position by maintaining unchanged or even reduced net debt by year-end 2016. 
During the first quarter, cash uses exceeded sources by approximately $463 million. This was primarily the result of commodity realizations coming in below our plan, a front-end loaded capital program and a build in working capital due to the timing of some nonrecurring working capital items. We anticipate these negative impacts early in the year will be more than offset later in the year. Even with the shortfall in first quarter cash flows, we ended the quarter with approximately $1 billion in cash. 
In summary, our financial condition and liquidity remain very strong. We have created this position through disciplined capital spending and aggressive cost management rather than issuing equity, reducing the dividend or selling core assets. Importantly, we still have good visibility to cash flow neutrality at our $35 plan level. 
Finally, I would like to take a moment to discuss Egypt production volume reporting. As you are aware, we most often refer you to pro forma production volumes, which, for Egypt, excludes 2 items: the 1/3 minority share of volumes attributable to our partner and tax barrels. Throughout 2014 and the first 3 quarters of 2015, our reported tax barrel production averaged approximately 26,500 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Asset impairments in the fourth quarter of 2015 and in the first quarter of 2016, combined with low oil prices, created a significant amount of noise in these tax barrel volumes. In the fourth quarter of 2015, these items resulted in negative tax barrel reported production of 47,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. In the first quarter of 2016, they resulted in Apache recording only 1,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day of production. As a reminder, tax barrels have no economic effect on our net cash flow from the business. Combined with the fact that they can lead to this type of reporting volatility, we believe investors should focus primarily on pro forma production in Egypt. A more thorough description of this will be on our website, along with a brief history of the difference between Egypt reported and pro forma volumes. We have also included this information for your reference in this quarter's earnings supplement. 
In closing, we took great efforts over the past 18 months to position Apache prudently for a prolonged downturn. After successfully navigating the challenges that confronted the industry in 2015, Apache is well prepared to capitalize on the opportunities that we believe will ultimately emerge. We have delivered a strong start to 2016 and look forward to continued progress throughout the year. Our primary goals for 2016 remain unchanged: We will live within our means, maintain our strong financial position, continue to build high-quality development inventory for the future and invest to improve long-term returns and add shareholder value. While we remain conservative in our budgeting and planned activity, we are prepared to respond when the environment is right to increase investment.

Our decline on our base is flattening, is a function of -- we're now 18 months into a slowdown in terms of the numbers of wells we've been bringing on, so that helps. Plus the base rate is a little lower that you've got to keep flat. So we see, clearly, less capital in '17 to keep it flat, but it's kind of a moving target at this point. And then obviously, the other factor is we've got some projects that we're advancing. Callater in the North Sea is on track, which will give us a big kick in the middle of '17.

So if we assume we don't pay down any debt this year, we expect to end closer to the $1.5 billion of cash where we started.

So if we assume we don't pay down any debt this year, we expect to end closer to the $1.5 billion of cash where we started. We had about a little over $450 million of cash consumption in the first quarter. Roughly 2/3 of that, if you just take -- if you look at first quarter actual versus the plan that it would take for the year to get to cash flow neutrality. In -- of that $450 million, about 2/3 of that is because we built working capital in the first quarter and we had practically 0 sale proceeds in the first quarter. We expect both of those items to be cash flow generators for us by the time we get to the end of the year, so about 2/3 of the $450 million is simply because of that. We had a pretty significant build in working capital during the quarter. The other 1/3 of the $450 million would be split roughly 50-50 between the overspend on capital in the year versus kind of an average quarterly run rate for the year and the shortfall on revenues less OpEx because of the fact that prices were below our $35, $2.35 Henry Hub plan for the year. On the working capital side, I mean, so why did we build working capital in the first quarter? The primary reason for that is because of the pay-down of payables and accrued costs between the end of the fourth quarter last year and the end of first quarter this year. And that's primarily because activity is slowing down so much, so our payables are coming down. Activity won't continue to slow down quite at the pace that it did through that time frame. And we expect inventory and accounts receivables, which tend to lag a bit the pay-down of payables, those to also come down through the year. And then we've got some pretty significant unique items, if you will, on the working capital side that we expect late this year, probably in the fourth quarter. Those are primarily in the form of tax refunds on lost carrybacks that one has been filed. One is about to be filed. And then also we do anticipate some asset sales, which will also take place later this year, the proceeds of which will come in late in 2015. So all of those things combine to offset the $460 million cash deficit that we incurred in the first quarter. A very -- sorry, a very long-winded way of saying yes, we anticipate getting back to $1.5 billion cash with the same debt level by the end of this year."

In conjunction with this morning's press release, I hope you have had the opportunity to review our second quarter financial and operational supplement. As discussed in our press release yesterday, Apache announced that during the second quarter of 2016, the company voluntarily changed its method of accounting for oil and gas exploration and development activities from the full cost to the successful efforts method. All numbers discussed today will be stated under successful efforts, unless otherwise noted. 
Please note, the following documents will be available after the close of business today. Our second quarter 10-Q filing; Form 8-K filings that include certain financial information from Apache's 2015 Form 10-K and first quarter 2016 Form 10-Q recasts to reflect the retrospective application of the successful efforts method; and a successful efforts conversion PDF presentation, which contains additional detailed information regarding the impact of this accounting change. Please reference our Investor Relations website at investor.apachecorp.com to access these documents. 
I'd like to remind everyone that today's discussions will contain forward-looking statements and assumptions based on our current views and reasonable expectations. However, a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discuss today. A full disclaimer is located with the supplemental data on our website.

Apache continues to make great progress in all aspects of our business, as demonstrated by the strength of our second quarter results. Before we get into the details, I would like to start off by highlightin",2461,"Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. Apache continues to make great progress in all aspects of our business, as demonstrated by the strength of our second quarter results. 
Before we get into the details, I would like to start off by highlighting a few important takeaways from today's call. First, we delivered another solid quarter of adjusted earnings and operating cash flow. This underscores the significant progress we have made on costs and the resilience of our portfolio on a low-price and low-reinvestment environment.
Second, we have been working all aspects of our cost structure for more than 18 months. Last year, the majority of our cost savings came from G&A reductions and capital efficiencies. While these costs continue to improve, we are seeing most of our significant savings coming from LOE. 
Third, production volumes continue to hold up well and track in line with the increased guidance range we provided last quarter. Our production expectations for the full year remain unchanged. 
Finally, with our cost structure better synchronized with the lower oil price environment and with the potential for prices to exceed our $35 budget for the year, we can see a path to more normalized investment levels. Our conservative budgeting approach, coupled with incremental cash flow in the second quarter, now gives us the optionality to increase investment activity. And the incremental investment will continue to be made within the construct of our rigorous capital allocation process and within operating cash flow. 
Now I will turn to our second quarter results, focusing first on the positive results we're realizing from our cost-cutting initiatives. Apache continues to drive significant reductions to its cost structure. After an impressive first quarter, our lease operating expenses were down even further in the second quarter. Our operational teams have done an exceptional job attacking every aspect of LOE. For example, we have renegotiated power, chemical and water handling contracts, in some cases, locking in very attractive pricing for the long term. We have also significantly lowered our third-party contractor costs in the field, as we further leverage the capabilities of our field personnel. 
On the G&A front, while most of the heavy lifting was done last year, we continue to identify additional opportunities to align overhead costs with projected activity levels. Importantly, we have retained the capacity to support much higher investment, so we do not anticipate these costs to revert. 
On the capital side, last quarter, I noted an impressive decrease in our average well costs, which were down cumulatively about 45% compared to 2014.
While we are seeing the rate of service price reductions begin to flatten out, we continue to find opportunities for overall well cost improvements. 
As we transition from strategic testing to development drilling operations, we will realize additional efficiencies and cost savings. For example, we will increase pad drilling operations, thereby enabling more efficient drilling and completions. We will draw longer laterals and reduce the number of future wellbores and associated costs. We will increase our utilization of rotary [indiscernible], enabling better landing zone targeting and faster penetration rates. In addition, most of our rigs currently working in North America and the North Sea were contracted prior to 2015 at very high day rates. Consequently, we anticipate our average rig rates will decline in the future. 
Moving on to production for the quarter. As noted in this morning's press release, Apache's global pro forma production was 461,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, consisting of 282,000 BOEs per day in North America Onshore and 179,000 BOE per day in international and offshore. North American onshore production declined roughly 16,000 BOEs per day from the first quarter. We only placed 20 new gross operated wells on production in North America during the second quarter, so these declines were expected. Notably, less than 5,600 BOEs per day of this decline was in the Permian, where Apache currently generates its highest North American margins. 
As set forth in our quarterly supplement, Apache's cash margins in the Permian averaged approximately $17 per BOE on the second quarter, which is more than double those in the rest of North America. Consequently, most of the volume reduction in North America had relatively little impact on our earnings and cash flow. 
Our Permian Region produced 165,000 BOEs per day in the second quarter or nearly 60% of Apache's total North American onshore production. In the Delaware Basin, we placed only 2 gross operated wells on production, both of which targeted the Third Bone Spring formation in the Pecos Bend area. One very notable well, which we mentioned in last quarter's call, was the Blue Jay unit 103H. This well was  placed on production in April and achieved an exceptional 30-day average rate of nearly 3,200 barrels of oil equivalent per day from a lateral length of approximately 5,100 feet. In fact, in its first 90 days on production, the oil component alone of this well was 147,000 barrels, making it Apache's best well to date in the Delaware Basin. 
In our Waha area of the Delaware Basin, through drilling longer laterals and taking advantage of natural fractures systems, we continue to enhance production rates. This has significantly improved the economics at Waha and reduced our breakeven oil price. An example of our recent success is the 905 H well, which we placed on production just after the end of the second quarter. This well achieve a peak 24-hour IP rate of approximately 1,750 barrels of oil equivalent. As a result of our technical progress, we now have an expanding inventory of attractive locations at Waha both the Wolfcamp A and Third Bone Spring formations. 
To sum up our opportunity in the Delaware Basin, in the Pecos Bend and Waha areas alone, we can support a multi-rig drilling program for several years. In the Midland Basin, Central Basin Platform and Northwest Shelf, we placed a combined 16 gross operated wells on production, which is down from 25 wells in the first quarter. During the second quarter, we brought online 2 Wolfcamp B wells, the Connell 38B 2HM and 38C 2HM, each of which achieved a 30-day average rate of more than 1,300 barrels of oil equivalent per day from 1-mile laterals. 
Subsequent to quarter-end, we placed another strong Wolfcamp B well, the CC4144 East 2HM on production at a peak 24-hour IP rate of approximately 2,200 BOEs predict. Much of our testing in the Wolfcamp involves completions and landing zone optimization. The improvements we are making, as demonstrated about these wells, will significantly enhance our Wolfcamp program going forward. 
Also in the Midland Basin, we look forward to bringing on 3 Lower Spraberry spell wells in the second half of this year, where we have significant running room and anticipate very compelling economics. 
Finally, on the Northwest Shelf, we placed 9 horizontal Yeso wells on production during the quarter and continue to generate very good production rates and economics from this play. What noteworthy well, the Hummingbird #7, produced a 30-day average rate of 734 BOEs per day. As a reminder, our well costs in the Yeso are very low, typically around $2.5 million. 
To sum up the Permian, Apache has made great strides during the downturn to improve every aspect of our business. Reduced drilling days, better landing zone targeting, optimized fracks and many other efficiencies have all contributed to expanding our economic drilling opportunities. We look forward to continued improvements, which will fully leverage the upside potential of our vast acreage position. 
Outside of the Permian, Apache had no active drilling rigs in North America and placed on production only 2 other operated wells, both of which were in the Woodford-SCOOP. We have limited activity planned in the SCOOP for the remainder of the year. However, Apache's 50,000-plus net acres in the play will underpin a profitable 2- or 3-rig drilling program for many years to come. 
Despite our lower level of reinvestment, we are making great progress in North America. As I mentioned at the beginning of the call, our North American Onshore production guidance is tracking in line with our previous 2016 guidance range of 268,000 to 278,000 BOEs per day. 
On the international and offshore side, pro forma production for the quarter was 179,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, consisting of approximately 101,000 BOEs from Egypt, 71,000 BOEs from the North Sea and 7,000 BOEs from the Gulf of Mexico. 
In Egypt, gross production of 350,000 BOEs per day was down modestly compared to the first quarter due primarily to outages at a third-party gas plant. On a net basis, pro forma volumes declined sequentially by 2,800 BOEs per day, primarily due to the impact of improving Brent oil prices on the cost recovery mechanisms and our production sharing contracts. Apache placed 14 wells on production in Egypt during the second quarter and achieved a drilling success rate of 93%. 
In the North Sea, production was approximately 71,000 BOEs per day during the second quarter, up slightly from the first quarter. This was primarily the result of a few strong development wells brought into production around the end of the first quarter and improved operational uptime, which more than offset the underlying base decline. 
Apache drilled 2 very notable development wells in the quarter, the BCR B81 in the Beryl field was placed on production in late June and achieved a peak 24-hour IP rate of 55 million cubic feet of gas equivalent per day. The LP7 well was also placed on production in June at a peak 24-hour IP rate of 46 million cubic feet of gas equivalent per day. 
Looking ahead to the third quarter, we anticipate North Sea production will be up modestly from the second quarter. The benefit of BCR and LP7 will be mostly offset by seasonal maintenance downtime. At our Aviat project in the Forties Field, we have now competing and tied in the first well. As you will recall, Aviat enables a switch from diesel to natural gas as our primary source of power for the Forties Field. This is an environmentally friendly project that will extend the economic life of Forties and reduce certain safety, cost and reliability risks associated with bunkering diesel to our platforms. 
As highlighted in our November 2015 North Sea webcast, we are drilling 2 exploration prospects in the second half of 2016, Storr and Kinord. Both prospects offer low cost tieback opportunities to our existing barrel infrastructure and have material reserve potential. We expect to have results for both before year-end. 
Since we have received many questions lately on Surinam, let me provide a brief update. On Block 53, we have completed an extensive geologic and 3D geophysical review and prioritize a number of attractive prospects. We anticipate drilling our next exploratory well on the block in 2017. A drill ship has been contracted, and preparations are underway. 
On Block 58, a 3D seismic shoot is in progress, and we will have an early look by the end of the year and have a fully processed data package in 2017. 
To sum up international and offshore, while activity was limited, we had very good development results in both Egypt and the North Sea during the second quarter. We remain on track to produce between 170,000 and 180,000 BOEs per day on a pro forma basis for the full year 2016. Both Egypt and the North Sea generated positive free cash flow in the first half of 2016, and we anticipate they will continue to do so for the remainder of the year. 
We are excited about the future exploration potential in our international and offshore portfolio and look forward to providing more details in the future. 
Now for a look into the second half of 2016 and our updated view on full year capital guidance. As we mentioned in last quarter's call, our top priorities for incremental capital in 2016 are to: increase investment activity in the Permian, keep 2 platform rigs operational in the North Sea and to accelerate strategic testing initiatives across the portfolio. We have now initiated action on all of these priorities. In the Midland Basin, we added a second rig in late July and will focus on Lower Spraberry and Wolfcamp B targets through the remainder of the year. In the North Sea, our 2 platform rigs will remain manned and focused on workovers and development drilling. Additionally, a considerable portion of our incremental capital will be directed toward accelerating strategic testing initiatives and will have minimal impact on 2016 production. As a result of the increased activity I just described, we now expect our 2016 North American capital spend to be at the high end of our $1.4 billion to $1.8 billion guidance. Importantly, we will not lose our capital discipline as activity increases, and we will continue to target unchanged or lower net debt at year-end, irrespective of changes in commodity price. 
Our incremental 2016 spending will have minimal impact on average 2016 production. However, this increased investment will help to stem our production decline and build momentum as we enter 2017. 
In closing, Apache has benefited from deliberate decisions to budget conservatively and to position the company for stability and success in a lower-price environment. We have streamlined our asset base, significantly reduced our cost structure and allocated a considerable percentage of our resources to strategic testing initiatives. Despite more than an 85% reduction in capital investments since 2014, we have high-graded our drilling inventory and substantially increased our opportunity set. I can say with confidence that despite the industry downturn, Apache has far more potential than we did just 18 months ago. 
We have protected our balance sheet and chosen to invest within our cash flows while maintaining our dividend and avoiding equity issuances. This approach has paid off as we have maintained our investment-grade credit rating and reduced our net debt level by 38% since early 2015. 
Going forward, our budgeting approach will remain conservative and methodical. We will continue to manage oil and gas price volatility by setting a reasonable expected price band and gearing our capital spending, returns targets and capital structure to the lower end of that band. Should realized prices come in higher, we will maintain the planning capability and operational flexibility to respond accordingly. This will help to ensure that we generate the best possible returns on our drilling programs and maintain a strong financial position through the cycle. 
In the second half of 2016, our primary goals remain unchanged. We will live within our means, maintain our strong financial position, continue to build high-quality development inventory for the future and invest to improve long-term returns and create shareholder value. 
I will now turn the call over to Steve Riney."

I will begin with Apache's switch from the full cost accounting method to successful efforts. I will lay out the rationale for the change and outline the primary differences between the 2 methodologies. Next, I will review our second quarter 2016 financial results as reported under successful efforts. I will contrast these with results that would have been reported under full costs. Please note that our quarterly financial and operational supplement contains a slide that compares key second quarter line items under successful efforts to the same items under fulls cost. I encourage you to review these comparisons to better understand the impact of the accounting change on our second quarter results. 
The full cost results outlined in the supplement are probably more comparable with analyst estimates for the quarter and should compare favorably to most expectations. Following that, I will review Apache's primary financial objectives for the remainder of 2016. And finally, I will update and expand our 2016 guidance. Our guidance will now be based on 2016 anticipated results under successful efforts. 
So let's begin with a discussion of our switch to the successful efforts accounting methodology. As many of you are aware, Apache has been evaluating a switch to successful efforts for several quarters. We have now effected that transition with our second quarter 2016 results. We decided to proceed with the change for 2 primary reasons. First, successful efforts provides for a better matching of costs incurred with the period in which they impact financial results. This is primarily accomplished through the recognition of exploration expense. Under full cost accounting, more costs tend to be capitalized under the balance sheet and then depreciated over time. During periods of sustained low oil and gas prices, this typically results in significant ceiling test write-downs, as Apache experience over the last 18 months. Successful efforts generally results in lower reported earnings and operating cash flows in the near term, but in the long run, the balance sheet and earnings are less impacted by commodity price volatility. Second, excess full efforts is generally preferred by the investment community and is more commonly used by the vast majority of E&P companies. 9 out of the 11 companies, in what we often refer to as our peer group, currently utilized successful efforts. So this transition allows for more easily understood and more comparable financial results for Apache. 
Now let me touch briefly on the changes you will see under successful efforts. As I just indicated, one of the primary differences is that under successful efforts, we will report exploration expense. Exploration expense includes 4 significant categories of costs. First, it includes exploration-related seismic costs, which are differentiated from capitalized development-related seismic costs. Note both exploration and development seismic activity are common at Apache. Second, it includes exploration-related G&A costs. Third, exploration expense includes lease rentals and the cost of any expired or surrendered leases associated with unproved acreage. And finally, dry hole costs, which will be expensed in the quarter in which an exploratory well is deemed to be uneconomic. Note, successful exploratory wells will be capitalized. Changes resulting from the recognition of exploration expense will have the following impacts on our reported financial results. On the income statement, results in the near term will appear lower under successful efforts due to the immediate recognition of exploration expense. For the second quarter of 2016, we recognized $91 million in exploration expense under successful efforts. These costs would have been capitalized under full costs. On the cash flow statement, net cash from operating activities results will be lower under successful efforts due to the exploration expense impact on net income. While the noncash portion of exploration expense is added back to arrive at operating cash flow, the cash portion will remain as a reduction. There will be an equal and offsetting reduction in cash used in investing activities since these costs will no longer be capitalized. For the second quarter of 2016, the result was $37 million reduction in reported operating cash flow and in cash used in investment activities. Net cash flow, of course, was the same under both methodologies. On the balance sheet, exploration expense results in less capitalized costs and, therefore, a lower carrying value for unproved property. The impact of the second quarter exploration expense resulted in a lower carrying value for unproved properties of $22 million. In the long run, exploration successes will transition to proved property with a lower carrying value, resulting in lower DD&A. At the end of my discussion, I will offer guidance on expected exploration expense for 2016. 
There are other differences between successful efforts and full cost accounting such as capitalization of interest costs, impairment calculations, reporting of gain or loss on sales and the treatment of assets held for sale. We don't have enough time to review all of those on this call. Accordingly, we will post a slide deck on our website at the end of the day that contains a more extensive comparison of full costs and successful efforts accounting methodologies as they relate to our financial reporting. Please feel free to reach out to Gary and his team with any questions as you work through the impacts of this change. 
You will see that we have included in the supplement a summary of the impacts of the switch to successful efforts on our second quarter reported results. It details what I have outlined today as well as a few other items, the most significant of which is the cumulative historical impact on Apache's balance sheet. The balance sheet now reflects the aggregate effect of successful efforts accounting from a historical perspective. You will note in particular that retained earnings has increased by $5.3 billion as of the end of the first quarter. This is the cumulative effect of many items, the most significant of which are: the recognition of past exploration expense, which reduces retained earnings by $8 billion; changes in past DD&A, ceiling test write-downs and asset impairment charges, which increases retained earnings by $14.9 billion; changes to past reported gains or losses on asset sales that decreased retained earnings by $1 billion; and various other items, including adjustments to capitalized interest and changes in tax valuation allowances, which decreased retained earnings by $640 million. 
So let's now switch to our successful efforts-based financial results for the second quarter as announced in this morning's press release. Apache reported a second quarter GAAP loss of $244 million or $0.65 per common share. These results include a number of items outside of core earnings that are typically excluded by the investment community in their published earnings estimates. In the second quarter, items generally not considered part of core earnings totaled $145 million after tax. Apache's loss for the quarter, when adjusted for these items, was $99 million or $0.26 per share. Under full cost accounting, our adjusted earnings would have been a profit of $0.05 per share. Since market expectations for the quarter assumed full cost accounting, we believe this is a more comparable basis for assessing our results. 
During the second quarter, we generated cash from operating activities of $744 million, a substantial increase from our first quarter result. Improved commodity prices, disciplined cost control and a release of cash from working capital drove this improvement. Under full cost accounting, cash from operating activities would have been $781 million. 
Apache ended the quarter with $1.2 billion in cash on hand. This is an increase of approximately $200 million from the end of the first quarter. After consuming cash in the first quarter, we are now rebuilding our cash position back toward the $1.5 billion we had to start the year. This is consistent with our goal to end 2016 with the same or lower net debt than we began the year with. 
Turning to costs. Lease operating expenses in the second quarter were $7.38 per barrel of oil equivalent, down 4% from the first quarter, following a significant quarter-on-quarter reduction from the fourth quarter of 2015. We continue to focus aggressively on all forms of cost reduction, and LOE has shown a tremendous response to that focus so far in 2016. That said, our expectation is that LOE per barrel of oil equivalent will increase in the second half of 2016 due to the timing of workover activity and seasonal maintenance. 
On the G&A side, costs continue to decline as we align our overhead cost structure with anticipated future capital spending levels. As you will recall, for the purposes of monitoring progress made in our G&A costs, we define G&A as our gross overhead cash costs. This excludes incentive compensation as well as G&A cost recoveries from our partners. These 2 items tend to offset one another but will vary from year-to-year. Our goal for 2016 was to reduce these costs to a range of $650 million to $700 million. We are currently tracking at the low end of this range. G&A costs have historically been incurred such that 45% was capitalized, 20% went to LOE and 35% was expensed. With significant changes to our G&A cost structure and elements of G&A now being recorded as exploration expense, you should expect, going forward, that G&A costs will track more closely to 25% being capitalized, 15% to LOE, 10% to exploration expense and 50% recorded as G&A on the income statement. Actual results will, of course, differ and will reflect quarterly fluctuations in the timing of costs, but this is a good general allocation to use on an annual basis. 
Apache's DD&A in the second quarter under successful efforts was $13.75 per barrel of oil equivalent. This is a modest increase relative to the first quarter as reported under full costs. This increase in the D&A is primarily attributable to an increase in the carrying value of our oil and gas properties resulting from the switch to successful efforts. 
Next I would like to turn to our key financial objectives for the remainder of 2016. Apache has worked hard to build a strong financial position, and we like where we stand. We have a strong liquidity position with $1.2 billion of cash and $3.5 billion of available credit facilities. We have a very reasonable level of debt, and we have maintained our investment-grade rating through the downturn. Equally important, we are running the business to be cash flow neutral at $35 oil. That being the case, we now have the possibility of higher cash flow in 2016 to the extent oil price averages above $35. We are in a unique position where we could fund an increase in capital investment with cash from operations. As always, incremental capital spending will be subject to a rigorous focus on long-term, full-cycle rates of return. 
With this context, our key financial objectives for the second half of 2016 are to: continue to focus on cost management in all aspect of the business. We have accomplished a lot, but there's always more to do. Allocate capital resources to the very best projects to enhance the quality of our drillable inventory and to deliver attractive, fully burdened returns; balance capital spending with available cash flows to end the year with the same or lower net debt; and maintain our current investment-grade rating. 
I would like to conclude by updating our guidance for the remainder of 2016 and offering a few additional items that may be helpful in light of our switch to successful efforts. As John already noted, after raising production guidance with our first quarter results, our full year production guidance ranges for both North America Onshore and international and offshore remain unchanged. He also reviewed our increased activity levels and noted that we now expect full year capital spending to be at the high end of our $1.4 billion to $1.8 billion range. 
With regard to LOE, following our first quarter results, we reduced our 2016 LOE guidance from $9.50 to $9.25 per BOE. Given the continued excellent progress we have made during the second quarter, but taking into account an expected increase in workover and seasonal maintenance expense, we now expect full year LOE at $8.50 per BOE or lower. 
On G&A costs, we will continue to speak about this in terms of gross spend, regardless of where it shows up in our financial statements. As indicated previously, we are approaching the lower end of our guidance range of $650 million to $700 million. While we continue to focus on our overhead cost structure, our guidance will remain unchanged. 
With the change to successful efforts and recent write-downs of unproved properties, we anticipate expensing a higher percentage of our interest costs going forward. Accordingly, we forecast that approximately 90% of our total interest costs will be expensed in 2016. As noted previously, successful efforts requires the recognition of exploration expense each quarter. Exploration expense includes some items that are planned and predictable and other items that tend to be volatile from quarter-to-quarter. Specifically, drivable costs and unproved property impairments, by their nature, do not lend themselves to guidance. 
Consequently, for the full year 2016, we anticipate exploration expense, in aggregate will, be in the range of $250 million to $300 million. This includes actual drivable costs and unproved property impairments through the second quarter that excludes them for the second half of the year. 
Finally, with regard to taxes, as I noted on our call back in February, we anticipate minimal cash taxes will be paid in 2016. 
In conclusion, we are proud of our financial accomplishments over the past 18 months. Our liquidity is strong, our debt levels are under control and we are living within our means. We have completed the transition to successful efforts, which will enhance comparability with our peers and better inform our already rigorous planning and capital allocation processes. We look to the future with great optimism and have set our long-term sights on significantly improving returns on capital employed and generating competitive per-share growth, which will be an outcome of disciplined returns-based investment decisions. 
I will now turn the call over to the operator for Q&A."

The overhead structure, the LOE, the well costs, our capital efficiency is actually, we continue to surprise ourselves with the progress we're making on the capital efficiency side.

And in the meantime, I don't find that our debt level is what I would call burdensome, given -- especially given the capital spending program that we have going on right now."

In conjunction with this morning's press release, I hope you have had the opportunity to review our second quarter financial and operational supplement. As discussed in our press release yesterday, Apache announced that during the second quarter of 2016, the company voluntarily changed its method of accounting for oil and gas exploration and development activities from the full cost to the successful efforts method. All numbers discussed today will be stated under successful efforts, unless otherwise noted. 
Please note, the following documents will be available after the close of business today. Our second quarter 10-Q filing; Form 8-K filings that include certain financial information from Apache's 2015 Form 10-K and first quarter 2016 Form 10-Q recasts to reflect the retrospective application of the successful efforts method; and a successful efforts conversion PDF presentation, which contains additional detailed information regarding the impact of this accounting change. Please reference our Investor Relations website at investor.apachecorp.com to access these documents. 
I'd like to remind everyone that today's discussions will contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions based on our current views and reasonable expectations. However, a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discuss today. A full disclaimer is located with the supplemental data on our website. 
I will now turn the call over to John."

Before we get into the details, I would like to start off by highlightin",2469,"Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. Apache continues to make great progress in all aspects of our business, as demonstrated by the strength of our second quarter results. 
Before we get into the details, I would like to start off by highlighting a few important takeaways from today's call. First, we delivered another solid quarter of adjusted earnings and operating cash flow. This underscores the significant progress we have made on costs and the resilience of our portfolio on a low-price and low-reinvestment environment.
Second, we have been working all aspects of our cost structure for more than 18 months. Last year, the majority of our cost savings came from G&A reductions and capital efficiencies. While these costs continue to improve, we are now seeing most of our significant savings coming from LOE. 
Third, production volumes continue to hold up well and track in line with the increased guidance range we provided last quarter. Our production expectations for the full year remain unchanged. 
Finally, with our cost structure better synchronized with the lower oil price environment and with the potential for prices to exceed our $35 budget for the year, we can see a path to more normalized investment levels. Our conservative budgeting approach, coupled with incremental cash flow in the second quarter, now gives us the optionality to increase investment activity. And the incremental investment will continued to be made within the construct of our rigorous capital allocation process and within operating cash flow. 
Now I will turn to our second quarter results, focusing first on the positive results we're realizing from our cost-cutting initiatives. Apache continues to drive significant reductions to its cost structure. After an impressive first quarter, our lease operating expenses were down even further in the second quarter. 
Our operational teams have done an exceptional job attacking every aspect of LOE. For example, we have renegotiated power, chemical and water handling contracts, in some cases, locking in very attractive pricing for the long term. We have also significantly lowered our third-party contractor costs in the field, as we further leverage the capabilities of our field personnel. 
On the G&A front, while most of the heavy lifting was done last year, we continued to identify additional opportunities to align overhead costs with projected activity levels. Importantly, we have retained the capacity to support much higher investment, so we do not anticipate these costs to revert. 
On the capital side, last quarter, I noted an impressive decrease in our average well costs, which were down cumulatively about 45% compared to 2014.
While we are seeing the rate of service price reductions begin to flatten out, we continue to find opportunities for overall well cost improvements. 
As we transition from strategic testing to development drilling operations, we will realize additional efficiencies and cost savings. For example, we will increase pad drilling operations, thereby enabling more efficient batch drilling and completions. We will draw longer laterals and reduce the number of future wellbores and associated costs. We will increase our utilization of rotary steerables, enabling better landing zone targeting and faster penetration rates. In addition, most of our rigs currently working in North America and the North Sea were contracted prior to 2015 at very high day rates. Consequently, we anticipate our average rig rates will decline in the future. 
Moving on to production for the quarter. As noted in this morning's press release, Apache's global pro forma production was 461,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, consisting of 282,000 BOEs per day in North America Onshore and 179,000 BOE per day in international and offshore. North American onshore production declined roughly 16,000 BOEs per day from the first quarter. We only placed 20 new gross operated wells on production in North America during the second quarter, so these declines were expected. Notably, less than 5,600 BOEs per day of this decline was in the Permian, where Apache currently generates its highest North American margins. 
As set forth in our quarterly supplement, Apache's cash margins in the Permian averaged approximately $17 per BOE in the second quarter, which is more than double of those in the rest of North America. Consequently, most of the volume reduction in North America had relatively little impact on our earnings and cash flow. 
Our Permian Region produced 165,000 BOEs per day in the second quarter or nearly 60% of Apache's total North American onshore production. In the Delaware Basin, we placed only 2 gross operated wells on production, both of which targeted the Third Bone Spring formation in the Pecos Bend area. One very notable well, which we mentioned in last quarter's call, was the Blue Jay unit 103H. This well was  placed on production in April and achieved an exceptional 30-day average rate of nearly 3,200 barrels of oil equivalent per day from a lateral length of approximately 5,100 feet. In fact, in its first 90 days on production, the oil component alone of this well was 147,000 barrels, making it Apache's best well to date in the Delaware Basin. 
In our Waha area of the Delaware Basin, through drilling longer laterals and taking advantage of natural fractures systems, we continued to enhance production rates. This has significantly improved the economics at Waha and reduced our breakeven oil price. An example of our recent success is the 905 H well, which we placed on production just after the end of the second quarter. This well achieved a peak 24-hour IP rate of approximately 1,750 barrels of oil equivalent. As a result of our technical progress, we now have an expanding inventory of attractive locations at Waha in both the Wolfcamp A and Third Bone Spring formations. 
To sum up our opportunity in the Delaware Basin, in the Pecos Bend and Waha areas alone, we can support a multi-rig drilling program for several years. In the Midland Basin, Central Basin Platform and Northwest Shelf, we placed a combined 16 gross operated wells on production, which is down from 25 wells in the first quarter. During the second quarter, we brought online 2 Wolfcamp B wells, the Connell 38B 2HM and 38C 2HM, each of which achieved a 30-day average rate of more than 1,300 barrels of oil equivalent per day from 1-mile laterals. 
Subsequent to quarter-end, we placed another strong Wolfcamp B well, the CC 4144 East 2HM on production at a peak 24-hour IP rate of approximately 2,200 BOEs per day. Much of our testing in the Wolfcamp involves completions and landing zone optimization. The improvements we are making as demonstrated about these wells, will significantly enhance our Wolfcamp program going forward. 
Also in the Midland Basin, we look forward to bringing on 3 Lower Spraberry shell wells in the second half of this year, where we have significant running room and anticipate very compelling economics. 
Finally, on the Northwest Shelf, we placed 9 horizontal Yeso wells on production during the quarter and continued to generate very good production rates and economics from this play. One noteworthy well, the Hummingbird #7 produced a 30-day average rate of 734 BOEs per day. As a reminder, our well costs in the Yeso play are very low, typically around $2.5 million. 
To sum up the Permian, Apache has made great strides during the downturn to improve every aspect of our business. Reduced drilling days, better landing zone targeting, optimized fracs and many other efficiencies have all contributed to expanding our economic drilling opportunities. We look forward to continued improvements, which will fully leverage the upside potential of our vast acreage position. 
Outside of the Permian, Apache had no active drilling rigs in North America and placed on production only 2 other operated wells, both of which were in the Woodford-SCOOP. We have limited activity planned in the SCOOP for the remainder of the year. However, Apache's 50,000-plus net acres in the play will underpin a profitable 2- or 3-rig drilling program for many years to come. 
Despite our lower level of reinvestment, we are making great progress in North America. As I mentioned at the beginning of the call, our North American Onshore production guidance is tracking in line with our previous 2016 guidance range of 268,000 to 278,000 BOEs per day. 
On the international and offshore side, pro forma production for the quarter was 179,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, consisting of approximately 101,000 BOEs from Egypt, 71,000 BOEs from the North Sea and 7,000 BOEs from the Gulf of Mexico. 
In Egypt, gross production of 350,000 BOEs per day was down modestly compared to the first quarter due primarily to outages at a third-party gas plant. On a net basis, pro forma volumes declined sequentially by 2,800 BOEs per day, primarily due to the impact of improving Brent oil prices on the cost recovery mechanisms and our production sharing contracts. Apache placed 14 wells on production in Egypt during the second quarter and achieved a drilling success rate of 93%. 
In the North Sea, production was approximately 71,000 BOEs per day during the second quarter, up slightly from the first quarter. This was primarily the result of a few strong development wells brought into production around the end of the first quarter and improved operational uptime, which more than offset the underlying base decline. 
Apache drilled 2 very notable development wells in the quarter, the BCR B81 in the Beryl field was placed on production in late June and achieved a peak 24-hour IP rate of 55 million cubic feet of gas equivalent per day. The LP7 well was also placed on production in June at a peak 24-hour IP rate of 46 million cubic feet of gas equivalent per day. 
Looking ahead to the third quarter, we anticipate North Sea production will be up modestly from the second quarter. The benefit of BCR and LP7 will be mostly offset by seasonal maintenance downtime. At our Aviat project in the Forties Field, we have now completed and tied in the first well. As you will recall, Aviat enables a switch from diesel to natural gas as our primary source of power for the Forties field. This is an environmentally friendly project that will extend the economic life of Forties and reduce certain safety, cost and reliability risks associated with bunkering diesel to our platforms. 
As highlighted in our November 2015 North Sea webcast, we are drilling 2 exploration prospects in the second half of 2016, Storr and Kinord. Both prospects offer low cost tieback opportunities to our existing barrel infrastructure and have material reserve potential. We expect to have results for both before year-end. 
Since we have received many questions lately on Suriname, let me provide a brief update. On Block 53, we have completed an extensive geologic and 3D geophysical review and prioritize a number of attractive prospects. We anticipate drilling our next exploratory well on the block in 2017. A drill ship has been contracted, and preparations are underway. 
On Block 58, a 3D seismic shoot is in progress, and we will have an early look by the end of the year and have a fully processed data package in 2017. 
To sum up international and offshore, while activity was limited, we had very good development results in both Egypt and the North Sea during the second quarter. We remain on track to produce between 170,000 and 180,000 BOEs per day on a pro forma basis for the full year 2016. Both Egypt and the North Sea generated positive free cash flow in the first half of 2016, and we anticipate they will continue to do so for the remainder of the year. 
We are excited about the future exploration potential in our international and offshore portfolio and look forward to providing more details in the future. 
Now for a look into the second half of 2016 and our updated view on full year capital guidance. As we mentioned in last quarter's call, our top priorities for incremental capital in 2016 are to: increase investment activity in the Permian, keep 2 platform rigs operational in the North Sea and to accelerate strategic testing initiatives across the portfolio. We have now initiated action on all of these priorities. 
In the Midland Basin, we added a second rig in late July and will focus on Lower Spraberry and Wolfcamp B targets through the remainder of the year. In the North Sea, our 2 platform rigs will remain manned and focused on workovers and development drilling. Additionally, a considerable portion of our incremental capital will be directed toward accelerating strategic testing initiatives and will have minimal impact on 2016 production. As a result of the increased activity I just described, we now expect our 2016 North American capital spend to be at the high end of our $1.4 billion to $1.8 billion guidance. Importantly, we will not lose our capital discipline as activity increases, and we will continue to target unchanged or lower net debt at year-end, irrespective of changes in commodity price. 
Our incremental 2016 spending will have minimal impact on average 2016 production. However, this increased investment will help to stem our production decline and build momentum as we enter 2017. 
In closing, Apache has benefited from deliberate decisions to budget conservatively and to position the company for stability and success in a lower-priced environment. We have streamlined our asset base, significantly reduced our cost structure and allocated a considerable percentage of our resources to strategic testing initiatives. Despite more than an 85% reduction in capital investments since 2014, we have high graded our drilling inventory and substantially increased our opportunity set. I can say with confidence that despite the industry downturn, Apache has far more potential than we did just 18 months ago. 
We have protected our balance sheet and chosen to invest within our cash flows while maintaining our dividend and avoiding equity issuances. This approach has paid off as we have maintained our investment-grade credit rating and reduced our net debt level by 38% since early 2015. 
Going forward, our budgeting approach will remain conservative and methodical. We will continue to manage oil and gas price volatility by setting a reasonable expected price band and gearing our capital spending, returns targets and capital structure to the lower end of that band. Should realized prices come in higher, we will maintain the planning capability and operational flexibility to respond accordingly. This will help to ensure that we generate the best possible returns on our drilling programs and maintain a strong financial position through the cycle. 
In the second half of 2016, our primary goals remain unchanged. We will live within our means, maintain our strong financial position, continue to build high-quality development inventory for the future and invest to improve long-term returns and create shareholder value. 
I will now turn the call over to Steve Riney."

So let's begin with a discussion of our switch to the successful efforts accounting methodology. As many of you are aware, Apache has been evaluating a switch to successful efforts for several quarters. We have now effected that transition with our second quarter 2016 results. We decided to proceed with the change for 2 primary reasons. First, successful efforts provides for a better matching of costs incurred with the period in which they impact financial results. This is primarily accomplished through the recognition of exploration expense. Under full cost accounting, more costs tend to be capitalized under the balance sheet and then depreciated over time. During periods of sustained low oil and gas prices, this typically results in significant ceiling test write-downs, as Apache experienced over the last 18 months. Successful efforts generally results in lower reported earnings and operating cash flows in the near term, but in the long run, the balance sheet and earnings are less impacted by commodity price volatility. Second, successful full efforts is generally preferred by the investment community and is more commonly used by the vast majority of E&P companies, in what we often refer to as our peer group, currently utilized successful efforts. So this transition allows for more easily understood and more comparable financial results for Apache. 
Now let me touch briefly on the changes you will see under successful efforts. As I just indicated, one of the primary differences is that under successful efforts, we will report exploration expense. Exploration expense includes 4 significant categories of costs. First, it includes exploration-related seismic costs, which are differentiated from capitalized development-related seismic costs. Note both exploration and development seismic activity are common at Apache. Second, it includes exploration-related G&A costs. Third, exploration expense includes lease rentals and the cost of any expired or surrendered leases associated with unproved acreage. And finally, dry hole costs, which will be expensed in the quarter in which an exploratory well is deemed to be uneconomic. Note, successful exploratory wells will be capitalized. Changes resulting from the recognition of exploration expense will have the following impacts on our reported financial results. On the income statement, results in the near term will appear lower under successful efforts due to the immediate recognition of exploration expense. For the second quarter of 2016, we recognized $91 million in exploration expense under successful efforts. These costs would have been capitalized under full costs. 
On the cash flow statement, net cash from operating activities results will be lower under successful efforts due to the exploration expense impact on net income. While the noncash portion of exploration expense is added back to arrive at operating cash flow, the cash portion will remain as a reduction. There will be an equal and offsetting reduction in cash used in investing activities since these costs will no longer be capitalized. For the second quarter of 2016, the result was $37 million reduction in reported operating cash flow and in cash used in investment activities. Net cash flow, of course, was the same under both methodologies. On the balance sheet, exploration expense results in less capitalized costs and, therefore, a lower carrying value for unproved property. The impact of the second quarter exploration expense resulted in a lower carrying value for unproved properties of $22 million. In the long run, exploration successes will transition to proved property with a lower carrying value, resulting in lower DD&A. At the end of my discussion, I will offer guidance on expected exploration expense for 2016. 
There are other differences between successful efforts and full cost accounting such as capitalization of interest costs, impairment calculations, reporting of gain or loss on sales and the treatment of assets held for sale. We don't have enough time to review all of those on this call. Accordingly, we will post a slide deck on our website at the end of the day that contains a more extensive comparison of full costs and successful efforts accounting methodologies as they relate to our financial reporting. Please feel free to reach out to Gary and his team with any questions as you work through the impacts of this change. 
You will see that we have included in the supplement a summary of the impacts of the switch to successful efforts on our second quarter reported results. It details what I have outlined today as well as a few other items, the most significant of which is the cumulative historical impact on Apache's balance sheet. The balance sheet now reflects the aggregate effect of successful efforts accounting from a historical perspective. You will note in particular that retained earnings has increased by $5.3 billion as of the end of the first quarter. This is the cumulative effect of many items, the most significant of which are: the recognition of past exploration expense, which reduces retained earnings by $8 billion; changes in past DD&A, ceiling test write-downs and asset impairment charges, which increases retained earnings by $14.9 billion; changes to past reported gains or losses on asset sales that decreased retained earnings by $1 billion; and various other items, including adjustments to capitalized interest and changes in tax valuation allowances, which decreased retained earnings by $640 million. 
So let's now switch to our successful efforts-based financial results for the second quarter as announced in this morning's press release. Apache reported a second quarter GAAP loss of $244 million or $0.65 per common share. These results include a number of items outside of core earnings that are typically excluded by the investment community in their published earnings estimates. In the second quarter, items generally not considered part of core earnings totaled $145 million after tax. Apache's loss for the quarter, when adjusted for these items, was $99 million or $0.26 per share. Under full cost accounting, our adjusted earnings would have been a profit of $0.05 per share. Since market expectations for the quarter assumed full cost accounting, we believe this is a more comparable basis for assessing our results. 
During the second quarter, we generated cash from operating activities of $744 million, a substantial increase from our first quarter result. Improved commodity prices, disciplined cost control and a release of cash from working capital drove this improvement. Under full cost accounting, cash from operating activities would have been $781 million. 
Apache ended the quarter with $1.2 billion in cash on hand. This is an increase of approximately $200 million from the end of the first quarter. After consuming cash in the first quarter, we are now rebuilding our cash position back toward the $1.5 billion we had to start the year. This is consistent with our goal to end 2016 with the same or lower net debt than we began the year with. 
Turning to costs. Lease operating expenses in the second quarter were $7.38 per barrel of oil equivalent, down 4% from the first quarter, following a significant quarter-on-quarter reduction from the fourth quarter of 2015. We continue to focus aggressively on all forms of cost reduction, and LOE has shown a tremendous response to that focus so far in 2016. That said, our expectation is that LOE per barrel of oil equivalent will increase in the second half of 2016 due to the timing of workover activity and seasonal maintenance. 
On the G&A side, costs continued to decline as we aligned our overhead cost structure with anticipated future capital spending levels. As you will recall, for the purposes of monitoring progress made in our G&A costs, we define G&A as our gross overhead cash costs. This excludes incentive compensation as well as G&A cost recoveries from our partners. These 2 items tend to offset one another but will vary from year-to-year. Our goal for 2016 was to reduce these costs to a range of $650 million to $700 million. We are currently tracking at the low end of this range. G&A costs have historically been incurred such that 45% was capitalized, 20% went to LOE and 35% was expensed. With significant changes to our G&A cost structure and elements of G&A now being recorded as exploration expense, you should expect, going forward, that G&A costs will track more closely to 25% being capitalized, 15% to LOE, 10% to exploration expense and 50% recorded as G&A on the income statement. Actual results will, of course, differ and will reflect quarterly fluctuations in the timing of costs, but this is a good general allocation to use on an annual basis. 
Apache's DD&A in the second quarter under successful efforts was $13.75 per barrel of oil equivalent. This is a modest increase relative to the first quarter as reported under full costs. This increase in the D&A is primarily attributable to an increase in the carrying value of our oil and gas properties resulting from the switch to successful efforts. 
Next I would like to turn to our key financial objectives for the remainder of 2016. Apache has worked hard to build a strong financial position, and we like where we stand. We have a strong liquidity position with $1.2 billion of cash and $3.5 billion of available credit facilities. We have a very reasonable level of debt, and we have maintained our investment-grade rating through the downturn. Equally important, we are running the business to be cash flow neutral at $35 oil. That being the case, we now have the possibility of higher cash flow in 2016 to the extent oil price averages above $35. We are in a unique position where we could fund an increase in capital investment with cash from operations. As always, incremental capital spending will be subject to a rigorous focus on long-term, full-cycle rates of return. 
With this context, our key financial objectives for the second half of 2016 are to: continue to focus on cost management in all aspects of the business. We have accomplished a lot, but there's always more to do. Allocate capital resources to the very best projects to enhance the quality of our drillable inventory and to deliver attractive, fully-burdened returns; balance capital spending with available cash flows to end the year with the same or lower net debt; and maintain our current investment-grade rating. 
I would like to conclude by updating our guidance for the remainder of 2016 and offering a few additional items that may be helpful in light of our switch to successful efforts. As John already noted, after raising production guidance with our first quarter results, our full year production guidance ranges for both North America Onshore and international and offshore remain unchanged. He also reviewed our increased activity levels and noted that we now expect full year capital spending to be at the high end of our $1.4 billion to $1.8 billion range. 
With regard to LOE, following our first quarter results, we reduced our 2016 LOE guidance from $9.50 to $9.25 per BOE. Given the continued excellent progress we have made during the second quarter, but taking into account an expected increase in workover and seasonal maintenance expense, we now expect full year LOE at $8.50 per BOE or lower. 
On G&A costs, we will continue to speak about this in terms of gross spend, regardless of where it shows up in our financial statements. As indicated previously, we are approaching the lower end of our guidance range of $650 million to $700 million. While we continue to focus on our overhead cost structure, our guidance will remain unchanged. 
With the change to successful efforts and recent write-downs of unproved properties, we anticipate expensing a higher percentage of our interest costs going forward. Accordingly, we forecast that approximately 90% of our total interest costs will be expensed in 2016. As noted previously, successful efforts requires the recognition of exploration expense each quarter. Exploration expense includes some items that are planned and predictable and other items that tend to be volatile from quarter-to-quarter. Specifically, drivable costs and unproved property impairments, by their nature, do not lend themselves to guidance. 
Consequently, for the full year 2016, we anticipate exploration expense, in aggregate will be in the range of $250 million to $300 million. This includes actual drivable costs and unproved property impairments through the second quarter that excludes them for the second half of the year. 
Finally, with regard to taxes, as I noted on our call back in February, we anticipate minimal cash taxes will be paid in 2016. 
In conclusion, we are proud of our financial accomplishments over the past 18 months. Our liquidity is strong, our debt levels are under control and we are living within our means. We have completed the transition to successful efforts, which will enhance comparability with our peers and better inform our already rigorous planning and capital allocation processes. We look to the future with great optimism and have set our long-term sights on significantly improving returns on capital employed and generating competitive per-share growth, which will be an outcome of disciplined returns-based investment decisions. 
I will now turn the call over to the operator for Q&A."

So I think on the market today, it's more constructive than it's been, both on oil and natural gas. I mean, I think it got a little bit ahead of itself here the last few months. We've seen it come back as we went back and touched $40. I think we'll see where -- what kind of price band we look at as we get into 2017.

In conjunction with this morning's press release, I hope you have had the opportunity to review our second quarter financial and operational supplement. As discussed in our press release yesterday, Apache announced that during the second quarter of 2016, the company voluntarily changed its method of accounting for oil and gas exploration and development activities from the full-cost to the successful-efforts method. All numbers discussed today will be stated under successful-efforts, unless otherwise noted. 
Please note, the following documents will be available after the close of business today. Our second quarter 10-Q filing; Form 8-K filings that include certain financial information from Apache's 2015 Form 10-K and first quarter 2016 Form 10-Q recasts to reflect the retrospective application of the successful-efforts method; and a successful-efforts conversion PDF presentation, which contains additional detailed information regarding the impact of this accounting change. Please reference our Investor Relations website at investor.apachecorp.com to access these documents. 
I'd like to remind everyone that today's discussions will contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions based on our current views and reasonable expectations. However, a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discuss today. A full disclaimer is located with the supplemental data on our website.

Apache continues to make great progress in all aspects of our business, as demonstrated by the strength of our second quarter results. Before we get into the details, I would like to start off by highlightin",2467,"Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. Apache continues to make great progress in all aspects of our business, as demonstrated by the strength of our second quarter results. 
Before we get into the details, I would like to start off by highlighting a few important takeaways from today's call. First, we delivered another solid quarter of adjusted earnings and operating cash flow. This underscores the significant progress we have made on costs and the resilience of our portfolio in a low-price and low-reinvestment environment.
Second, we have been working all aspects of our cost structure for more than 18 months. Last year, the majority of our cost savings came from G&A reductions and capital efficiencies. While these costs continue to improve, we are now seeing most of our significant savings coming from LOE. 
Third, production volumes continue to hold up well and track in line with the increased guidance range we provided last quarter. Our production expectations for the full year remain unchanged. 
Finally, with our cost structure better synchronized with the lower oil price environment and with the potential for prices to exceed our $35 budget for the year, we can see a path to more normalized investment levels. Our conservative budgeting approach, coupled with incremental cash flow in the second quarter, now gives us the optionality to increase investment activity. Any incremental investment will continued to be made within the construct of our rigorous capital allocation process and within operating cash flow. 
Now I will turn to our second quarter results, focusing first on the positive results we're realizing from our cost-cutting initiatives. Apache continues to drive significant reductions to its cost structure. After an impressive first quarter, our lease operating expenses were down even further in the second quarter. 
Our operational teams have done an exceptional job attacking every aspect of LOE. For example, we have renegotiated power, chemical and water handling contracts, in some cases, locking in very attractive pricing for the long term. We have also significantly lowered our third-party contractor costs in the field, as we further leverage the capabilities of our field personnel. 
On the G&A front, while most of the heavy lifting was done last year, we continued to identify additional opportunities to align overhead costs with projected activity levels. Importantly, we have retained the capacity to support much higher investment, so we do not anticipate these costs to revert. 
On the capital side, last quarter, I noted an impressive decrease in our average well costs, which were down cumulatively about 45% compared to 2014.
While we are seeing the rate of service price reductions begin to flatten out, we continue to find opportunities for overall well cost improvements. 
As we transition from strategic testing to development drilling operations, we will realize additional efficiencies and cost savings. For example, we will increase pad drilling operations, thereby enabling more efficient batch drilling and completions. We will draw longer laterals and reduce the number of future wellbores and associated costs. We will increase our utilization of rotary steerables, enabling better landing zone targeting and faster penetration rates. In addition, most of our rigs currently working in North America and the North Sea were contracted prior to 2015 at very high day rates. Consequently, we anticipate our average rig rates will decline in the future. 
Moving on to production for the quarter. As noted in this morning's press release, Apache's global pro forma production was 461,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, consisting of 282,000 BOEs per day in North America Onshore and 179,000 BOE per day in international and offshore. North American onshore production declined roughly 16,000 BOEs per day from the first quarter. We only placed 20 new gross operated wells on production in North America during the second quarter, so these declines were expected. Notably, less than 5,600 BOEs per day of this decline was in the Permian, where Apache currently generates its highest North American margins. 
As set forth in our quarterly supplement, Apache's cash margins in the Permian averaged approximately $17 per BOE in the second quarter, which is more than double of those in the rest of North America. Consequently, most of the volume reduction in North America had relatively little impact on our earnings and cash flow. 
Our Permian Region produced 165,000 BOEs per day in the second quarter or nearly 60% of Apache's total North American onshore production. In the Delaware Basin, we placed only 2 gross operated wells on production, both of which targeted the Third Bone Spring formation in the Pecos Bend area. One very notable well, which we mentioned in last quarter's call, was the Blue Jay unit 103H. This well was  placed on production in April and achieved an exceptional 30-day average rate of nearly 3,200 barrels of oil equivalent per day from a lateral length of approximately 5,100 feet. In fact, in its first 90 days on production, the oil component alone of this well was 147,000 barrels, making it Apache's best well to date in the Delaware Basin. 
In our Waha area of the Delaware Basin, through drilling longer laterals and taking advantage of natural fracture systems, we continued to enhance production rates. This has significantly improved the economics at Waha and reduced our breakeven oil price. An example of our recent success is the 905 H well, which we placed on production just after the end of the second quarter. This well achieved a peak 24-hour IP rate of approximately 1,750 barrels of oil equivalent. As a result of our technical progress, we now have an expanding inventory of attractive locations at Waha in both the Wolfcamp A and Third Bone Spring formations. 
To sum up our opportunity in the Delaware Basin, in the Pecos Bend and Waha areas alone, we can support a multi-rig drilling program for several years. In the Midland Basin, Central Basin Platform and Northwest Shelf, we placed a combined 16 gross operated wells on production, which is down from 25 wells in the first quarter. During the second quarter, we brought online 2 Wolfcamp B wells, the Connell 38B 2HM and 38C 2HM, each of which achieved a 30-day average rate of more than 1,300 barrels of oil equivalent per day from 1-mile laterals. 
Subsequent to quarter-end, we placed another strong Wolfcamp B well, the CC 4144 East 2HM on production at a peak 24-hour IP rate of approximately 2,200 BOEs per day. Much of our testing in the Wolfcamp involves completions and landing zone optimization. The improvements we are making as demonstrated about these wells, will significantly enhance our Wolfcamp program going forward. 
Also in the Midland Basin, we look forward to bringing on 3 Lower Spraberry shell wells in the second half of this year, where we have significant running room and anticipate very compelling economics. 
Finally, on the Northwest Shelf, we placed 9 horizontal Yeso wells on production during the quarter and continued to generate very good production rates and economics from this play. One noteworthy well, the Hummingbird #7 produced a 30-day average rate of 734 BOEs per day. As a reminder, our well costs in the Yeso play are very low, typically around $2.5 million. 
To sum up the Permian, Apache has made great strides during the downturn to improve every aspect of our business. Reduced drilling days, better landing zone targeting, optimized fracs and many other efficiencies have all contributed to expanding our economic drilling opportunities. We look forward to continued improvements, which will fully leverage the upside potential of our vast acreage position. 
Outside of the Permian, Apache had no active drilling rigs in North America and placed on production only 2 other operated wells, both of which were in the Woodford-SCOOP. We have limited activity planned in the SCOOP for the remainder of the year. However, Apache's 50,000-plus net acres in the play will underpin a profitable 2- or 3-rig drilling program for many years to come. 
Despite our lower level of reinvestment, we are making great progress in North America. As I mentioned at the beginning of the call, our North American Onshore production guidance is tracking in line with our previous 2016 guidance range of 268,000 to 278,000 BOEs per day. 
On the international and offshore side, pro forma production for the quarter was 179,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, consisting of approximately 101,000 BOEs from Egypt, 71,000 BOEs from the North Sea and 7,000 BOEs from the Gulf of Mexico. 
In Egypt, gross production of 350,000 BOEs per day was down modestly compared to the first quarter due primarily to outages at a third-party gas plant. On a net basis, pro forma volumes declined sequentially by 2,800 BOEs per day, primarily due to the impact of improving Brent oil prices on the cost recovery mechanisms in our production sharing contracts. Apache placed 14 wells on production in Egypt during the second quarter and achieved a drilling success rate of 93%. 
In the North Sea, production was approximately 71,000 BOEs per day during the second quarter, up slightly from the first quarter. This was primarily the result of a few strong development wells brought into production around the end of the first quarter and improved operational uptime, which more than offset the underlying base decline. 
Apache drilled 2 very notable development wells in the quarter, the BCR B81 in the Beryl field was placed on production in late June and achieved a peak 24-hour IP rate of 55 million cubic feet of gas equivalent per day. The LP7 well was also placed on production in June at a peak 24-hour IP rate of 46 million cubic feet of gas equivalent per day. 
Looking ahead to the third quarter, we anticipate North Sea production will be up modestly from the second quarter. The benefit of BCR and LP7 will be mostly offset by seasonal maintenance downtime. At our Aviat project in the Forties Field, we have now completed and tied in the first well. As you will recall, Aviat enables a switch from diesel to natural gas as our primary source of power for the Forties field. This is an environmentally friendly project that will extend the economic life of Forties and reduce certain safety, cost and reliability risks associated with bunkering diesel to our platforms. 
As highlighted in our November 2015 North Sea webcast, we are drilling 2 exploration prospects in the second half of 2016, Storr and Kinord. Both prospects offer low cost tieback opportunities to our existing barrel infrastructure and have material reserve potential. We expect to have results for both before year-end. 
Since we have received many questions lately on Suriname, let me provide a brief update. On Block 53, we have completed an extensive geologic and 3D geophysical review and prioritized a number of attractive prospects. We anticipate drilling our next exploratory well on the block in 2017. A drill ship has been contracted, and preparations are underway. 
On Block 58, a 3D seismic shoot is in progress, and we will have an early look by the end of the year and have a fully processed data package in 2017. 
To sum up international and offshore, while activity was limited, we had very good development results in both Egypt and the North Sea during the second quarter. We remain on track to produce between 170,000 and 180,000 BOEs per day on a pro forma basis for the full year 2016. Both Egypt and the North Sea generated positive free cash flow in the first half of 2016, and we anticipate they will continue to do so for the remainder of the year. 
We are excited about the future exploration potential in our international and offshore portfolio and look forward to providing more details in the future. 
Now for a look into the second half of 2016 and our updated view on full year capital guidance. As we mentioned in last quarter's call, our top priorities for incremental capital in 2016 are to: increase investment activity in the Permian, keep 2 platform rigs operational in the North Sea and to accelerate strategic testing initiatives across the portfolio. We have now initiated action on all of these priorities. 
In the Midland Basin, we added a second rig in late July that will focus on Lower Spraberry and Wolfcamp B targets through the remainder of the year. In the North Sea, our 2 platform rigs will remain manned and focused on workovers and development drilling. Additionally, a considerable portion of our incremental capital will be directed toward accelerating strategic testing initiatives and will have minimal impact on 2016 production. As a result of the increased activity I just described, we now expect our 2016 North American capital spend to be at the high end of our $1.4 billion to $1.8 billion guidance. Importantly, we will not lose our capital discipline as activity increases, and we will continue to target unchanged or lower net debt at year-end, irrespective of changes in commodity price. 
Our incremental 2016 spending will have minimal impact on average 2016 production. However, this increased investment will help to stem our production decline and build momentum as we enter 2017. 
In closing, Apache has benefited from deliberate decisions to budget conservatively and to position the company for stability and success in a lower-priced environment. We have streamlined our asset base, significantly reduced our cost structure and allocated a considerable percentage of our resources to strategic testing initiatives. Despite more than an 85% reduction in capital investments since 2014, we have high graded our drilling inventory and substantially increased our opportunity set. I can say with confidence that despite the industry downturn, Apache has far more potential than we did just 18 months ago. 
We have protected our balance sheet and chosen to invest within our cash flows while maintaining our dividend and avoiding equity issuances. This approach has paid off as we have maintained our investment-grade credit rating and reduced our net debt level by 38% since early 2015. 
Going forward, our budgeting approach will remain conservative and methodical. We will continue to manage oil and gas price volatility by setting a reasonable expected price band and gearing our capital spending, returns targets and capital structure to the lower end of that band. Should realized prices come in higher, we will maintain the planning capability and operational flexibility to respond accordingly. This will help to ensure we generate the best possible returns on our drilling programs and maintain a strong financial position through the cycle. 
In the second half of 2016, our primary goals remain unchanged. We will live within our means, maintain our strong financial position, continue to build high-quality development inventory for the future and invest to improve long-term returns and create shareholder value. 
I will now turn the call over to Steve Riney."

I will begin with Apache's switch from the full-cost accounting method to successful-efforts. I will lay out the rationale for the change and outline the primary differences between the 2 methodologies. Next, I will review our second quarter 2016 financial results as reported under successful-efforts. I will contrast these with results that would have been reported under full-costs. Please note that our quarterly financial and operational supplement contains a slide that compares key second quarter line items under successful-efforts to the same items under full-cost. I encourage you to review these comparisons to better understand the impact of the accounting change on our second quarter results. 
The full-cost results outlined in the supplement are probably more comparable with analyst estimates for the quarter and should compare favorably to most expectations. Following that, I will review Apache's primary financial objectives for the remainder of 2016. And finally, I will update and expand our 2016 guidance. Our guidance will now be based on 2016 anticipated results under successful-efforts. 
So let's begin with a discussion of our switch to the successful-efforts accounting methodology. As many of you are aware, Apache has been evaluating a switch to successful-efforts for several quarters. We have now effected that transition with our second quarter 2016 results. We decided to proceed with the change for two primary reasons; first, successful-efforts provides for a better matching of costs incurred with the period in which they impact financial results. This is primarily accomplished through the recognition of exploration expense. Under full-cost accounting, more costs tend to be capitalized under the balance sheet and then depreciated over time. During periods of sustained low oil and gas prices, this typically results in significant ceiling test write-downs, as Apache experienced over the last 18 months. Successful-efforts generally results in lower reported earnings and operating cash flows in the near term, but in the long run, the balance sheet and earnings are less impacted by commodity price volatility. Second, successful-full efforts is generally preferred by the investment community and is more commonly used by the vast majority of E&P companies, 9 out of 11 companies in what we often refer to as our peer group, currently utilize successful-efforts. So this transition allows for more easily understood and more comparable financial results for Apache. 
Now let me touch briefly on the changes you will see under successful-efforts. As I just indicated, one of the primary differences is that under successful-efforts, we will report exploration expense. Exploration expense includes four significant categories of costs; first, it includes exploration-related seismic costs, which are differentiated from capitalized development-related seismic costs. Note both exploration and development seismic activity are common at Apache; second, it includes exploration-related G&A costs; third, exploration expense includes lease rentals and the cost of any expired or surrendered leases associated with unproved acreage; and finally, dry hole costs, which will be expensed in the quarter in which an exploratory well is deemed to be uneconomic. Note, successful exploratory wells will be capitalized. Changes resulting from the recognition of exploration expense will have the following impacts on our reported financial results: On the income statement, results in the near term will appear lower under successful-efforts due to the immediate recognition of exploration expense. For the second quarter of 2016, we recognized $91 million in exploration expense under successful-efforts. These costs would have been capitalized under full-cost.
On the cash flow statement, net cash from operating activities results will be lower under successful-efforts due to the exploration expense impact on net income. While the noncash portion of exploration expense is added back to arrive at operating cash flow, the cash portion will remain as a reduction. There will be an equal and offsetting reduction in cash used in investing activities since these costs will no longer be capitalized. For the second quarter of 2016, the result was $37 million reduction in reported operating cash flow and in cash used in investment activities. Net cash flow, of course, was the same under both methodologies. On the balance sheet, exploration expense results in less capitalized costs and, therefore, a lower carrying value for unproved property. The impact of the second quarter exploration expense resulted in a lower carrying value for unproved properties of $22 million. In the long run, exploration successes will transition to proved property with a lower carrying value, resulting in lower DD&A. At the end of my discussion, I will offer guidance on expected exploration expense for 2016. 
There are other differences between successful efforts and full cost accounting such as capitalization of interest costs, impairment calculations, reporting of gain or loss on sales and the treatment of assets held for sale. We don't have enough time to review all of those on this call. Accordingly, we will post a slide deck on our website at the end of the day that contains a more extensive comparison of full-cost and successful-efforts accounting methodologies as they relate to our financial reporting. Please feel free to reach out to Gary and his team with any questions as you work through the impacts of this change. 
You will see that we have included in the supplement a summary of the impacts of the switch to successful-efforts on our second quarter reported results. It details what I have outlined today as well as a few other items, the most significant of which is the cumulative historical impact on Apache's balance sheet. The balance sheet now reflects the aggregate effect of successful-efforts accounting from a historical perspective. You will note in particular that retained earnings has increased by $5.3 billion as of the end of the first quarter. This is the cumulative effect of many items, the most significant of which are: the recognition of past exploration expense, which reduces retained earnings by $8 billion; changes in past DD&A, ceiling test write-downs and asset impairment charges, which increases retained earnings by $14.9 billion; changes to past reported gains or losses on asset sales that decreased retained earnings by $1 billion; and various other items, including adjustments to capitalized interest and changes in tax valuation allowances, which decreased retained earnings by $640 million. 
So let's now switch to our successful efforts-based financial results for the second quarter as announced in this morning's press release. Apache reported a second quarter GAAP loss of $244 million or $0.65 per common share. These results include a number of items outside of core earnings that are typically excluded by the investment community in their published earnings estimates. In the second quarter, items generally not considered part of core earnings totaled $145 million after tax. Apache's loss for the quarter, when adjusted for these items, was $99 million or $0.26 per share. Under full-cost accounting, our adjusted earnings would have been a profit of $0.05 per share. Since market expectations for the quarter assumed full-cost accounting, we believe this is a more comparable basis for assessing our results. 
During the second quarter, we generated cash from operating activities of $744 million, a substantial increase from our first quarter result. Improved commodity prices, disciplined cost control and a release of cash from working capital drove this improvement. Under full-cost accounting, cash from operating activities would have been $781 million. 
Apache ended the quarter with $1.2 billion in cash on hand. This is an increase of approximately $200 million from the end of the first quarter. After consuming cash in the first quarter, we are now rebuilding our cash position back toward the $1.5 billion we had to start the year. This is consistent with our goal to end 2016 with the same or lower net debt than we began the year with. 
Turning to costs. Lease operating expenses in the second quarter were $7.38 per barrel of oil equivalent, down 4% from the first quarter, following a significant quarter-on-quarter reduction from the fourth quarter of 2015. We continue to focus aggressively on all forms of cost reduction, and LOE has shown a tremendous response to that focus so far in 2016. That said, our expectation is that LOE per barrel of oil equivalent will increase in the second half of 2016 due to the timing of workover activity and seasonal maintenance. 
On the G&A side, costs continued to decline as we aligned our overhead cost structure with anticipated future capital spending levels. As you will recall, for the purposes of monitoring progress made on our G&A costs, we define G&A as our gross overhead cash costs. This excludes incentive compensation as well as G&A cost recoveries from our partners. These 2 items tend to offset one another but will vary from year-to-year. Our goal for 2016 was to reduce these costs to a range of $650 million to $700 million. We are currently tracking at the low end of this range. G&A costs have historically been incurred, such that 45% was capitalized, 20% went to LOE and 35% was expensed. With significant changes to our G&A cost structure and elements of G&A now being recorded as exploration expense, you should expect, going forward, that G&A costs will track more closely to 25% being capitalized, 15% to LOE, 10% to exploration expense and 50% recorded as G&A on the income statement. Actual results will, of course, differ and will reflect quarterly fluctuations in the timing of costs, but this is a good general allocation to use on an annual basis. 
Apache's DD&A in the second quarter under successful-efforts was $13.75 per barrel of oil equivalent. This is a modest increase relative to the first quarter as reported under full-cost. This increase in the D&A is primarily attributable to an increase in the carrying value of our oil and gas properties resulting from the switch to successful-efforts. 
Next I would like to turn to our key financial objectives for the remainder of 2016. Apache has worked hard to build a strong financial position, and we like where we stand. We have a strong liquidity position with $1.2 billion of cash and $3.5 billion of available credit facilities. We have a very reasonable level of debt, and we have maintained our investment-grade rating through the downturn. Equally important, we are running the business to be cash flow neutral at $35 oil. That being the case, we now have the possibility of higher cash flow in 2016 to the extent oil price averages above $35. We are in a unique position where we could fund an increase in capital investment with cash from operations. As always, incremental capital spending will be subject to a rigorous focus on long-term, full-cycle rates of return. 
With this context, our key financial objectives for the second half of 2016 are to: continue to focus on cost management in all aspects of the business. We have accomplished a lot, but there's always more to do. Allocate capital resources to the very best projects to enhance the quality of our drillable inventory and to deliver attractive, fully-burdened returns; balance capital spending with available cash flows to end the year with the same or lower net debt; and maintain our current investment-grade rating. 
I would like to conclude by updating our guidance for the remainder of 2016 and offering a few additional items that may be helpful in light of our switch to successful-efforts. As John already noted, after raising production guidance with our first quarter results, our full year production guidance ranges for both North America Onshore and international and offshore remain unchanged. He also reviewed our increased activity levels and noted that we now expect full year capital spending to be at the high end of our $1.4 billion to $1.8 billion range. 
With regard to LOE, following our first quarter results, we reduced our 2016 LOE guidance from $9.50 to $9.25 per BOE. Given the continued excellent progress we have made during the second quarter, but taking into account an expected increase in workover and seasonal maintenance expense, we now expect full year LOE at $8.50 per BOE or lower. 
On G&A costs, we will continue to speak about this in terms of gross spend, regardless of where it shows up in our financial statements. As indicated previously, we are approaching the lower end of our guidance range of $650 million to $700 million. While we continue to focus on our overhead cost structure, our guidance will remain unchanged. 
With the change to successful-efforts and recent write-downs of unproved properties, we anticipate expensing a higher percentage of our interest costs going forward. Accordingly, we forecast that approximately 90% of our total interest costs will be expensed in 2016. As noted previously, successful-efforts requires the recognition of exploration expense each quarter. Exploration expense includes some items that are planned and predictable and other items that tend to be volatile from quarter-to-quarter. Specifically, dry hole costs and unproved property impairments, by their nature, do not lend themselves to guidance. 
Consequently, for the full year 2016, we anticipate exploration expense, in aggregate will be in the range of $250 million to $300 million. This includes actual dry hole costs and unproved property impairments through the second quarter that excludes them for the second half of the year. 
Finally, with regard to taxes, as I noted on our call back in February, we anticipate minimal cash taxes will be paid in 2016. 
In conclusion, we are proud of our financial accomplishments over the past 18 months. Our liquidity is strong, our debt levels are under control and we are living within our means. We have completed the transition to successful-efforts, which will enhance comparability with our peers and better inform our already rigorous planning and capital allocation processes. We look to the future with great optimism and have set our long-term sights on significantly improving returns on capital employed and generating competitive per-share growth, which will be an outcome of disciplined returns-based investment decisions. 
I will now turn the call over to the operator for Q&A."

So our capital efficiency is actually, we continue to surprise ourselves with the progress we're making on the capital efficiency side.

In conjunction with this morning's press release, I hope you have had the opportunity to review our second quarter financial and operational supplement. As discussed in our press release yesterday, Apache announced that during the second quarter of 2016, the company voluntarily changed its method of accounting for oil and gas exploration and development activities from the full-cost to the successful-efforts method. All numbers discussed today will be stated under successful-efforts, unless otherwise noted. 
Please note, the following documents will be available after the close of business today. Our second quarter 10-Q filing; Form 8-K filings that include certain financial information from Apache's 2015 Form 10-K and first quarter 2016 Form 10-Q recasts to reflect the retrospective application of the successful-efforts method; and a successful-efforts conversion PDF presentation, which contains additional detailed information regarding the impact of this accounting change. Please reference our Investor Relations website at investor.apachecorp.com to access these documents. 
I'd like to remind everyone that today's discussions will contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions based on our current views and reasonable expectations. However, a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discuss today. A full disclaimer is located with the supplemental data on our website.

Apache continues to make great progress in all aspects of our business, as demonstrated by the strength of our second quarter results. 
Before we get into the details, I would like to start off by highlighting a few important takeaways from today's call. First, we delivered another solid quarter of adjusted earnings and operating cash flow. This underscores the significant progress we have made on costs and the resilience of our portfolio in a low-price and low-reinvestment environment.
Second, we have been working all aspects of our cost structure for more than 18 months. Last year, the majority of our cost savings came from G&A reductions and capital efficiencies. While these costs continue to improve, we are now seeing most of our significant savings coming from LOE. 
Third, production volumes continue to hold up well and track in line with the increased guidance range we provided last quarter. Our production expectations for the full year remain unchanged. 
Finally, with our cost structure better synchronized with the lower oil price environment and with the potential for prices to exceed our $35 budget for the year, we can see a path to more normalized investment levels. Our conservative budgeting approach, coupled with incremental cash flow in the second quarter, now gives us the optionality to increase investment activity. Any incremental investment will continued to be made within the construct of our rigorous capital allocation process and within operating cash flow. 
Now I will turn to our second quarter results, focusing first on the positive results we're realizing from our cost-cutting initiatives. Apache continues to drive significant reductions to its cost structure. After an impressive first quarter, our lease operating expenses were down even further in the second quarter. 
Our operational teams have done an exceptional job attacking every aspect of LOE. For example, we have renegotiated power, chemical and water handling contracts, in some cases, locking in very attractive pricing for the long term. We have also significantly lowered our third-party contractor costs in the field, as we further leverage the capabilities of our field personnel. 
On the G&A front, while most of the heavy lifting was done last year, we continued to identify additional opportunities to align overhead costs with projected activity levels. Importantly, we have retained the capacity to support much higher investment, so we do not anticipate these costs to revert. 
On the capital side, last quarter, I noted an impressive decrease in our average well costs, which were down cumulatively about 45% compared to 2014.
While we are seeing the rate of service price reductions begin to flatten out, we continue to find opportunities for overall well cost improvements. 
As we transition from strategic testing to development drilling operations, we will realize additional efficiencies and cost savings. For example, we will increase pad drilling operations, thereby enabling more efficient batch drilling and completions. We will draw longer laterals and reduce the number of future wellbores and associated costs. We will increase our utilization of rotary steerables, enabling better landing zone targeting and faster penetration rates. In addition, most of our rigs currently working in North America and the North Sea were contracted prior to 2015 at very high day rates. Consequently, we anticipate our average rig rates will decline in the future. 
Moving on to production for the quarter. As noted in this morning's press release, Apache's global pro forma production was 461,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, consisting of 282,000 BOEs per day in North America Onshore and 179,000 BOE per day in international and offshore. North American onshore production declined roughly 16,000 BOEs per day from the first quarter. We only placed 20 new gross operated wells on production in North America during the second quarter, so these declines were expected. Notably, less than 5,600 BOEs per day of this decline was in the Permian, where Apache currently generates its highest North American margins. 
As set forth in our quarterly supplement, Apache's cash margins in the Permian averaged approximately $17 per BOE in the second quarter, which is more than double of those in the rest of North America. Consequently, most of the volume reduction in North America had relatively little impact on our earnings and cash flow. 
Our Permian Region produced 165,000 BOEs per day in the second quarter or nearly 60% of Apache's total North American onshore production. In the Delaware Basin, we placed only 2 gross operated wells on production, both of which targeted the Third Bone Spring formation in the Pecos Bend area. One very notable well, which we mentioned in last quarter's call, was the Blue Jay unit 103H. This well was  placed on production in April and achieved an exceptional 30-day average rate of nearly 3,200 barrels of oil equivalent per day from a lateral length of approximately 5,100 feet. In fact, in its first 90 days on production, the oil component alone of this well was 147,000 barrels, making it Apache's best well to date in the Delaware Basin. 
In our Waha area of the Delaware Basin, through drilling longer laterals and taking advantage of natural fracture systems, we continued to enhance production rates. This has significantly improved the economics at Waha and reduced our breakeven oil price. An example of our recent success is the 905 H well, which we placed on production just after the end of the second quarter. This well achieved a peak 24-hour IP rate of approximately 1,750 barrels of oil equivalent. As a result of our technical progress, we now have an expanding inventory of attractive locations at Waha in both the Wolfcamp A and Third Bone Spring formations. 
To sum up our opportunity in the Delaware Basin, in the Pecos Bend and Waha areas alone, we can support a multi-rig drilling program for several years. In the Midland Basin, Central Basin Platform and Northwest Shelf, we placed a combined 16 gross operated wells on production, which is down from 25 wells in the first quarter. During the second quarter, we brought online 2 Wolfcamp B wells, the Connell 38B 2HM and 38C 2HM, each of which achieved a 30-day average rate of more than 1,300 barrels of oil equivalent per day from 1-mile laterals. 
Subsequent to quarter-end, we placed another strong Wolfcamp B well, the CC 4144 East 2HM on production at a peak 24-hour IP rate of approximately 2,200 BOEs per day. Much of our testing in the Wolfcamp involves completions and landing zone optimization. The improvements we are making as demonstrated about these wells, will significantly enhance our Wolfcamp program going forward. 
Also in the Midland Basin, we look forward to bringing on 3 Lower Spraberry shell wells in the second half of this year, where we have significant running room and anticipate very compelling economics. 
Finally, on the Northwest Shelf, we placed 9 horizontal Yeso wells on production during the quarter and continued to generate very good production rates and economics from this play. One noteworthy well, the Hummingbird #7 produced a 30-day average rate of 734 BOEs per day. As a reminder, our well costs in the Yeso play are very low, typically around $2.5 million. 
To sum up the Permian, Apache has made great strides during the downturn to improve every aspect of our business. Reduced drilling days, better landing zone targeting, optimized fracs and many other efficiencies have all contributed to expanding our economic drilling opportunities. We look forward to continued improvements, which will fully leverage the upside potential of our vast acreage position. 
Outside of the Permian, Apache had no active drilling rigs in North America and placed on production only 2 other operated wells, both of which were in the Woodford-SCOOP. We have limited activity planned in the SCOOP for the remainder of the year. However, Apache's 50,000-plus net acres in the play will underpin a profitable 2- or 3-rig drilling program for many years to come. 
Despite our lower level of reinvestment, we are making great progress in North America. As I mentioned at the beginning of the call, our North American Onshore production guidance is tracking in line with our previous 2016 guidance range of 268,000 to 278,000 BOEs per day. 
On the international and offshore side, pro forma production for the quarter was 179,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, consisting of approximately 101,000 BOEs from Egypt, 71,000 BOEs from the North Sea and 7,000 BOEs from the Gulf of Mexico. 
In Egypt, gross production of 350,000 BOEs per day was down modestly compared to the first quarter due primarily to outages at a third-party gas plant. On a net basis, pro forma volumes declined sequentially by 2,800 BOEs per day, primarily due to the impact of improving Brent oil prices on the cost recovery mechanisms in our production sharing contracts. Apache placed 14 wells on production in Egypt during the second quarter and achieved a drilling success rate of 93%. 
In the North Sea, production was approximately 71,000 BOEs per day during the second quarter, up slightly from the first quarter. This was primarily the result of a few strong development wells brought into production around the end of the first quarter and improved operational uptime, which more than offset the underlying base decline. 
Apache drilled 2 very notable development wells in the quarter, the BCR B81 in the Beryl field was placed on production in late June and achieved a peak 24-hour IP rate of 55 million cubic feet of gas equivalent per day. The LP7 well was also placed on production in June at a peak 24-hour IP rate of 46 million cubic feet of gas equivalent per day. 
Looking ahead to the third quarter, we anticipate North Sea production will be up modestly from the second quarter. The benefit of BCR and LP7 will be mostly offset by seasonal maintenance downtime. At our Aviat project in the Forties Field, we have now completed and tied in the first well. As you will recall, Aviat enables a switch from diesel to natural gas as our primary source of power for the Forties field. This is an environmentally friendly project that will extend the economic life of Forties and reduce certain safety, cost and reliability risks associated with bunkering diesel to our platforms. 
As highlighted in our November 2015 North Sea webcast, we are drilling 2 exploration prospects in the second half of 2016, Storr and Kinord. Both prospects offer low cost tieback opportunities to our existing barrel infrastructure and have material reserve potential. We expect to have results for both before year-end. 
Since we have received many questions lately on Suriname, let me provide a brief update. On Block 53, we have completed an extensive geologic and 3D geophysical review and prioritized a number of attractive prospects. We anticipate drilling our next exploratory well on the block in 2017. A drill ship has been contracted, and preparations are underway. 
On Block 58, a 3D seismic shoot is in progress, and we will have an early look by the end of the year and have a fully processed data package in 2017. 
To sum up international and offshore, while activity was limited, we had very good development results in both Egypt and the North Sea during the second quarter. We remain on track to produce between 170,000 and 180,000 BOEs per day on a pro forma basis for the full year 2016. Both Egypt and the North Sea generated positive free cash flow in the first half of 2016, and we anticipate they will continue to do so for the remainder of the year. 
We are excited about the future exploration potential in our international and offshore portfolio and look forward to providing more details in the future. 
Now for a look into the second half of 2016 and our updated view on full year capital guidance. As we mentioned in last quarter's call, our top priorities for incremental capital in 2016 are to: increase investment activity in the Permian, keep 2 platform rigs operational in the North Sea and to accelerate strategic testing initiatives across the portfolio. We have now initiated action on all of these priorities. 
In the Midland Basin, we added a second rig in late July that will focus on Lower Spraberry and Wolfcamp B targets through the remainder of the year. In the North Sea, our 2 platform rigs will remain manned and focused on workovers and development drilling. Additionally, a considerable portion of our incremental capital will be directed toward accelerating strategic testing initiatives and will have minimal impact on 2016 production. As a result of the increased activity I just described, we now expect our 2016 North American capital spend to be at the high end of our $1.4 billion to $1.8 billion guidance. Importantly, we will not lose our capital discipline as activity increases, and we will continue to target unchanged or lower net debt at year-end, irrespective of changes in commodity price. 
Our incremental 2016 spending will have minimal impact on average 2016 production. However, this increased investment will help to stem our production decline and build momentum as we enter 2017. 
In closing, Apache has benefited from deliberate decisions to budget conservatively and to position the company for stability and success in a lower-priced environment. We have streamlined our asset base, significantly reduced our cost structure and allocated a considerable percentage of our resources to strategic testing initiatives. Despite more than an 85% reduction in capital investments since 2014, we have high graded our drilling inventory and substantially increased our opportunity set. I can say with confidence that despite the industry downturn, Apache has far more potential than we did just 18 months ago. 
We have protected our balance sheet and chosen to invest within our cash flows while maintaining our dividend and avoiding equity issuances. This approach has paid off as we have maintained our investment-grade credit rating and reduced our net debt level by 38% since early 2015. 
Going forward, our budgeting approach will remain conservative and methodical. We will continue to manage oil and gas price volatility by setting a reasonable expected price band and gearing our capital spending, returns targets and capital structure to the lower end of that band. Should realized prices come in higher, we will maintain the planning capability and operational flexibility to respond accordingly. This will help to ensure we generate the best possible returns on our drilling programs and maintain a strong financial position through the cycle. 
In the second half of 2016, our primary goals remain unchanged. We will live within our means, maintain our strong financial position, continue to build high-quality development inventory for the future and invest to improve long-term returns and create shareholder value. 
I will now turn the call over to Steve Riney."

I will begin with Apache's switch from the full-cost accounting method to successful-efforts. I will lay out the rationale for the change and outline the primary differences between the 2 methodologies. Next, I will review our second quarter 2016 financial results as reported under successful-efforts. I will contrast these with results that would have been reported under full-costs. Please note that our quarterly financial and operational supplement contains a slide that compares key second quarter line items under successful-efforts to the same items under full-cost. I encourage you to review these comparisons to better understand the impact of the accounting change on our second quarter results. 
The full-cost results outlined in the supplement are probably more comparable with analyst estimates for the quarter and should compare favorably to most expectations. Following that, I will review Apache's primary financial objectives for the remainder of 2016. And finally, I will update and expand our 2016 guidance. Our guidance will now be based on 2016 anticipated results under successful-efforts. 
So let's begin with a discussion of our switch to the successful-efforts accounting methodology. As many of you are aware, Apache has been evaluating a switch to successful-efforts for several quarters. We have now effected that transition with our second quarter 2016 results. We decided to proceed with the change for two primary reasons; first, successful-efforts provides for a better matching of costs incurred with the period in which they impact financial results. This is primarily accomplished through the recognition of exploration expense. Under full-cost accounting, more costs tend to be capitalized under the balance sheet and then depreciated over time. During periods of sustained low oil and gas prices, this typically results in significant ceiling test write-downs, as Apache experienced over the last 18 months. Successful-efforts generally results in lower reported earnings and operating cash flows in the near term, but in the long run, the balance sheet and earnings are less impacted by commodity price volatility. Second, successful-full efforts is generally preferred by the investment community and is more commonly used by the vast majority of E&P companies, 9 out of 11 companies in what we often refer to as our peer group, currently utilize successful-efforts. So this transition allows for more easily understood and more comparable financial results for Apache. 
Now let me touch briefly on the changes you will see under successful-efforts. As I just indicated, one of the primary differences is that under successful-efforts, we will report exploration expense. Exploration expense includes four significant categories of costs; first, it includes exploration-related seismic costs, which are differentiated from capitalized development-related seismic costs. Note both exploration and development seismic activity are common at Apache; second, it includes exploration-related G&A costs; third, exploration expense includes lease rentals and the cost of any expired or surrendered leases associated with unproved acreage; and finally, dry hole costs, which will be expensed in the quarter in which an exploratory well is deemed to be uneconomic. Note, successful exploratory wells will be capitalized. Changes resulting from the recognition of exploration expense will have the following impacts on our reported financial results: On the income statement, results in the near term will appear lower under successful-efforts due to the immediate recognition of exploration expense. For the second quarter of 2016, we recognized $91 million in exploration expense under successful-efforts. These costs would have been capitalized under full-cost.
On the cash flow statement, net cash from operating activities results will be lower under successful-efforts due to the exploration expense impact on net income. While the noncash portion of exploration expense is added back to arrive at operating cash flow, the cash portion will remain as a reduction. There will be an equal and offsetting reduction in cash used in investing activities since these costs will no longer be capitalized. For the second quarter of 2016, the result was $37 million reduction in reported operating cash flow and in cash used in investment activities. Net cash flow, of course, was the same under both methodologies. On the balance sheet, exploration expense results in less capitalized costs and, therefore, a lower carrying value for unproved property. The impact of the second quarter exploration expense resulted in a lower carrying value for unproved properties of $22 million. In the long run, exploration successes will transition to proved property with a lower carrying value, resulting in lower DD&A. At the end of my discussion, I will offer guidance on expected exploration expense for 2016. 
There are other differences between successful efforts and full cost accounting such as capitalization of interest costs, impairment calculations, reporting of gain or loss on sales and the treatment of assets held for sale. We don't have enough time to review all of those on this call. Accordingly, we will post a slide deck on our website at the end of the day that contains a more extensive comparison of full-cost and successful-efforts accounting methodologies as they relate to our financial reporting. Please feel free to reach out to Gary and his team with any questions as you work through the impacts of this change. 
You will see that we have included in the supplement a summary of the impacts of the switch to successful-efforts on our second quarter reported results. It details what I have outlined today as well as a few other items, the most significant of which is the cumulative historical impact on Apache's balance sheet. The balance sheet now reflects the aggregate effect of successful-efforts accounting from a historical perspective. You will note in particular that retained earnings has increased by $5.3 billion as of the end of the first quarter. This is the cumulative effect of many items, the most significant of which are: the recognition of past exploration expense, which reduces retained earnings by $8 billion; changes in past DD&A, ceiling test write-downs and asset impairment charges, which increases retained earnings by $14.9 billion; changes to past reported gains or losses on asset sales that decreased retained earnings by $1 billion; and various other items, including adjustments to capitalized interest and changes in tax valuation allowances, which decreased retained earnings by $640 million. 
So let's now switch to our successful efforts-based financial results for the second quarter as announced in this morning's press release. Apache reported a second quarter GAAP loss of $244 million or $0.65 per common share. These results include a number of items outside of core earnings that are typically excluded by the investment community in their published earnings estimates. In the second quarter, items generally not considered part of core earnings totaled $145 million after tax. Apache's loss for the quarter, when adjusted for these items, was $99 million or $0.26 per share. Under full-cost accounting, our adjusted earnings would have been a profit of $0.05 per share. Since market expectations for the quarter assumed full-cost accounting, we believe this is a more comparable basis for assessing our results. 
During the second quarter, we generated cash from operating activities of $744 million, a substantial increase from our first quarter result. Improved commodity prices, disciplined cost control and a release of cash from working capital drove this improvement. Under full-cost accounting, cash from operating activities would have been $781 million. 
Apache ended the quarter with $1.2 billion in cash on hand. This is an increase of approximately $200 million from the end of the first quarter. After consuming cash in the first quarter, we are now rebuilding our cash position back toward the $1.5 billion we had to start the year. This is consistent with our goal to end 2016 with the same or lower net debt than we began the year with. 
Turning to costs. Lease operating expenses in the second quarter were $7.38 per barrel of oil equivalent, down 4% from the first quarter, following a significant quarter-on-quarter reduction from the fourth quarter of 2015. We continue to focus aggressively on all forms of cost reduction, and LOE has shown a tremendous response to that focus so far in 2016. That said, our expectation is that LOE per barrel of oil equivalent will increase in the second half of 2016 due to the timing of workover activity and seasonal maintenance. 
On the G&A side, costs continued to decline as we aligned our overhead cost structure with anticipated future capital spending levels. As you will recall, for the purposes of monitoring progress made on our G&A costs, we define G&A as our gross overhead cash costs. This excludes incentive compensation as well as G&A cost recoveries from our partners. These 2 items tend to offset one another but will vary from year-to-year. Our goal for 2016 was to reduce these costs to a range of $650 million to $700 million. We are currently tracking at the low end of this range. G&A costs have historically been incurred, such that 45% was capitalized, 20% went to LOE and 35% was expensed. With significant changes to our G&A cost structure and elements of G&A now being recorded as exploration expense, you should expect, going forward, that G&A costs will track more closely to 25% being capitalized, 15% to LOE, 10% to exploration expense and 50% recorded as G&A on the income statement. Actual results will, of course, differ and will reflect quarterly fluctuations in the timing of costs, but this is a good general allocation to use on an annual basis. 
Apache's DD&A in the second quarter under successful-efforts was $13.75 per barrel of oil equivalent. This is a modest increase relative to the first quarter as reported under full-cost. This increase in the D&A is primarily attributable to an increase in the carrying value of our oil and gas properties resulting from the switch to successful-efforts. 
Next I would like to turn to our key financial objectives for the remainder of 2016. Apache has worked hard to build a strong financial position, and we like where we stand. We have a strong liquidity position with $1.2 billion of cash and $3.5 billion of available credit facilities. We have a very reasonable level of debt, and we have maintained our investment-grade rating through the downturn. Equally important, we are running the business to be cash flow neutral at $35 oil. That being the case, we now have the possibility of higher cash flow in 2016 to the extent oil price averages above $35. We are in a unique position where we could fund an increase in capital investment with cash from operations. As always, incremental capital spending will be subject to a rigorous focus on long-term, full-cycle rates of return. 
With this context, our key financial objectives for the second half of 2016 are to: continue to focus on cost management in all aspects of the business. We have accomplished a lot, but there's always more to do. Allocate capital resources to the very best projects to enhance the quality of our drillable inventory and to deliver attractive, fully-burdened returns; balance capital spending with available cash flows to end the year with the same or lower net debt; and maintain our current investment-grade rating. 
I would like to conclude by updating our guidance for the remainder of 2016 and offering a few additional items that may be helpful in light of our switch to successful-efforts. As John already noted, after raising production guidance with our first quarter results, our full year production guidance ranges for both North America Onshore and international and offshore remain unchanged. He also reviewed our increased activity levels and noted that we now expect full year capital spending to be at the high end of our $1.4 billion to $1.8 billion range. 
With regard to LOE, following our first quarter results, we reduced our 2016 LOE guidance from $9.50 to $9.25 per BOE. Given the continued excellent progress we have made during the second quarter, but taking into account an expected increase in workover and seasonal maintenance expense, we now expect full year LOE at $8.50 per BOE or lower. 
On G&A costs, we will continue to speak about this in terms of gross spend, regardless of where it shows up in our financial statements. As indicated previously, we are approaching the lower end of our guidance range of $650 million to $700 million. While we continue to focus on our overhead cost structure, our guidance will remain unchanged. 
With the change to successful-efforts and recent write-downs of unproved properties, we anticipate expensing a higher percentage of our interest costs going forward. Accordingly, we forecast that approximately 90% of our total interest costs will be expensed in 2016. As noted previously, successful-efforts requires the recognition of exploration expense each quarter. Exploration expense includes some items that are planned and predictable and other items that tend to be volatile from quarter-to-quarter. Specifically, dry hole costs and unproved property impairments, by their nature, do not lend themselves to guidance. 
Consequently, for the full year 2016, we anticipate exploration expense, in aggregate will be in the range of $250 million to $300 million. This includes actual dry hole costs and unproved property impairments through the second quarter that excludes them for the second half of the year. 
Finally, with regard to taxes, as I noted on our call back in February, we anticipate minimal cash taxes will be paid in 2016. 
In conclusion, we are proud of our financial accomplishments over the past 18 months. Our liquidity is strong, our debt levels are under control and we are living within our means. We have completed the transition to successful-efforts, which will enhance comparability with our peers and better inform our already rigorous planning and capital allocation processes. We look to the future with great optimism and have set our long-term sights on significantly improving returns on capital employed and generating competitive per-share growth, which will be an outcome of disciplined returns-based investment decisions. 
I will now turn the call over to the operator for Q&A."

In conjunction with this morning's press release, I hope you have had the opportunity to review our second quarter financial and operational supplement. As discussed in our press release yesterday, Apache announced that during the second quarter of 2016, the company voluntarily changed its method of accounting for oil and gas exploration and development activities from the full-cost to the successful-efforts  method. All numbers discussed today will be stated under successful-efforts, unless otherwise noted. 
Please note, the following documents will be available after the close of business today. Our second quarter 10-Q filing; Form 8-K filings that include certain financial information from Apache's 2015 Form 10-K and first quarter 2016 Form 10-Q recasts to reflect the retrospective application of the successful-efforts  method; and a successful-efforts  conversion PDF presentation, which contains additional detailed information regarding the impact of this accounting change. Please reference our Investor Relations website at investor.apachecorp.com to access these documents. 
I'd like to remind everyone that today's discussions will contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions based on our current views and reasonable expectations. However, a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discuss today. A full disclaimer is located with the supplemental data on our website. 
I will now turn the call over to John."

Before we get into the details, I would like to start off by highlightin",2467,"Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. Apache continues to make great progress in all aspects of our business, as demonstrated by the strength of our second quarter results. 
Before we get into the details, I would like to start off by highlighting a few important takeaways from today's call. First, we delivered another solid quarter of adjusted earnings and operating cash flow. This underscores the significant progress we have made on costs and the resilience of our portfolio in a low-price and low-reinvestment environment.
Second, we have been working all aspects of our cost structure for more than 18 months. Last year, the majority of our cost savings came from G&A reductions and capital efficiencies. While these costs continue to improve, we are now seeing most of our significant savings coming from LOE. 
Third, production volumes continue to hold up well and track in line with the increased guidance range we provided last quarter. Our production expectations for the full year remain unchanged. 
Finally, with our cost structure better synchronized with the lower oil price environment and with the potential for prices to exceed our $35 budget for the year, we can see a path to more normalized investment levels. Our conservative budgeting approach, coupled with incremental cash flow in the second quarter, now gives us the optionality to increase investment activity. Any  incremental investment will continue to be made within the construct of our rigorous capital allocation process and within operating cash flow. 
Now I will turn to our second quarter results, focusing first on the positive results we are realizing from our cost-cutting initiatives. Apache continues to drive significant reductions to its cost structure. After an impressive first quarter, our lease operating expenses were down even further in the second quarter. 
Our operational teams have done an exceptional job attacking every aspect of LOE. For example, we have renegotiated power, chemical and water handling contracts, in some cases, locking in very attractive pricing for the long term. We have also significantly lowered our third-party contractor costs in the field, as we further leverage the capabilities of our field personnel. 
On the G&A front, while most of the heavy lifting was done last year, we continued to identify additional opportunities to align overhead costs with projected activity levels. Importantly, we have retained the capacity to support much higher investment, so we do not anticipate these costs to revert. 
On the capital side, last quarter, I noted an impressive decrease in our average well costs, which were down cumulatively about 45% compared to 2014.
While we are seeing the rate of service price reductions begin to flatten out, we continue to find opportunities for overall well cost improvements. 
As we transition from strategic testing to development drilling operations, we will realize additional efficiencies and cost savings. For example, we will increase pad drilling operations, thereby enabling more efficient batch drilling and completions. We will drill longer laterals and reduce the number of future wellbores and associated costs. We will increase our utilization of rotary steerables, enabling better landing zone targeting and faster penetration rates. In addition, most of our rigs currently working in North America and the North Sea were contracted prior to 2015 at very high day rates. Consequently, we anticipate our average rig rates will decline in the future. 
Moving on to production for the quarter. As noted in this morning's press release, Apache's global pro forma production was 461,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, consisting of 282,000 BOEs per day in North America Onshore and 179,000 BOE per day in international and offshore. North American onshore production declined roughly 16,000 BOEs per day from the first quarter. We only placed 20 new gross operated wells on production in North America during the second quarter, so these declines were expected. Notably, less than 5,600 BOEs per day of this decline was in the Permian, where Apache currently generates its highest North American margins. 
As set forth in our quarterly supplement, Apache's cash margins in the Permian averaged approximately $17 per BOE in the second quarter, which is more than double of those in the rest of North America. Consequently, most of the volume reduction in North America had relatively little impact on our earnings and cash flow. 
Our Permian Region produced 165,000 BOEs per day in the second quarter or nearly 60% of Apache's total North American onshore production. In the Delaware Basin, we placed only 2 gross operated wells on production, both of which targeted the Third Bone Spring formation in the Pecos Bend area. One very notable well, which we mentioned in last quarter's call, was the Blue Jay unit 103H. This well was  placed on production in April and achieved an exceptional 30-day average rate of nearly 3,200 barrels of oil equivalent per day from a lateral length of approximately 5,100 feet. In fact, in its first 90 days on production, the oil component alone of this well was 147,000 barrels, making it Apache's best well to date in the Delaware Basin. 
In our Waha area of the Delaware Basin, through drilling longer laterals and taking advantage of natural fracture systems, we continued to enhance production rates. This has significantly improved the economics at Waha and reduced our breakeven oil price. An example of our recent success is the 905H well, which we placed on production just after the end of the second quarter. This well achieved a peak 24-hour IP rate of approximately 1,750 barrels of oil equivalent. As a result of our technical progress, we now have an expanding inventory of attractive locations at Waha in both the Wolfcamp A and Third Bone Spring formations. 
To sum up our opportunity in the Delaware Basin, in the Pecos Bend and Waha areas alone, we can support a multi-rig drilling program for several years. In the Midland Basin, Central Basin Platform and Northwest Shelf, we placed a combined 16 gross operated wells on production, which is down from 25 wells in the first quarter. During the second quarter, we brought online 2 Wolfcamp B wells, the Connell 38B 2HM and 38C 2HM, each of which achieved a 30-day average rate of more than 1,300 barrels of oil equivalent per day from 1-mile laterals. 
Subsequent to quarter-end, we placed another strong Wolfcamp B well, the CC 4144 East 2HM on production at a peak 24-hour IP rate of approximately 2,200 BOEs per day. Much of our testing in the Wolfcamp involves completions and landing zone optimization. The improvements we are making as demonstrated by these wells, will significantly enhance our Wolfcamp program going forward. 
Also in the Midland Basin, we look forward to bringing on 3 Lower Spraberry shale wells in the second half of this year, where we have significant running room and anticipate very compelling economics. 
Finally, on the Northwest Shelf, we placed 9 horizontal Yeso wells on production during the quarter and continued to generate very good production rates and economics from this play. One noteworthy well, the Hummingbird #7 produced a 30-day average rate of 734 BOEs per day. As a reminder, our well costs in the Yeso play are very low, typically around $2.5 million. 
To sum up the Permian, Apache has made great strides during the downturn to improve every aspect of our business. Reduced drilling days, better landing zone targeting, optimized fracs and many other efficiencies have all contributed to expanding our economic drilling opportunities. We look forward to continued improvements, which will fully leverage the upside potential of our vast acreage position. 
Outside of the Permian, Apache had no active drilling rigs in North America and placed on production only 2 other operated wells, both of which were in the Woodford-SCOOP. We have limited activity planned in the SCOOP for the remainder of the year. However, Apache's 50,000-plus net acres in the play will underpin a profitable 2- or 3-rig drilling program for many years to come. 
Despite our low level of reinvestment, we are making great progress in North America. As I mentioned at the beginning of the call, our North American Onshore production guidance is tracking in line with our previous 2016 guidance range of 268,000 to 278,000 BOEs per day. 
On the international and offshore side, pro forma production for the quarter was 179,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, consisting of approximately 101,000 BOEs from Egypt, 71,000 BOEs from the North Sea and 7,000 BOEs from the Gulf of Mexico. 
In Egypt, gross production of 350,000 BOEs per day was down modestly compared to the first quarter due primarily to outages at a third-party gas plant. On a net basis, pro forma volumes declined sequentially by 2,800 BOEs per day, primarily due to the impact of improving Brent oil prices on the cost recovery mechanisms in our production sharing contracts. Apache placed 14 wells on production in Egypt during the second quarter and achieved a drilling success rate of 93%. 
In the North Sea, production was approximately 71,000 BOEs per day during the second quarter, up slightly from the first quarter. This was primarily the result of a few strong development wells brought into production around the end of the first quarter and improved operational uptime, which more than offset the underlying base decline. 
Apache drilled 2 very notable development wells in the quarter: The BCR B81 in the Beryl field was placed on production in late June and achieved a peak 24-hour IP rate of 55 million cubic feet of gas equivalent per day; the LP7 well was also placed on production in June at a peak 24-hour IP rate of 46 million cubic feet of gas equivalent per day. 
Looking ahead to the third quarter, we anticipate North Sea production will be up modestly from the second quarter. The benefit of BCR and LP7 will be mostly offset by seasonal maintenance downtime. At our Aviat project in the Forties Field, we have now completed and tied in the first well. As you will recall, Aviat enables a switch from diesel to natural gas as our primary source of power for the Forties field. This is an environmentally friendly project that will extend the economic life of Forties and reduce certain safety, cost and reliability risks associated with bunkering diesel to our platforms. 
As highlighted in our November 2015 North Sea webcast, we are drilling 2 exploration prospects in the second half of 2016, Storr and Kinord. Both prospects offer low cost tieback opportunities to our existing Beryl infrastructure and have material reserve potential. We expect to have results for both before year-end. 
Since we have received many questions lately on Suriname, let me provide a brief update. On Block 53, we have completed an extensive geologic and 3D geophysical review and prioritized a number of attractive prospects. We anticipate drilling our next exploratory well on the block in 2017. A drill ship has been contracted, and preparations are underway. 
On Block 58, a 3D seismic shoot is in progress, and we will have an early look by the end of the year and have a fully processed data package in 2017. 
To sum up international and offshore, while activity was limited, we had very good development results in both Egypt and the North Sea during the second quarter. We remain on track to produce between 170,000 and 180,000 BOEs per day on a pro forma basis for the full year 2016. Both Egypt and the North Sea generated positive free cash flow in the first half of 2016, and we anticipate they will continue to do so for the remainder of the year. 
We are excited about the future exploration potential in our international and offshore portfolio and look forward to providing more details in the future. 
Now for a look into the second half of 2016 and our updated view on full year capital guidance. As we mentioned in last quarter's call, our top priorities for incremental capital in 2016 are to: increase investment activity in the Permian, keep 2 platform rigs operational in the North Sea and to accelerate strategic testing initiatives across the portfolio. We have now initiated action on all of these priorities. 
In the Midland Basin, we added a second rig in late July that will focus on Lower Spraberry and Wolfcamp B targets through the remainder of the year. In the North Sea, our 2 platform rigs will remain manned and focused on workovers and development drilling. Additionally, a considerable portion of our incremental capital will be directed toward accelerating strategic testing initiatives and will have minimal impact on 2016 production. As a result of the increased activity I just described, we now expect our 2016 North American capital spend to be at the high end of our $1.4 billion to $1.8 billion guidance. Importantly, we will not lose our capital discipline as activity increases, and we will continue to target unchanged or lower net debt at year-end, irrespective of changes in commodity price. 
Our incremental 2016 spending will have minimal impact on average 2016 production. However, this increased investment will help to stem our production decline and build momentum as we enter 2017. 
In closing, Apache has benefited from deliberate decisions to budget conservatively and to position the company for stability and success in a lower-priced environment. We have streamlined our asset base, significantly reduced our cost structure and allocated a considerable percentage of our resources to strategic testing initiatives. Despite more than an 85% reduction in capital investments since 2014, we have high graded our drilling inventory and substantially increased our opportunity set. I can say with confidence that despite the industry downturn, Apache has far more potential than we did just 18 months ago. 
We have protected our balance sheet and chosen to invest within our cash flows while maintaining our dividend and avoiding equity issuances. This approach has paid off as we have maintained our investment-grade credit rating and reduced our net debt level by 38% since early 2015. 
Going forward, our budgeting approach will remain conservative and methodical. We will continue to manage oil and gas price volatility by setting a reasonable expected price band and gearing our capital spending, returns targets and capital structure to the lower end of that band. Should realized prices come in higher, we will maintain the planning capability and operational flexibility to respond accordingly. This will help to ensure  we generate the best possible returns on our drilling programs and maintain a strong financial position through the cycle. 
In the second half of 2016, our primary goals remain unchanged. We will live within our means, maintain our strong financial position, continue to build high-quality development inventory for the future and invest to improve long-term returns and create shareholder value. 
I will now turn the call over to Steve Riney."

I will begin with Apache's switch from the full-cost  accounting method to successful-efforts.  I will lay out the rationale for the change and outline the primary differences between the 2 methodologies. Next, I will review our second quarter 2016 financial results as reported under successful-efforts.  I will contrast these with results that would have been reported under full-costs.  Please note that our quarterly financial and operational supplement contains a slide that compares key second quarter line items under successful-efforts to the same items under full-cost.  I encourage you to review these comparisons to better understand the impact of the accounting change on our second quarter results. 
The full-cost  results outlined in the supplement are probably more comparable with analyst estimates for the quarter and should compare favorably to most expectations. Following that, I will review Apache's primary financial objectives for the remainder of 2016. And finally, I will update and expand our 2016 guidance. Our guidance will now be based on 2016 anticipated results under successful-efforts.  
So let's begin with a discussion of our switch to the successful-efforts  accounting methodology. As many of you are aware, Apache has been evaluating a switch to successful-efforts  for several quarters. We have now effected that transition with our second quarter 2016 results. We decided to proceed with the change for two primary reasons: First, successful-efforts provides for a better matching of costs incurred with the period in which they impact financial results. This is primarily accomplished through the recognition of exploration expense. Under full-cost  accounting, more costs tend to be capitalized under the balance sheet and then depreciated over time. During periods of sustained low oil and gas prices, this typically results in significant ceiling test write-downs, as Apache experienced over the last 18 months. Successful-efforts  generally results in lower reported earnings and operating cash flows in the near term, but in the long run, the balance sheet and earnings are less impacted by commodity price volatility. 
Second, successful efforts is generally preferred by the investment community and is more commonly used by the vast majority of E&P companies, 9 out of 11 companies in what we often refer to as our peer group, currently utilize successful-efforts.  So this transition allows for more easily understood and more comparable financial results for Apache. 
Now let me touch briefly on the changes you will see under successful-efforts.  As I just indicated, one of the primary differences is that under successful-efforts,  we will report exploration expense. Exploration expense includes four significant categories of costs: First, it includes exploration-related seismic costs, which are differentiated from capitalized development-related seismic costs. Note both exploration and development seismic activity are common at Apache; second, it includes exploration-related G&A costs; third, exploration expense includes lease rentals and the cost of any expired or surrendered leases associated with unproved acreage; and finally, dry hole costs, which will be expensed in the quarter in which an exploratory well is deemed to be uneconomic. Note, successful exploratory wells will be capitalized. Changes resulting from the recognition of exploration expense will have the following impacts on our reported financial results: On the income statement, results in the near term will appear lower under successful-efforts  due to the immediate recognition of exploration expense. For the second quarter of 2016, we recognized $91 million in exploration expense under successful-efforts.  These costs would have been capitalized under full-cost.
  
On the cash flow statement, net cash from operating activities results will be lower under successful-efforts  due to the exploration expense impact on net income. While the noncash portion of exploration expense is added back to arrive at operating cash flow, the cash portion will remain as a reduction. There will be an equal and offsetting reduction in cash used in investing activities since these costs will no longer be capitalized. For the second quarter of 2016, the result was $37 million reduction in reported operating cash flow and in cash used in investment activities. Net cash flow, of course, was the same under both methodologies. On the balance sheet, exploration expense results in less capitalized costs and therefore a lower carrying value for unproved property. The impact of the second quarter exploration expense resulted in a lower carrying value for unproved properties of $22 million. In the long run, exploration successes will transition to proved property with a lower carrying value, resulting in lower DD&A. At the end of my discussion, I will offer guidance on expected exploration expense for 2016. 
There are other differences between successful efforts and full cost accounting such as capitalization of interest costs, impairment calculations, reporting of gain or loss on sales and the treatment of assets held for sale. We don't have enough time to review all of those on this call. Accordingly, we will post a slide deck on our website at the end of the day that contains a more extensive comparison of full-cost  and successful-efforts  accounting methodologies as they relate to our financial reporting. Please feel free to reach out to Gary and his team with any questions as you work through the impacts of this change. 
You will see that we have included in the supplement a summary of the impacts of the switch to successful-efforts  on our second quarter reported results. It details what I have outlined today as well as a few other items, the most significant of which is the cumulative historical impact on Apache's balance sheet. The balance sheet now reflects the aggregate effect of successful-efforts  accounting from a historical perspective. You will note in particular that retained earnings has increased by $5.3 billion as of the end of the first quarter. This is the cumulative effect of many items, the most significant of which are: the recognition of past exploration expense, which reduces retained earnings by $8 billion; changes in past DD&A, ceiling test write-downs and asset impairment charges, which increases retained earnings by $14.9 billion; changes to past reported gains or losses on asset sales that decreased retained earnings by $1 billion; and various other items, including adjustments to capitalized interest and changes in tax valuation allowances, which decreased retained earnings by $640 million. 
So let's now switch to our successful efforts-based financial results for the second quarter as announced in this morning's press release. Apache reported a second quarter GAAP loss of $244 million or $0.65 per common share. These results include a number of items outside of core earnings that are typically excluded by the investment community in their published earnings estimates. In the second quarter, items generally not considered part of core earnings totaled $145 million after tax. Apache's loss for the quarter, when adjusted for these items, was $99 million or $0.26 per share. Under full-cost  accounting, our adjusted earnings would have been a profit of $0.05 per share. Since market expectations for the quarter assumed full-cost  accounting, we believe this is a more comparable basis for assessing our results. 
During the second quarter, we generated cash from operating activities of $744 million, a substantial increase from our first quarter result. Improved commodity prices, disciplined cost control and a release of cash from working capital drove this improvement. Under full-cost  accounting, cash from operating activities would have been $781 million. 
Apache ended the quarter with $1.2 billion in cash on hand. This is an increase of approximately $200 million from the end of the first quarter. After consuming cash in the first quarter, we are now rebuilding our cash position back toward the $1.5 billion we had to start the year. This is consistent with our goal to end 2016 with the same or lower net debt than we began the year with. 
Turning to costs. Lease operating expenses in the second quarter were $7.38 per barrel of oil equivalent, down 4% from the first quarter, following a significant quarter-on-quarter reduction from the fourth quarter of 2015. We continue to focus aggressively on all forms of cost reduction, and LOE has shown a tremendous response to that focus so far in 2016. That said, our expectation is that LOE per barrel of oil equivalent will increase in the second half of 2016 due to the timing of workover activity and seasonal maintenance. 
On the G&A side, costs continued to decline as we aligned our overhead cost structure with anticipated future capital spending levels. As you will recall, for the purposes of monitoring progress made on our G&A costs, we define G&A as our gross overhead cash costs. This excludes incentive compensation as well as G&A cost recoveries from our partners. These 2 items tend to offset one another but will vary from year-to-year. Our goal for 2016 was to reduce these costs to a range of $650 million to $700 million. We are currently tracking at the low end of this range. G&A costs have historically been incurred, such that 45% was capitalized, 20% went to LOE and 35% was expensed. With significant changes to our G&A cost structure and elements of G&A now being recorded as exploration expense, you should expect, going forward, that G&A costs will track more closely to 25% being capitalized, 15% to LOE, 10% to exploration expense and 50% recorded as G&A on the income statement. Actual results will of course differ and will reflect quarterly fluctuations in the timing of cost, but this is a good general allocation to use on an annual basis. 
Apache's DD&A in the second quarter under successful-efforts  was $13.75 per barrel of oil equivalent. This is a modest increase relative to the first quarter as reported under full-cost.  This increase in the D&A is primarily attributable to an increase in the carrying value of our oil and gas properties resulting from the switch to successful-efforts.  
Next I would like to turn to our key financial objectives for the remainder of 2016. Apache has worked hard to build a strong financial position, and we like where we stand. We have a strong liquidity position with $1.2 billion of cash and $3.5 billion of available credit facility. We have a very reasonable level of debt, and we have maintained our investment-grade rating through the downturn. Equally important, we are running the business to be cash flow neutral at $35 oil. That being the case, we now have the possibility of higher cash flow in 2016 to the extent oil price averages above $35. We are in a unique position where we could fund an increase in capital investment with cash from operations. As always, incremental capital spending will be subject to a rigorous focus on long-term, full-cycle rates of return. 
With this context, our key financial objectives for the second half of 2016 are to: continue to focus on cost management in all aspects of the business. We have accomplished a lot, but there's always more to do. Allocate capital resources to the very best projects to enhance the quality of our drillable inventory and to deliver attractive, fully burdened returns; balance capital spending with available cash flows to end the year with the same or lower net debt; and maintain our current investment-grade rating. 
I would like to conclude by updating our guidance for the remainder of 2016 and offering a few additional items that may be helpful in light of our switch to successful-efforts.  As John already noted, after raising production guidance with our first quarter results, our full year production guidance ranges for both North America Onshore and international and offshore remain unchanged. He also reviewed our increased activity levels and noted that we now expect full year capital spending to be at the high end of our $1.4 billion to $1.8 billion range. 
With regard to LOE, following our first quarter results, we reduced our 2016 LOE guidance from $9.50 to $9.25 per BOE. Given the continued excellent progress we have made during the second quarter, but taking into account an expected increase in workover and seasonal maintenance expense, we now expect full year LOE at $8.50 per BOE or lower. 
On G&A costs, we will continue to speak about this in terms of gross spend, regardless of where it shows up in our financial statements. As indicated previously, we are approaching the lower end of our guidance range of $650 million to $700 million. While we continue to focus on our overhead cost structure, our guidance will remain unchanged. 
With the change to successful-efforts  and recent write-downs of unproved properties, we anticipate expensing a higher percentage of our interest costs going forward. Accordingly, we forecast that approximately 90% of our total interest costs will be expensed in 2016. As noted previously, successful-efforts  requires the recognition of exploration expense each quarter. Exploration expense includes some items that are planned and predictable and other items that tend to be volatile from quarter-to-quarter. Specifically, dry hole costs and unproved property impairments, by their nature, do not lend themselves to guidance. 
Consequently, for the full year 2016, we anticipate exploration expense, in aggregate will be in the range of $250 million to $300 million. This includes actual dry hole costs and unproved property impairments through the second quarter that excludes them for the second half of the year. 
Finally, with regard to taxes, as I noted on our call back in February, we anticipate minimal cash taxes will be paid in 2016. 
In conclusion, we are proud of our financial accomplishments over the past 18 months. Our liquidity is strong. Our debt levels are under control, and we are living within our means. We have completed the transition to successful-efforts,  which will enhance comparability with our peers and better inform our already rigorous planning and capital allocation processes. We look to the future with great optimism and have set our long-term sights on significantly improving returns on capital employed and generating competitive per-share growth, which will be an outcome of disciplined returns-based investment decisions. 
I will now turn the call over to the operator for Q&A."

They continue to get better. You've seen the progress we're making on the cost structure, the overhead structure, the LOE, the well costs. So our capital efficiency is actually, we continue to surprise ourselves with the progress we're making on the capital efficiency side. And then the other piece is, our base has come down a little bit as we've been less focused on growth and more focused on adjusting cost structure to where we can generate returns. So quite frankly, $45 would have been a pretty comfortable price for us this year, and I think that number would be lower in 2017."

Apache continues to make great progress on the goals we set at the beginning of the year and our recent announcements, and third quarter results underscore this positive performance. On today's call, I will",1882,"Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. 
Apache continues to make great progress on the goals we set at the beginning of the year and our recent announcements, and third quarter results underscore this positive performance. On today's call, I will discuss 4 primary topics. First, I will review the strategy we laid out at the beginning of 2015 that got Apache through the downturn. I will outline how the execution of that strategy has positioned Apache for success in 2017 and beyond. Then I will discuss our capital spending priorities as we look ahead to 2017. Following that, I will review our Permian, Egypt and North Sea regions and then conclude with a discussion of the Alpine High. 
At the start of the downturn, we established some guiding principles that have brought us to where we are today. These were: dramatically reduced development spending until price and costs come into better equilibrium; establish a strong financial position and protect it by living within cash flow; and prepare the portfolio for long-term returns, growth and shareholder value. At the start of 2016, we put forth a very conservative capital budget of $1.6 billion. This spend level was based on a plan to live within cash flow at $35 per barrel of oil. Our capital allocation process reflected the decision to constrain capital investment in North American Onshore development activity. Despite this, our North American Onshore production has performed well in 2016 which is a testament to Apache's greatly improved capital efficiency and the relatively low decline rate of our Permian-anchored production base.
At the beginning of 2016, our planned capital allocation for the Alpine High play was less than $100 million. As the year progressed and cash flow came in above budgeted levels, we elected to invest incremental cash flow in Alpine High rather than chase near-term production growth elsewhere. As a result, we now expect to spend approximately $500 million in Alpine High this year which effectively accounts for the incremental cash flow above our original budget. Our financial and operational discipline has served us well. We plan to end the year with relatively unchanged net debt, and we brought forth a transformational discovery at Alpine High that will drive incremental growth and returns for years to come.
With regard to next year's outlook, in February, on our fourth quarter conference call, we will provide a detailed view of our 2017 capital budget and other guidance items. In the meantime, I thought it would be helpful to provide the following high-level summary of our 2017 investment priorities. 
Our top priority next year is funding the Alpine High. The budget will likely consist of a 4- to 6-rig program and a first wave of midstream buildouts. The near-term pace of spending on Alpine High will be governed by the timing of infrastructure availability as well as a prudent appraisal and delineation program. Our goal in 2017 is to ensure that investment levels do not outpace our comprehensive understanding of the opportunity or our capacity to get product to market.
Our next priority is to increase development activity in our other Permian Basin focus areas. Specifically, we will add 3 rigs in the Midland Basin before year-end 2016, bringing our total rig count to 5. This additional activity, coupled with first gas production from Alpine High, will return the Permian Basin to a strong growth trajectory in the second half of 2017. We will also continue to invest in Egypt and the North Sea at levels designed to sustain production and generate significant free cash flow. 
And lastly, our other exploration projects and North American development opportunities will compete for the remaining available capital. 
Now, turning to the third quarter. As noted in this morning's press release, Apache's adjusted production in the third quarter which excludes tax barrels and our noncontrolling interest in Egypt was approximately 438,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. This is comprised of 270,000 BOEs per day in North America Onshore and 168,000 BOEs per day from the international and offshore. Production in North America Onshore continues to perform well despite minimal development capital. For the full year 2016, we expect North American Onshore production will be in the upper half of our most recent guidance range of 268,000 to 278,000 BOEs per day. 
In the Permian, while we are clearly excited about our Alpine High acreage, we are also positioned for very attractive growth and returns elsewhere in the basin. Our focus on strategic testing during the downturn has yielded excellent results in our core Midland and Delaware Basin acreage where we have expanded and prioritized our inventory of high-return projects. Improved landing zone targeting and new completion designs are delivering strong well performance in both areas. With these improvements and the significant progress we have made on costs, we are confident in bringing growth-oriented capital investment back to the Permian Basin. As such, we have initiated a more aggressive development drilling program in the Midland Basin and will look to expand our rig count further in 2017 if warranted by commodity prices and available cash flow.
Turning briefly to our international and offshore regions. Production for the quarter, excluding tax barrels and our noncontrolling interest in Egypt, was 168,000 BOEs per day, comprising 98,000 BOEs per day from Egypt, 62,000 BOEs from the North Sea and 8,000 BOEs from the Gulf of Mexico. During the quarter, our North Sea operations were impacted by planned and unplanned maintenance downtime as well as third-party facilities downtime. Thus far, we have seen volumes in the fourth quarter rebound to more normalized levels. For the full year 2016, international and offshore production is on track for the midpoint of our 170,000 to 180,000 BOE per day guidance for the year. I am very pleased with the drilling results in our international operations this year. Our exploration and development drilling success rate in Egypt and the North Sea year-to-date is approximately 90%. Apache made another key discovery in the North Sea this quarter at our Storr prospect. We highlighted this prospect in our North Sea investor webcast late last year, and it marks our third consecutive exploration success since acquiring 3D seismic data in the Beryl area. This validates the quality of our 3D seismic data and geologic modeling and gives us higher confidence in the dozens of future exploration prospects we have identified to date. 
Now, I would like to spend a few minutes discussing our Alpine High play. The Alpine High is an immense resource and a transformational discovery for Apache. We have invested a significant amount of human and financial capital through 2 years of extensive geologic and geophysical work, and reservoir and fluid analysis. This was accompanied by concept testing and initial round of verification wells, the results of which we disclosed in early September. We are now engaged in the methodical appraisal and delineation program to confirm the geographic and stratigraphic extent of the play and to formulate our long-term infrastructure plan. This work will continue for the next several quarters before transitioning to an active development program once gas processing and transportation infrastructure is in place. The Alpine High can be broadly characterized as 5 distinct target formations, all of which, we believe, will be highly economic. This includes the Bone Springs and Wolfcamp which are prevalent and productive throughout the Delaware Basin. These hybrid, unconventional plays are the current focus of industry to the North and East of the Alpine High. Two early tests have demonstrated that these formations are oil-productive and offer significant potential at Alpine High. More appraisal drilling in these zones is necessary before we will provide prospective location counts and resource in place estimates. Underlying the Bone Springs and Wolfcamp and unique to the Alpine High is a true resource play in the Pennsylvanian Barnett and Woodford formations. This is a world-class source rock sequence, up to 1,500 feet thick across our acreage position. Based on our appraisal program to date, we anticipate this will become a very large resource play with attractive rates of return and breakeven economics. Together, the Penn, Barnett, Woodford source rock and the 2 hybrid, unconventional zones in the Bone Springs and Wolfcamp are up to 5,000 feet thick across Apache's Alpine High acreage position. Given this extensive vertical column, we anticipate drilling multiple landing zones in each of these formations and ultimately defining several pipe wells in associated location counts. As a reminder, in previous disclosure, we assigned only 1 landing zone to each of the Barnett and the Woodford formations on only a portion of our acreage to arrive at our current 2,000 to 3,000-plus location count. When we announced Alpine High in September, we provided production results from 8 horizontal wells: 6 in the Woodford and 1 each in the Barnett and Bone Springs. The objective of this initial group of wells was only to test the boundaries of specific geologic settings and evaluate certain potential hazards. We made no effort to optimize completions, well orientations or landing zone placement. Despite this, the test wells have continued to perform very well. Since Barclays, we have flow-tested 2 additional wells. The Blackhawk 1H, a normally pressured Woodford well, flowed at a peak 24-hour IP rate of 5.3 million cubic feet of gas, 224 barrels of oil and 245 barrels of NGLs. The Redwood 1H, an overpressured Woodford well, flowed at a peak 24-hour IP rate of 18 million cubic feet of gas. This well was drilled to a vertical depth of nearly 14,000 feet, further confirming our thermal maturity model of the play and the depth limit of the wet gas window. Tim Sullivan will provide more details on our Alpine High wells in his remarks. 
Finally, we have closed several additional acreage transactions over the past 2 months, and our Alpine High position now comprises 320,000 net contiguous acres. Apache identified and captured this position for an average price of $1,300 per acre over a period of approximately 2 years. This very low entry cost gives us an advantage that we believe will translate into very attractive returns on capital employed compared to the alternative of acquiring perspective Delaware acreage at current transaction prices.
To summarize, our near-term drilling objectives at Alpine High include: geographic testing to define geologic settings across our acreage position, stratigraphic testing to collect data from all 5 formations, defining the number of landing zones and the optimal well placement and orientation within each formation, and enhancing completions and testing longer laterals and well spacing to optimize full steel development. At this point, we can say with confidence that the Alpine High contains thousands of predictable, high-return horizontal drilling locations that will drive returns and production growth for many years to come. Importantly, Apache controls a vast majority of the play and we have the ability to establish the pace and scope of development. Our ultimate goal is to optimize value of this extensive resource base for the maximum long-term benefit of our shareholders as well as other stakeholders.
I would now like to turn the call over to Tim Sullivan and Steve Riney who will discuss the company's drilling results, financial performance and midstream plans before coming back for some final remarks ahead of the Q&A session."

My remarks today will be focused on providing more detail around results from our core areas, highlights from specific wells and near-term development plans. 
Our Permian Region produced 159,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the third quarter or nearly 60% of Apache's total North American Onshore production. Production in the Permian Basin decreased by roughly 6,200 BOE per day from the second quarter as the declines were buffered primarily by 13-well tie-ins in our Northwest Shelf Yeso play. In our new Delaware Basin discovery, the Alpine High, we're showing results from 10 wells comprising 8 Woodford, 1 Barnett and 1/3 Bone Spring wells. 
On Page 15 of the operation supplement, we have updated our production curve from the wells we showed at Barclays and have included the 2 most recent wells. As you can see, our Alpine High wells compare favorably with the P50-type curves for the Marcellus, Utica and SCOOP resource plays, with half the wells producing at or above the P50-type curves. Keep in mind, the Alpine High wells are short laterals and have not been normalized for lateral length. Also, the completions and landing zones have not been optimized. These initial wells were drilled as appraisal wells and test of concept and were oftentimes drilled near hazards so that we can better understand the boundaries of the play. Given this, we are excited about the early time performance. We are shutting wells in as we complete testing and will collect pressure buildup data. These wells will be brought back online when we begin selling gas in 2017.
The 2 new Alpine High wells John previously mentioned are both producing from the Woodford formation. The Blackhawk State 1H which was drilled in a normally pressured setting has the highest oil cut in the Woodford among the wells we have drilled to date. The Redwood 1H is the deepest well we have drilled and is our highest gas producer. We have also updated production from the Bone Springs producer, Mont Blanc 2H, which can be seen on Page 17 of the operation supplement. The well, which was a nonoptimized completion with a short lateral, has a cumulative production of greater than 40,000 barrels of oil equivalent over 100 days, and is currently producing 220 barrels of oil and 580 MCF per day with a stable GOR. Also, you can see that the water production has decreased to approximately 275 barrels per day. 
The wells drilled to date have confirmed the unprecedented picture of the vertical dimensions of the play of the Bone Springs to the Woodford across our acreage position, with the hydrocarbon column ranging from oil to wet gas to dry gas, confirming our geologic model. We have seen the range of initial oil cuts in the Woodford from 0 to 20%. The shallower Barnett well has an oil cut of 21%. These yields are in line with our thermal maturity model and can be correlated to depth. The gas is extremely rich, with an average BTU of approximately 1,300. This should provide for an average NGL yield in excess of 100 barrels per million cubic feet of natural gas when permanent facilities are in place. 
As expected in a resource play, Alpine High is becoming more predictable. Every well we've drilled has confirmed our model. In the Pecos Bend area in the Delaware Basin, we placed 7 gross-operated wells on production, all of which targeted the third Bone Springs formation. We continue to see excellent production performance across this play. Our Bluejay unit 103H well continues its strong performance. Using 3-D seismic, we targeted a highly fractured area. The well has produced 427,000 barrels of oil equivalent in just under 7 months, achieving an average rate of roughly 2,260 barrels of oil equivalent per day. This well is currently producing approximately 1,500 barrels of oil equivalent per day, of which 60% is oil. In a less fractured area of the play, we are also able to drill economic wells by utilizing pad drilling operations. On our Falcon State lease, a 6-well pad came online in mid-September with an average 30-day rate of 625 barrels of oil equivalent per day. This pad also demonstrated our best-in-class operational efficiencies in this basin, with an average total well cost of $3.5 million per well. In the Midland Basin, Central Basin Platform and Northwest Shelf, we placed a combined 16 gross-operated wells on production in the quarter. We ran 2 rigs in the third quarter, primarily in the Midland Basin and intend to ramp up to 5 rigs by the end of the year. Activity is focused on stratigraphic landing zone targeting and development pad drilling in the Wolfcamp and Spraberry Shale formations in our Wildfire, Azalea and Powell focus areas. We also expect to bring 20 horizontal wells online over the next few quarters across these 3 areas.
As we stated on our last quarter call, in the third quarter, we brought online the CC 4144 East 2HM producing from the Wolfcamp B formation at Powell. This well continues to show strong performance and has produced 136,000 barrels of oil equivalent in the first 90 days online, an average of more than 1,500 barrels of oil equivalent per day. This well, along with our Connell 38B 2HM and 38C 2HM wells, were drilled with our improved targeting and completion design which we highlighted last quarter. 
Please refer to Page 18 in our operation supplement for a production update of our Midland Basin focus area. Subsequent to quarter end, we brought online the Lynch A 6HM, a Wolfcamp B producer in our Wildfire area in Midland County. This 8,500-foot lateral was completed with 146 frack stages at approximately 60-foot frack spacing, pumping 1,700 pounds per foot of sand. The well is still cleaning up and has not reached peak production but is flowing at a rate of 1,120 barrels of oil and 1.1 million cubic feet of gas per day. In addition to this well, we will be testing one middle Spraberry and 3 lower Spraberry wells on our Wildfire focus area later this month. 
Much of our previous strategic testing in the Wolfcamp and Spraberry involve completions and landing zone optimization. The improvements we are making, as demonstrated by these wells, will significantly enhance our Midland Basin program going forward. 
In the Northwest Shelf, we placed 9 horizontal Yeso wells on production during the quarter and continued to generate very good production rates and economics from this play. The 30-day rate for these 9 wells averaged almost 450 barrels of oil equivalent per day. With our best-in-class drilling and completion costs for these wells, we average less than $2.5 million per well. This program generates extremely favorable economics on a fully burdened basin.
In addition to the 9 horizontal Yeso wells, we also placed 4 vertical Yeso wells on production during the quarter. Outside of the Permian, Apache had no active drilling rigs operating in North America during the quarter. We did, however, test 7 operated wells, all in Canada in our Ante Creek Montney and Wapiti Montney focus areas. Most notably is our 9 of 23 well completed in the lower Montney and our Wapiti area. This well tested at an impressive initial rate of 10.6 million cubic feet of gas per day and approximately 2,000 barrels of condensate per day, with a total estimated completed well cost of $6.2 million. 
We are making great progress in North America even at our low level of reinvestment. We remain focused on returns and are positioning the Permian Basin for a growth trajectory in the second half of 2017.
Moving to international and offshore operations. In Egypt, gross production of 350,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day was up slightly compared to the second quarter. On a net basis, adjusted volumes declined sequentially by 3,000 BOE per day, primarily due to the impact of improving Brent oil prices on cost recovery mechanisms and our production sharing contracts. We continue to benefit from a robust, optimized drilling program, drilling 45 producers and only 5 dry holes, achieving a 90% success rate through the first 3 quarters of 2016.
Apache placed 9 wells on production in Egypt during the third quarter, most notably is the Ptah number 12 producing from the formation with a current peak oil production of over 2,800 barrels of oil per day. Since field discovery in November 2014, the Ptah and Berenice fields have produced a combined 17 million barrels of oil equivalent from only 14 wells and are still producing at a rate of more than 38,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Well costs for this play average only $3.2 million per well.
In the North Sea, third quarter production decreased approximately 8,300 BOE per day due to downtime, resulting from planned maintenance turnarounds and third-party operated facility restrictions that impacted production. This was associated with seasonal turnarounds that occur in this region during the late summer. This deferred some 3Q production into the current period, so we expect 4Q volumes to bounce back to levels we've seen in the first half of the year. 
As John mentioned, we also made a nice discovery at our Storr prospect in the Beryl area, which encountered hydrocarbons and 2 separate fault blocks. The results were in line with regional estimates, and we expect to test more fault blocks at store in the future. 
Apache has a 55% working interest, with Shell holding the remaining 45%.
In late October, we commenced drilling our next rural area prospect, Kinord, which we expect to reach TD by year-end. Please refer to our November 2015 North Sea investor update for more details on Storr, Kinord and other opportunities in the Beryl area. 
I would note annual higher rate development well at the Beryl field among, the Nevis North and NA, which came online mid-September. The 30-day average rate for this well was 20 million cubic feet of natural gas equivalent per day. At our project in the Forties Field, we have now completed and tightened the first well. As you may recall, Aviat enables a switch from diesel to natural gas as our primary source of power for the Forties Field. This is an environmentally friendly project that will extend the economic life of Forties due to lower operating costs and reduced certain safety and reliability of risk associated with bunkering diesel to our platforms. We estimate our annual diesel savings due to this project at $15 million per year. 
Importantly, using natural gas to fuel the Forties Field should enable us to maintain higher and more stable water injection rate, which should in turn result in higher sustained hydrocarbon production from the field. 
In Surinam, we completed our 3-D seismic shoot on Block 58 in September, and we will have preliminary processing results by year-end and a fully processed data set in the third quarter of 2017. 
On the adjacent Block 53, we will commence drilling operations on a commitment well in the first quarter of next year, the [indiscernible] #1. While this is an attractive and sizable exploration prospect, very few wells have been drilled to this step offshore Surinam and as such carries a significant amount of risk. The dry hole cost to Apache for this well is estimated at less than $40 million. 
To sum up international and offshore, while activity was limited, we had very good exploration and development results in both Egypt and the North Sea during the third quarter. We are excited about the future exploration potential in our international and offshore portfolio and look forward to providing more details in the future.
I would now like to turn the call over to Steve."
169838,404454262,1072454,"Apache Corp., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2016",2016-11-03,"Earnings Calls","APA Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Tim, and good afternoon, everyone.

On today's call, I will discuss the following. First, I will review our financial results for the third quarter and provide updated 2016 guidance on selected items. Next, I will provide a few details on our near-term Alpine High infrastructure development activities, which have the primary purpose of achieving first gas sales around mid-2017. Then I will conclude by outlining the framework that we intend to follow as we put together our 2017 capital budget. 
Before I dive into our -- I want to remind everyone that all of our numbers I will review on today's call are now reported under the successful efforts accounting method. For those who would like to compare these results to those under the full cost accounting method we used in the past, please reference the 10-Q that will be filed later today.
As noted in our press release, Apache reported a loss of $607 million or $1.60 per common share. Our results for the quarter include a number of items outside of our core earnings that are typically excluded by the investment community in published earnings estimates. This includes a $355 million impairment of certain proved properties in Canada as a result of downward reserve revisions related to well performance and lower expected net gas realizations. 
In addition, with the reduction of the U.K. Petroleum Revenue Tax, or PRT, to 0% in September, we recognized a charge of $481 million to eliminate the PRT benefit associated with certain future abandonment costs. Despite the apparent negative impacts of the change, in the long term, the reduction in the PRT tax rate will improve our North Sea returns. 
When excluding these and other smaller items, our adjusted loss for the quarter was $12 million or $0.03 per share. In the third quarter, Apache generated $651 million in cash flow from operations. We operated near cash flow neutrality after paying dividends and after increasing capital expenditures in the Alpine High and in our core Midland Basin. As a result, we ended the quarter with $1.2 billion of cash.
Our 2016 CapEx guidance, which we updated in early September, remains unchanged at $2 billion. And we still intend to end the year with unchanged or lower net debt. A combination of asset disposal proceeds and a significant U.S. tax refund, both anticipated in the fourth quarter, should enable us to achieve our targeted cash balance of $1.5 billion at year-end.
Turning to costs. Lease operating costs in the third quarter were $7.94 per barrel of oil equivalent, approximately 10% lower than the same period last year. As previously guided, LOE per barrel of oil equivalent increased from the second quarter due to higher seasonal maintenance activity and increased work over expenses. While we expect LOE per BOE to trend a little higher in the fourth quarter, we are again revising our full year 2016 guidance down to less than $8 per barrel of oil equivalent. This just reinforces the tremendous progress we have made on costs this year.
On the G&A side, our gross overhead spend, which we've defined on previous calls, continues to track toward the lower end of our 2016 guidance of $650 million to $700 million. As such, you can now expect our 2016 gross overhead spend to be about $650 million. 
Lastly, exploration expense in the third quarter was $161 million. $114 million of this was attributable to unproved leasehold impairments in Canada, the Eagle Ford and the Canyon Lime. Last quarter, we guided to $250 million to $300 million of exploration expense for the full year. With the incremental impairment firm the third quarter, we now expect full year 2016 exploration expense in the range of $350 million to $400 million.
I would now like to provide a few details on our Alpine High infrastructure development plans. There is currently very limited infrastructure in the immediate vicinity of our acreage. During the course of delineation drilling, Apache has installed skid-mounted refrigeration units to process gas and recover natural gas liquids. NGL recovery volumes are currently constrained by the capability of these temporary units. We have also installed separation facilities to recover oil. Both the oil and the NGLs are being trucked to local sales points. These temporary arrangements will, over time, be replaced by more permanent solutions. The initial objective of our infrastructure investment is to establish permanent gas processing capacity and transportation of residue gas to market sales points. First gas sales are expected in the middle of 2017. 
Field processing of the gas train will be accomplished using refrigeration units at key locations across the acreage. These units are modular and can be expanded commensurate with increasing production. This will help optimize the pace of capital deployment and maximize efficiency. A high priority during the initial phase of the field development is to ensure that production is not limited by processing or transportation capacity. The gas takeaway infrastructure will include 60 miles of 30 units [ph] diameter trunk line that will traverse our entire Alpine High acreage position. Major third-party transport lines are currently situated or are under construction in locations approximately 10 miles to the north and south of the Apache leasehold. The hub is located less than 50 miles to the east of Apache's acreage and provides access to most major U.S. markets. Apache is currently evaluating numerous options to utilize these points of access to both the U.S. and Mexico gas market opportunities. We will install the trunk line across the Alpine High and establish most market connections through 2017 and 2018.
As indicated previously, NGLs are currently being transported by truck to local sales points. As production volumes increase, NGLs will eventually exceed trucking capacity and will require pipeline transport. Apache is evaluating options for the type of gas processing and the means of access to major NGL markets. There will be additional disclosure regarding these plans in the future.
Apache's Alpine High infrastructure strategy will address both the near-term requirements for market access during the appraisal and delineation phase as well as the long-term requirements for optimizing value through the transition to full-field development. As the ultimate production potential of the Alpine High is better understood, the long-term infrastructure requirements will be formulated accordingly. As with all capital decisions at Apache, infrastructure investment and full-field development decisions at Apache high will be made with full-cycle, fully burdened, long-term returns as a key priority. 
To reiterate some of John's early comments, as we think about our 2017 capital allocation process, we will do so based on a continuation of our core principles. We will focus on living within our means, maintaining our strong financial position and investing to improve long-term returns. We will provide the details of our 2017 capital plan and guidance in February. However, I would like to share 3 of the key themes in this year's planning process. 
First, the Alpine High and the rest of the Permian Basin will be high priorities for our capital program. We fully expect to return the Permian Basin to a strong growth trajectory in the second half of 2017. We are pleased with the improvements we made during the downturn across our portfolio, and we are not prepared to execute on our robust growth plan.
Second, we will continue to fund our Egypt and North Sea assets to sustain production and free cash flow. Our returns in these regions are highly competitive, and the free cash flow is critical to funding growth opportunities without resorting to dilutive equity raises. 
Finally, we are fortunate to have many quality assets that will compete for capital funding throughout the portfolio. In some situations, when funding availability is scarce, we have the luxury of deferring investments without significantly impacting underlying values. 
With that, I will turn the call back over to John."

Before taking questions, I wanted to make a few closing comments. Apache used the industry downturn to drive substantial change and improvement. We drastically reduced our cost structure, implemented a rigorous and integrated capital allocation and planning process, upgraded and expanded our drilling inventory, improved our capital efficiency, and positioned ourselves extremely well for the future. We invested a high percentage of our precious capital in strategic testing and captured the Alpine High play. This significant new discovery reflects not only the company's strategic focus on organic growth but also highlights the strong technical capabilities that were necessary to discover and secure it. 
In 2017, we will continue to manage oil and gas price volatility by setting a reasonable expected price band and gearing our capital spending, return targets and capital structure to the lower end of that band. Should realized prices come in higher, we will maintain the operational and financial flexibility and optionality to respond accordingly as we have done in 2016.
Our overall strategic approach will remain unchanged. Apache will live within its means, maintain its strong financial position, continue to build and develop our high-quality drilling inventory and invest our capital with the primary focus on improving long-term returns and creating shareholder value.

What we guided is a hydrocarbon system that has 5,000 feet of stack play. And so what the purpose of that well really to do was, was prove that we have oil production at a depth around 9,000 feet and which confirms our geologic model and our thermal maturity model. So quite frankly, we're very pleased with that well. It's a very short lateral. It's a small frack. It was more designed to test the geologic mile and the maturity model. And quite frankly, what's impressive about it is the geo orders [ph] have been stable and is relatively flat, and you've seen order volumes come down. So we're quite pleased with it. As we've said all along, we have not tried to drill big press release wells that are going to blow everybody away with the production rates. This is a well designed to confirm them.production. We have a very rich call him all the way from 9,000 feet down to 14,000 feet, which the Redwood confirmed. When we moved from oil down to wet gas down to dry gas. And the beauty of it is unlike other plays where you have a 200-foot zone that you're trying to track aerially across windows, you've got such a thick column here and we have the maturity all the way up to column. So what we have to do is move up home and will have more oil and so forth. So as we get into further test points and start to delineate and start to drill some other bring on some other things. But the important thing here is it validates there is oil production at 9,100 feet and 43 gravity API, and I think it's -- we're very excited about."

And really, the oil cut is going to be a function of thermal maturity in the depth to burial. And so as you move up, I mean, the only Barnett well we've drilled has a 20% cut. Below that in the deeper Woodford wells we've drilled, we've seen anywhere from 0 up to 21%. So the point in this whole thing is that we've got multiple zones across a window, hydrocarbon system that we know has hydrocarbons, ranging from oil, from 9,000 feet and probably shallower, I mean, we've got some other indications it could go shallower, down to 14,000 feet. So those cuts are going to be a function of which rock we place in those depths. And quite frankly, the transgressive sequence from the Woodford up to the pen, it really doesn't matter what age it was laid down. It's more a function of where it is in the maturity model. And so as we move up, we will see higher oil cuts, and we're confident in that. And we got the wells that we are drilling that we'll be bringing forth in the future that will design those. I mean, you can look at the oil cut in the Mont Bloc 2H, and it's very good at 9,100 feet. So I've tried to articulate what you got is a hydrocarbon system, okay, which is unique because we've got 5 stack pace, different types of rocks. And as you move up, the cuts are all going to be a function of depth and temperature. And that's the good thing about it is everything's been validated.

Oil, we actually export, sell in the open-market and get U.S. dollars into U.S. Bank accounts. On the costs side, we do have some costs that are based in Egyptian pounds, which means that we're a net Egyptian pound buyer on. A quarterly basis, we buy about $100 million worth of Egyptian pounds, and we buy them, obviously, at a rate at which we would consume them. So the logical conclusion would be that the devaluation would benefit us on the cost side, but actually, we would anticipate that inflation would mostly offset that over time. And then, just as a general rule, on a day-to-day basis, we generally hold a pretty minimal amount of Egyptian pounds at any one point in time. Just as an example, at September 30, we had a little over $50,000 worth of Egyptian pounds on hand. So the actual exposure to the Egyptian pound, in a direct financial basis, is pretty minimal. Of course, the more macro issue is that Egypt is going through a very difficult time. They're doing all of the right things, but it's going to be very difficult and it's going to be tough on the economy. And we obviously keep a very close eye on that."

That is a trunk line through the field, but we have 3 directions in which we can connect to markets. And eventually, I would hope and assume that we would be connected in all 3 directions, and therefore, the trunk line that can flow in different directions. And obviously, therefore, it's not the amount of gas that the field can produce. It's not limited by a unilateral flow of gas through the trunk line. It can flow in different directions. And then there will be a third connection most likely to the east from the middle of the field over to Waha. So you can -- the capacity of the field to produce and transport gas out is not actually limited by one direction flow of a 30-inch line with compression. I think you could probably get a pretty good estimate of what the capital costs are going to be over the next few years. We're going to put in all the pipes and the connects over the next 2 years, 2017, 2018. We're actually going to begin construction on the trunk line before the end of this year. So we'll have trunk line connections hopefully north, south into Waha and an NGL line most likely into the Waha direction as well by the end of '18. And I think industry estimates probably work to figure out the cost of that, a 60-mile trunk line, less than 10 miles to the north and south and then less than -- just less than 50 miles over to Waha. On the processing side, we're going to be -- you can put in refrigeration units in the 4 -- 50 million to 100 million cubic feet per day increments. That works economically. And for both processing and compression kind of an industry cost estimate of somewhere in the $0.40 to $0.60 per cubic feet per day in terms of capital spending is probably a reasonable estimate. So whatever you're assuming in terms of our development profile and production profile, you can pretty much match a field processing and compression profile with that and get a decent estimate of the capital spending. We do anticipate that we will put in processing and compression capacity in advance of us meeting it, so we won't be takeaway constrained. Processing or takeaway constrain will be well deliverability constrain."

Apache continues to make great progress on the goals we set at the beginning of the year and our recent announcements, and third quarter results underscore this positive performance. On today's call, I will",1882,"Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. 
Apache continues to make great progress on the goals we set at the beginning of the year and our recent announcements, and third quarter results underscore this positive performance. On today's call, I will discuss 4 primary topics. First, I will review the strategy we laid out at the beginning of 2015 that got Apache through the downturn. I will outline how the execution of that strategy has positioned Apache for success in 2017 and beyond. Then I will discuss our capital spending priorities as we look ahead to 2017. Following that, I will review our Permian, Egypt and North Sea regions and then conclude with a discussion of the Alpine High. 
At the start of the downturn, we established some guiding principles that have brought us to where we are today. These were: dramatically reduced development spending until price and costs come into better equilibrium; establish a strong financial position and protect it by living within cash flow; and prepare the portfolio for long-term returns, growth and shareholder value. At the start of 2016, we put forth a very conservative capital budget of $1.6 billion. This spend level was based on a plan to live within cash flow at $35 per barrel of oil. Our capital allocation process reflected the decision to constrain capital investment in North American Onshore development activity. Despite this, our North American Onshore production has performed well in 2016 which is a testament to Apache's greatly improved capital efficiency and the relatively low decline rate of our Permian-anchored production base.
At the beginning of 2016, our planned capital allocation for the Alpine High play was less than $100 million. As the year progressed and cash flow came in above budgeted levels, we elected to invest incremental cash flow in Alpine High rather than chase near-term production growth elsewhere. As a result, we now expect to spend approximately $500 million in Alpine High this year which effectively accounts for the incremental cash flow above our original budget. Our financial and operational discipline has served us well. We plan to end the year with relatively unchanged net debt, and we brought forth a transformational discovery at Alpine High that will drive incremental growth and returns for years to come.
With regard to next year's outlook, in February, on our fourth quarter conference call, we will provide a detailed view of our 2017 capital budget and other guidance items. In the meantime, I thought it would be helpful to provide the following high-level summary of our 2017 investment priorities. 
Our top priority next year is funding the Alpine High. The budget will likely consist of a 4- to 6-rig program and a first wave of midstream buildouts. The near-term pace of spending on Alpine High will be governed by the timing of infrastructure availability as well as a prudent appraisal and delineation program. Our goal in 2017 is to ensure that investment levels do not outpace our comprehensive understanding of the opportunity or our capacity to get product to market.
Our next priority is to increase development activity in our other Permian Basin focus areas. Specifically, we will add 3 rigs in the Midland Basin before year-end 2016, bringing our total rig count to 5. This additional activity, coupled with first gas production from Alpine High, will return the Permian Basin to a strong growth trajectory in the second half of 2017. We will also continue to invest in Egypt and the North Sea at levels designed to sustain production and generate significant free cash flow. 
And lastly, our other exploration projects and North American development opportunities will compete for the remaining available capital. 
Now, turning to the third quarter. As noted in this morning's press release, Apache's adjusted production in the third quarter which excludes tax barrels and our noncontrolling interest in Egypt was approximately 438,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. This is comprised of 270,000 BOEs per day in North America Onshore and 168,000 BOEs per day from the international and offshore. Production in North America Onshore continues to perform well despite minimal development capital. For the full year 2016, we expect North American Onshore production will be in the upper half of our most recent guidance range of 268,000 to 278,000 BOEs per day. 
In the Permian, while we are clearly excited about our Alpine High acreage, we are also positioned for very attractive growth and returns elsewhere in the basin. Our focus on strategic testing during the downturn has yielded excellent results in our core Midland and Delaware Basin acreage where we have expanded and prioritized our inventory of high-return projects. Improved landing zone targeting and new completion designs are delivering strong well performance in both areas. With these improvements and the significant progress we have made on costs, we are confident in bringing growth-oriented capital investment back to the Permian Basin. As such, we have initiated a more aggressive development drilling program in the Midland Basin and will look to expand our rig count further in 2017 if warranted by commodity prices and available cash flow.
Turning briefly to our international and offshore regions. Production for the quarter, excluding tax barrels and our noncontrolling interest in Egypt, was 168,000 BOEs per day, comprising 98,000 BOEs per day from Egypt, 62,000 BOEs from the North Sea and 8,000 BOEs from the Gulf of Mexico. During the quarter, our North Sea operations were impacted by planned and unplanned maintenance downtime as well as third-party facilities downtime. Thus far, we have seen volumes in the fourth quarter rebound to more normalized levels. For the full year 2016, international and offshore production is on track for the midpoint of our 170,000 to 180,000 BOE per day guidance for the year. I am very pleased with the drilling results in our international operations this year. Our exploration and development drilling success rate in Egypt and the North Sea year-to-date is approximately 90%. Apache made another key discovery in the North Sea this quarter at our Storr prospect. We highlighted this prospect in our North Sea investor webcast late last year, and it marks our third consecutive exploration success since acquiring 3D seismic data in the Beryl area. This validates the quality of our 3D seismic data and geologic modeling and gives us higher confidence in the dozens of future exploration prospects we have identified to date. 
Now, I would like to spend a few minutes discussing our Alpine High play. The Alpine High is an immense resource and a transformational discovery for Apache. We have invested a significant amount of human and financial capital through 2 years of extensive geologic and geophysical work, and reservoir and fluid analysis. This was accompanied by concept testing and initial round of verification wells, the results of which we disclosed in early September. We are now engaged in the methodical appraisal and delineation program to confirm the geographic and stratigraphic extent of the play and to formulate our long-term infrastructure plan. This work will continue for the next several quarters before transitioning to an active development program once gas processing and transportation infrastructure is in place. The Alpine High can be broadly characterized as 5 distinct target formations, all of which, we believe, will be highly economic. This includes the Bone Springs and Wolfcamp which are prevalent and productive throughout the Delaware Basin. These hybrid, unconventional plays are the current focus of industry to the North and East of the Alpine High. Two early tests have demonstrated that these formations are oil-productive and offer significant potential at Alpine High. More appraisal drilling in these zones is necessary before we will provide prospective location counts and resource in place estimates. Underlying the Bone Springs and Wolfcamp and unique to the Alpine High is a true resource play in the Pennsylvanian Barnett and Woodford formations. This is a world-class source rock sequence, up to 1,500 feet thick across our acreage position. Based on our appraisal program to date, we anticipate this will become a very large resource play with attractive rates of return and breakeven economics. Together, the Penn, Barnett, Woodford source rock and the 2 hybrid, unconventional zones in the Bone Springs and Wolfcamp are up to 5,000 feet thick across Apache's Alpine High acreage position. Given this extensive vertical column, we anticipate drilling multiple landing zones in each of these formations and ultimately defining several pipe wells in associated location counts. As a reminder, in previous disclosure, we assigned only 1 landing zone to each of the Barnett and the Woodford formations on only a portion of our acreage to arrive at our current 2,000 to 3,000-plus location count. When we announced Alpine High in September, we provided production results from 8 horizontal wells: 6 in the Woodford and 1 each in the Barnett and Bone Springs. The objective of this initial group of wells was only to test the boundaries of specific geologic settings and evaluate certain potential hazards. We made no effort to optimize completions, well orientations or landing zone placement. Despite this, the test wells have continued to perform very well. Since Barclays, we have flow-tested 2 additional wells. The Blackhawk 1H, a normally pressured Woodford well, flowed at a peak 24-hour IP rate of 5.3 million cubic feet of gas, 224 barrels of oil and 245 barrels of NGLs. The Redwood 1H, an overpressured Woodford well, flowed at a peak 24-hour IP rate of 18 million cubic feet of gas. This well was drilled to a vertical depth of nearly 14,000 feet, further confirming our thermal maturity model of the play and the depth limit of the wet gas window. Tim Sullivan will provide more details on our Alpine High wells in his remarks. 
Finally, we have closed several additional acreage transactions over the past 2 months, and our Alpine High position now comprises 320,000 net contiguous acres. Apache identified and captured this position for an average price of $1,300 per acre over a period of approximately 2 years. This very low entry cost gives us an advantage that we believe will translate into very attractive returns on capital employed compared to the alternative of acquiring perspective Delaware acreage at current transaction prices.
To summarize, our near-term drilling objectives at Alpine High include: geographic testing to define geologic settings across our acreage position, stratigraphic testing to collect data from all 5 formations, defining the number of landing zones and the optimal well placement and orientation within each formation, and enhancing completions and testing longer laterals and well spacing to optimize full steel development. At this point, we can say with confidence that the Alpine High contains thousands of predictable, high-return horizontal drilling locations that will drive returns and production growth for many years to come. Importantly, Apache controls a vast majority of the play and we have the ability to establish the pace and scope of development. Our ultimate goal is to optimize value of this extensive resource base for the maximum long-term benefit of our shareholders as well as other stakeholders.
I would now like to turn the call over to Tim Sullivan and Steve Riney who will discuss the company's drilling results, financial performance and midstream plans before coming back for some final remarks ahead of the Q&A session."

My remarks today will be focused on providing more detail around results from our core areas, highlights from specific wells and near-term development plans.

My remarks today will be focused on providing more detail around results from our core areas, highlights from specific wells and near-term development plans. 
Our Permian Region produced 159,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the third quarter or nearly 60% of Apache's total North American Onshore production. Production in the Permian Basin decreased by roughly 6,200 BOE per day from the second quarter as the declines were buffered primarily by 13-well tie-ins in our Northwest Shelf Yeso play. In our new Delaware Basin discovery, the Alpine High, we're showing results from 10 wells comprising 8 Woodford, 1 Barnett and 1/3 Bone Spring wells. 
On Page 15 of the operation supplement, we have updated our production curve from the wells we showed at Barclays and have included the 2 most recent wells. As you can see, our Alpine High wells compare favorably with the P50-type curves for the Marcellus, Utica and SCOOP resource plays, with half the wells producing at or above the P50-type curves. Keep in mind, the Alpine High wells are short laterals and have not been normalized for lateral length. Also, the completions and landing zones have not been optimized. These initial wells were drilled as appraisal wells and test of concept and were oftentimes drilled near hazards so that we can better understand the boundaries of the play. Given this, we are excited about the early time performance. We are shutting wells in as we complete testing and will collect pressure buildup data. These wells will be brought back online when we begin selling gas in 2017.
The 2 new Alpine High wells John previously mentioned are both producing from the Woodford formation. The Blackhawk State 1H which was drilled in a normally pressured setting has the highest oil cut in the Woodford among the wells we have drilled to date. The Redwood 1H is the deepest well we have drilled and is our highest gas producer. We have also updated production from the Bone Springs producer, Mont Blanc 2H, which can be seen on Page 17 of the operation supplement. The well, which was a non-optimized completion with a short lateral, has a cumulative production of greater than 40,000 barrels of oil equivalent over 100 days, and is currently producing 220 barrels of oil and 580 MCF per day with a stable GOR. Also, you can see that the water production has decreased to approximately 275 barrels per day. 
The wells drilled to date have confirmed the unprecedented picture of the vertical dimensions of the play of the Bone Springs to the Woodford across our acreage position, with the hydrocarbon column ranging from oil to wet gas to dry gas, confirming our geologic model. We have seen the range of initial oil cuts in the Woodford from 0 to 20%. The shallower Barnett well has an oil cut of 21%. These yields are in line with our thermal maturity model and can be correlated to depth. The gas is extremely rich, with an average BTU of approximately 1,300. This should provide for an average NGL yield in excess of 100 barrels per million cubic feet of natural gas when permanent facilities are in place. 
As expected in a resource play, Alpine High is becoming more predictable. Every well we've drilled has confirmed our model. In the Pecos Bend area in the Delaware Basin, we placed 7 gross-operated wells on production, all of which targeted the third Bone Springs formation. We continue to see excellent production performance across this play. Our Bluejay unit 103H well continues its strong performance. Using 3-D seismic, we targeted a highly fractured area. The well has produced 427,000 barrels of oil equivalent in just under 7 months, achieving an average rate of roughly 2,260 barrels of oil equivalent per day. This well is currently producing approximately 1,500 barrels of oil equivalent per day, of which 60% is oil. In a less fractured area of the play, we are also able to drill economic wells by utilizing pad drilling operations. On our Falcon State lease, a 6-well pad came online in mid-September with an average 30-day rate of 625 barrels of oil equivalent per day. This pad also demonstrated our best-in-class operational efficiencies in this basin, with an average total well cost of $3.5 million per well. In the Midland Basin, Central Basin Platform and Northwest Shelf, we placed a combined 16 gross-operated wells on production in the quarter. We ran 2 rigs in the third quarter, primarily in the Midland Basin and intend to ramp up to 5 rigs by the end of the year. Activity is focused on stratigraphic landing zone targeting and development pad drilling in the Wolfcamp and Spraberry Shale formations in our Wildfire, Azalea and Powell focus areas. We also expect to bring 20 horizontal wells online over the next few quarters across these 3 areas.
As we stated on our last quarter call, in the third quarter, we brought online the CC 4144 East 2HM producing from the Wolfcamp B formation at Powell. This well continues to show strong performance and has produced 136,000 barrels of oil equivalent in the first 90 days online, an average of more than 1,500 barrels of oil equivalent per day. This well, along with our Connell 38B 2HM and 38C 2HM wells, were drilled with our improved targeting and completion design which we highlighted last quarter. 
Please refer to Page 18 in our operation supplement for a production update of our Midland Basin focus area. Subsequent to quarter end, we brought online the Lynch A 6HM, a Wolfcamp B producer in our Wildfire area in Midland County. This 8,500-foot lateral was completed with 146 frack stages at approximately 60-foot frack spacing, pumping 1,700 pounds per foot of sand. The well is still cleaning up and has not reached peak production but is flowing at a rate of 1,120 barrels of oil and 1.1 million cubic feet of gas per day. In addition to this well, we will be testing one middle Spraberry and 3 lower Spraberry wells on our Wildfire focus area later this month. 
Much of our previous strategic testing in the Wolfcamp and Spraberry involve completions and landing zone optimization. The improvements we are making, as demonstrated by these wells, will significantly enhance our Midland Basin program going forward. 
In the Northwest Shelf, we placed 9 horizontal Yeso wells on production during the quarter and continued to generate very good production rates and economics from this play. The 30-day rate for these 9 wells averaged almost 450 barrels of oil equivalent per day. With our best-in-class drilling and completion costs for these wells, we average less than $2.5 million per well. This program generates extremely favorable economics on a fully burdened basin.
In addition to the 9 horizontal Yeso wells, we also placed 4 vertical Yeso wells on production during the quarter. Outside of the Permian, Apache had no active drilling rigs operating in North America during the quarter. We did, however, test 7 operated wells, all in Canada in our Ante Creek Montney and Wapiti Montney focus areas. Most notably is our 9 of 23 well completed in the lower Montney and our Wapiti area. This well tested at an impressive initial rate of 10.6 million cubic feet of gas per day and approximately 2,000 barrels of condensate per day, with a total estimated completed well cost of $6.2 million. 
We are making great progress in North America even at our low level of reinvestment. We remain focused on returns and are positioning the Permian Basin for a growth trajectory in the second half of 2017.
Moving to international and offshore operations. In Egypt, gross production of 350,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day was up slightly compared to the second quarter. On a net basis, adjusted volumes declined sequentially by 3,000 BOE per day, primarily due to the impact of improving Brent oil prices on cost recovery mechanisms and our production sharing contracts. We continue to benefit from a robust, optimized drilling program, drilling 45 producers and only 5 dry holes, achieving a 90% success rate through the first 3 quarters of 2016.
Apache placed 9 wells on production in Egypt during the third quarter, most notably is the Ptah #12, producing from the Shifah formation with a current peak oil production of over 2,800 barrels of oil per day. Since field discovery in November 2014, the Ptah and Berenice fields have produced a combined 17 million barrels of oil equivalent from only 14 wells and are still producing at a rate of more than 38,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Well costs for this play average only $3.2 million per well.
In the North Sea, third quarter production decreased approximately 8,300 BOE per day due to downtime, resulting from planned maintenance turnarounds and third-party operated facility restrictions that impacted production. This was associated with seasonal turnarounds that occur in this region during the late summer. This deferred some 3Q production into the current period, so we expect 4Q volumes to bounce back to levels we've seen in the first half of the year. 
As John mentioned, we also made a nice discovery at our Storr prospect in the Beryl area which encountered hydrocarbons in 2 separate fault blocks. The results were in line with pre-drill estimates and we expect to test more fault blocks at Storr in the future. 
Apache has a 55% working interest, with Shell holding the remaining 45%.
In late October, we commenced drilling our next Beryl area prospect, Kinord, which we expect to reach TD by year-end. Please refer to our November 2015 North Sea investor update for more details on Storr, Kinord and other opportunities in the Beryl area. 
I would note a new high-rate development well at the Beryl field, the Nevis North NNA [ph] which came online mid-September. The 30-day average rate for this well was 20 million cubic feet of natural gas equivalent per day. At our Aviat project in the Forties Field, we have now completed and tied in the first well. As you may recall, Aviat enabled the switch from diesel to natural gas as a primary source of power for the Forties Field. This is an environmentally friendly project that will extend the economic life of Forties due to lower operating costs and reduce certain safety and reliability risk associated with bunkering diesel to our platforms. We estimate our annual diesel savings due to this project at $15 million per year. 
Importantly, using natural gas to fuel the Forties Field should enable us to maintain higher and more stable water injection rates which should in turn, result in higher sustained hydrocarbon production from the field. 
In Suriname, we completed our 3-D seismic shoot on Block 58 in September, and we will have preliminary processing results by year-end and a fully processed data set in the third quarter of 2017. 
On the adjacent Block 53, we will commence drilling operations on a commitment well in the first quarter of next year, the Kolibri #1. While this is an attractive and sizable exploration prospect, very few wells have been drilled to this depth offshore Suriname and as such, carries a significant amount of risk. The dry hole cost to Apache for this well is estimated at less than $40 million. 
To sum up international and offshore, while activity was limited, we had very good exploration and development results in both Egypt and the North Sea during the third quarter. We are excited about the future exploration potential in our international and offshore portfolio and look forward to providing more details in the future.
I would now like to turn the call over to Steve."
169838,404454262,1072646,"Apache Corp., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2016",2016-11-03,"Earnings Calls","APA Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Tim, and good afternoon, everyone. On today's call, I will discuss the following. First, I will review our financial results for the third quarter and provide updated 2016 guidance on selected items.

On today's call, I will discuss the following. First, I will review our financial results for the third quarter and provide updated 2016 guidance on selected items. Next, I will provide a few details on our near-term Alpine High infrastructure development activities which have the primary purpose of achieving first gas sales around mid-2017. Then I will conclude by outlining the framework that we intend to follow as we put together our 2017 capital budget. 
Before I dive into it, I want to remind everyone that all of our numbers I will review on today's call are now reported under the successful efforts accounting method. For those who would like to compare these results to those under the full cost accounting method we used in the past, please reference the 10-Q that will be filed later today.
As noted in our press release, Apache reported a loss of $607 million or $1.60 per common share. Our results for the quarter include a number of items outside of our core earnings that are typically excluded by the investment community in published earnings estimates. This includes a $355 million impairment of certain proved properties in Canada as a result of downward reserve revisions related to well performance and lower expected net gas realizations. 
In addition, with the reduction of the U.K. Petroleum Revenue Tax, or PRT, to 0% in September, we recognized a charge of $481 million to eliminate the PRT benefit associated with certain future abandonment costs. Despite the apparent negative impacts of the change, in the long term, the reduction in the PRT tax rate will improve our North Sea returns. 
When excluding these and other smaller items, our adjusted loss for the quarter was $12 million or $0.03 per share. In the third quarter, Apache generated $651 million in cash flow from operations. We operated near cash flow neutrality after paying dividends and after increasing capital expenditures in the Alpine High and in our core Midland Basin. As a result, we ended the quarter with $1.2 billion of cash.
Our 2016 CapEx guidance which we updated in early September remains unchanged at $2 billion, and we still intend to end the year with unchanged or lower net debt. A combination of asset disposal proceeds and a significant U.S. tax refund, both anticipated in the fourth quarter, should enable us to achieve our targeted cash balance of $1.5 billion at year-end.
Turning to costs. Lease operating costs in the third quarter were $7.94 per barrel of oil equivalent, approximately 10% lower than the same period last year. As previously guided, LOE per barrel of oil equivalent increased from the second quarter due to higher seasonal maintenance activity and increased work over expenses. While we expect LOE per BOE to trend a little higher in the fourth quarter, we are again revising our full year 2016 guidance down to less than $8 per barrel of oil equivalent. This just reinforces the tremendous progress we have made on costs this year.
On the G&A side, our gross overhead spend which we've defined on previous calls continues to track toward the lower end of our 2016 guidance of $650 million to $700 million. As such, you can now expect our 2016 gross overhead spend to be about $650 million. 
Lastly, exploration expense in the third quarter was $161 million. $114 million of this was attributable to unproved leasehold impairments in Canada, the Eagle Ford and the Canyon Lime. Last quarter, we guided to $250 million to $300 million of exploration expense for the full year. With the incremental impairment firm the third quarter, we now expect full year 2016 exploration expense in the range of $350 million to $400 million.
I would now like to provide a few details on our Alpine High infrastructure development plans. There is currently very limited infrastructure in the immediate vicinity of our acreage. During the course of delineation drilling, Apache has installed skid-mounted refrigeration units to process gas and recover natural gas liquids. NGL recovery volumes are currently constrained by the capability of these temporary units. We have also installed separation facilities to recover oil. Both the oil and the NGLs are being trucked to local sales points. These temporary arrangements will, over time, be replaced by more permanent solutions. The initial objective of our infrastructure investment is to establish permanent gas processing capacity and transportation of residue gas to market sales points. First gas sales are expected in the middle of 2017. 
Field processing of the gas train will be accomplished using refrigeration units at key locations across the acreage. These units are modular and can be expanded commensurate with increasing production. This will help optimize the pace of capital deployment and maximize efficiency. A high priority during the initial phases of field development is to ensure that production is not limited by processing or transportation capacity. The gas takeaway infrastructure will include 60 miles of 30-inch diameter trunk line that will traverse our entire Alpine High acreage position. Major third-party transport lines are currently situated or are under construction in locations approximately 10 miles to the north and south of the Apache leasehold. The Waha hub is located less than 50 miles to the east of Apache's acreage and provides access to most major U.S. markets. Apache is currently evaluating numerous options to utilize these points of access to both the U.S. and Mexico gas market opportunities. We will install the trunk line across the Alpine High and establish most market connections through 2017 and 2018.
As indicated previously, NGLs are currently being transported by truck to local sales points. As production volumes increase, NGLs will eventually exceed trucking capacity and will require pipeline transport. Apache is evaluating options for the type of gas processing and the means of access to major NGL markets. There will be additional disclosure regarding these plans in the future.
Apache's Alpine High infrastructure strategy will address both the near-term requirements for market access during the appraisal and delineation phase as well as the long-term requirements for optimizing value through the transition to full-field development. As the ultimate production potential of the Alpine High is better understood, the long-term infrastructure requirements will be formulated accordingly. As with all capital decisions at Apache, infrastructure investment and full-field development decisions at Alpine High will be made with full-cycle, fully-burdened, long-term returns as a key priority. 
To reiterate some of John's early comments, as we think about our 2017 capital allocation process, we will do so based on a continuation of our core principles. We will focus on living within our means, maintaining our strong financial position and investing to improve long-term returns. We will provide the details of our 2017 capital plan and guidance in February. However, I would like to share 3 of the key themes in this year's planning process. 
First, the Alpine High and the rest of the Permian Basin will be high priorities for our capital program. We fully expect to return the Permian Basin to a strong growth trajectory in the second half of 2017. We are pleased with the improvements we made during the downturn across our portfolio, and we are now prepared to execute on our robust growth plan.
Second, we will continue to fund our Egypt and North Sea assets to sustain production and free cash flow. Our returns in these regions are highly competitive and the free cash flow is critical to funding growth opportunities without resorting to dilutive equity raises. 
Finally, we are fortunate to have many quality assets that will compete for capital funding throughout the portfolio. In some situations, when funding availability is scarce, we have the luxury of deferring investments without significantly impacting underlying values. 
With that, I will turn the call back over to John."

Before taking questions, I wanted to make a few closing comments. Apache used the industry downturn to drive substantial change and improvement. We drastically reduced our cost structure, implemented a rigorous and integrated capital allocation and planning process, upgraded and expanded our drilling inventory, improved our capital efficiency, and positioned ourselves extremely well for the future. We invested a high percentage of our precious capital in strategic testing and captured the Alpine High play. This significant new discovery reflects not only the company's strategic focus on organic growth but also highlights the strong technical capabilities that were necessary to discover and secure it. 
In 2017, we will continue to manage oil and gas price volatility by setting a reasonable expected price band and gearing our capital spending, return targets and capital structure to the lower end of that band. Should realized prices come in higher, we will maintain the operational and financial flexibility and optionality to respond accordingly as we have done in 2016.
Our overall strategic approach will remain unchanged. Apache will live within its means, maintain its strong financial position, continue to build and develop our high-quality drilling inventory and invest our capital with a primary focus on improving long-term returns and creating shareholder value. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to the operator to begin the Q&A."

What we've got is a hydrocarbon system that has 5,000 feet of stack play. And so what the purpose of that well really to do was, was prove that we have oil production at a depth of around 9,000 feet and which confirms our geologic model and our thermal maturity model. So quite frankly, we're very pleased with that well. It's a very short lateral, it's a small frack. It was more designed to test the geologic mile and the maturity model. And quite frankly, what's impressive about it is the GOR has been stable and is relatively flat, and you've seen the order volumes come down. So we're quite pleased with it. As we've said all along, we have not tried to drill big press release wells that are going to blow everybody away with the production rates. This is a well designed to confirm we have oil production. We have a very rich column, all the way from 9,000 feet down to 14,000 feet which the Redwood confirmed when we moved from oil down to wet gas down to dry gas. And the beauty of it is unlike other plays where you have a 200-foot zone that you're trying to track aerially across windows, we've got such a thick column here and we have the maturity all the way up the column. So all we have to do is move up hole and we will have more oil and so forth. So as we get into further test points and start to delineate and start to drill some other wells, we'll bring on some other things. But the important point here is it validates there is oil production at 9,100 feet and the 43 gravity API, and the -- I think it's something we're very excited about."

And really, the oil cut is going to be a function of thermal maturity and the depth of burial. And so as you move up, I mean, the only Barnett well we've drilled has a 20% cut. Below that in the deeper Woodford wells we've drilled, we've seen anywhere from 0 up to 21%. So the point in this whole thing is that we've got multiple zones across a window, a hydrocarbon system that we know has hydrocarbons ranging from oil from 9,000 feet and probably shallower. I mean, we've got some other indications it could go shallower, down to 14,000 feet. So those cuts are going to be a function of which rock we place in those depths. And quite frankly, the transgressive sequence from the Woodford up to the Penn, it really doesn't matter what age it was laid down, it's more a function of where it is in the maturity model. And so as we move up, we will see higher oil cuts and we're confident in that. And we got the wells that we are drilling that we'll be bringing forth in the future that will design those. I mean, you can look at the oil cut in the Mont Blanc 2H, and it's very good at 9,100 feet. So I've tried to articulate what you got is a hydrocarbon system, okay, which is unique because we've got 5 stack pays at different types of rocks. And as you move up, the cuts are all going to be a function of depth and temperature. And that's the good thing about it is everything's been validated, we can predict it and everything's coming in at or better than our model suggests."

Oil, we actually export, sell in the open-market and get U.S. dollars into U.S. bank accounts. On the cost side, we do have some costs that are based in Egyptian pounds which means that we're a net Egyptian pound buyer. On a quarterly basis, we buy about $100 million worth of Egyptian pounds, and we buy them, obviously, at a rate at which we would consume them. So the logical conclusion would be that the devaluation would benefit us on the cost side but actually, we would anticipate that inflation would mostly offset that over time. And then just as a general rule, on a day-to-day basis, we generally hold a pretty minimal amount of Egyptian pounds at any one point in time. And just as an example, at September 30, we had a little over $50,000 worth of Egyptian pounds on hand. So the actual exposure to the Egyptian pound, in a direct financial basis, is pretty minimal. Of course, the more macro issue is that Egypt is going through a very difficult time. They're doing all of the right things but it's going to be very difficult and it's going to be tough on the economy, and we obviously keep a very close eye on that."

That is a trunk line through the field but we have 3 directions in which we can connect to markets. And eventually, I would hope and assume that we would be connected in all 3 directions and therefore, the trunk line can flow in different directions. And obviously, therefore, it's not the amount of gas that the field can produce is not limited by a unilateral flow of gas through the trunk line, it can flow in different directions. And then there will be a third connection most likely to the east from the middle of the field over to Waha. So you can -- the capacity of the field to produce and transport gas out is not actually limited by one direction flow of a 30-inch line with compression. I think you could probably get a pretty good estimate of what the capital costs are going to be over the next few years. We're going to put in all the pipes and the connects over the next 2 years, 2017, 2018. We're actually going to begin construction on the trunk line before the end of this year. So we'll have trunk line connections hopefully north, south into Waha and an NGL line most likely into the Waha direction as well by the end of '18. And I think industry estimates probably work to figure out the cost of that, a 60-mile trunk line, less than 10 miles to the north and south and then less than -- just less than 50 miles over to Waha. On the processing side, we're going to be -- you can put in refrigeration units in the 450 million to 100 million cubic feet per day increments, that works economically. And for both processing and compression, a kind of an industry cost estimate of somewhere in the $0.40 to $0.60 per cubic feet per day in terms of capital spending is probably a reasonable estimate. So whatever you're assuming in terms of our development profile and production profile, you can pretty much match a field processing and compression profile with that and get a decent estimate of the capital spending. We do anticipate that we will put in processing and compression capacity in advance of us meeting it, so we won't be takeaway-constrained -- processing or takeaway-constrained, we'll be well deliverability-constrained."

It starts based on the buildout of the infrastructure and just the amount of time it takes to do -- collect the data and do this properly in a way that's going to maximize the NPV and the returns. So it's not a matter of needing more capital to try to accelerate Alpine -- the Alpine High play. It's going to get its capital in that pace. And then amazingly, it becomes cash flow positive pretty fast and self-funding. So I think the bigger question will be, as we look at the portfolio, Steve mentioned in his comments, we've got some -- a lot of things we can defer as we have really, the last 2 years as we've shut down and we're doing strategic testing and stuff. Most of our acreage is HBP. We've got a lot of really other attractive plays, and a lot of that will depend on what capital budget we want to run and what price deck we're comfortable spending at in terms of how we feather those in, and that's one thing. If there clearly are things and higher prices that we don't envision ourselves getting to, then obviously, we'd be looking at some of those options over the next couple of years. So those are all things that would be on the table."

So as we start out '17, a lot of that's just going to hinge on what price we've got we feel comfortable using. The good news is we made a lot of progress over the last 18 months, not just on our Alpine and just on our Permian. We've got a lot of really strong projects that are very competitive. We've got a nice SCOOP position in the Woodford with 52,000 net and 200,000 gross acres up there, a nice full position of the stack. You've seen some of the results from some of the Montney and the Duvernay today. So we've got a lot of other quality projects that we're fortunate that we can defer a few of those. But it's all going to hinge on ultimately, where we shake down on the capital plan coming into '17 would be where we will start. And of course, the main thing is we're going to maintain the flexibility like we did this year by budgeting a little bit conservatively to then react and ramp up because we've got a lot of optionality and a lot of opportunity in our portfolio, both within the Permian and the other parts of the portfolio."

Apache continues to make great progress on the goals we set at the beginning of the year, and our recent announcements and third quarter results underscore this positive performance. On today's call, I will",1882,"Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. 
Apache continues to make great progress on the goals we set at the beginning of the year, and our recent announcements and third quarter results underscore this positive performance. On today's call, I will discuss 4 primary topics. First, I will review the strategy we laid out at the beginning of 2015 that got Apache through the downturn. I will outline how the execution of that strategy has positioned Apache for success in 2017 and beyond. Then I will discuss our capital spending priorities as we look ahead to 2017. Following that, I will review our Permian, Egypt and North Sea regions and then conclude with a discussion of the Alpine High. 
At the start of the downturn, we established some guiding principles that have brought us to where we are today. These were: dramatically reduced development spending until price and costs come into better equilibrium; establish a strong financial position and protect it by living within cash flow; and prepare the portfolio for long-term returns, growth and shareholder value. At the start of 2016, we put forth a very conservative capital budget of $1.6 billion. This spend level was based on a plan to live within cash flow at $35 per barrel of oil. Our capital allocation process reflected the decision to constrain capital investment in North American Onshore development activity. Despite this, our North American Onshore production has performed well in 2016, which is a testament to Apache's greatly improved capital efficiency and the relatively low decline rate of our Permian-anchored production base.
At the beginning of 2016, our planned capital allocation for the Alpine High play was less than $100 million. As the year progressed and cash flow came in above budgeted levels, we elected to invest incremental cash flow in Alpine High rather than chase near-term production growth elsewhere. As a result, we now expect to spend approximately $500 million in Alpine High this year which effectively accounts for the incremental cash flow above our original budget. Our financial and operational discipline has served us well. We plan to end the year with relatively unchanged net debt, and we brought forth a transformational discovery at Alpine High that will drive incremental growth and returns for years to come.
With regard to next year's outlook, in February, on our fourth quarter conference call, we will provide a detailed view of our 2017 capital budget and other guidance items. In the meantime, I thought it would be helpful to provide the following high-level summary of our 2017 investment priorities. 
Our top priority next year is funding the Alpine High. The budget will likely consist of a 4- to 6-rig program and a first wave of midstream buildouts. The near-term pace of spending on Alpine High will be governed by the timing of infrastructure availability as well as a prudent appraisal and delineation program. Our goal in 2017 is to ensure that investment levels do not outpace our comprehensive understanding of the opportunity or our capacity to get product to market.
Our next priority is to increase development activity in our other Permian Basin focus areas. Specifically, we will add 3 rigs in the Midland Basin before year-end 2016, bringing our total rig count to 5. This additional activity, coupled with first gas production from Alpine High, will return the Permian Basin to a strong growth trajectory in the second half of 2017. We will also continue to invest in Egypt and the North Sea at levels designed to sustain production and generate significant free cash flow. 
And lastly, our other exploration projects and North American development opportunities will compete for the remaining available capital. 
Now, turning to the third quarter. As noted in this morning's press release, Apache's adjusted production in the third quarter, which excludes tax barrels and our noncontrolling interest in Egypt, was approximately 438,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. This is comprised of 270,000 BOEs per day in North America Onshore and 168,000 BOEs per day from the international and offshore. Production in North America Onshore continues to perform well despite minimal development capital. For the full year 2016, we expect North American Onshore production will be in the upper half of our most recent guidance range of 268,000 to 278,000 BOEs per day. 
In the Permian, while we are clearly excited about our Alpine High acreage, we are also positioned for very attractive growth and returns elsewhere in the basin. Our focus on strategic testing during the downturn has yielded excellent results in our core Midland and Delaware Basin acreage where we have expanded and prioritized our inventory of high-return projects. Improved landing zone targeting and new completion designs are delivering strong well performance in both areas. With these improvements and the significant progress we have made on costs, we are confident in bringing growth-oriented capital investment back to the Permian Basin. As such, we have initiated a more aggressive development drilling program in the Midland Basin and will look to expand our rig count further in 2017 if warranted by commodity prices and available cash flow.
Turning briefly to our international and offshore regions. Production for the quarter, excluding tax barrels and our noncontrolling interest in Egypt, was 168,000 BOEs per day, comprising 98,000 BOEs per day from Egypt, 62,000 BOEs from the North Sea and 8,000 BOEs from the Gulf of Mexico. During the quarter, our North Sea operations were impacted by planned and unplanned maintenance downtime as well as third-party facilities downtime. Thus far, we have seen volumes in the fourth quarter rebound to more normalized levels. For the full year 2016, international and offshore production is on track for the midpoint of our 170,000 to 180,000 BOE per day guidance for the year. I am very pleased with the drilling results in our international operations this year. Our exploration and development drilling success rate in Egypt and the North Sea year-to-date is approximately 90%. Apache made another key discovery in the North Sea this quarter at our Storr prospect. We highlighted this prospect in our North Sea investor webcast late last year, and it marks our third consecutive exploration success since acquiring 3D seismic data in the Beryl area. This validates the quality of our 3D seismic data and geologic modeling and gives us higher confidence in the dozens of future exploration prospects we have identified to date. 
Now, I would like to spend a few minutes discussing our Alpine High play. The Alpine High is an immense resource and a transformational discovery for Apache. We have invested a significant amount of human and financial capital through 2 years of extensive geologic and geophysical work, and reservoir and fluid analysis. This was accompanied by concept testing and initial round of verification wells, the results of which we disclosed in early September. We are now engaged in the methodical appraisal and delineation program to confirm the geographic and stratigraphic extent of the play and to formulate our long-term infrastructure plan. This work will continue for the next several quarters before transitioning to an active development program once gas processing and transportation infrastructure is in place. The Alpine High can be broadly characterized as 5 distinct target formations, all of which, we believe, will be highly economic. This includes the Bone Springs and Wolfcamp which are prevalent and productive throughout the Delaware Basin. These hybrid, unconventional plays are the current focus of industry to the North and East of the Alpine High. Two early tests have demonstrated that these formations are oil-productive and offer significant potential at Alpine High. More appraisal drilling in these zones is necessary before we will provide prospective location counts and resource in place estimates. Underlying the Bone Springs and Wolfcamp and unique to the Alpine High is a true resource play in the Pennsylvanian Barnett and Woodford formations. This is a world-class source rock sequence, up to 1,500 feet thick across our acreage position. Based on our appraisal program to date, we anticipate this will become a very large resource play with attractive rates of return and breakeven economics. Together, the Penn, Barnett, Woodford source rock and the 2 hybrid, unconventional zones in the Bone Springs and Wolfcamp are up to 5,000 feet thick across Apache's Alpine High acreage position. Given this extensive vertical column, we anticipate drilling multiple landing zones in each of these formations and ultimately defining several pipe wells in associated location counts. As a reminder, in previous disclosure, we assigned only 1 landing zone to each of the Barnett and the Woodford formations on only a portion of our acreage to arrive at our current 2,000 to 3,000-plus location count. When we announced Alpine High in September, we provided production results from 8 horizontal wells: 6 in the Woodford and 1 each in the Barnett and Bone Springs. The objective of this initial group of wells was only to test the boundaries of specific geologic settings and evaluate certain potential hazards. We made no effort to optimize completions, well orientations or landing zone placement. Despite this, the test wells have continued to perform very well. Since Barclays, we have flow-tested 2 additional wells. The Blackhawk 1H, a normally pressured Woodford well, flowed at a peak 24-hour IP rate of 5.3 million cubic feet of gas, 224 barrels of oil and 245 barrels of NGLs. The Redwood 1H, an overpressured Woodford well, flowed at a peak 24-hour IP rate of 18 million cubic feet of gas. This well was drilled to a vertical depth of nearly 14,000 feet, further confirming our thermal maturity model of the play and the depth limit of the wet gas window. Tim Sullivan will provide more details on our Alpine High wells in his remarks. 
Finally, we have closed several additional acreage transactions over the past 2 months, and our Alpine High position now comprises 320,000 net contiguous acres. Apache identified and captured this position for an average price of $1,300 per acre over a period of approximately 2 years. This very low entry cost gives us an advantage that we believe will translate into very attractive returns on capital employed compared to the alternative of acquiring perspective Delaware acreage at current transaction prices.
To summarize, our near-term drilling objectives at Alpine High include: geographic testing to define geologic settings across our acreage position, stratigraphic testing to collect data from all 5 formations, defining the number of landing zones and the optimal well placement and orientation within each formation, and enhancing completions and testing longer laterals and well spacing to optimize full steel development. At this point, we can say with confidence that the Alpine High contains thousands of predictable, high-return horizontal drilling locations that will drive returns and production growth for many years to come. Importantly, Apache controls a vast majority of the play and we have the ability to establish the pace and scope of development. Our ultimate goal is to optimize value of this extensive resource base for the maximum long-term benefit of our shareholders as well as other stakeholders.
I would now like to turn the call over to Tim Sullivan and Steve Riney who will discuss the company's drilling results, financial performance and midstream plans before coming back for some final remarks ahead of the Q&A session."

My remarks today will be focused on providing more detail around results from our core areas, highlights from specific wells and near-term development plans. 
Our Permian Region produced 159,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the third quarter or nearly 60% of Apache's total North American Onshore production. Production in the Permian Basin decreased by roughly 6,200 BOE per day from the second quarter as their declines were buffered primarily by 13-well tie-ins in our Northwest Shelf Yeso play. In our new Delaware Basin discovery, the Alpine High, we're showing results from 10 wells comprising 8 Woodford, 1 Barnett and 1/3 Bone Spring wells. 
On Page 15 of the operation supplement, we have updated our production curve from the wells we showed at Barclays and have included the 2 most recent wells. As you can see, our Alpine High wells compare favorably with the P50-type curves for the Marcellus, Utica and SCOOP resource plays, with half the wells producing at or above the P50-type curves. Keep in mind, the Alpine High wells are short laterals and have not been normalized for lateral length. Also, the completions and landing zones have not been optimized. These initial wells were drilled as appraisal wells and test of concept and were oftentimes drilled near hazards so that we can better understand the boundaries of the play. Given this, we are excited about the early time performance. We are shutting wells in as we complete testing and will collect pressure buildup data. These wells will be brought back online when we begin selling gas in 2017.
The 2 new Alpine High wells John previously mentioned are both producing from the Woodford formation. The Blackhawk State 1H which was drilled in a normally pressured setting has the highest oil cut in the Woodford among the wells we have drilled to date. The Redwood 1H is the deepest well we have drilled and is our highest gas producer. We have also updated production from the Bone Springs producer, Mont Blanc 2H, which can be seen on Page 17 of the operation supplement. The well, which was a non-optimized completion with a short lateral, has a cumulative production of greater than 40,000 barrels of oil equivalent over 100 days, and is currently producing 220 barrels of oil and 580 MCF per day with a stable GOR. Also, you can see that the water production has decreased to approximately 275 barrels per day. 
The wells drilled to date have confirmed the unprecedented picture of the vertical dimensions of the play of the Bone Springs to the Woodford across our acreage position, with the hydrocarbon column ranging from oil to wet gas to dry gas, confirming our geologic model. We have seen a range of initial oil cuts in the Woodford from 0 to 20%. The shallower Barnett well has an oil cut of 21%. These yields are in line with our thermal maturity model and can be correlated to depth. The gas is extremely rich, with an average BTU of approximately 1,300. This should provide for an average NGL yield in excess of 100 barrels per million cubic feet of natural gas when permanent facilities are in place. 
As expected in a resource play, Alpine High is becoming more predictable. Every well we've drilled has confirmed our model. In the Pecos Bend area in the Delaware Basin, we placed 7 gross-operated wells on production, all of which targeted the third Bone Springs formation. We continue to see excellent production performance across this play. Our Bluejay unit 103H well continues its strong performance. Using 3-D seismic, we targeted a highly fractured area. The well has produced 427,000 barrels of oil equivalent in just under 7 months, achieving an average rate of roughly 2,260 barrels of oil equivalent per day. This well is currently producing approximately 1,500 barrels of oil equivalent per day, of which 60% is oil. In a less fractured area of the play, we are also able to drill economic wells by utilizing pad drilling operations. On our Falcon State lease, a 6-well pad came online in mid-September with an average 30-day rate of 625 barrels of oil equivalent per day. This pad also demonstrated our best-in-class operational efficiencies in this basin, with an average total well cost of $3.5 million per well. In the Midland Basin, Central Basin Platform and Northwest Shelf, we placed a combined 16 gross-operated wells on production in the quarter. We ran 2 rigs in the third quarter, primarily in the Midland Basin and intend to ramp up to 5 rigs by the end of the year. Activity is focused on stratigraphic landing zone targeting and development pad drilling in the Wolfcamp and Spraberry Shale formations in our Wildfire, Azalea and Powell focus areas. We also expect to bring 20 horizontal wells online over the next 2 quarters across these 3 areas.
As we stated on our last quarter call, in the third quarter, we brought online the CC 4144 East 2HM producing from the Wolfcamp B formation at Powell. This well continues to show strong performance and has produced 136,000 barrels of oil equivalent in the first 90 days online, an average of more than 1,500 barrels of oil equivalent per day. This well, along with our Connell 38B 2HM and 38C 2HM wells, were drilled with our improved targeting and completion design, which we highlighted last quarter. 
Please refer to Page 18 in our operation supplement for a production update of our Midland Basin focus area. Subsequent to quarter end, we brought online the Lynch A 6HM, a Wolfcamp B producer in our Wildfire area in Midland County. This 8,500-foot lateral was completed with 146 frack stages at approximately 60-foot frack spacing, pumping 1,700 pounds per foot of sand. The well is still cleaning up and has not reached peak production but is flowing at a rate of 1,120 barrels of oil and 1.1 million cubic feet of gas per day. In addition to this well, we will be testing one middle Spraberry and 3 lower Spraberry wells on our Wildfire focus area later this month. 
Much of our previous strategic testing in the Wolfcamp and Spraberry involve completions and landing zone optimization. The improvements we are making, as demonstrated by these wells, will significantly enhance our Midland Basin program going forward. 
In the Northwest Shelf, we placed 9 horizontal Yeso wells on production during the quarter and continued to generate very good production rates and economics from this play. The 30-day rate for these 9 wells averaged almost 450 barrels of oil equivalent per day. With our best-in-class drilling and completion costs for these wells, we average less than $2.5 million per well. This program generates extremely favorable economics on a fully burdened basin.
In addition to the 9 horizontal Yeso wells, we also placed 4 vertical Yeso wells on production during the quarter. Outside of the Permian, Apache had no active drilling rigs operating in North America during the quarter. We did, however, test 7 operated wells, all in Canada in our Ante Creek Montney and Wapiti Montney focus areas. Most notably is our 9 of 23 well completed in the lower Montney and our Wapiti area. This well tested at an impressive initial rate of 10.6 million cubic feet of gas per day and approximately 2,000 barrels of condensate per day, with a total estimated completed well cost of $6.2 million. 
We are making great progress in North America even at our low level of reinvestment. We remain focused on returns and are positioning the Permian Basin for a growth trajectory in the second half of 2017.
Moving to international and offshore operations. In Egypt, gross production of 350,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day was up slightly compared to the second quarter. On a net basis, adjusted volumes declined sequentially by 3,000 BOE per day, primarily due to the impact of improving Brent oil prices on cost recovery mechanisms and our production sharing contracts. We continue to benefit from a robust, optimized drilling program, drilling 45 producers and only 5 dry holes, achieving a 90% success rate through the first 3 quarters of 2016.
Apache placed 9 wells on production in Egypt during the third quarter. Most notably is the Ptah #12, producing from the Shifah formation with a current peak oil production of over 2,800 barrels of oil per day. Since field discovery in November 2014, the Ptah and Berenice fields have produced a combined 17 million barrels of oil equivalent from only 14 wells and are still producing at a rate of more than 38,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Well costs for this play average only $3.2 million per well.
In the North Sea, third quarter production decreased approximately 8,300 BOE per day due to downtime, resulting from planned maintenance turnarounds and third-party operated facility restrictions that impacted production. This was associated with seasonal turnarounds that occur in this region during the late summer. This deferred some 3Q production into the current period, so we expect 4Q volumes to bounce back to levels we've seen in the first half of the year. 
As John mentioned, we also made a nice discovery at our Storr prospect in the Beryl area which encountered hydrocarbons in 2 separate fault blocks. The results were in line with pre-drill estimates and we expect to test more fault blocks at Storr in the future. 
Apache has a 55% working interest, with Shell holding the remaining 45%.
In late October, we commenced drilling our next Beryl area prospect, Kinord, which we expect to reach TD by year-end. Please refer to our November 2015 North Sea investor update for more details on Storr, Kinord and other opportunities in the Beryl area. 
I would note a new high-rate development well at the Beryl field, the Nevis North NNA [ph], which came online mid-September. The 30-day average rate for this well was 20 million cubic feet of natural gas equivalent per day. At our Aviat project in the Forties Field, we have now completed and tied in the first well. As you may recall, Aviat enabled the switch from diesel to natural gas as a primary source of power for the Forties Field. This is an environmentally friendly project that will extend the economic life of Forties due to lower operating costs and reduce certain safety and reliability risk associated with bunkering diesel to our platforms. We estimate our annual diesel savings due to this project at $15 million per year. 
Importantly, using natural gas to fuel the Forties Field should enable us to maintain higher and more stable water injection rates, which should in turn result in higher sustained hydrocarbon production from the field. 
In Suriname, we completed our 3-D seismic shoot on Block 58 in September, and we will have preliminary processing results by year-end and a fully processed data set in the third quarter of 2017. 
On the adjacent Block 53, we will commence drilling operations on a commitment well in the first quarter of next year, the Kolibri #1. While this is an attractive and sizable exploration prospect, very few wells have been drilled to this depth offshore Suriname and as such, carries a significant amount of risk. The dry hole cost to Apache for this well is estimated at less than $40 million. 
To sum up international and offshore, while activity was limited, we had very good exploration and development results in both Egypt and the North Sea during the third quarter. We are excited about the future exploration potential in our international and offshore portfolio and look forward to providing more details in the future.
I would now like to turn the call over to Steve."
169838,404454262,1072950,"Apache Corp., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2016",2016-11-03,"Earnings Calls","APA Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Tim, and good afternoon, everyone.

On today's call, I will discuss the following. First, I will review our financial results for the third quarter and provide updated 2016 guidance on selected items. Next, I will provide a few details on our near-term Alpine High infrastructure development activities which have the primary purpose of achieving first gas sales around mid-2017. Then I will conclude by outlining the framework that we intend to follow as we put together our 2017 capital budget. 
Before I dive into it, I want to remind everyone that all of our numbers I will review on today's call are now reported under the successful efforts accounting method. For those who would like to compare these results to those under the full cost accounting method we used in the past, please reference the 10-Q that will be filed later today.
As noted in our press release, Apache reported a loss of $607 million or $1.60 per common share. Our results for the quarter include a number of items outside of our core earnings that are typically excluded by the investment community in published earnings estimates. This includes a $355 million impairment of certain proved properties in Canada as a result of downward reserve revisions related to well performance and lower expected net gas realizations. 
In addition, with the reduction of the U.K. Petroleum Revenue Tax, or PRT, to 0% in September, we recognized a charge of $481 million to eliminate the PRT benefit associated with certain future abandonment costs. Despite the apparent negative impacts of the change, in the long term, the reduction in the PRT tax rate will improve our North Sea returns. 
When excluding these and other smaller items, our adjusted loss for the quarter was $12 million or $0.03 per share. In the third quarter, Apache generated $651 million in cash flow from operations. We operated near cash flow neutrality after paying dividends and after increasing capital expenditures in the Alpine High and in our core Midland Basin. As a result, we ended the quarter with $1.2 billion of cash.
Our 2016 CapEx guidance which we updated in early September remains unchanged at $2 billion, and we still intend to end the year with unchanged or lower net debt. A combination of asset disposal proceeds and a significant U.S. tax refund, both anticipated in the fourth quarter, should enable us to achieve our targeted cash balance of $1.5 billion at year-end.
Turning to costs. Lease operating costs in the third quarter were $7.94 per barrel of oil equivalent, approximately 10% lower than the same period last year. As previously guided, LOE per barrel of oil equivalent increased from the second quarter due to higher seasonal maintenance activity and increased work over expenses. While we expect LOE per BOE to trend a little higher in the fourth quarter, we are again revising our full year 2016 guidance down to less than $8 per barrel of oil equivalent. This just reinforces the tremendous progress we have made on costs this year.
On the G&A side, our gross overhead spend which we've defined on previous calls continues to track toward the lower end of our 2016 guidance of $650 million to $700 million. As such, you can now expect our 2016 gross overhead spend to be about $650 million. 
Lastly, exploration expense in the third quarter was $161 million. $114 million of this was attributable to unproved leasehold impairments in Canada, the Eagle Ford and the Canyon Lime. Last quarter, we guided to $250 million to $300 million of exploration expense for the full year. With the incremental impairment from the third quarter, we now expect full year 2016 exploration expense in the range of $350 million to $400 million.
I would now like to provide a few details on our Alpine High infrastructure development plans. There is currently very limited infrastructure in the immediate vicinity of our acreage. During the course of delineation drilling, Apache has installed skid-mounted refrigeration units to process gas and recover natural gas liquids. NGL recovery volumes are currently constrained by the capability of these temporary units. We have also installed separation facilities to recover oil. Both the oil and the NGLs are being trucked to local sales points. These temporary arrangements will, over time, be replaced by more permanent solutions. The initial objective of our infrastructure investment is to establish permanent gas processing capacity and transportation of residue gas to market sales points. First gas sales are expected in the middle of 2017. 
Field processing of the gas train will be accomplished using refrigeration units at key locations across the acreage. These units are modular and can be expanded commensurate with increasing production. This will help optimize the pace of capital deployment and maximize efficiency. A high priority during the initial phases of field development is to ensure that production is not limited by processing or transportation capacity. The gas takeaway infrastructure will include 60 miles of 30-inch diameter trunk line that will traverse our entire Alpine High acreage position. Major third-party transport lines are currently situated or are under construction in locations approximately 10 miles to the north and south of the Apache leasehold. The Waha hub is located less than 50 miles to the east of Apache's acreage and provides access to most major U.S. markets. Apache is currently evaluating numerous options to utilize these points of access to both U.S. and Mexico gas market opportunities. We will install the trunk line across the Alpine High and establish most market connections through 2017 and 2018.
As indicated previously, NGLs are currently being transported by truck to local sales points. As production volumes increase, NGLs will eventually exceed trucking capacity and will require pipeline transport. Apache is evaluating options for the type of gas processing and the means of access to major NGL markets. There will be additional disclosure regarding these plans in the future.
Apache's Alpine High infrastructure strategy will address both the near-term requirement for market access during the appraisal and delineation phase as well as the long-term requirements for optimizing value through the transition to full-field development. As the ultimate production potential of the Alpine High is better understood, the long-term infrastructure requirements will be formulated accordingly. As with all capital decisions at Apache, infrastructure investment and full-field development decisions at Alpine High will be made with full-cycle, fully burdened, long-term returns as a key priority. 
To reiterate some of John's early comments, as we think about our 2017 capital allocation process, we will do so based on a continuation of our core principles. We will focus on living within our means, maintaining our strong financial position and investing to improve long-term returns. We will provide the details of our 2017 capital plan and guidance in February. However, I would like to share 3 of the key themes in this year's planning process. 
First, the Alpine High and the rest of the Permian Basin will be high priorities for our capital program. We fully expect to return the Permian Basin to a strong growth trajectory in the second half of 2017. We are pleased with the improvements we made during the downturn across our portfolio, and we are now prepared to execute on our robust growth plan.
Second, we will continue to fund our Egypt and North Sea assets to sustain production and free cash flow. Our returns in these regions are highly competitive and the free cash flow is critical to funding growth opportunities without resorting to dilutive equity raises. 
Finally, we are fortunate to have many quality assets that will compete for capital funding throughout the portfolio. In some situations, when funding availability is scarce, we have the luxury of deferring investments without significantly impacting underlying values. 
With that, I will turn the call back over to John."

Before taking questions, I wanted to make a few closing comments. Apache used the industry downturn to drive substantial change and improvement. We drastically reduced our cost structure, implemented a rigorous and integrated capital allocation and planning process, upgraded and expanded our drilling inventory, improved our capital efficiency, and positioned ourselves extremely well for the future. We invested a high percentage of our precious capital in strategic testing and captured the Alpine High play. This significant new discovery reflects not only the company's strategic focus on organic growth but also highlights the strong technical capabilities that were necessary to discover and secure it. 
In 2017, we will continue to manage oil and gas price volatility by setting a reasonable expected price band and gearing our capital spending, return targets and capital structure to the lower end of that band. Should realized prices come in higher, we will maintain the operational and financial flexibility and optionality to respond accordingly as we have done in 2016.
Our overall strategic approach will remain unchanged. Apache will live within its means, maintain its strong financial position, continue to build and develop our high-quality drilling inventory and invest our capital with a primary focus on improving long-term returns and creating shareholder value. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to the operator to begin the Q&A."

What we've got is a hydrocarbon system that has 5,000 feet of stack pay. And so what the purpose of that well really to do was, was prove that we have oil production at a depth of around 9,000 feet and which confirms our geologic model and our thermal maturity model. So quite frankly, we're very pleased with that well. It's a very short lateral, it's a small frack. It was more designed to test the geologic model and the maturity model. And quite frankly, what's impressive about it is the GOR has been stable and is relatively flat, and you've seen the order volumes come down. So we're quite pleased with it. As we've said all along, we have not tried to drill big press release wells that are going to blow everybody away with the production rates. This well was designed to confirm we have oil production. We have a very rich column, all the way from 9,000 feet down to 14,000 feet which the Redwood confirmed when we moved from oil down to wet gas down to dry gas. And the beauty of it is unlike other plays where you have a 200-foot zone that you're trying to track aerially across windows, we've got such a thick column here and we have the maturity all the way up the column. So all we have to do is move up hole and we will have more oil and so forth. So as we get into further test points and start to delineate and start to drill some other wells, we'll bring on some other things. But the important point here is it validates there is oil production at 9,100 feet and 43 gravity API, and the -- I think it's something we're very excited about."

Below that in the deeper Woodford wells we've drilled, we've seen anywhere from 0 up to 21%. So the point in this whole thing is that we've got multiple zones across a window, a hydrocarbon system that we know has hydrocarbons ranging from oil from 9,000 feet and probably shallower. I mean, we've got some other indications it could go shallower, down to 14,000 feet. So those cuts are going to be a function of which rock we place in those depths. And quite frankly, the transgressive sequence from the Woodford up through the Penn, it really doesn't matter what age it was laid down, it's more a function of where it is in the maturity model. And so as we move up, we will see higher oil cuts and we're confident in that. And we got wells that we are drilling that we'll be bringing forth in the future that will design those. I mean, you can look at the oil cut in the Mont Blanc 2H, and it's very good at 9,100 feet. So I've tried to articulate what you got is a hydrocarbon system, okay, which is unique because we've got 5 stack pays at different types of rocks. And as you move up, the cuts are all going to be a function of depth and temperature. And that's the good thing about it is everything's been validated, we can predict it and everything's coming in at or better than our model suggests."

Oil, we actually export, sell in the open-market and get U.S. dollars into U.S. bank accounts. On the cost side, we do have some costs that are based in Egyptian pounds which means that we're a net Egyptian pound buyer. On a quarterly basis, we buy about $100 million worth of Egyptian pounds, and we buy them, obviously, at a rate at which we would consume them. So the logical conclusion would be that the devaluation would benefit us on the cost side but actually, we would anticipate that inflation would mostly offset that over time. And then just as a general rule, on a day-to-day basis, we generally hold a pretty minimal amount of Egyptian pounds at any one point in time. And just as an example, at September 30, we had a little over $50,000 worth of Egyptian pounds on hand. So the actual exposure to the Egyptian pound, in a direct financial basis, is pretty minimal. Of course, the more macro issue is that Egypt is going through a very difficult time. They're doing all of the right things but it's going to be very difficult and it's going to be tough on the economy, and we obviously keep a very close eye on that."

That is a trunk line through the field but we have 3 directions in which we can connect to markets. And eventually, I would hope and assume that we would be connected in all 3 directions and therefore, the trunk line can flow in different directions. And obviously, therefore, it's not the amount of gas that the field can produce is not limited by a unilateral flow of gas through the trunk line, it can flow in different directions. And then there will be a third connection most likely to the east from the middle of the field over to Waha. So you can -- the capacity of the field to produce and transport gas out is not actually limited by one direction flow of a 30-inch line with compression. I think you could probably get a pretty good estimate of what the capital costs are going to be over the next few years. We're going to put in all the pipes and the connects over the next 2 years, 2017, 2018. We're actually going to begin construction on the trunk line before the end of this year. So we'll have trunk line connections hopefully north, south into Waha and an NGL line most likely into the Waha direction as well by the end of '18. And I think industry estimates probably work to figure out the cost of that, a 60-mile trunk line, less than 10 miles to the north and south and then less than -- just less than 50 miles over to Waha. On the processing side, we're going to be -- you can put in refrigeration units in the 450 million to 100 million cubic feet per day increments, that works economically. And for both processing and compression, a kind of an industry cost estimate of somewhere in the $0.40 to $0.60 per cubic feet per day in terms of capital spending is probably a reasonable estimate. So whatever you're assuming in terms of our development profile and production profile, you can pretty much match a field processing and compression profile with that and get a decent estimate of the capital spending. We do anticipate that we will put in processing and compression capacity in advance of us meeting it, so we won't be takeaway-constrained -- processing or takeaway-constrained, we'll be well deliverability-constrained."

Apache continues to make great progress on the goals we set at the beginning of the year, and our recent announcements and third quarter results underscore this positive performance. On today's call, I will",1882,"Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. 
Apache continues to make great progress on the goals we set at the beginning of the year, and our recent announcements and third quarter results underscore this positive performance. On today's call, I will discuss 4 primary topics. First, I will review the strategy we laid out at the beginning of 2015 that got Apache through the downturn. I will outline how the execution of that strategy has positioned Apache for success in 2017 and beyond. Then I will discuss our capital spending priorities as we look ahead to 2017. Following that, I will review our Permian, Egypt and North Sea regions and then conclude with a discussion of the Alpine High. 
At the start of the downturn, we established some guiding principles that have brought us to where we are today. These were: dramatically reduced development spending until price and costs come into better equilibrium; establish a strong financial position and protect it by living within cash flow; and prepare the portfolio for long-term returns, growth and shareholder value. At the start of 2016, we put forth a very conservative capital budget of $1.6 billion. This spend level was based on a plan to live within cash flow at $35 per barrel of oil. Our capital allocation process reflected the decision to constrain capital investment in North American Onshore development activity. Despite this, our North American Onshore production has performed well in 2016, which is a testament to Apache's greatly improved capital efficiency and the relatively low decline rate of our Permian-anchored production base.
At the beginning of 2016, our planned capital allocation for the Alpine High play was less than $100 million. As the year progressed and cash flow came in above budgeted levels, we elected to invest incremental cash flow in Alpine High rather than chase near-term production growth elsewhere. As a result, we now expect to spend approximately $500 million in Alpine High this year which effectively accounts for the incremental cash flow above our original budget. Our financial and operational discipline has served us well. We plan to end the year with relatively unchanged net debt, and we brought forth a transformational discovery at Alpine High that will drive incremental growth and returns for years to come.
With regard to next year's outlook, in February, on our fourth quarter conference call, we will provide a detailed view of our 2017 capital budget and other guidance items. In the meantime, I thought it would be helpful to provide the following high-level summary of our 2017 investment priorities. 
Our top priority next year is funding the Alpine High. The budget will likely consist of a 4- to 6-rig program and a first wave of midstream buildouts. The near-term pace of spending on Alpine High will be governed by the timing of infrastructure availability as well as a prudent appraisal and delineation program. Our goal in 2017 is to ensure that investment levels do not outpace our comprehensive understanding of the opportunity or our capacity to get product to market.
Our next priority is to increase development activity in our other Permian Basin focus areas. Specifically, we will add 3 rigs in the Midland Basin before year-end 2016, bringing our total rig count to 5. This additional activity, coupled with first gas production from Alpine High, will return the Permian Basin to a strong growth trajectory in the second half of 2017. We will also continue to invest in Egypt and the North Sea at levels designed to sustain production and generate significant free cash flow. 
And lastly, our other exploration projects and North American development opportunities will compete for the remaining available capital. 
Now, turning to the third quarter. As noted in this morning's press release, Apache's adjusted production in the third quarter, which excludes tax barrels and our noncontrolling interest in Egypt, was approximately 438,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. This is comprised of 270,000 BOEs per day in North America Onshore and 168,000 BOEs per day from the international and offshore. Production in North America Onshore continues to perform well despite minimal development capital. For the full year 2016, we expect North American Onshore production will be in the upper half of our most recent guidance range of 268,000 to 278,000 BOEs per day. 
In the Permian, while we are clearly excited about our Alpine High acreage, we are also positioned for very attractive growth and returns elsewhere in the basin. Our focus on strategic testing during the downturn has yielded excellent results in our core Midland and Delaware Basin acreage where we have expanded and prioritized our inventory of high-return projects. Improved landing zone targeting and new completion designs are delivering strong well performance in both areas. With these improvements and the significant progress we have made on costs, we are confident in bringing growth-oriented capital investment back to the Permian Basin. As such, we have initiated a more aggressive development drilling program in the Midland Basin and will look to expand our rig count further in 2017 if warranted by commodity prices and available cash flow.
Turning briefly to our international and offshore regions. Production for the quarter, excluding tax barrels and our noncontrolling interest in Egypt, was 168,000 BOEs per day, comprising 98,000 BOEs per day from Egypt, 62,000 BOEs from the North Sea and 8,000 BOEs from the Gulf of Mexico. During the quarter, our North Sea operations were impacted by planned and unplanned maintenance downtime as well as third-party facilities downtime. Thus far, we have seen volumes in the fourth quarter rebound to more normalized levels. For the full year 2016, international and offshore production is on track for the midpoint of our 170,000 to 180,000 BOE per day guidance for the year. I am very pleased with the drilling results in our international operations this year. Our exploration and development drilling success rate in Egypt and the North Sea year-to-date is approximately 90%. Apache made another key discovery in the North Sea this quarter at our Storr prospect. We highlighted this prospect in our North Sea investor webcast late last year, and it marks our third consecutive exploration success since acquiring 3D seismic data in the Beryl area. This validates the quality of our 3D seismic data and geologic modeling and gives us higher confidence in the dozens of future exploration prospects we have identified to date. 
Now, I would like to spend a few minutes discussing our Alpine High play. The Alpine High is an immense resource and a transformational discovery for Apache. We have invested a significant amount of human and financial capital through 2 years of extensive geologic and geophysical work, and reservoir and fluid analysis. This was accompanied by concept testing and initial round of verification wells, the results of which we disclosed in early September. We are now engaged in the methodical appraisal and delineation program to confirm the geographic and stratigraphic extent of the play and to formulate our long-term infrastructure plan. This work will continue for the next several quarters before transitioning to an active development program once gas processing and transportation infrastructure is in place. The Alpine High can be broadly characterized as 5 distinct target formations, all of which, we believe, will be highly economic. This includes the Bone Springs and Wolfcamp which are prevalent and productive throughout the Delaware Basin. These hybrid, unconventional plays are the current focus of industry to the North and East of the Alpine High. Two early tests have demonstrated that these formations are oil-productive and offer significant potential at Alpine High. More appraisal drilling in these zones is necessary before we will provide prospective location counts and resource in place estimates. Underlying the Bone Springs and Wolfcamp and unique to the Alpine High is a true resource play in the Pennsylvanian Barnett and Woodford formations. This is a world-class source rock sequence, up to 1,500 feet thick across our acreage position. Based on our appraisal program to date, we anticipate this will become a very large resource play with attractive rates of return and breakeven economics. Together, the Penn, Barnett, Woodford source rock and the 2 hybrid, unconventional zones in the Bone Springs and Wolfcamp are up to 5,000 feet thick across Apache's Alpine High acreage position. Given this extensive vertical column, we anticipate drilling multiple landing zones in each of these formations and ultimately defining several pipe wells in associated location counts. As a reminder, in previous disclosure, we assigned only 1 landing zone to each of the Barnett and the Woodford formations on only a portion of our acreage to arrive at our current 2,000 to 3,000-plus location count. When we announced Alpine High in September, we provided production results from 8 horizontal wells: 6 in the Woodford and 1 each in the Barnett and Bone Springs. The objective of this initial group of wells was only to test the boundaries of specific geologic settings and evaluate certain potential hazards. We made no effort to optimize completions, well orientations or landing zone placement. Despite this, the test wells have continued to perform very well. Since Barclays, we have flow-tested 2 additional wells. The Blackhawk 1H, a normally pressured Woodford well, flowed at a peak 24-hour IP rate of 5.3 million cubic feet of gas, 224 barrels of oil and 245 barrels of NGLs. The Redwood 1H, an overpressured Woodford well, flowed at a peak 24-hour IP rate of 18 million cubic feet of gas. This well was drilled to a vertical depth of nearly 14,000 feet, further confirming our thermal maturity model of the play and the depth limit of the wet gas window. Tim Sullivan will provide more details on our Alpine High wells in his remarks. 
Finally, we have closed several additional acreage transactions over the past 2 months, and our Alpine High position now comprises 320,000 net contiguous acres. Apache identified and captured this position for an average price of $1,300 per acre over a period of approximately 2 years. This very low entry cost gives us an advantage that we believe will translate into very attractive returns on capital employed compared to the alternative of acquiring perspective Delaware acreage at current transaction prices.
To summarize, our near-term drilling objectives at Alpine High include: geographic testing to define geologic settings across our acreage position, stratigraphic testing to collect data from all 5 formations, defining the number of landing zones and the optimal well placement and orientation within each formation, and enhancing completions and testing longer laterals and well spacing to optimize full steel development. At this point, we can say with confidence that the Alpine High contains thousands of predictable, high-return horizontal drilling locations that will drive returns and production growth for many years to come. Importantly, Apache controls a vast majority of the play and we have the ability to establish the pace and scope of development. Our ultimate goal is to optimize value of this extensive resource base for the maximum long-term benefit of our shareholders as well as other stakeholders.
I would now like to turn the call over to Tim Sullivan and Steve Riney who will discuss the company's drilling results, financial performance and midstream plans before coming back for some final remarks ahead of the Q&A session."

My remarks today will be focused on providing more detail around results from our core areas, highlights from specific wells and near-term development plans. 
Our Permian Region produced 159,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the third quarter or nearly 60% of Apache's total North American Onshore production. Production in the Permian Basin decreased by roughly 6,200 BOE per day from the second quarter as their declines were buffered primarily by 13-well tie-ins in our Northwest Shelf Yeso play. In our new Delaware Basin discovery, the Alpine High, we're showing results from 10 wells comprising 8 Woodford, 1 Barnett and 1/3 Bone Spring wells. 
On Page 15 of the operation supplement, we have updated our production curve from the wells we showed at Barclays and have included the 2 most recent wells. As you can see, our Alpine High wells compare favorably with the P50-type curves for the Marcellus, Utica and SCOOP resource plays, with half the wells producing at or above the P50-type curves. Keep in mind, the Alpine High wells are short laterals and have not been normalized for lateral length. Also, the completions and landing zones have not been optimized. These initial wells were drilled as appraisal wells and test of concept and were oftentimes drilled near hazards so that we can better understand the boundaries of the play. Given this, we are excited about the early time performance. We are shutting wells in as we complete testing and will collect pressure buildup data. These wells will be brought back online when we begin selling gas in 2017.
The 2 new Alpine High wells John previously mentioned are both producing from the Woodford formation. The Blackhawk State 1H which was drilled in a normally pressured setting has the highest oil cut in the Woodford among the wells we have drilled to date. The Redwood 1H is the deepest well we have drilled and is our highest gas producer. We have also updated production from the Bone Springs producer, Mont Blanc 2H, which can be seen on Page 17 of the operation supplement. The well, which was a non-optimized completion with a short lateral, has a cumulative production of greater than 40,000 barrels of oil equivalent over 100 days, and is currently producing 220 barrels of oil and 580 MCF per day with a stable GOR. Also, you can see that the water production has decreased to approximately 275 barrels per day. 
The wells drilled to date have confirmed the unprecedented picture of the vertical dimensions of the play of the Bone Springs to the Woodford across our acreage position, with the hydrocarbon column ranging from oil to wet gas to dry gas, confirming our geologic model. We have seen a range of initial oil cuts in the Woodford from 0 to 20%. The shallower Barnett well has an oil cut of 21%. These yields are in line with our thermal maturity model and can be correlated to depth. The gas is extremely rich, with an average BTU of approximately 1,300. This should provide for an average NGL yield in excess of 100 barrels per million cubic feet of natural gas when permanent facilities are in place. 
As expected in a resource play, Alpine High is becoming more predictable. Every well we've drilled has confirmed our model. In the Pecos Bend area in the Delaware Basin, we placed 7 gross-operated wells on production, all of which targeted the third Bone Springs formation. We continue to see excellent production performance across this play. Our Bluejay unit 103H well continues its strong performance. Using 3-D seismic, we targeted a highly fractured area. The well has produced 427,000 barrels of oil equivalent in just under 7 months, achieving an average rate of roughly 2,260 barrels of oil equivalent per day. This well is currently producing approximately 1,500 barrels of oil equivalent per day, of which 60% is oil. In a less fractured area of the play, we are also able to drill economic wells by utilizing pad drilling operations. On our Falcon State lease, a 6-well pad came online in mid-September with an average 30-day rate of 625 barrels of oil equivalent per day. This pad also demonstrated our best-in-class operational efficiencies in this basin, with an average total well cost of $3.5 million per well. In the Midland Basin, Central Basin Platform and Northwest Shelf, we placed a combined 16 gross-operated wells on production in the quarter. We ran 2 rigs in the third quarter, primarily in the Midland Basin and intend to ramp up to 5 rigs by the end of the year. Activity is focused on stratigraphic landing zone targeting and development pad drilling in the Wolfcamp and Spraberry Shale formations in our Wildfire, Azalea and Powell focus areas. We also expect to bring 20 horizontal wells online over the next 2 quarters across these 3 areas.
As we stated on our last quarter call, in the third quarter, we brought online the CC 4144 East 2HM producing from the Wolfcamp B formation at Powell. This well continues to show strong performance and has produced 136,000 barrels of oil equivalent in the first 90 days online, an average of more than 1,500 barrels of oil equivalent per day. This well, along with our Connell 38B 2HM and 38C 2HM wells, were drilled with our improved targeting and completion design, which we highlighted last quarter. 
Please refer to Page 18 in our operation supplement for a production update of our Midland Basin focus area. Subsequent to quarter end, we brought online the Lynch A 6HM, a Wolfcamp B producer in our Wildfire area in Midland County. This 8,500-foot lateral was completed with 146 frac stages at approximately 60-foot frac spacing, pumping 1,700 pounds per foot of sand. The well is still cleaning up and has not reached peak production but is flowing at a rate of 1,120 barrels of oil and 1.1 million cubic feet of gas per day. In addition to this well, we will be testing one middle Spraberry and 3 lower Spraberry wells on our Wildfire focus area later this month. 
Much of our previous strategic testing in the Wolfcamp and Spraberry involve completions and landing zone optimization. The improvements we are making, as demonstrated by these wells, will significantly enhance our Midland Basin program going forward. 
In the Northwest Shelf, we placed 9 horizontal Yeso wells on production during the quarter and continued to generate very good production rates and economics from this play. The 30-day rate for these 9 wells averaged almost 450 barrels of oil equivalent per day. With our best-in-class drilling and completion costs for these wells, we average less than $2.5 million per well. This program generates extremely favorable economics on a fully burdened basin.
In addition to the 9 horizontal Yeso wells, we also placed 4 vertical Yeso wells on production during the quarter. Outside of the Permian, Apache had no active drilling rigs operating in North America during the quarter. We did, however, test 7 operated wells, all in Canada in our Ante Creek Montney and Wapiti Montney focus areas. Most notably is our 9 of 23 well completed in the lower Montney and our Wapiti area. This well tested at an impressive initial rate of 10.6 million cubic feet of gas per day and approximately 2,000 barrels of condensate per day, with a total estimated completed well cost of $6.2 million. 
We are making great progress in North America even at our low level of reinvestment. We remain focused on returns and are positioning the Permian Basin for a growth trajectory in the second half of 2017.
Moving to international and offshore operations. In Egypt, gross production of 350,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day was up slightly compared to the second quarter. On a net basis, adjusted volumes declined sequentially by 3,000 BOE per day, primarily due to the impact of improving Brent oil prices on cost recovery mechanisms and our production sharing contracts. We continue to benefit from a robust, optimized drilling program, drilling 45 producers and only 5 dry holes, achieving a 90% success rate through the first 3 quarters of 2016.
Apache placed 9 wells on production in Egypt during the third quarter. Most notably is the Ptah #12, producing from the Shifah formation with a current peak oil production of over 2,800 barrels of oil per day. Since field discovery in November 2014, the Ptah and Berenice fields have produced a combined 17 million barrels of oil equivalent from only 14 wells and are still producing at a rate of more than 38,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Well costs for this play average only $3.2 million per well.
In the North Sea, third quarter production decreased approximately 8,300 BOE per day due to downtime, resulting from planned maintenance turnarounds and third-party operated facility restrictions that impacted production. This was associated with seasonal turnarounds that occur in this region during the late summer. This deferred some 3Q production into the current period, so we expect 4Q volumes to bounce back to levels we've seen in the first half of the year. 
As John mentioned, we also made a nice discovery at our Storr prospect in the Beryl area which encountered hydrocarbons in 2 separate fault blocks. The results were in line with pre-drill estimates and we expect to test more fault blocks at Storr in the future. 
Apache has a 55% working interest, with Shell holding the remaining 45%.
In late October, we commenced drilling our next Beryl area prospect, Kinord, which we expect to reach TD by year-end. Please refer to our November 2015 North Sea investor update for more details on Storr, Kinord and other opportunities in the Beryl area. 
I would note a new high-rate development well at the Beryl field, the Nevis North NNA [ph], which came online mid-September. The 30-day average rate for this well was 20 million cubic feet of natural gas equivalent per day. At our Aviat project in the Forties Field, we have now completed and tied in the first well. As you may recall, Aviat enabled the switch from diesel to natural gas as a primary source of power for the Forties Field. This is an environmentally friendly project that will extend the economic life of Forties due to lower operating costs and reduce certain safety and reliability risk associated with bunkering diesel to our platforms. We estimate our annual diesel savings due to this project at $15 million per year. 
Importantly, using natural gas to fuel the Forties Field should enable us to maintain higher and more stable water injection rates, which should in turn result in higher sustained hydrocarbon production from the field. 
In Suriname, we completed our 3-D seismic shoot on Block 58 in September, and we will have preliminary processing results by year-end and a fully processed data set in the third quarter of 2017. 
On the adjacent Block 53, we will commence drilling operations on a commitment well in the first quarter of next year, the Kolibri #1. While this is an attractive and sizable exploration prospect, very few wells have been drilled to this depth offshore Suriname and as such, carries a significant amount of risk. The dry hole cost to Apache for this well is estimated at less than $40 million. 
To sum up international and offshore, while activity was limited, we had very good exploration and development results in both Egypt and the North Sea during the third quarter. We are excited about the future exploration potential in our international and offshore portfolio and look forward to providing more details in the future.
I would now like to turn the call over to Steve."
169838,404454262,1074925,"Apache Corp., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2016",2016-11-03,"Earnings Calls","APA Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Tim, and good afternoon, everyone.

On today's call, I will discuss the following. First, I will review our financial results for the third quarter and provide updated 2016 guidance on selected items. Next, I will provide a few details on our near-term Alpine High infrastructure development activities which have the primary purpose of achieving first gas sales around mid-2017. Then I will conclude by outlining the framework that we intend to follow as we put together our 2017 capital budget. 
Before I dive into it, I want to remind everyone that all of our numbers I will review on today's call are now reported under the successful efforts accounting method. For those who would like to compare these results to those under the full cost accounting method we used in the past, please reference the 10-Q that will be filed later today.
As noted in our press release, Apache reported a loss of $607 million or $1.60 per common share. Our results for the quarter include a number of items outside of our core earnings that are typically excluded by the investment community in published earnings estimates. This includes a $355 million impairment of certain proved properties in Canada as a result of downward reserve revisions related to well performance and lower expected net gas realizations. 
In addition, with the reduction of the U.K. Petroleum Revenue Tax, or PRT, to 0% in September, we recognized a charge of $481 million to eliminate the PRT benefit associated with certain future abandonment costs. Despite the apparent negative impacts of the change, in the long term, the reduction in the PRT tax rate will improve our North Sea returns. 
When excluding these and other smaller items, our adjusted loss for the quarter was $12 million or $0.03 per share. In the third quarter, Apache generated $651 million in cash flow from operations. We operated near cash flow neutrality after paying dividends and after increasing capital expenditures in the Alpine High and in our core Midland Basin. As a result, we ended the quarter with $1.2 billion of cash.
Our 2016 CapEx guidance which we updated in early September remains unchanged at $2 billion, and we still intend to end the year with unchanged or lower net debt. A combination of asset disposal proceeds and a significant U.S. tax refund, both anticipated in the fourth quarter, should enable us to achieve our targeted cash balance of $1.5 billion at year-end.
Turning to costs. Lease operating costs in the third quarter were $7.94 per barrel of oil equivalent, approximately 10% lower than the same period last year. As previously guided, LOE per barrel of oil equivalent increased from the second quarter due to higher seasonal maintenance activity and increased work over expenses. While we expect LOE per BOE to trend a little higher in the fourth quarter, we are again revising our full year 2016 guidance down to less than $8 per barrel of oil equivalent. This just reinforces the tremendous progress we have made on costs this year.
On the G&A side, our gross overhead spend which we've defined on previous calls continues to track toward the lower end of our 2016 guidance of $650 million to $700 million. As such, you can now expect our 2016 gross overhead spend to be about $650 million. 
Lastly, exploration expense in the third quarter was $161 million. $114 million of this was attributable to unproved leasehold impairments in Canada, the Eagle Ford and the Canyon Lime. Last quarter, we guided to $250 million to $300 million of exploration expense for the full year. With the incremental impairment from the third quarter, we now expect full year 2016 exploration expense in the range of $350 million to $400 million.
I would now like to provide a few details on our Alpine High infrastructure development plans. There is currently very limited infrastructure in the immediate vicinity of our acreage. During the course of delineation drilling, Apache has installed skid-mounted refrigeration units to process gas and recover natural gas liquids. NGL recovery volumes are currently constrained by the capability of these temporary units. We have also installed separation facilities to recover oil. Both the oil and the NGLs are being trucked to local sales points. These temporary arrangements will, over time, be replaced by more permanent solutions. The initial objective of our infrastructure investment is to establish permanent gas processing capacity and transportation of residue gas to market sales points. First gas sales are expected in the middle of 2017. 
Field processing of the gas train will be accomplished using refrigeration units at key locations across the acreage. These units are modular and can be expanded commensurate with increasing production. This will help optimize the pace of capital deployment and maximize efficiency. A high priority during the initial phases of field development is to ensure that production is not limited by processing or transportation capacity. The gas takeaway infrastructure will include 60 miles of 30-inch diameter trunk line that will traverse our entire Alpine High acreage position. Major third-party transport lines are currently situated or are under construction in locations approximately 10 miles to the north and south of the Apache leasehold. The Waha hub is located less than 50 miles to the east of Apache's acreage and provides access to most major U.S. markets. Apache is currently evaluating numerous options to utilize these points of access to both U.S. and Mexico gas market opportunities. We will install the trunk line across the Alpine High and establish most market connections through 2017 and 2018.
As indicated previously, NGLs are currently being transported by truck to local sales points. As production volumes increase, NGLs will eventually exceed trucking capacity and will require pipeline transport. Apache is evaluating options for the type of gas processing and the means of access to major NGL markets. There will be additional disclosure regarding these plans in the future.
Apache's Alpine High infrastructure strategy will address both the near-term requirement for market access during the appraisal and delineation phase as well as the long-term requirements for optimizing value through the transition to full-field development. As the ultimate production potential of the Alpine High is better understood, the long-term infrastructure requirements will be formulated accordingly. As with all capital decisions at Apache, infrastructure investment and full-field development decisions at Alpine High will be made with full-cycle, fully burdened, long-term returns as a key priority. 
To reiterate some of John's early comments, as we think about our 2017 capital allocation process, we will do so based on a continuation of our core principles. We will focus on living within our means, maintaining our strong financial position and investing to improve long-term returns. We will provide the details of our 2017 capital plan and guidance in February. However, I would like to share 3 of the key themes in this year's planning process. 
First, the Alpine High and the rest of the Permian Basin will be high priorities for our capital program. We fully expect to return the Permian Basin to a strong growth trajectory in the second half of 2017. We are pleased with the improvements we made during the downturn across our portfolio, and we are now prepared to execute on our robust growth plan.
Second, we will continue to fund our Egypt and North Sea assets to sustain production and free cash flow. Our returns in these regions are highly competitive and the free cash flow is critical to funding growth opportunities without resorting to dilutive equity raises. 
Finally, we are fortunate to have many quality assets that will compete for capital funding throughout the portfolio. In some situations, when funding availability is scarce, we have the luxury of deferring investments without significantly impacting underlying values. 
With that, I will turn the call back over to John."

Before taking questions, I wanted to make a few closing comments. Apache used the industry downturn to drive substantial change and improvement. We drastically reduced our cost structure, implemented a rigorous and integrated capital allocation and planning process, upgraded and expanded our drilling inventory, improved our capital efficiency, and positioned ourselves extremely well for the future. We invested a high percentage of our precious capital in strategic testing and captured the Alpine High play. This significant new discovery reflects not only the company's strategic focus on organic growth but also highlights the strong technical capabilities that were necessary to discover and secure it. 
In 2017, we will continue to manage oil and gas price volatility by setting a reasonable expected price band and gearing our capital spending, return targets and capital structure to the lower end of that band. Should realized prices come in higher, we will maintain the operational and financial flexibility and optionality to respond accordingly as we have done in 2016.
Our overall strategic approach will remain unchanged. Apache will live within its means, maintain its strong financial position, continue to build and develop our high-quality drilling inventory and invest our capital with a primary focus on improving long-term returns and creating shareholder value. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to the operator to begin the Q&A."

What we've got is a hydrocarbon system that has 5,000 feet of stack pay. And so what the purpose of that well really to do was, was prove that we have oil production at a depth of around 9,000 feet and which confirms our geologic model and our thermal maturity model. So quite frankly, we're very pleased with that well. It's a very short lateral, it's a small frac. It was more designed to test the geologic model and the maturity model. And quite frankly, what's impressive about it is the GOR has been stable and is relatively flat, and you've seen the order volumes come down. So we're quite pleased with it. As we've said all along, we have not tried to drill big press release wells that are going to blow everybody away with the production rates. This well was designed to confirm we have oil production. We have a very rich column, all the way from 9,000 feet down to 14,000 feet which the Redwood confirmed when we moved from oil down to wet gas down to dry gas. And the beauty of it is unlike other plays where you have a 200-foot zone that you're trying to track aerially across windows, we've got such a thick column here and we have the maturity all the way up the column. So all we have to do is move up hole and we will have more oil and so forth. So as we get into further test points and start to delineate and start to drill some other wells, we'll bring on some other things. But the important point here is it validates there is oil production at 9,100 feet and 43 gravity API, and the -- I think it's something we're very excited about."

Below that in the deeper Woodford wells we've drilled, we've seen anywhere from 0 up to 21%. So the point in this whole thing is that we've got multiple zones across a window, a hydrocarbon system that we know has hydrocarbons ranging from oil from 9,000 feet and probably shallower. I mean, we've got some other indications it could go shallower, down to 14,000 feet. So those cuts are going to be a function of which rock we place in those depths. And quite frankly, the transgressive sequence from the Woodford up through the Penn, it really doesn't matter what age it was laid down, it's more a function of where it is in the maturity model. And so as we move up, we will see higher oil cuts and we're confident in that. And we got wells that we are drilling that we'll be bringing forth in the future that will design those. I mean, you can look at the oil cut in the Mont Blanc 2H, and it's very good at 9,100 feet. So I've tried to articulate what you got is a hydrocarbon system, okay, which is unique because we've got 5 stack pays at different types of rocks. And as you move up, the cuts are all going to be a function of depth and temperature.

On the cost side, we do have some costs that are based in Egyptian pounds which means that we're a net Egyptian pound buyer. On a quarterly basis, we buy about $100 million worth of Egyptian pounds, and we buy them, obviously, at a rate at which we would consume them. So the logical conclusion would be that the devaluation would benefit us on the cost side but actually, we would anticipate that inflation would mostly offset that over time. And then just as a general rule, on a day-to-day basis, we generally hold a pretty minimal amount of Egyptian pounds at any one point in time. And just as an example, at September 30, we had a little over $50,000 worth of Egyptian pounds on hand. So the actual exposure to the Egyptian pound, in a direct financial basis, is pretty minimal. Of course, the more macro issue is that Egypt is going through a very difficult time.

That is a trunk line through the field but we have 3 directions in which we can connect to markets. And eventually, I would hope and assume that we would be connected in all 3 directions and therefore, the trunk line can flow in different directions. And obviously, therefore, it's not the amount of gas that the field can produce is not limited by a unilateral flow of gas through the trunk line, it can flow in different directions. And then there will be a third connection most likely to the east from the middle of the field over to Waha. So you can -- the capacity of the field to produce and transport gas out is not actually limited by one direction flow of a 30-inch line with compression. I think you could probably get a pretty good estimate of what the capital costs are going to be over the next few years. We're going to put in all the pipes and the connects over the next 2 years, 2017, 2018. We're actually going to begin construction on the trunk line before the end of this year. So we'll have trunk line connections hopefully north, south into Waha and an NGL line most likely into the Waha direction as well by the end of '18. And I think industry estimates probably work to figure out the cost of that, a 60-mile trunk line, less than 10 miles to the north and south and then less than -- just less than 50 miles over to Waha. On the processing side, we're going to be -- you can put in refrigeration units in the 450 million to 100 million cubic feet per day increments, that works economically. And for both processing and compression, a kind of an industry cost estimate of somewhere in the $0.40 to $0.60 per cubic feet per day in terms of capital spending is probably a reasonable estimate. So whatever you're assuming in terms of our development profile and production profile, you can pretty much match a field processing and compression profile with that and get a decent estimate of the capital spending. We do anticipate that we will put in processing and compression capacity in advance of us meeting it, so we won't be takeaway-constrained -- processing or takeaway-constrained, we'll be well deliverability-constrained."

Most of our acreage is HBP. We've got a lot of really other attractive plays, and a lot of that will depend on what capital budget we want to run and what price deck we're comfortable spending at in terms of how we feather those in, and that sort of thing.

I mean, we've gone from the low 50s to the mid-40s. And so obviously, every $5 of oil price and the movement of gas price means a lot to us in terms of that. So as we start out '17, a lot of that's just going to hinge on what price we've got we feel comfortable using. The good news is we made a lot of progress over the last 18 months, not just on our Alpine and just on our Permian. We've got a lot of really strong projects that are very competitive. We've got a nice SCOOP position in the Woodford with 52,000 net and 200,000 gross acres up there, a nice full position of the stack. You've seen some of the results from some of the Montney and the Duvernay today. So we've got a lot of other quality projects that we're fortunate that we can defer a few of those.
