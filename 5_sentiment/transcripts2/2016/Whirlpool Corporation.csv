Welcome to the Whirlpool Corporation's Fourth Quarter 2015 Conference Call. Joining me today are Jeff Fettig, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Marc Bitzer, our President and Chief Operating Officer; and Larry Venturelli, our Chief Financial Officer. 
Our remarks today track with the presentation available on the Investor section of our website at whirlpoolcorp.com. 
Before we begin, let me remind you that as we conduct this call, we will be making forward-looking statements to assist you in understanding Whirlpool Corporation's future expectations. Our actual results could differ materially from these statements due to many factors discussed on our latest 10-K and our other periodic reports as well as on Slide 1 and in the appendix of this presentation. 
Turning to Slide 2. We went to remind you that today's presentation includes non-GAAP financial measures. We believe these measures are important indicators of our operations as they exclude items that may not be indicative of, or are unrelated to, results from our ongoing business operations. We also think the adjusted measures will provide you with a better baseline for analyzing trends in our ongoing business operations. Listeners are directed to the appendix section of our presentation beginning on Slide 36 for the reconciliation of non-GAAP items to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Jeff."

As you saw in our press release this morning, we reported record revenue, ongoing profit and earnings per share for full year 2015. 
Overall, our integration activities in Europe and Asia progressed well and as planned, we delivered significant integration benefits, both in the fourth quarter and for the full year. Our ability to deliver these record results, despite significant volatility in the global economic environment, does demonstrate the strength of our execution and the benefits of our larger global operating platform. 
If you turn to Slide 5, I will review the 2015 financial results. What you see that we delivered strong revenue growth for the year, our revenues were up 5% versus last year and 18%, excluding currency impact. Our ongoing business earnings were a record $12.38 per share and as we expected, we delivered $620 million in free cash flow. 
Turning to Slide 6, you can see our priority -- our 2016 priorities in what we expect to be another record year. We do believe that the challenges we successfully managed in 2015 will carry over into 2016. And by that, we mean we expect the emerging markets will continue to be weak or decline but we do that largely offset by growth in our developed markets. We also anticipate that this strong dollar era that we're experiencing will continue into this year. So within this environment, our focus in 2016 is to continue to grow revenues and we see great opportunities to expand our operating margins. 
We plan to invest to grow globally in both our core appliance business and adjacent business us. We will deliver significant new product innovations in the market. And we continue to expect to deliver very strong cost productivity. 
So turning to Slide 7 where we show our guidance for 2016. We expect to deliver ongoing earnings per share of $14 to $14.75 a share, which represents 15% plus growth versus last year. We also expect free cash flow generation of between $700 million to $800 million, which is a substantial improvement versus the prior year. 
And while 2015 was a year where we faced several challenges, I think we were able to demonstrate our ability to create value for our shareholders through strong operational execution in this environment. in our current guidance reflects our expectation that this level of execution will continue as we do expect to deliver another year of record results in 2016. 
So at this point, I'd like to turn over to Marc Bitzer to review our global operations."

Turning to Slide 9, we will review North America's performance in the fourth quarter. As emphasized in our last earnings call, our strategy in North America had not changed. We performed perfectly in line with our",1047,"Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 9, we will review North America's performance in the fourth quarter. As emphasized in our last earnings call, our strategy in North America had not changed. We performed perfectly in line with our expectations as we grew revenues and substantially expanded margins in the fourth quarter. 
We grew our revenue 6.2%, excluding currency, and expanded operating margin to 12.4%, an all-time record. As expected, with our recently launched product fully available and nearly fully floored, the investments we made to drive growth in our U.S. business delivered sequential market share improvement in the fourth quarter. 
In addition to a leverage from its revenue growth, a very strong operating margins in the fourth quarter driven by our ongoing costs productivity activity program and favorable mix from our new product introductions, which more than offset nearly $30 million in unfavorable currency impact in Canada and Mexico.
Turning to Slide 10, we outlined our 2016 operation priorities for North America region. Our expectation is that the industry will continue to show strong 5% annual growth behind improved housing trends and consumer sentiment. And we expect to grow our revenues at or above industry levels. We also expect to continue accelerating growth of our new products to capitalize on this increased consumer and to drive improved price/mix and revenue growth. 
Our strong cost productivity programs will continue to drive margin improvement and remain focused on growing our type of core. We anticipate that these actions will more than offset a point of margin impact from negative currency based into days rate for the Canadian dollar and Mexican peso. We expect to deliver operating margins between 11.5% to 12.5%, which is fully in line with our long-term goals and a number of improvements over prior year. 
I will now share the fourth quarter results for our Europe, Middle East and Africa region as shown on Slide 11. Sales were $1.5 billion compared to $1.7 billion in the prior year. Excluding currencies, sales were up 8.1%. Ongoing operating profit was $88 million compared to $101 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. 
During the fourth quarter, strong execution of our integration plans and ongoing cost productivity mostly offset $45 million in unfavorable currency impact as well as the impact of a significant industry decline in Russia. 
Last year, we saw an unusually strong fourth quarter as trailing consumers bought heavily of the devaluation. As planned, and expected, we also met the marketing technology and product this quarter. 
For the full year, we delivered 4.5% operating margin, which is fully consistent with our guidance at the beginning of the year, in spite of $160 million in currency impact and weaker demand in Eastern Europe. 
On Slide 12, as [indiscernible] the full year 2016, our priorities remains unchanged with a strong focus on integration activities, ongoing cost productivities and growth from new products both within and beyond the core. We expect industry to be approximately flat to 2%, primarily driven by continued strong demand in Western Europe. 
Based on today's rates, weakness in the ruble and Europe will continue, but we plan to more than offset over point of margin impact from currency through ongoing cost productivity and acquisition synergies. Overall, we expect operating margins to be between 7% and 8% for the year, which is a number substantial year-over-year improvement and very consistent and even ahead of our long-term goals. 
Now we'll discuss our Latin America results on Slide 13. Sales for the quarter were $845 million, excluding the impact of currencies, sales decreased 8%. 
Our operating profit for the quarter totaled $58 million or nearly 7% of sales, which represents a substantial improvement in operating margin versus the prior 2 quarters. These margin levels are a clear indication that we have readjusted our business for today's operating environment through already deployed price, mix actions and cost and capacity reductions. 
On Slide 14, we summarized our priorities in Latin America. We expect demand from continued volatility and are fully prepared to deploy further actions necessary. We will continue to invest in new products, grow our business out of Brazil core appliances and are well positioned to capitalize growth in Brazil then demand does return. 
We expect industry decline of 10% and based on today's rate, 0.5 point of margin impact from currency primarily in the first half of the year. 
For growth in our non-Brazil operations, the benefit of previously announced cost base price increases, implemented reduction of fixed costs and improved mix from our new products, we expect to mitigate both currency and demand impact. 
Based on our expectation of demand down 10% and the Brazilian real at current spot rates and disadvantages of our offsetting actions for 2016, we expect operating margins between 6.5% and 7.5%, despite lower revenue due to the currency and emerging market demand. 
Now let's turn to our fourth quarter results in the Asia region, which are shown on Slide 15. Net sales were $312 million in comparison to $282 million in the prior year period. Excluding the impact of currency, our sales increased 15%. 
Our fourth quarter ongoing operating profit was $11 million compared to $17 million in the prior year period. Ongoing operating margin of 3.6% driven by record margins in India and integration benefits in China that were offset by weak demand and increased product and marketing mix. While these investments in China temporarily reduced our margins in the fourth quarter, we expect them to lead to strong growth in margins in the future. 
Turning to Slide 16, we're sharing our 2016 priorities for Asia operations. We will continue to focus on [indiscernible] expansion and ongoing cost productivity programs. Our expectations for flat industry growth in the region. For additional clarity about our assumptions, we are forecasting a 5% industry growth in India and a 2% to 3% industry decline in China. Overall, we expect strong margin performance of 7% to 8%, driven by our larger growth platforms and the benefits of our strong innovation pipeline. 
For Slide 17, we summarized our regional margin goals. We expect 2016 to be another year of record performance and see opportunities for a strong margin expansions in all regions. 
And now, I'd like to turn it over to Larry."

You may recall that we entered the year with significant currency headwinds and weakened emerging market demand. Given these challenges, our first half ongoing earnings of approximately $4.85 per share for flat with 2014. However, based on the actions we took throughout the year, we were able to deliver second half ongoing earnings of $7.55 per share, which is up 15% from last year's results. Our second half earnings momentum and our fourth quarter run rate entering 2016 are solid. 
Turning to our fourth quarter results on Slide 19 and 20, revenues were $5.6 billion. Currency had a $700 million top line impact, but excluding currency, sales were up 4%. 
We achieved all-time record ongoing earnings of $4.10 per share, driven by acquisition synergies and ongoing cost productivity programs, as well as price/mix from new product introductions and previously announced cost base price actions. 
You'll note from the slide that SG&A as percent of sales on a GAAP basis decreased approximately 1.5 points. While we make incrementally higher marketing investment this year to support our product introductions, those were more than offset by acquisition synergies and a planned reduction in acquisition-related costs. 
Our effective tax rate for the year was under 21%. This represents approximately a $0.20 improvement versus our prior full year guidance. 
In summary, we are pleased with the results for the quarter. 
Now turning to 2016. We expect another record year. We will continue to be impacted by currency and emerging market demand. However, we are confident in the actions we are taking to offset these headwinds, and deliver 15-percent plus earnings per share growth in 2016. 
First, on Slide 21, you can see that we absorbed nearly $6 from the combination of emerging market demand weakness and currency devaluation in 2015. As Marc discussed in the regional reviews, our operational focus and additional actions to deployed during the year drove record revenue and earnings performance, despite these challenges. 
Now turning to Slide 22, we share the 2016 assumptions for emerging market demand and currency headwinds included in our guidance. As Jeff mentioned, based on current exchange rates, we expect currency devaluation to continue, although at a reduced level compared to the prior year. Accordingly, we anticipate a negative impact of approximately $1 billion in sales and $2.50 in earnings per share from currency headwinds. Additionally, we're anticipating continued demand weakness in most emerging markets. As a result, we will offset $0.50 in earnings per share impact from that. 
It's important to note that these emerging market countries now represents 15% of our global sales. 
Finally, on Slide 23 and 25, we summarized key actions that we expect will offset the impact from currency and emerging market demand. We expect another very strong year in total cost productivity given material trends, fixed cost reductions taken in Brazil and our normal productivity programs. Our acquisition synergies tied to cost and capacity reduction activities will ramp-up during 2016. We expect solid demand trends in developed markets, combined with positive impact from previous and new product launches and growth in adjacent businesses. And our previously announced cost base price increases in Canada, Brazil and Russia are in full effect. 
On Slide 24, you can see an update on the progress of our restructuring and acquisition integration activities. We incurred $200 million in restructuring expense and delivered $200 million in benefits this year, consistent with previous communications. For 2016, we expect $250 million in expense and continue to expect $175 million in benefits. 
On Slide 26, we highly the cadence of half 1 versus half 2 earnings drivers we just discussed. First, given historical seasonality, volume is stronger in the second half of the year. In addition, we should have lower currency headwinds in the back half of the year based on current rates. Traditionally, we see much stronger seasonality in our cost productivity programs in the second half of the year and our acquisition synergies will ramp-up throughout the year. As a result, we would expect full year earnings seasonality to approximate 40% in the first half and 60% in the second half. 
On Slide 27, our 2016 guidance should deliver ongoing earnings of $14 to $14.75 per share, a 15% increase year-over-year. We are forecasting approximately $700 million to $800 million in free cash flow, which includes planned cash outlays of up to $200 million in restructuring related to acquisitions, $150 million related to our previously announced product warranty cost to Europe and capital spending of between $700 million to $750 million. 
Our priority for cash deployment have not changed as shown on Slide 28. We did repurchased $155 million of stock during the fourth quarter and have $225 million remaining on our existing authorization. We expect to complete our current share repurchase authorization this year. 
Now I'd like to turn it back over to Jeff."
314515,322524016,923637,"Whirlpool Corp., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 29, 2016",2016-01-29,"Earnings Calls","Whirlpool Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Larry. I'd now like to take a moment to update you on our long-range goals that we first outlined at our December 2014 Investor Day conference. Overall, our long-term strategy remains on track and we see tremendous opportunities from our larger",896,"Thanks, Larry. I'd now like to take a moment to update you on our long-range goals that we first outlined at our December 2014 Investor Day conference. 
Overall, our long-term strategy remains on track and we see tremendous opportunities from our larger global footprint, our leading position in key markets around the world, our continuation of stepping up levels of new product innovation, our strong brand portfolio with 7 powerful brands, each with over $1 billion in revenues and over the mid- to longer term, we do believe that our leading positions in several key emerging markets will be a great advantage for us. 
So then turning to Slide 31, I would like to summarize our updated management goals. And again, as we discussed earlier last year and carry over to this year, we are -- have been hit by declines in emerging market demands and significant currency devaluation. And this is really the only driver of our change in goals because this has had a large impact on our original sales goals. As a result, we now believe we can grow our revenues to $23 billion to $24 billion in net sales by 2018 versus over previous growth of $26 billion to $28 billion. And again, the difference essentially all purely from currency translation. Because we have rapidly adjusted to the changed global environment from our previously announced cost base price increases, fixed cost reductions and continued investment in new product innovation. And we will continue to do so as we go forward. 
We are offsetting these impacts previously discussed with what I believe is very strong operational execution. And as a result, we still expect to deliver operating margins, consistent with our 2018 goals. So we haven't changed our view at all that we can deliver double-digit operating margins globally. And with that, we expect to reach also our goal of doubling our free cash flow by 2018. 
In total, this will lead to strong earnings growth and we know plan to deliver strong growth in earnings per share to $20 to $22 per share in 2018. Again, the difference between this and the previous is simply a reduction in revenues due to currency. 
These revised targets would represents an improvement of 60% to 80% of our today's levels of earnings and represent exceptionally strong value accretion. 
As always, there are risks of us putting out long-range goals like this. But I think as we've demonstrated to last year, we have been able to adjust the environment and still deliver strong results. 
So turning to Slide 32. You can very specifically see the drivers in our ongoing earnings per share improvements. And again, we have multiple paths to drive value creation. We'll drive it through growth, acquisition synergies and cost productivities and these big levers that we outlined in December of 2014 have not changed. We are on track with our acquisition synergies in Europe and we expect an additional $2 to $3 per share in benefits by 2018. 
We are assuming demand in emerging markets like Brazil, Russia and China begin to stabilize in 2017, but likely only drive moderate recovery growth during this panning fighting cycle and we don't expect to see that until 2018. Additionally, demand in the U.S. is rebounding, consistent with our Investor Day assumptions, and we continue to see solid growth in our adjacent businesses. 
We also now are seeing more and more growth, which is enabled by our [indiscernible] and China acquisitions, which are now part of our baseline revenue assumptions. 
And finally, and importantly, from a cost productivity perspective, we fully expect to continue with strong ongoing annual productivity improvements in addition to the benefits from favorable input cost that we're currently seeing and we see great opportunities to further leverage benefits from our global operating platform. And I think over the last couple years, we've had a good a track record of delivering on those types of the benefits. 
So to sum up, we do expect to grow our earnings per share by nearly 60% to 80% over the next 3 years to between $20 and $22 per share. 
And then on Slide 33, you can see the walk on how we expect to double our free cash flow. And as you can see from this chart, cash flow growth is largely earnings driven. Working capital is just a bit higher due to growth in the business. We don't expect any fundamental changes in our rate of capital expenditures, which run about 3.5% and this has not changed. 
So turning to Slide 34, I just reconfirm, we are committed to achieving our vision of becoming the best global brand and consumer products company. As a reminder, we are #1 globally in 3 out of the 4 regions in the world. We're the largest Western company in Asia. We have a top market position in 5 of the top 7 largest appliance markets in Europe, and we also have the #1 position in the U.S., Canada and Brazil. 
So in total, we have a very high confidence in our growth plans give us an outstanding opportunity to continue driving significant shareholder returns. And we believe 2016 will be a strong step forward towards reaching our 2018 goals. 
So with that, I will end our formal remarks and we would like to open it up for questions."

I mean, there are 3 or, perhaps, 4 segments you can look in that business. The most impacted for all the reasons we talked about, is the Brazilian appliance business because of the currency, because demand being down almost 25% with the expectations -- so that where the heavy hit. But I would say, and I think I said this before, we've been in Brazil market for over 60 years, and we've never lost money in that market. And we continue to be in a positive profit position. So even in that tough situation, but our margins were hurt very badly in appliances. In our adjacent businesses, other than offsetting the inflation, they've remained intact. In Broco, which is our global compressor business, was hurt by demand in emerging markets and currency, but not nearly as much, and we had a reasonably good year in Broco. And [indiscernible] international, I would just say that it got hit by all the same currency -- the currency devaluations came at different times. We have a big position, for example, in Columbia. Columbia peso has devalued by 50%. Late in the year, Argentina obviously, devalued. So we adjust, but there's a larger basket of countries to do so. So those margins, although hurt some were not hurt as bad. So the predominant work, I would say has been to do, which we've already announced, the cost base price increases, which we've already announced and carry over into this year, we've done significant fixed cost reduction, almost 30%, I think. We drive the heck out of productivity, but we still have to offset inflation and negative demand. And I think Marc said it exactly correct. If you based on our assumption of today's spot and currency and the market going down another 10%, we feel pretty good about our ability to improve our margins. If we have another round of volatility, we'll have to adjust again and we are fully prepared to do that."

And as we talk about -- and by the way, we think that, that's the best way to look at it because that gives you the net number, which you ought to expect to see in the P&L or in the margins, which is what we show. The challenge talking about, which caused a little bit of confusion last year is when you have this of volatility in currency, we certainly saw net material cost last year, I think we said over $100 million. But we also had -- part of that -- the actual gross number was higher than that, but it's offset by currency increases in markets like Brazil, Russia and so and so forth. So bottom line is, we're going to have a big year of productivity. If you look at the margin walk, it's roughly between all of those factors, it's about a $400 million reduction, of which, I would suspect net, and it really depends on currency raw material ought to be -- we ought to expect same kind of improvement that we saw this year."

Let me actually start this -- first off by saying, we're very pleased with our North America Q4. And I know there were some concerns out there but these results would have quite a lot of concern. Let me, first of all, on the units, because you mentioned the 3% unit. First of all, and we said that in a number of previous call, our unit shipments are not comparable to what is AHAM published numbers because we include a lot more now units. So the numbers are not fully comparable. Having said that, what you can compare is our unit growth versus our organic excess growth, so the 3% versus 6%. And you're exactly right, I mean, that shows just how strong our price/mix was, which is the full result of disciplined promotion management and finally, results of our new product introductions. So to have that kind of lists in such a promotion environment is an achievement that we're very proud of. Now let me put it in broader context off the fourth quarter. Again, we delivered good ex currency growth 6%, record margin of 12.4%, which is exactly what we said we would do, drive growth and margin expansion. What is also important to note, we had ex currency revenue growth in all our business units, so Canada, Mexico, more domestic, major store appliances, which also means, we had sequential market share growth Q4 compared to Q3, which is something which we've been driving for very hard. So now with regards to your question about our expectations next year's market. As you know, we guide industry to 5%. As I also said in my prepared remarks, we fully expect to grow our revenue in line or above that market assumption. That's what we guide. That's our expectation based on run rate in which we have developed, based on new product introductions. So we're -- I think we'd say very confident behind these assumptions. Towards -- the comment towards broader industry assumption about 5%. As you know, as we guided in 2015, we initially came out before and we lift it to 5%, 5 plus  percent, [indiscernible] 6.5%. Beginning of the year many people question if North America would come to this group levels and North America, as an industry, did. [indiscernible] largely driven, the confidence of 5% is we still do believe the housing is as best the midpoint of a housing recovery in terms of cycle. We do see consumer sentiment becoming bigger. We do see wealth creation on the mid- and lower income level. So all these factors, if you put it in our macroeconomic model, you have a lot of confidence behind the 5% industry growth."

As you know, we guided at the beginning of '15 to 4% to 5% and with exactly the midpoint. I would say probably not some people maybe surprised but we're guiding now towards 7% or 8%, which as you recall, that was pretty much our targets in Investor Day. We are fully confident in the mid- 7% to 8% and the confidence comes from we do see the benefits from restructuring synergies and ongoing cost productivity. So as you know, when you're running a business, you have confidence in cost, that gives you a lot of confidence. It's just much more predicable than any top line assumptions. And if you look at '15, that was largely total cost driven and we know we have momentum, we know we have agreement on certain restructuring activities and that carries into '16. You will also note that our volume assumption for industry is actually not overly bullish, it's 0% to 2%. And frankly, that magnitude between 0% and 2% is entirely driven by what happens to Russia. So we basically, we're not overly bullish on Prussia. If Russia comes around faster but we've seen in prior decades and cycles, then you could see an offset versus 2%, that's the big assumption right now. But again, in Europe, in our view, on our [indiscernible] clockworks and that gives us a lot of confidence for '16 as well. On Latin America, [indiscernible] Jeff's comments. First of all, let me underline Latin America is obviously heavily influenced by what assumption take on Brazil industry growth and real. So on today's spot rates of real and with the assumption that Brazil goes down another 10%, which pretty much will be consistent with what we see right now, so this year region of the marketplace based on our taking cost actions and price/mix, which we have already deployed, we are very confident that 6.5% to 7%, which is, by the way, is not too far away from what we had in Q4. So it's not like we, from a run rate perspective, it's not like we're planning for huge step up. But again, I want to reiterate that the big assumption about the real exchange rates, and we've seen dramatic moves this year and it's the biggest assumption about the industry."

So we had -- we are behind unusual higher high amount of product introductions, which, of course, always has a certain impact on the top line.

Let me first try to explain what happened in '15 and then maybe give an indication for '16 and how that lead dynamics come together. If we just look at the full year P&L in Europe, you'll realize there's -- if you take up a currency impact, there's a small revenue growth, but the margin growth expansion came largely from the cost side, to be very straightforward. And the cost side, on the other hand, yes, there's some ongoing productivity coming from raw materials, which indicates Europe is largely offset through net currency, that's a transactional impact. So the net [indiscernible] comes largely from realizing the synergies in procurement, in footprint, in SG&A. So if you want to say, '15 was largely a restructuring and synergy [indiscernible]. It is important to note that the fact that we held the top line in year 1 in a post merger integration is a big deal because [indiscernible] see in such competitive environment that you're being attacked from all sides. And we even grow it. And some people asked us about the different pieces. Even if you won't break down the 2 legacy business, both elements grow organically, which again is a big deal in year 1 of such a complex integration. Now shifting gears into '16, again, the cost side are carryover benefits and certain restructuring initiatives, which we have just initiated and announced. So that just gives you unusual high amount of confidence because you're not relying on certain raw material assumptions, whatever, it's in your control. And I would say off margin improvement and profit in Europe for '16, it's still 70% to 80% is cost-driven. Now you come -- ultimately, comes back to the question, how much revenue growth can you drive at that brand and product portfolio. I would expect, and I'll come back to more Jeff's point, the long-term plan, in the planning horizon, it's '17, '18, that's when you start revenue growth coming in. For the simple that one it just takes awhile to have all these product platform integration plans because that's the most complicated process. And you see, we already put a lot of products down in the market. The vast majority of a new joint product basically comes '17 and '18. And that's when you should expect the top line growth. Even in the interim and that's the important thing is as one of our biggest attractions [indiscernible] why we bought this is strong country position. There is some with #1 in 5 out of the 7 markets and may [indiscernible] very all transparency [indiscernible]  our market share told by the markets has held up or even expanded in the last years. So that's a very, very important achievement for us."

We did have and we talked about some very, very large new product transitions, which affected millions of volumes -- millions of units of volumes, okay? We always have product transitions, so that is not new. And I would say, if the rest of the world was somewhat stable, that you wouldn't even probably even notice the impact of the product transition problems we had last year. But the fact of the matter is, we had, and the way I described it, the currency devaluation, and it's part a lie, but it is the most impacted movement currencies we've seen ever since we track currency. It costs us over $4 a share. And at the same time, Latin America -- emerging markets, in general, particularly Latin America, it seems like a long time ago, but in 2014, we had an all-time record year in Latin America. Last year, 1 year, our earnings were down by $300 million and cash was down by $300 million. We had record years in any other region in the world. So it wasn't the operational challenges we had on product [indiscernible]. It was that, on top of dealing with a massive currency issue, a massive decline in demand issue. And it means, we had to do a lot of things really well to still grow earnings by 9% last year. So I guess -- so let's fast forward into this year and I should say, we did very well on the cost side last year for a host of reasons, including the synergies, the restructuring, raw material markets, et cetera. So coming into this year, what we all have to mention is we still have big currency and demand headwinds. But there are less than half the size of last year, if things stay as we see them today. We're going to have another great year of cost productivity. And I would say we have no major known operational execution problems today like we had a year ago. So it's a -- that's, I guess, as clear I could try to be -- to hopefully address your point."

In addition to the margin -- and as we -- in the investor meeting showed Canada used to be roughly $1 billion business for us, that was in the old currency exchange rate. So you have a demand-side. And on top of that, the currency move of Canadian dollar has been massive. Keeping in mind there's no production in Canada. So you have a full currency impact. Having said that, in context, our team were very disciplined cost base price increase which we already had announced and executed. We maintained a good margin unfortunately, a much lower base. But the margin in Canada is very intact, very robust, but it's just a much lower base. Mexico is a slightly different story. The Mexico market is steady, pretty much slightly down, but there's not a huge downside in Canada. Mexico is a top line issue because of the Mexican peso was 18 [ph] it's just dramatically devalued.

Before we begin, let me remind you that as we conduct this call, we will be making forward-looking statements to assist you in understanding Whirlpool Corporation's future expectations.

We believe these measures are important indicators of our operations as they exclude items that may not be indicative of or are unrelated to results from our ongoing business operations. We also think the adjusted measures will provide you with a better baseline for analyzing trends in our ongoing business operations.

As you saw in our press release this morning, we reported record revenue, ongoing profit and earnings per share for full year 2015. 
Overall, our integration activities in Europe and Asia progressed well and as planned, we delivered significant integration benefits, both in the fourth quarter and for the full year. Our ability to deliver these record results, despite significant volatility in the global economic environment, does demonstrate the strength of our execution and the benefits of our larger global operating platform. 
If you turn to Slide 5, I will review the 2015 financial results, where you see that we delivered strong revenue growth for the year. Our revenues were up 5% versus last year and 18% excluding currency impact. Our ongoing business earnings were a record $12.38 per share and as we expected, we delivered $620 million in free cash flow. 
Turning to Slide 6, you can see our priority -- our 2016 priorities in what we expect to be another record year. We do believe that the challenges we successfully managed in 2015 will carry over into 2016. And by that, we mean we expect the emerging markets will continue to be weak or decline, but we do see that largely offset by growth in our developed markets. We also anticipate that this strong dollar era that we're experiencing will continue into this year. So within this environment, our focus in 2016 is to continue to grow revenues and we see great opportunities to expand our operating margins. 
We plan to invest to grow globally in both our core appliance business and adjacent businesses. We will deliver significant new product innovations in the market. And we continue to expect to deliver very strong cost productivity. 
So turning to Slide 7 where we show our guidance for 2016. We expect to deliver ongoing earnings per share of $14 to $14.75 a share, which represents 15%-plus growth versus last year. We also expect free cash flow generation of between $700 million to $800 million, which is a substantial improvement versus the prior year. 
And while 2015 was a year where we faced several challenges, I think we were able to demonstrate our ability to create value for our shareholders through strong operational execution in this environment. And our current guidance reflects our expectation that this level of execution will continue as we do expect to deliver another year of record results in 2016. 
So at this point, I'd like to turn it over to Marc Bitzer to review our global operations."

Turning to Slide 9, we will review North America's performance in the fourth quarter. As emphasized in our last earnings call, our strategy in North America has not changed. We performed perfectly in line with our",1063,"Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 9, we will review North America's performance in the fourth quarter. As emphasized in our last earnings call, our strategy in North America has not changed. We performed perfectly in line with our expectations as we grew revenues and substantially expanded margins in the fourth quarter. 
We grew our revenue 6.2%, excluding currency, and expanded operating margin to 12.4%, an all-time record. As expected, with our recently launched product fully available and nearly fully floored, the investments we made to drive growth in our U.S. business delivered sequential T6 market share improvement in the fourth quarter. 
In addition to leverage from its revenue growth, our very strong operating margins in the fourth quarter were driven by our ongoing cost productivity programs and favorable mix from our new product introductions, which more than offset nearly $30 million in unfavorable currency impacts in Canada and Mexico.
Turning to Slide 10, we outline our 2016 operation priorities for the North America region. Our expectation is that the industry will continue to show strong 5% annual growth behind improved housing trends and consumer sentiment. And we expect to grow our revenues at/or above industry levels. We also expect to continue accelerating growth of our new products to capitalize on this increased consumer demand and to drive improved price/mix and revenue growth. 
Our strong cost productivity programs will continue to drive margin improvement and remain focused on growing outside the core. We anticipate that these actions will more than offset a point of margin impact from negative currency based on today's rate for the Canadian dollar and Mexican peso. We expect to deliver operating margins between 11.5% and 12.5%, which is fully in line with our long-term goals and the number improvement over prior year. 
I will now share the fourth quarter result for our Europe, Middle East and Africa region as shown on Slide 11. Sales were $1.5 billion compared to $1.7 billion in the prior year. Excluding currencies, sales were up 8.1%. Ongoing operating profit was $88 million compared to $101 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. 
During the fourth quarter, strong execution of our integration plans and ongoing cost productivity mostly offset $45 million in unfavorable currency impacts as well as the impact of a significant industry decline in Russia. 
Last year, we saw an unusually strong fourth quarter in Russia as trading consumers bought heavily ahead of the devaluation. As planned and expected, we also invested in marketing technology and products this quarter. 
For the full year, we delivered 4.5% operating margin, which is fully consistent with our guidance at the beginning of the year in spite of $160 million in currency impacts and weaker demand in Eastern Europe. 
On Slide 12, as we look to our -- the full year 2016, our priorities remain unchanged, with a strong focus on integration activities, ongoing cost productivity and growth from new products both within and beyond the core. We expect industry to be approximately flat to 2%, primarily driven by continued strong demand in Western Europe. 
Based on today's rates, weakness in the ruble and euro will continue, but we plan to more than offset over a point of margin impact from currency through ongoing cost productivity and acquisition synergies. Overall, we expect operating margins to be between 7% and 8% for the year, which is a number substantial to year-over-year improvement and very consistent to this and even ahead of our long-term goals. 
Now we'll discuss our Latin America results on Slide 13. Sales for the quarter were $845 million. Excluding the impact of currencies, sales decreased 8%. 
Our operating profit for the quarter totaled $58 million or nearly 7% of sales, which represents a substantial improvement in operating margin versus the prior 2 quarters. These margin levels are a clear indication that we had readjusted our business for today's operating environment through already deployed price/mix actions and cost and capacity reductions. 
On Slide 14, we summarize our priorities in Latin America. We expect demand through continued volatility and are fully prepared to deploy further actions if necessary. We will continue to invest in new products, grow our business out of Brazil core appliances and are well positioned to capitalize in growth in Brazil, then demand does return. 
We expect industry decline of 10% and based on today's rate, a 0.5 point of margin impact from currency primarily in the first half of the year. 
For growth in our non-Brazil operations, the benefits of previously announced cost base price increases, implemented reduction of fixed costs and improved mix from our new products, we expect to mitigate both currency and demand impacts. 
Based on our expectations of demand down 10% and the Brazilian real at current spot rates, and this is a benefit of our offsetting actions for 2016, we expect operating margins between 6.5% and 7.5% despite lower revenue due to the currency and emerging market demand. 
Now we turn to our fourth quarter results in the Asia region, which are shown on Slide 15. Net sales were $312 million in comparison to $282 million in the prior year period. Excluding the impact of currency, our sales increased 15%. 
Our fourth quarter ongoing operating profit was $11 million compared to $17 million in the prior year period. Ongoing operating margin was 3.6%, driven by record margins in India and integration benefits in China that were offset by a weak demand and increased product and marketing measurements. While these investments in China temporarily reduced our margins in the fourth quarter, we expect them to lead to strong growth in margins in the future. 
Turning to Slide 16, we're showing our 2016 priorities for Asia operations. We will continue to focus on distribution expansion and ongoing cost productivity programs. Our expectation is for flat industry growth in the region. For additional clarity about our assumptions, we are forecasting a 5% industry growth in India and a 2% to 3% industry decline in China. Overall, we expect strong margin performance of 7% to 8%, driven by our larger growth platform and the benefits of our strong innovation pipeline. 
On Slide 17, we summarize our regional margin goals. We expect 2016 to be another year of record performance and see opportunities for strong margin expansions in all regions. 
And now I'd like to turn it over to Larry."

You may recall that we entered the year with significant currency headwinds and weakened emerging market demand. Given these challenges, our first half ongoing earnings of approximately $4.85 per share were flat with 2014. However, based on the actions we took throughout the year, we were able to deliver second half ongoing earnings of $7.55 per share, which is up 15% from last year's results. Our second half earnings momentum and our fourth quarter run rate entering 2016 are solid. 
Turning to our fourth quarter results on Slides 19 and 20, revenues were $5.6 billion. Currency had a $700 million top line impact, but excluding currency, sales were up 4%. 
We achieved all-time record ongoing earnings of $4.10 per share, driven by acquisition synergies and ongoing cost productivity programs as well as price/mix from new product introductions and previously announced cost base price actions. 
You'll note from the slide that SG&A as a percent of sales on a GAAP basis decreased approximately 1.5 points. While we did make incrementally higher marketing investments this year to support our product introductions, those were more than offset by acquisition synergies and a planned reduction in acquisition-related cost. 
Our effective tax rate for the year was under 21%. This represents approximately a $0.20 improvement versus our prior full year guidance. 
In summary, we are pleased with the results for the quarter. 
Now turning to 2016. We expect another record year. We will continue to be impacted by currency and emerging market demand. However, we are confident in the actions we are taking to offset these headwinds and deliver 15%-plus earnings per share growth in 2016. 
First, on Slide 21, you can see that we absorbed nearly $6 from the combination of emerging market demand weakness and currency devaluation in 2015. As Marc discussed in the regional reviews, our operational focus and additional actions deployed during the year drove record revenue and earnings performance despite these challenges. 
Now turning to Slide 22, we share the 2016 assumptions for emerging market demand and currency headwinds included in our guidance. As Jeff mentioned, based on current exchange rates, we expect currency devaluation to continue, although at a reduced level compared to the prior year. Accordingly, we anticipate a negative impact of approximately $1 billion in sales and $2.50 in earnings per share from currency headwinds. Additionally, we're anticipating continued demand weakness in most emerging markets. As a result, we will offset $0.50 in earnings per share impact from that. 
It's important to note that these emerging market countries now represent 15% of our global sales. 
Finally, on Slides 23 and 25, we summarize key actions that we expect will offset the impact of currency and emerging market demand. We expect another very strong year in total cost productivity given material trends, fixed cost reductions taken in Brazil and our normal productivity programs. Our acquisition synergies tied to cost and capacity reduction activities will ramp up during 2016. We expect solid demand trends in developed markets, combined with positive impact from previous and new product launches and growth in adjacent businesses. And our previously announced cost base price increases in Canada, Brazil and Russia are in full effect. 
On Slide 24, you can see an update on the progress of our restructuring and acquisition integration activities. We incurred $200 million in a restructuring expense and delivered $200 million in benefits this year, consistent with previous communications. For 2016, we expect $250 million in expense and continue to expect $175 million in benefits. 
On Slide 26, we highlight the cadence of Half 1 versus Half 2 earnings drivers we just addressed. First, given historical seasonality, volume is stronger in the second half of the year. In addition, we should have lower currency headwinds in the back half of the year based on current rates. Traditionally, we see much stronger seasonality in our cost productivity programs in the second half of the year and our acquisition synergies will ramp up throughout the year. As a result, we would expect full year earnings seasonality to approximate 40% in the first half and 60% in the second half. 
On Slide 27, our 2016 guidance should deliver record ongoing earnings of $14 to $14.75 per share, a 15% increase year-over-year. We are forecasting approximately $700 million to $800 million in free cash flow, which includes planned cash outlays of up to $200 million in restructuring related to the acquisitions, $150 million related to our previously announced product warranty cost to Europe and capital spending of between $700 million to $750 million. 
Our priorities for cash deployment have not changed as shown on Slide 28. We did repurchase $155 million of stock during the fourth quarter and have $225 million remaining on our existing authorization. We expect to complete our current share repurchase authorization this year. 
Now I'd like to turn it back over to Jeff."

I'd now like to take a moment to update you on our long-range goals that we first outlined at our December 2014 Investor Day conference. Overall, our long-term strategy remains on track and we see tremendous opportunities from our larger",892,"Thanks, Larry. I'd now like to take a moment to update you on our long-range goals that we first outlined at our December 2014 Investor Day conference. 
Overall, our long-term strategy remains on track and we see tremendous opportunities from our larger global footprint, our leading position in key markets around the world, our continuation of stepping up levels of new product innovation, our strong brand portfolio with 7 powerful brands, each with over $1 billion in revenues, and over the mid- to longer-term, we do believe that our leading positions in several key emerging markets will be a great advantage for us. 
So then turning to Slide 31, I would like to summarize our updated management goals. And again, as we discussed earlier last year and carrying it over to this year, we are -- have been hit by declines in emerging market demands and significant currency devaluations. And this is really the only driver of our change in goals because this had us have a large impact on our original sales goal. As a result, we now believe we can grow our revenues to $23 billion to $24 billion in sales by 2018 versus our previous goal of $26 billion to $28 billion. And again, the difference is essentially all purely from currency translation because we have rapidly adjusted to the changed global environment through our previously announced cost base price increases, fixed cost reductions and continued investment in new product innovation. And we will continue to do so as we go forward. 
We are offsetting these impacts previously discussed with what I believe is very strong operational execution. And as a result, we still expect to deliver operating margins consistent with our 2018 goals. So we haven't changed our view at all that we can deliver double-digit operating margins globally. And with that, we expect to reach also our goal of doubling our free cash flow by 2018. 
In total, this will lead to strong earnings growth, and we now plan to deliver strong growth in earnings per share to $20 to $22 per share in 2018. Again, the difference between this and the previous is simply a reduction in revenues due to currency. 
These revised targets would represent an improvement of 60% to 80% over today's levels of earnings and represent exceptionally strong value creation. 
As always, there are risk of us putting in an out long-range goals like this. But I think as we've demonstrated to last year, we have been able to adjust the environment and still deliver strong results. 
So turning to Slide 32. You can very specifically see the drivers in our ongoing earnings per share improvements. And again, we have multiple paths to drive value creation. We'll drive it through growth, acquisition synergies and cost productivities. And these big levers that we outlined in December of 2014 have not changed. We are on track with our acquisition synergies in Europe, and we expect an additional $2 to $3 per share in benefits by 2018. 
We are assuming demand in emerging markets like Brazil, Russia and China begin to stabilize in 2017 but likely only drive moderate recovery growth during this planning cycle and we don't expect to see that until 2018. Additionally, demand in the U.S. is rebounding, consistent with our Investor Day assumptions, and we continue to see solid growth in our adjacent businesses. 
We also now are seeing more and more growth, which is enabled by our Indesit and China acquisitions, which are now part of our baseline revenue assumptions. 
And finally, and importantly, from a cost productivity perspective, we fully expect to continue with strong ongoing annual productivity improvements in addition to the benefits from favorable input costs that we're currently seeing and we see great opportunities to further leverage benefits from our global operating platform. And I think over the last couple years, we've had a good track record of delivering on those type of benefits. 
So to sum up, we do expect to grow our earnings per share by nearly 60% to 80% over the next 3 years to between $20 and $22 per share. 
And then on Slide 33, you could see the walk on how we expect to double our free cash flow. And as you can see from this chart, cash flow growth is largely earnings-driven. Working capital is just a bit higher due to growth in the business. We don't expect any fundamental changes in our rate of capital expenditures, which run about 3.5%, and this has not changed. 
So turning to Slide 34, I'll just reconfirm, we are committed to achieving our vision of becoming the best global brand and consumer products company. As a reminder, we are #1 globally in 3 out of the 4 regions in the world. We're the largest Western company in Asia. We have a top market position in 5 of the top 7 largest appliance markets in Europe, and we also have the #1 position in U.S., Canada and Brazil. 
So in total, we have very high confidence that our growth plans give us an outstanding opportunity to continue driving significant shareholder returns. And we believe 2016 will be a strong step forward towards reaching our 2018 goals. 
So with that, I will end our formal remarks and we would like to open it up for questions."

I mean, there are 3 or perhaps 4 segments you can look at in that business. The most impacted, for all the reasons we talked about, is the Brazilian appliance business because of the currency and because of demand being down almost 25%, with the expectation -- so that's where the heavy hit. But I would say, and it's -- I think I said this before, we've been in the Brazil market for over 60 years and we've never lost money in that market and we continue to be in a positive profit position. So even in that tough situation -- but our margins were hurt very badly in appliances. In our adjacent businesses, other than offsetting the inflation, they have remained intact. Embraco, which is our global compressor business, was hurt by demand in emerging markets and currency but not nearly as much, and we had a reasonably good year in Embraco. And LAR International, I would just say that it got hit by all the same currency -- the currency devaluations came at different times. We have a big position, for example, in Colombia. Colombia peso has devalued by 50%. Late in the year, Argentina obviously devalued. So we adjust, but there's a larger basket of countries to do. So those margins, although hurt some, were not hurt as bad. So the predominant work, I would say, has been to do, which we've already announced, the cost base price increases, which we've already announced and carried over into this year. We've done a significant fixed cost reduction, almost 30%, I think. We drive the heck out of productivity, but we still have to offset inflation and negative demand. So -- and I think Marc said it exactly correct. If you based on our assumption of today's spot in currency and the market going down another 10%, we feel pretty good about our ability to improve our margins. If we have another round of volatility, we'll have to adjust again, and we're fully prepared to do that."

And as we talk about -- and by the way, that we think that's the best way to look at it because that gives you a net number which you ought to expect to see in the P&L or in the margins, which is what we show. The challenge talking about, which caused a little bit of confusion last year, is when you have this volatility in currency, we certainly saw lower net material cost last year, I think we said over $100 million. But we also had -- part of that -- the actual gross number was higher than that, but it's offset by currency increases in markets like Brazil and Russia and so and so forth. So bottom line is, we're going to have a big year of productivity. If you look at the margin walk, it's roughly, between all of those factors, it's about a $400 million reduction, of which, I would suspect, net, and that really depends on what currency raw materials ought to be, we ought to expect the same kind of improvement that we saw this year."

Let me actually start with -- first off by saying that we're very pleased with our North America Q4. And I know there were some concerns out there, but these results would have quiet down a lot of concerns. Let me, first of all, on the units, because you mentioned the 3% unit. First of all, and we said that in a number of previous calls, our unit shipments are not comparable to what is AHAM published numbers because we include a lot more now units. So the numbers are not fully comparable. Having said that, what you can compare is our unit growth versus our organic excess growth, so the 3% versus 6%. And you're exactly right, I mean, that shows you just how strong our price/mix was, which is the full result of disciplined promotion management and finally, results of our new product introductions. So to have that kind of lists in such a promotion environment is an achievement we're very proud of. Now let me put it in broader context off the fourth quarter. Again, we delivered good ex currency revenue growth, 6%, record margin of 12.4%, which is exactly what we said we would do, drive growth and margin expansion. What is also important to note, we had ex currency revenue growth in all our business units, so Canada, Mexico, more domestic, major store appliances, which also means, we had sequential market share growth Q4 compared to Q3, which is something which, as you know, we've been driving for very hard. So now with regards to your question about our expectations for next year's market. As you know, we guide industry to 5%. As I also said in my prepared remarks, we fully expect to grow our revenue in line or above that market assumption. That's what we guide to, and that's our expectation based on run rates which we have developed, based on new product introductions. So we're -- I think we'd say very confident behind these assumptions. Towards -- the comment towards the broader industry assumption about 5%. As you know, we, as we guided in 2015, we initially came out before and we lift it to 5%, 5 plus percent, the final was 6.5%. Beginning of the year many people questioned if North America would come to these growth levels and North America, as an industry, did. Med is still largely driven, the confidence for 5% is, we still do believe the housing is, at best midpoint of a housing recovery, in terms of cycle. We do see consumer sentiment becoming bigger. We do see wealth creation on the mid- and lower income levels. And so all these factors, if you put it in our macroeconomic model, you have a lot of confidence behind the 5% industry growth."

We are fully confident in the mid- 7% to 8%, and the confidence comes from, we do see the benefits from restructuring synergies and ongoing cost productivity. So which, as you know, when you're running a business, if you have a confidence in cost, that gives you a lot of confidence. It's just much more predicable than any top line assumptions. And if you look at '15, that was largely cost, total cost driven, and we know we have a momentum, we know we have agreement on certain restructuring activities and that carries into '16. You will also note that our volume assumption for industry is actually not overly bullish, it's 0% to 2%. And frankly, that magnitude between 0% and 2% is entirely driven by what happens to Russia. So we basically, we're not overly bullish on Russia. If Russia comes around faster, but we've seen in prior decades, or in cycles, then you could see it offset versus 2%, but that's a big assumption right now. But again, on Europe, in our view, on all quarters, we delivered like a clockworks, and that gives us a lot of confidence for '16 as well. On Latin America, Mike expected Jeff's comments. First of all, let me underline, Latin America is obviously heavily influenced by what assumptions you take on Brazil industry growth and the real. So on today's spot rate of real, and with the assumption that Brazil goes down another 10%, which pretty much will be consistent with what we see right now, so further deterioration of the marketplace, based on ROI, taking cost actions and price/mix, which we have already deployed, we are very confident to hit that 6.5% to 7%, which is, by the way, is not too far away from what we had in Q4. So it's not like we -- from a run rate perspective, it's not like we're planning for a huge step up. But again, I want to reiterate that this big assumption about the real exchange rates, and we've seen dramatic moves this year, and it's a big assumption about the industry."

Let me first try to explain what happened in '15 and then maybe give an indication for '16 and how that lead dynamics come together. If you just look at the full year P&L in Europe, you'll realize there's -- if you take up a currency impact, there's a small revenue growth, but it -- the margin growth expansion came largely from the cost side, to be very straightforward. And the cost side, on the other hand, yes, there's some ongoing productivity coming from raw materials, which in the case for Europe is largely offset through an active currency, that's a transactional impact. So the net bulk comes largely from realizing the synergies in procurement, in footprint, in SG&A. So if you want to say, so '15 was largely a restructuring and synergy play. It is, however, important to note that the fact that we held the top line in year 1 in a post-merger integration is a big deal, because [indiscernible] would see, in such competitive environment that you're being attacked from all sides. And we even grow it. And some people asked us about the different pieces. Even if you would break down the 2 legacy business, both elements grow organically, which again, is a big deal in Year 1 after such a complex integration. Now shifting gears into '16, again, the cost side are carryover benefits and certain restructuring initiatives, which we have just initiated and announced. So that just gives you an unusual high amount of confidence, because you're not relying on certain raw material assumptions, whatever, it's in your control. And I would say of margin improvement and profit in Europe for '16, it's still 70% or 80% is cost-driven. Now you come -- ultimately, it comes back to a question of how much revenue growth can you drive at that brand and product portfolio. I would expect, and I'll come back to more Jeff's point, the long-term plan, in the planning horizon, it's '17, '18. That's when you start seeing the revenue growth coming in. And the simple reason for that one, it just takes a while to have all these product platform integration plans, because that's the most complicated process. And you see, we already put a lot of new products now in the market. The vast majority of a new joint product basically comes '17 and '18. And that's when you should expect the top line growth. Even in the interim, and that's an important thing is, as in one of our biggest attractions of the indices are, why we bought it is ultimately strong country position. There are some, with #1 in 5 of top 7 markets, and very in all transparency by larger driving profit [indiscernible]. Our market share in these top 5 markets has held up or even expanded in the last year. So that's a very, very important achievement for us."

We did have and we talked about some very, very large, new product transitions, which affected millions of volumes -- millions of units of volume, okay? We always have product transitions, so that is not new. And I would say, if the rest of the world was somewhat stable, that you wouldn't have even probably even noticed the impact of the product transition problems we had last year. But the fact of the matter is, we had, in the way I described it, the currency devaluation, and it's part of life, but it is the most impactive moving currencies we've seen ever since we track currency. It cost us over $4 a share. And at the same time, Latin America -- emerging markets in general, particularly Latin America, it seems like a long time ago, but in 2014, we had an all-time record year in Latin America. Last year, 1 year, our earnings were down by $300 million and the cash went down by $300 million. We had record years in every other region in the world. So it wasn't the operational challenges we had on product transition. It was that, on top of dealing with a massive currency issue, a massive decline in demand issue. And it means we had to do a lot of things really well, to still grow earnings by 9% last year. So I guess -- so let's fast forward into this year, and I should say, we did very well on the cost side last year for a host of reasons, including the synergies, the restructuring, raw material markets, et cetera. So coming into this year, what we all have to mention is, we still have big currency and demand headwinds. But they're less than half the size of last year, if things stay as we see them today. We're going to have another great year of cost productivity. And I would say we have no major known operational execution problems today, that like we had a year ago. So it's -- that's, I guess, as clear I could try to be to hopefully address your point."

First of all, often when you look at the numbers, yes, the Canadian market was down 8% in Q4. And put in context, Canadian market in the financial recession did not -- did the best in North America, so it's held up for much longer. But now obviously, there's consumer confidence, oil, the Canadian market is soft, and we do expect it to be soft mostly going forward. In addition to the margin -- and as we, in the investor meeting showed, Canada used to be roughly $1 billion business for us, that was in the old currency exchange rate. So you have a demand-side. And on top of that, the currency move of Canadian dollar has been massive. Keeping in mind there's no production in Canada. So you have a full currency impact. Having said that in context, I think our team were very disciplined cost based price increase, which we already had announced and executed. We maintained a good margin. Unfortunately, at a much lower base. But the margin in Canada is very intact, very robust, but it's just a much lower base. Mexico is a slightly different story. The Mexico market is steady, pretty much slightly down, but it's -- there is not the huge downside as in Canada. Mexico is a top line issue because also your Mexican peso was 18, it's just dramatically devalued. So that has, obviously, a negative impact on the pure revenue side. It doesn't impact us so much on the ongoing margin side, because we're largely -- Mexican production is 60%, local to local production, or 70%."

Our remarks today track with the presentation available on the Investors section of our website at whirlpoolcorp.com. 
Before we begin, let me remind you that as we conduct this call, we will be making forward-looking statements to assist you in understanding Whirlpool Corporation's future expectations. Our actual results could differ materially from these statements due to many factors discussed on our latest 10-K and our other periodic reports as well as on Slide 1 and in the appendix of this presentation. 
Turning to Slide 2. We want to remind you that today's presentation includes non-GAAP financial measures. We believe these measures are important indicators of our operations as they exclude items that may not be indicative of or are unrelated to results from our ongoing business operations. We also think the adjusted measures will provide you with a better baseline for analyzing trends in our ongoing business operations. Listeners are directed to the appendix section of our presentation beginning on Slide 36 for the reconciliation of non-GAAP items to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Jeff."

As you saw in our press release this morning, we reported record revenue, ongoing profit and earnings per share for full year 2015. 
Overall, our integration activities in Europe and Asia progressed well and as planned, we delivered significant integration benefits, both in the fourth quarter and for the full year. Our ability to deliver these record results, despite significant volatility in the global economic environment, does demonstrate the strength of our execution and the benefits of our larger global operating platform. 
If you turn to Slide 5, I will review the 2015 financial results, where you see that we delivered strong revenue growth for the year. Our revenues were up 5% versus last year and 18% excluding currency impact. Our ongoing business earnings were a record $12.38 per share and as we expected, we delivered $620 million in free cash flow. 
Turning to Slide 6, you can see our priority -- our 2016 priorities in what we expect to be another record year. We do believe that the challenges we successfully managed in 2015 will carry over into 2016. And by that, we mean we expect the emerging markets will continue to be weak or decline, but we do see that largely offset by growth in our developed markets. We also anticipate that this strong dollar era that we're experiencing will continue into this year. So within this environment, our focus in 2016 is to continue to grow revenues and we see great opportunities to expand our operating margins. 
We plan to invest to grow globally in both our core appliance business and adjacent businesses. We will deliver significant new product innovations in the market. And we continue to expect to deliver very strong cost productivity. 
So turning to Slide 7 where we show our guidance for 2016. We expect to deliver ongoing earnings per share of $14 to $14.75 a share, which represents 15%-plus growth versus last year. We also expect free cash flow generation of between $700 million to $800 million, which is a substantial improvement versus the prior year. 
And while 2015 was a year where we faced several challenges, I think we were able to demonstrate our ability to create value for our shareholders through strong operational execution in this environment. And our current guidance reflects our expectation that this level of execution will continue as we do expect to deliver another year of record results in 2016. 
So at this point, I'd like to turn it over to Marc Bitzer to review our global operations."

Turning to Slide 9, we will review North America's performance in the fourth quarter. As emphasized in our last earnings call, our strategy in North America has not changed. We performed perfectly in line with our",1063,"Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 9, we will review North America's performance in the fourth quarter. As emphasized in our last earnings call, our strategy in North America has not changed. We performed perfectly in line with our expectations as we grew revenues and substantially expanded margins in the fourth quarter. 
We grew our revenue 6.2%, excluding currency, and expanded operating margin to 12.4%, an all-time record. As expected, with our recently launched product fully available and nearly fully floored, the investments we made to drive growth in our U.S. business delivered sequential T6 market share improvement in the fourth quarter. 
In addition to leverage from its revenue growth, our very strong operating margins in the fourth quarter were driven by our ongoing cost productivity programs and favorable mix from our new product introductions, which more than offset nearly $30 million in unfavorable currency impacts in Canada and Mexico.
Turning to Slide 10, we outline our 2016 operation priorities for the North America region. Our expectation is that the industry will continue to show strong 5% annual growth behind improved housing trends and consumer sentiment. And we expect to grow our revenues at/or above industry levels. We also expect to continue accelerating growth of our new products to capitalize on this increased consumer demand and to drive improved price/mix and revenue growth. 
Our strong cost productivity programs will continue to drive margin improvement and remain focused on growing outside the core. We anticipate that these actions will more than offset a point of margin impact from negative currency based on today's rate for the Canadian dollar and Mexican peso. We expect to deliver operating margins between 11.5% and 12.5%, which is fully in line with our long-term goals and the number improvement over prior year. 
I will now share the fourth quarter result for our Europe, Middle East and Africa region as shown on Slide 11. Sales were $1.5 billion compared to $1.7 billion in the prior year. Excluding currencies, sales were up 8.1%. Ongoing operating profit was $88 million compared to $101 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. 
During the fourth quarter, strong execution of our integration plans and ongoing cost productivity mostly offset $45 million in unfavorable currency impacts as well as the impact of a significant industry decline in Russia. 
Last year, we saw an unusually strong fourth quarter in Russia as trading consumers bought heavily ahead of the devaluation. As planned and expected, we also invested in marketing technology and products this quarter. 
For the full year, we delivered 4.5% operating margin, which is fully consistent with our guidance at the beginning of the year in spite of $160 million in currency impacts and weaker demand in Eastern Europe. 
On Slide 12, as we look to our -- the full year 2016, our priorities remain unchanged, with a strong focus on integration activities, ongoing cost productivity and growth from new products both within and beyond the core. We expect industry to be approximately flat to 2%, primarily driven by continued strong demand in Western Europe. 
Based on today's rates, weakness in the ruble and euro will continue, but we plan to more than offset over a point of margin impact from currency through ongoing cost productivity and acquisition synergies. Overall, we expect operating margins to be between 7% and 8% for the year, which is a number substantial to year-over-year improvement and very consistent to this and even ahead of our long-term goals. 
Now we'll discuss our Latin America results on Slide 13. Sales for the quarter were $845 million. Excluding the impact of currencies, sales decreased 8%. 
Our operating profit for the quarter totaled $58 million or nearly 7% of sales, which represents a substantial improvement in operating margin versus the prior 2 quarters. These margin levels are a clear indication that we had readjusted our business for today's operating environment through already deployed price/mix actions and cost and capacity reductions. 
On Slide 14, we summarize our priorities in Latin America. We expect demand through continued volatility and are fully prepared to deploy further actions if necessary. We will continue to invest in new products, grow our business out of Brazil core appliances and are well positioned to capitalize in growth in Brazil, then demand does return. 
We expect industry decline of 10% and based on today's rate, a 0.5 point of margin impact from currency primarily in the first half of the year. 
For growth in our non-Brazil operations, the benefits of previously announced cost base price increases, implemented reduction of fixed costs and improved mix from our new products, we expect to mitigate both currency and demand impacts. 
Based on our expectations of demand down 10% and the Brazilian real at current spot rates, and this is a benefit of our offsetting actions for 2016, we expect operating margins between 6.5% and 7.5% despite lower revenue due to the currency and emerging market demand. 
Now we turn to our fourth quarter results in the Asia region, which are shown on Slide 15. Net sales were $312 million in comparison to $282 million in the prior year period. Excluding the impact of currency, our sales increased 15%. 
Our fourth quarter ongoing operating profit was $11 million compared to $17 million in the prior year period. Ongoing operating margin was 3.6%, driven by record margins in India and integration benefits in China that were offset by a weak demand and increased product and marketing measurements. While these investments in China temporarily reduced our margins in the fourth quarter, we expect them to lead to strong growth in margins in the future. 
Turning to Slide 16, we're showing our 2016 priorities for Asia operations. We will continue to focus on distribution expansion and ongoing cost productivity programs. Our expectation is for flat industry growth in the region. For additional clarity about our assumptions, we are forecasting a 5% industry growth in India and a 2% to 3% industry decline in China. Overall, we expect strong margin performance of 7% to 8%, driven by our larger growth platform and the benefits of our strong innovation pipeline. 
On Slide 17, we summarize our regional margin goals. We expect 2016 to be another year of record performance and see opportunities for strong margin expansions in all regions. 
And now I'd like to turn it over to Larry."

As Jeff mentioned, we had a solid year of performance. You may recall that we entered the year with significant currency headwinds and weakened emerging market demand. Given these challenges, our first half ongoin",828,"Thanks, Marc, and good morning, everyone. As Jeff mentioned, we had a solid year of performance. You may recall that we entered the year with significant currency headwinds and weakened emerging market demand. Given these challenges, our first half ongoing earnings of approximately $4.85 per share were flat with 2014. However, based on the actions we took throughout the year, we were able to deliver second half ongoing earnings of $7.55 per share, which is up 15% from last year's results. Our second half earnings momentum and our fourth quarter run rate entering 2016 are solid. 
Turning to our fourth quarter results on Slides 19 and 20, revenues were $5.6 billion. Currency had a $700 million top line impact, but excluding currency, sales were up 4%. 
We achieved all-time record ongoing earnings of $4.10 per share, driven by acquisition synergies and ongoing cost productivity programs as well as price/mix from new product introductions and previously announced cost base price actions. 
You'll note from the slide that SG&A as a percent of sales on a GAAP basis decreased approximately 1.5 points. While we did make incrementally higher marketing investments this year to support our product introductions, those were more than offset by acquisition synergies and a planned reduction in acquisition-related cost. 
Our effective tax rate for the year was under 21%. This represents approximately a $0.20 improvement versus our prior full year guidance. 
In summary, we are pleased with the results for the quarter. 
Now turning to 2016. We expect another record year. We will continue to be impacted by currency and emerging market demand. However, we are confident in the actions we are taking to offset these headwinds and deliver 15%-plus earnings per share growth in 2016. 
First, on Slide 21, you can see that we absorbed nearly $6 from the combination of emerging market demand weakness and currency devaluation in 2015. As Marc discussed in the regional reviews, our operational focus and additional actions deployed during the year drove record revenue and earnings performance despite these challenges. 
Now turning to Slide 22, we share the 2016 assumptions for emerging market demand and currency headwinds included in our guidance. As Jeff mentioned, based on current exchange rates, we expect currency devaluation to continue, although at a reduced level compared to the prior year. Accordingly, we anticipate a negative impact of approximately $1 billion in sales and $2.50 in earnings per share from currency headwinds. Additionally, we're anticipating continued demand weakness in most emerging markets. As a result, we will offset $0.50 in earnings per share impact from that. 
It's important to note that these emerging market countries now represent 15% of our global sales. 
Finally, on Slides 23 and 25, we summarize key actions that we expect will offset the impact on currency and emerging market demand. We expect another very strong year in total cost productivity given material trends, fixed cost reductions taken in Brazil and our normal productivity programs. Our acquisition synergies tied to cost and capacity reduction activities will ramp up during 2016. We expect solid demand trends in developed markets, combined with positive impact from previous and new product launches and growth in adjacent businesses. And our previously announced cost base price increases in Canada, Brazil and Russia are in full effect. 
On Slide 24, you can see an update on the progress of our restructuring and acquisition integration activities. We incurred $200 million in a restructuring expense and delivered $200 million in benefits this year, consistent with previous communications. For 2016, we expect $250 million in expense and continue to expect $175 million in benefits. 
On Slide 26, we highlight the cadence of Half 1 versus Half 2 earnings drivers we just addressed. First, given historical seasonality, volume is stronger in the second half of the year. In addition, we should have lower currency headwinds in the back half of the year based on current rates. Traditionally, we see much stronger seasonality in our cost productivity programs in the second half of the year and our acquisition synergies will ramp up throughout the year. As a result, we would expect full year earnings seasonality to approximate 40% in the first half and 60% in the second half. 
On Slide 27, our 2016 guidance should deliver record ongoing earnings of $14 to $14.75 per share, a 15% increase year-over-year. We are forecasting approximately $700 million to $800 million in free cash flow, which includes planned cash outlays of up to $200 million in restructuring related to the acquisitions, $150 million related to our previously announced product warranty cost to Europe and capital spending of between $700 million to $750 million. 
Our priorities for cash deployment have not changed as shown on Slide 28. We did repurchase $155 million of stock during the fourth quarter and have $225 million remaining on our existing authorization. We expect to complete our current share repurchase authorization this year. 
Now I'd like to turn it back over to Jeff."
314515,322524016,923821,"Whirlpool Corp., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 29, 2016",2016-01-29,"Earnings Calls","Whirlpool Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Larry. I'd now like to take a moment to update you on our long-range goals that we first outlined at our December 2014 Investor Day conference. Overall, our long-term strategy remains on track and we see tremendous opportunities from our larger",891,"Thanks, Larry. I'd now like to take a moment to update you on our long-range goals that we first outlined at our December 2014 Investor Day conference. 
Overall, our long-term strategy remains on track and we see tremendous opportunities from our larger global footprint, our leading position in key markets around the world, our continuation of stepping up levels of new product innovation, our strong brand portfolio with 7 powerful brands, each with over $1 billion in revenues, and over the mid- to longer-term, we do believe that our leading positions in several key emerging markets will be a great advantage for us. 
So then turning to Slide 31, I would like to summarize our updated management goals. And again, as we discussed earlier last year and carrying it over to this year, we are -- have been hit by declines in emerging market demands and significant currency devaluations. And this is really the only driver of our change in goals because this had us have a large impact on our original sales goal. As a result, we now believe we can grow our revenues to $23 billion to $24 billion in sales by 2018 versus our previous goal of $26 billion to $28 billion. And again, the difference is essentially all purely from currency translation because we have rapidly adjusted to the changed global environment through our previously announced cost base price increases, fixed cost reductions and continued investment in new product innovation. And we will continue to do so as we go forward. 
We are offsetting these impacts previously discussed with what I believe is very strong operational execution. And as a result, we still expect to deliver operating margins consistent with our 2018 goals. So we haven't changed our view at all that we can deliver double-digit operating margins globally. And with that, we expect to reach also our goal of doubling our free cash flow by 2018. 
In total, this will lead to strong earnings growth, and we now plan to deliver strong growth in earnings per share to $20 to $22 per share in 2018. Again, the difference between this and the previous is simply a reduction in revenues due to currency. 
These revised targets would represent an improvement of 60% to 80% over today's levels of earnings and represent exceptionally strong value creation. 
As always, there are risk of us putting in an out long-range goals like this. But I think as we've demonstrated last year, we have been able to adjust the environment and still deliver strong results. 
So turning to Slide 32. You can very specifically see the drivers in our ongoing earnings per share improvements. And again, we have multiple paths to drive value creation. We'll drive it through growth, acquisition synergies and cost productivities. And these big levers that we outlined in December of 2014 have not changed. We are on track with our acquisition synergies in Europe, and we expect an additional $2 to $3 per share in benefits by 2018. 
We are assuming demand in emerging markets like Brazil, Russia and China begin to stabilize in 2017 but likely only drive moderate recovery growth during this planning cycle and we don't expect to see that until 2018. Additionally, demand in the U.S. is rebounding, consistent with our Investor Day assumptions, and we continue to see solid growth in our adjacent businesses. 
We also now are seeing more and more growth, which is enabled by our Indesit and China acquisitions, which are now part of our baseline revenue assumptions. 
And finally, and importantly, from a cost productivity perspective, we fully expect to continue with strong ongoing annual productivity improvements in addition to the benefits from favorable input costs that we're currently seeing and we see great opportunities to further leverage benefits from our global operating platform. And I think over the last couple years, we've had a good track record of delivering on those type of benefits. 
So to sum up, we do expect to grow our earnings per share by nearly 60% to 80% over the next 3 years to between $20 and $22 per share. 
And then on Slide 33, you could see the walk on how we expect to double our free cash flow. And as you can see from this chart, cash flow growth is largely earnings-driven. Working capital is just a bit higher due to growth in the business. We don't expect any fundamental changes in our rate of capital expenditures, which run about 3.5%, and this has not changed. 
So turning to Slide 34, I'll just reconfirm, we are committed to achieving our vision of becoming the best global brand and consumer products company. As a reminder, we are #1 globally in 3 out of the 4 regions in the world. We're the largest Western company in Asia. We have a top market position in 5 of the top 7 largest appliance markets in Europe, and we also have the #1 position in U.S., Canada and Brazil. 
So in total, we have very high confidence that our growth plans give us an outstanding opportunity to continue driving significant shareholder returns. And we believe 2016 will be a strong step forward towards reaching our 2018 goals. 
So with that, I will end our formal remarks and we would like to open it up for questions."

I mean, there are 3 or perhaps 4 segments you can look at in that business. The most impacted, for all the reasons we talked about, is the Brazilian appliance business because of the currency and because of demand being down almost 25%, with the expectation -- so that's where the heavy hit. But I would say, and it's -- I think I said this before, we've been in the Brazil market for over 60 years and we've never lost money in that market and we continue to be in a positive profit position. So even in that tough situation -- but our margins were hurt very badly in appliances. In our adjacent businesses, other than offsetting the inflation, they have remained intact. Embraco, which is our global compressor business, was hurt by demand in emerging markets and currency but not nearly as much, and we had a reasonably good year in Embraco. And LAR International, I would just say that it got hit by all the same currency -- the currency devaluations came at different times. We have a big position, for example, in Colombia. Colombia peso has devalued by 50%. Late in the year, Argentina obviously devalued. So we adjust, but there's a larger basket of countries to do. So those margins, although hurt some, were not hurt as bad. So the predominant work, I would say, has been to do, which we've already announced, the cost base price increases, which we've already announced and carried over into this year. We've done a significant fixed cost reduction, almost 30%, I think. We drive the heck out of productivity, but we still have to offset inflation and negative demand. So -- and I think Marc said it exactly correct. If you based on our assumption of today's spot in currency and the market going down another 10%, we feel pretty good about our ability to improve our margins. If we have another round of volatility, we'll have to adjust again, and we're fully prepared to do that."

And we do look at total cost, which is comprised of our synergies, our restructuring as well as our ongoing productivity, which includes change in raw material cost. And as we talk about -- and by the way, that we think that's the best way to look at it because that gives you a net number which you ought to expect to see in the P&L or in the margins, which is what we show. The challenge talking about, which caused a little bit of confusion last year, is when you have this volatility in currency, we certainly saw lower net material cost last year, I think we said over $100 million. But we also had -- part of that -- the actual gross number was higher than that, but it's offset by currency increases in markets like Brazil and Russia and so on and so forth. So bottom line is, we're going to have a big year of productivity. If you look at the margin walk, it's roughly, between all of those factors, it's about a $400 million reduction, of which, I would suspect, net, and that really depends on what currency raw materials ought to be, we ought to expect the same kind of improvement that we saw this year."

Let me actually start with -- first off by saying that we're very pleased with our North America Q4. And I know there were some concerns out there, but these results would have quiet down a lot of concerns. Let me, first of all, on the units, because you mentioned the 3% unit. First of all, and we said that in a number of previous calls, our unit shipments are not comparable to what is AHAM published numbers because we include a lot more now units. So the numbers are not fully comparable. Having said that, what you can compare is our unit growth versus our organic excess growth, so the 3% versus 6%. And you're exactly right, I mean, that shows you just how strong our price/mix was, which is the full result of disciplined promotion management and finally, results of our new product introductions. So to have that kind of lift in such a promotion environment is an achievement we're very proud of. Now let me put it in broader context off the fourth quarter. Again, we delivered good ex currency revenue growth, 6%, record margin of 12.4%, which is exactly what we said we would do, drive growth and margin expansion. What is also important to note, we had ex currency revenue growth in all our business units, so Canada, Mexico, more domestic, major store appliances, which also means, we had sequential market share growth Q4 compared to Q3, which is something which, as you know, we've been driving for very hard. So now with regards to your question about our expectations for next year's market. As you know, we guide industry to 5%. As I also said in my prepared remarks, we fully expect to grow our revenue in line or above that market assumption. That's what we guide to, and that's our expectation based on run rates which we have developed, based on new product introductions. So we're -- I think we'd say very confident behind these assumptions. Towards -- the comment towards the broader industry assumption about 5%. As you know, we, as we guided into '15, we initially came out before and we lift it to 5%, 5 plus percent, the final was 6.5%. Beginning of the year many people questioned if North America would come to these growth levels and North America, as an industry, did. Med is still largely driven, the confidence for 5% is, we still do believe the housing is, at best midpoint of a housing recovery, in terms of cycle. We do see consumer sentiment becoming bigger. We do see wealth creation on the mid- and lower income levels. And so all these factors, if you put it in our macroeconomic model, you have a lot of confidence behind the 5% industry growth."

As you know, we guided at the beginning of '15 to 4% to 5%, and we hit exactly the midpoints. I would say, probably not -- some people may be surprised that we're guiding now towards 7% or 8%, which as you recall, that was pretty much our target in Investor Day. We are fully confident in the mid- 7% to 8%, and the confidence comes from, we do see the benefits from restructuring synergies and ongoing cost productivity. So which, as you know, when you're running a business, if you have a confidence in cost, that gives you a lot of confidence. It's just much more predicable than any top line assumptions. And if you look at '15, that was largely cost, total cost driven, and we know we have a momentum, we know we have agreement on certain restructuring activities and that carries into '16. You will also note that our volume assumption for industry is actually not overly bullish, it's 0% to 2%. And frankly, that magnitude between 0% and 2% is entirely driven by what happens to Russia. So we basically, we're not overly bullish on Russia. If Russia comes around faster, which we've seen in prior decades, or in cycles, then you could see it offset versus 2%, but that's a big assumption right now. But again, on Europe, in our view, on all quarters, we delivered like a clockwork, and that gives us a lot of confidence for '16 as well. On Latin America, Mike[ph] expected Jeff's comments. First of all, let me underline, Latin America is obviously heavily influenced by what assumptions you take on Brazil industry growth and the real. So on today's spot rate of real, and with the assumption that Brazil goes down another 10%, which pretty much will be consistent with what we see right now, so further deterioration of the marketplace, based on ROI, taking cost actions and price/mix, which we have already deployed, we are very confident to hit that 6.5% to 7.%, which is, by the way, is not too far away from what we had in Q4. So it's not like we -- from a run rate perspective, it's not like we're planning for a huge step up. But again, I want to reiterate that this big assumption about the real exchange rates, and we've seen dramatic moves this year, and it's a big assumption about the industry."

There was laundry, there was pretty much the entire refrigeration line, which was driven by energy standards. So we had -- we are behind an unusual high amount of product introductions, which, of course, always has a certain impact on the top line. It's not just availability, it's just the ramp-up, ramp down, reflooring. Whenever you do that, you have an impact. The availability supply chain for x factories is fully restored.

It's clear, and it's been clear for some time that General Electric would sell their appliance business, so the global people that you would expect to look at it had plenty of time to look at it. And obviously, they wound up get a substantially improved offer from Haier. And so from that standpoint, they'll go through their process and we'll know in 4, 5, 6 months how that's going to turn out. But the question is, have we seen any changes? No. I mean, we compete with both companies. Haier's a very substantial competitor in China, very successful, very -- and it's created value doing that, General Electric has been a very good and tough competitor in the U.S. for forever. So Chinese companies have been willing to have a good market position in the U.S., this is an attractive opportunity. And they apparently agreed, and that's probably why they paid the price they did."

Let me first try to explain what happened in '15 and then maybe give an indication for '16 and how that lead dynamics come together. If you just look at the full year P&L in Europe, you'll realize there's -- if you take up a currency impact, there's a small revenue growth, but it -- the margin growth expansion came largely from the cost side, to be very straightforward. And the cost side, on the other hand, yes, there's some ongoing productivity coming from raw materials, which in the case for Europe is largely offset through an active currency, that's a transactional impact. So the net bulk comes largely from realizing the synergies in procurement, in footprint, in SG&A. So if you want to say, so '15 was largely a restructuring and synergy play. It is, however, important to note that the fact that we held the top line in year 1 in a post-merger integration is a big deal, because you typically would see, in such competitive environment that you're being attacked from all sides. And we even grow it. And some people asked us about the different pieces. Even if you would break down the 2 legacy pieces, both elements grow organically, which again, is a big deal in Year 1 after such a complex integration. Now shifting gears into '16, again, the cost side are carryover benefits and certain restructuring initiatives, which we have just initiated and announced. So that just gives you an unusual high amount of confidence, because you're not relying on certain raw material assumptions, whatever, it's in your control. And I would say of margin improvement and profit in Europe for '16, it's still 70% or 80% is cost-driven. Now you come -- ultimately, it comes back to a question of how much revenue growth can you drive at that brand and product portfolio. I would expect, and I'll come back to more Jeff's point, the long-term plan, in the planning horizon, it's '17, '18. That's when you start seeing the revenue growth coming in. And the simple reason for that one, it just takes a while to have all these product platform integration plans, because that's the most complicated process. And you see, we already put a lot of new products now in the market. The vast majority of a new joint product basically comes '17 and '18. And that's when you should expect the top line growth. Even in the interim, and that's an important thing is, as in one of our biggest attractions of the indices are, why we bought it is ultimately strong country position. There are some, with #1 in 5 of top 7 markets, and very in all transparency by larger driving profit of Europe. Our market share in these top 5 markets has held up or even expanded in the last year. So that's a very, very important achievement for us."

We did have and we talked about some very, very large, new product transitions, which affected millions of volumes -- millions of units of volume, okay? We always have product transitions, so that is not new. And I would say, if the rest of the world was somewhat stable, that you wouldn't have even probably even noticed the impact of the product transition problems we had last year. But the fact of the matter is, we had, in the way I described it, the currency devaluation, and it's part of life, but it is the most impactive moving currencies we've seen ever since we track currency. It cost us over $4 a share. And at the same time, Latin America -- emerging markets in general, particularly Latin America, it seems like a long time ago, but in 2014, we had an all-time record year in Latin America. Last year, 1 year, our earnings were down by $300 million and the cash went down by $300 million. We had record years in every other region in the world. So it wasn't the operational challenges we had on product transition. It was that, on top of dealing with a massive currency issue, a massive decline in demand issue. And it means we had to do a lot of things really well, to still grow earnings by 9% last year. So I guess -- so let's fast forward into this year, and I should say, we did very well on the cost side last year for a host of reasons, including the synergies, the restructuring, raw material markets, et cetera. So coming into this year, what we all have to mention is, we still have big currency and demand headwinds. But they're less than half the size of last year, if things stay as we see them today. We're going to have another great year of cost productivity. And I would say we have no major known operational execution problems today, that like we had a year ago. So it's -- that's, I guess, as clear I could try to be to hopefully address your point."

But now obviously, there's consumer confidence, oil, the Canadian market is soft, and we do expect it to be soft mostly going forward. In addition to the margin -- and as we, in the investor meeting showed, Canada used to be roughly $1 billion business for us, that was in the old currency exchange rate. So you have a demand-side. And on top of that, the currency move of Canadian dollar has been massive. Keeping in mind there's no production in Canada. So you have a full currency impact. Having said that in context, I think our teams were very disciplined cost based price increase, which we already had announced and executed. We maintained a good margin. Unfortunately, at a much lower base. But the margin in Canada is very intact, very robust, but it's just a much lower base. Mexico is a slightly different story. The Mexico market is steady, pretty much slightly down, but it's -- there is not the huge downside as in Canada. Mexico is a top line issue because also your Mexican peso was 18, it's just dramatically devalued. So that has, obviously, a negative impact on the pure revenue side. It doesn't impact us so much on the ongoing margin side, because we're largely -- Mexican production is 60%, local to local production, or 70%."

Our remarks today track with the presentation available on the Investors section of our website at whirlpoolcorp.com. 
Before we begin, let me remind you that as we conduct this call, we will be making forward-looking statements to assist you in understanding Whirlpool Corporation's future expectations. Our actual results could differ materially from these statements due to many factors discussed on our latest 10-K and our other periodic reports as well as on Slide 1 and in the appendix of this presentation. 
Turning to Slide 2. We want to remind you that today's presentation includes non-GAAP financial measures. We believe these measures are important indicators of our operations as they exclude items that may not be indicative of or are unrelated to results from our ongoing business operations. We also think the adjusted measures will provide you with a better baseline for analyzing trends in our ongoing business operations. Listeners are directed to the appendix section of our presentation beginning on Slide 36 for the reconciliation of non-GAAP items to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Jeff."

As you saw in our press release this morning, we reported record revenue, ongoing profit and earnings per share for full year 2015. 
Overall, our integration activities in Europe and Asia progressed well and as planned, we delivered significant integration benefits, both in the fourth quarter and for the full year. Our ability to deliver these record results, despite significant volatility in the global economic environment, does demonstrate the strength of our execution and the benefits of our larger global operating platform. 
If you turn to Slide 5, I will review the 2015 financial results, where you see that we delivered strong revenue growth for the year. Our revenues were up 5% versus last year and 18% excluding currency impact. Our ongoing business earnings were a record $12.38 per share and as we expected, we delivered $620 million in free cash flow. 
Turning to Slide 6, you can see our priority -- our 2016 priorities in what we expect to be another record year. We do believe that the challenges we successfully managed in 2015 will carry over into 2016. And by that, we mean we expect the emerging markets will continue to be weak or decline, but we do see that largely offset by growth in our developed markets. We also anticipate that this strong dollar era that we're experiencing will continue into this year. So within this environment, our focus in 2016 is to continue to grow revenues and we see great opportunities to expand our operating margins. 
We plan to invest to grow globally in both our core appliance business and adjacent businesses. We will deliver significant new product innovations in the market. And we continue to expect to deliver very strong cost productivity. 
So turning to Slide 7 where we show our guidance for 2016. We expect to deliver ongoing earnings per share of $14 to $14.75 a share, which represents 15%-plus growth versus last year. We also expect free cash flow generation of between $700 million to $800 million, which is a substantial improvement versus the prior year. 
And while 2015 was a year where we faced several challenges, I think we were able to demonstrate our ability to create value for our shareholders through strong operational execution in this environment. And our current guidance reflects our expectation that this level of execution will continue as we do expect to deliver another year of record results in 2016. 
So at this point, I'd like to turn it over to Marc Bitzer to review our global operations."

We performed perfectly in line with our",1063,"Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 9, we will review North America's performance in the fourth quarter. As emphasized in our last earnings call, our strategy in North America has not changed. We performed perfectly in line with our expectations as we grew revenues and substantially expanded margins in the fourth quarter. 
We grew our revenue 6.2%, excluding currency, and expanded operating margin to 12.4%, an all-time record. As expected, with our recently launched product fully available and nearly fully floored, the investments we made to drive growth in our U.S. business delivered sequential T6 market share improvement in the fourth quarter. 
In addition to leverage from its revenue growth, our very strong operating margins in the fourth quarter were driven by our ongoing cost productivity programs and favorable mix from our new product introductions, which more than offset nearly $30 million in unfavorable currency impacts in Canada and Mexico.
Turning to Slide 10, we outline our 2016 operation priorities for the North America region. Our expectation is that the industry will continue to show strong 5% annual growth behind improved housing trends and consumer sentiment. And we expect to grow our revenues at/or above industry levels. We also expect to continue accelerating growth of our new products to capitalize on this increased consumer demand and to drive improved price/mix and revenue growth. 
Our strong cost productivity programs will continue to drive margin improvement and remain focused on growing outside the core. We anticipate that these actions will more than offset a point of margin impact from negative currency based on today's rate for the Canadian dollar and Mexican peso. We expect to deliver operating margins between 11.5% and 12.5%, which is fully in line with our long-term goals and the number improvement over prior year. 
I will now share the fourth quarter result for our Europe, Middle East and Africa region as shown on Slide 11. Sales were $1.5 billion compared to $1.7 billion in the prior year. Excluding currencies, sales were up 8.1%. Ongoing operating profit was $88 million compared to $101 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. 
During the fourth quarter, strong execution of our integration plans and ongoing cost productivity mostly offset $45 million in unfavorable currency impacts as well as the impact of a significant industry decline in Russia. 
Last year, we saw an unusually strong fourth quarter in Russia as trading consumers bought heavily ahead of the devaluation. As planned and expected, we also invested in marketing technology and products this quarter. 
For the full year, we delivered 4.5% operating margin, which is fully consistent with our guidance at the beginning of the year in spite of $160 million in currency impacts and weaker demand in Eastern Europe. 
On Slide 12, as we look to our -- the full year 2016, our priorities remain unchanged, with a strong focus on integration activities, ongoing cost productivity and growth from new products both within and beyond the core. We expect industry to be approximately flat to 2%, primarily driven by continued strong demand in Western Europe. 
Based on today's rates, weakness in the ruble and euro will continue, but we plan to more than offset over a point of margin impact from currency through ongoing cost productivity and acquisition synergies. Overall, we expect operating margins to be between 7% and 8% for the year, which is a number substantial to year-over-year improvement and very consistent to this and even ahead of our long-term goals. 
Now we'll discuss our Latin America results on Slide 13. Sales for the quarter were $845 million. Excluding the impact of currencies, sales decreased 8%. 
Our operating profit for the quarter totaled $58 million or nearly 7% of sales, which represents a substantial improvement in operating margin versus the prior 2 quarters. These margin levels are a clear indication that we had readjusted our business for today's operating environment through already deployed price/mix actions and cost and capacity reductions. 
On Slide 14, we summarize our priorities in Latin America. We expect demand through continued volatility and are fully prepared to deploy further actions if necessary. We will continue to invest in new products, grow our business out of Brazil core appliances and are well positioned to capitalize in growth in Brazil, then demand does return. 
We expect industry decline of 10% and based on today's rate, a 0.5 point of margin impact from currency primarily in the first half of the year. 
For growth in our non-Brazil operations, the benefits of previously announced cost base price increases, implemented reduction of fixed costs and improved mix from our new products, we expect to mitigate both currency and demand impacts. 
Based on our expectations of demand down 10% and the Brazilian real at current spot rates, and this is a benefit of our offsetting actions for 2016, we expect operating margins between 6.5% and 7.5% despite lower revenue due to the currency and emerging market demand. 
Now we turn to our fourth quarter results in the Asia region, which are shown on Slide 15. Net sales were $312 million in comparison to $282 million in the prior year period. Excluding the impact of currency, our sales increased 15%. 
Our fourth quarter ongoing operating profit was $11 million compared to $17 million in the prior year period. Ongoing operating margin was 3.6%, driven by record margins in India and integration benefits in China that were offset by a weak demand and increased product and marketing measurements. While these investments in China temporarily reduced our margins in the fourth quarter, we expect them to lead to strong growth in margins in the future. 
Turning to Slide 16, we're showing our 2016 priorities for Asia operations. We will continue to focus on distribution expansion and ongoing cost productivity programs. Our expectation is for flat industry growth in the region. For additional clarity about our assumptions, we are forecasting a 5% industry growth in India and a 2% to 3% industry decline in China. Overall, we expect strong margin performance of 7% to 8%, driven by our larger growth platform and the benefits of our strong innovation pipeline. 
On Slide 17, we summarize our regional margin goals. We expect 2016 to be another year of record performance and see opportunities for strong margin expansions in all regions. 
And now I'd like to turn it over to Larry."

You may recall that we entered the year with significant currency headwinds and weakened emerging market demand. Given these challenges, our first half ongoing earnings of approximately $4.85 per share were flat with 2014. However, based on the actions we took throughout the year, we were able to deliver second half ongoing earnings of $7.55 per share, which is up 15% from last year's results. Our second half earnings momentum and our fourth quarter run rate entering 2016 are solid. 
Turning to our fourth quarter results on Slides 19 and 20, revenues were $5.6 billion. Currency had a $700 million top line impact, but excluding currency, sales were up 4%. 
We achieved all-time record ongoing earnings of $4.10 per share, driven by acquisition synergies and ongoing cost productivity programs as well as price/mix from new product introductions and previously announced cost base price actions. 
You'll note from the slide that SG&A as a percent of sales on a GAAP basis decreased approximately 1.5 points. While we did make incrementally higher marketing investments this year to support our product introductions, those were more than offset by acquisition synergies and a planned reduction in acquisition-related cost. 
Our effective tax rate for the year was under 21%. This represents approximately a $0.20 improvement versus our prior full year guidance. 
In summary, we are pleased with the results for the quarter. 
Now turning to 2016. We expect another record year. We will continue to be impacted by currency and emerging market demand. However, we are confident in the actions we are taking to offset these headwinds and deliver 15%-plus earnings per share growth in 2016. 
First, on Slide 21, you can see that we absorbed nearly $6 from the combination of emerging market demand weakness and currency devaluation in 2015. As Marc discussed in the regional reviews, our operational focus and additional actions deployed during the year drove record revenue and earnings performance despite these challenges. 
Now turning to Slide 22, we share the 2016 assumptions for emerging market demand and currency headwinds included in our guidance. As Jeff mentioned, based on current exchange rates, we expect currency devaluation to continue, although at a reduced level compared to the prior year. Accordingly, we anticipate a negative impact of approximately $1 billion in sales and $2.50 in earnings per share from currency headwinds. Additionally, we're anticipating continued demand weakness in most emerging markets. As a result, we will offset $0.50 in earnings per share impact from that. 
It's important to note that these emerging market countries now represent 15% of our global sales. 
Finally, on Slides 23 and 25, we summarize key actions that we expect will offset the impact on currency and emerging market demand. We expect another very strong year in total cost productivity given material trends, fixed cost reductions taken in Brazil and our normal productivity programs. Our acquisition synergies tied to cost and capacity reduction activities will ramp up during 2016. We expect solid demand trends in developed markets, combined with positive impact from previous and new product launches and growth in adjacent businesses. And our previously announced cost base price increases in Canada, Brazil and Russia are in full effect. 
On Slide 24, you can see an update on the progress of our restructuring and acquisition integration activities. We incurred $200 million in a restructuring expense and delivered $200 million in benefits this year, consistent with previous communications. For 2016, we expect $250 million in expense and continue to expect $175 million in benefits. 
On Slide 26, we highlight the cadence of Half 1 versus Half 2 earnings drivers we just addressed. First, given historical seasonality, volume is stronger in the second half of the year. In addition, we should have lower currency headwinds in the back half of the year based on current rates. Traditionally, we see much stronger seasonality in our cost productivity programs in the second half of the year and our acquisition synergies will ramp up throughout the year. As a result, we would expect full year earnings seasonality to approximate 40% in the first half and 60% in the second half. 
On Slide 27, our 2016 guidance should deliver record ongoing earnings of $14 to $14.75 per share, a 15% increase year-over-year. We are forecasting approximately $700 million to $800 million in free cash flow, which includes planned cash outlays of up to $200 million in restructuring related to the acquisitions, $150 million related to our previously announced product warranty cost to Europe and capital spending of between $700 million to $750 million. 
Our priorities for cash deployment have not changed as shown on Slide 28. We did repurchase $155 million of stock during the fourth quarter and have $225 million remaining on our existing authorization. We expect to complete our current share repurchase authorization this year. 
Now I'd like to turn it back over to Jeff."

I'd now like to take a moment to update you on our long-range goals that we first outlined at our December 2014 Investor Day conference. Overall, our long-term strategy remains on track and we see tremendous opportunities from our larger",891,"Thanks, Larry. I'd now like to take a moment to update you on our long-range goals that we first outlined at our December 2014 Investor Day conference. 
Overall, our long-term strategy remains on track and we see tremendous opportunities from our larger global footprint, our leading position in key markets around the world, our continuation of stepping up levels of new product innovation, our strong brand portfolio with 7 powerful brands, each with over $1 billion in revenues, and over the mid- to longer-term, we do believe that our leading positions in several key emerging markets will be a great advantage for us. 
So then turning to Slide 31, I would like to summarize our updated management goals. And again, as we discussed earlier last year and carrying it over to this year, we are -- have been hit by declines in emerging market demands and significant currency devaluations. And this is really the only driver of our change in goals because this had us have a large impact on our original sales goal. As a result, we now believe we can grow our revenues to $23 billion to $24 billion in sales by 2018 versus our previous goal of $26 billion to $28 billion. And again, the difference is essentially all purely from currency translation because we have rapidly adjusted to the changed global environment through our previously announced cost base price increases, fixed cost reductions and continued investment in new product innovation. And we will continue to do so as we go forward. 
We are offsetting these impacts previously discussed with what I believe is very strong operational execution. And as a result, we still expect to deliver operating margins consistent with our 2018 goals. So we haven't changed our view at all that we can deliver double-digit operating margins globally. And with that, we expect to reach also our goal of doubling our free cash flow by 2018. 
In total, this will lead to strong earnings growth, and we now plan to deliver strong growth in earnings per share to $20 to $22 per share in 2018. Again, the difference between this and the previous is simply a reduction in revenues due to currency. 
These revised targets would represent an improvement of 60% to 80% over today's levels of earnings and represent exceptionally strong value creation. 
As always, there are risk of us putting in an out long-range goals like this. But I think as we've demonstrated last year, we have been able to adjust the environment and still deliver strong results. 
So turning to Slide 32. You can very specifically see the drivers in our ongoing earnings per share improvements. And again, we have multiple paths to drive value creation. We'll drive it through growth, acquisition synergies and cost productivities. And these big levers that we outlined in December of 2014 have not changed. We are on track with our acquisition synergies in Europe, and we expect an additional $2 to $3 per share in benefits by 2018. 
We are assuming demand in emerging markets like Brazil, Russia and China begin to stabilize in 2017 but likely only drive moderate recovery growth during this planning cycle and we don't expect to see that until 2018. Additionally, demand in the U.S. is rebounding, consistent with our Investor Day assumptions, and we continue to see solid growth in our adjacent businesses. 
We also now are seeing more and more growth, which is enabled by our Indesit and China acquisitions, which are now part of our baseline revenue assumptions. 
And finally, and importantly, from a cost productivity perspective, we fully expect to continue with strong ongoing annual productivity improvements in addition to the benefits from favorable input costs that we're currently seeing and we see great opportunities to further leverage benefits from our global operating platform. And I think over the last couple years, we've had a good track record of delivering on those type of benefits. 
So to sum up, we do expect to grow our earnings per share by nearly 60% to 80% over the next 3 years to between $20 and $22 per share. 
And then on Slide 33, you could see the walk on how we expect to double our free cash flow. And as you can see from this chart, cash flow growth is largely earnings-driven. Working capital is just a bit higher due to growth in the business. We don't expect any fundamental changes in our rate of capital expenditures, which run about 3.5%, and this has not changed. 
So turning to Slide 34, I'll just reconfirm, we are committed to achieving our vision of becoming the best global brand and consumer products company. As a reminder, we are #1 globally in 3 out of the 4 regions in the world. We're the largest Western company in Asia. We have a top market position in 5 of the top 7 largest appliance markets in Europe, and we also have the #1 position in U.S., Canada and Brazil. 
So in total, we have very high confidence that our growth plans give us an outstanding opportunity to continue driving significant shareholder returns. And we believe 2016 will be a strong step forward towards reaching our 2018 goals. 
So with that, I will end our formal remarks and we would like to open it up for questions."

I mean, there are 3 or perhaps 4 segments you can look at in that business. The most impacted, for all the reasons we talked about, is the Brazilian appliance business because of the currency and because of demand being down almost 25%, with the expectation -- so that's where the heavy hit. But I would say, and it's -- I think I said this before, we've been in the Brazil market for over 60 years and we've never lost money in that market and we continue to be in a positive profit position. So even in that tough situation -- but our margins were hurt very badly in appliances. In our adjacent businesses, other than offsetting the inflation, they have remained intact. Embraco, which is our global compressor business, was hurt by demand in emerging markets and currency but not nearly as much, and we had a reasonably good year in Embraco. And LAR International, I would just say that it got hit by all the same currency -- the currency devaluations came at different times. We have a big position, for example, in Colombia. Colombia peso has devalued by 50%. Late in the year, Argentina obviously devalued. So we adjust, but there's a larger basket of countries to do. So those margins, although hurt some, were not hurt as bad. So the predominant work, I would say, has been to do, which we've already announced, the cost base price increases, which we've already announced and carried over into this year. We've done a significant fixed cost reduction, almost 30%, I think. We drive the heck out of productivity, but we still have to offset inflation and negative demand. So -- and I think Marc said it exactly correct. If you based on our assumption of today's spot in currency and the market going down another 10%, we feel pretty good about our ability to improve our margins. If we have another round of volatility, we'll have to adjust again, and we're fully prepared to do that."

And as we talk about -- and by the way, that we think that's the best way to look at it because that gives you a net number which you ought to expect to see in the P&L or in the margins, which is what we show. The challenge talking about, which caused a little bit of confusion last year, is when you have this volatility in currency, we certainly saw lower net material cost last year, I think we said over $100 million. But we also had -- part of that -- the actual gross number was higher than that, but it's offset by currency increases in markets like Brazil and Russia and so on and so forth. So bottom line is, we're going to have a big year of productivity. If you look at the margin walk, it's roughly, between all of those factors, it's about a $400 million reduction, of which, I would suspect, net, and that really depends on what currency raw materials ought to be, we ought to expect the same kind of improvement that we saw this year."

Let me actually start with -- first off by saying that we're very pleased with our North America Q4. And I know there were some concerns out there, but these results would have quiet down a lot of concerns. Let me, first of all, on the units, because you mentioned the 3% unit. First of all, and we said that in a number of previous calls, our unit shipments are not comparable to what is AHAM published numbers because we include a lot more now units. So the numbers are not fully comparable. Having said that, what you can compare is our unit growth versus our organic excess growth, so the 3% versus 6%. And you're exactly right, I mean, that shows you just how strong our price/mix was, which is the full result of disciplined promotion management and finally, results of our new product introductions. So to have that kind of lift in such a promotion environment is an achievement we're very proud of. Now let me put it in broader context off the fourth quarter. Again, we delivered good ex currency revenue growth, 6%, record margin of 12.4%, which is exactly what we said we would do, drive growth and margin expansion. What is also important to note, we had ex currency revenue growth in all our business units, so Canada, Mexico, more domestic, major store appliances, which also means, we had sequential market share growth Q4 compared to Q3, which is something which, as you know, we've been driving for very hard. So now with regards to your question about our expectations for next year's market. As you know, we guide industry to 5%. As I also said in my prepared remarks, we fully expect to grow our revenue in line or above that market assumption. That's what we guide to, and that's our expectation based on run rates which we have developed, based on new product introductions. So we're -- I think we'd say very confident behind these assumptions. Towards -- the comment towards the broader industry assumption about 5%. As you know, we, as we guided into '15, we initially came out before and we lift it to 5%, 5 plus percent, the final was 6.5%. Beginning of the year many people questioned if North America would come to these growth levels and North America, as an industry, did. Med is still largely driven, the confidence for 5% is, we still do believe the housing is, at best midpoint of a housing recovery, in terms of cycle. We do see consumer sentiment becoming bigger. We do see wealth creation on the mid- and lower income levels. And so all these factors, if you put it in our macroeconomic model, you have a lot of confidence behind the 5% industry growth."

And putting aside the fact that we understand things change quickly in emerging markets, what's the likelihood that you can actually achieve positive margin momentum in Latin America? And are you confident that Brazil will not lose money? That's a lot of stuff, but if you could just take it apart, it would be great."

As you know, we guided at the beginning of '15 to 4% to 5%, and we hit exactly the midpoints. I would say, probably not -- some people may be surprised that we're guiding now towards 7% or 8%, which as you recall, that was pretty much our target in Investor Day. We are fully confident in the mid- 7% to 8%, and the confidence comes from, we do see the benefits from restructuring synergies and ongoing cost productivity. So which, as you know, when you're running a business, if you have a confidence in cost, that gives you a lot of confidence. It's just much more predicable than any top line assumptions. And if you look at '15, that was largely cost, total cost driven, and we know we have a momentum, we know we have agreement on certain restructuring activities and that carries into '16. You will also note that our volume assumption for industry is actually not overly bullish, it's 0% to 2%. And frankly, that magnitude between 0% and 2% is entirely driven by what happens to Russia. So we basically, we're not overly bullish on Russia. If Russia comes around faster, which we've seen in prior decades, or in cycles, then you could see it offset versus 2%, but that's a big assumption right now. But again, on Europe, in our view, on all quarters, we delivered like a clockwork, and that gives us a lot of confidence for '16 as well. On Latin America, Mike[ph] expected Jeff's comments. First of all, let me underline, Latin America is obviously heavily influenced by what assumptions you take on Brazil industry growth and the real. So on today's spot rate of real, and with the assumption that Brazil goes down another 10%, which pretty much will be consistent with what we see right now, so further deterioration of the marketplace, based on ROI, taking cost actions and price/mix, which we have already deployed, we are very confident to hit that 6.5% to 7.5%, which is, by the way, is not too far away from what we had in Q4. So it's not like we -- from a run rate perspective, it's not like we're planning for a huge step up. But again, I want to reiterate that this big assumption about the real exchange rates, and we've seen dramatic moves this year, and it's a big assumption about the industry."

To my earlier comment about product introductions, as you were well aware, we had a lot of product introductions the last 18 months in North America. There was laundry, there was pretty much the entire refrigeration line, which was driven by energy standards. So we had -- we are behind an unusual high amount of product introductions, which, of course, always has a certain impact on the top line. It's not just availability, it's just the ramp-up, ramp down, reflooring. Whenever you do that, you have an impact. The availability supply chain for x factories is fully restored.

Let me first try to explain what happened in '15 and then maybe give an indication for '16 and how that lead dynamics come together. If you just look at the full year P&L in Europe, you'll realize there's -- if you take up a currency impact, there's a small revenue growth, but it -- the margin growth expansion came largely from the cost side, to be very straightforward. And the cost side, on the other hand, yes, there's some ongoing productivity coming from raw materials, which in the case for Europe is largely offset through an active currency, that's a transactional impact. So the net bulk comes largely from realizing the synergies in procurement, in footprint, in SG&A. So if you want to say, so '15 was largely a restructuring and synergy play. It is, however, important to note that the fact that we held the top line in year 1 in a post-merger integration is a big deal, because you typically would see, in such competitive environment that you're being attacked from all sides. And we even grow it. And some people asked us about the different pieces. Even if you would break down the 2 legacy pieces, both elements grow organically, which again, is a big deal in Year 1 after such a complex integration. Now shifting gears into '16, again, the cost side are carryover benefits and certain restructuring initiatives, which we have just initiated and announced. So that just gives you an unusual high amount of confidence, because you're not relying on certain raw material assumptions, whatever, it's in your control. And I would say of margin improvement and profit in Europe for '16, it's still 70% or 80% is cost-driven. Now you come -- ultimately, it comes back to a question of how much revenue growth can you drive at that brand and product portfolio. I would expect, and I'll come back to more Jeff's point, the long-term plan, in the planning horizon, it's '17, '18. That's when you start seeing the revenue growth coming in. And the simple reason for that one, it just takes a while to have all these product platform integration plans, because that's the most complicated process. And you see, we already put a lot of new products now in the market. The vast majority of a new joint product basically comes '17 and '18. And that's when you should expect the top line growth. Even in the interim, and that's an important thing is, as in one of our biggest attractions of the indices are, why we bought it is ultimately strong country position. There are some, with #1 in 5 of top 7 markets, and very in all transparency by larger driving profit of Europe. Our market share in these top 5 markets has held up or even expanded in the last year. So that's a very, very important achievement for us."

We always have product transitions, so that is not new. And I would say, if the rest of the world was somewhat stable, that you wouldn't have even probably even noticed the impact of the product transition problems we had last year. But the fact of the matter is, we had, in the way I described it, the currency devaluation, and it's part of life, but it is the most impactive moving currencies we've seen ever since we track currency. It cost us over $4 a share. And at the same time, Latin America -- emerging markets in general, particularly Latin America, it seems like a long time ago, but in 2014, we had an all-time record year in Latin America. Last year, 1 year, our earnings were down by $300 million and the cash went down by $300 million. We had record years in every other region in the world. So it wasn't the operational challenges we had on product transition. It was that, on top of dealing with a massive currency issue, a massive decline in demand issue. And it means we had to do a lot of things really well, to still grow earnings by 9% last year. So I guess -- so let's fast forward into this year, and I should say, we did very well on the cost side last year for a host of reasons, including the synergies, the restructuring, raw material markets, et cetera. So coming into this year, what we all have to mention is, we still have big currency and demand headwinds. But they're less than half the size of last year, if things stay as we see them today. We're going to have another great year of cost productivity. And I would say we have no major known operational execution problems today, that like we had a year ago. So it's -- that's, I guess, as clear I could try to be to hopefully address your point."

But now obviously, there's consumer confidence, oil, the Canadian market is soft, and we do expect it to be soft mostly going forward. In addition to the margin -- and as we, in the investor meeting showed, Canada used to be roughly $1 billion business for us, that was in the old currency exchange rate. So you have a demand-side. And on top of that, the currency move of Canadian dollar has been massive. Keeping in mind there's no production in Canada. So you have a full currency impact. Having said that in context, I think our teams were very disciplined cost based price increase, which we already had announced and executed. We maintained a good margin. Unfortunately, at a much lower base. But the margin in Canada is very intact, very robust, but it's just a much lower base. Mexico is a slightly different story. The Mexico market is steady, pretty much slightly down, but it's -- there is not the huge downside as in Canada. Mexico is a top line issue because also your Mexican peso was 18, it's just dramatically devalued. So that has, obviously, a negative impact on the pure revenue side. It doesn't impact us so much on the ongoing margin side, because we're largely -- Mexican production is 60%, local to local production, or 70%."

Our remarks today track with the presentation available on the Investors section of our website at whirlpoolcorp.com. 
Before we begin, let me remind you that as we conduct this call, we will be making forward-looking statements to assist you in understanding Whirlpool Corporation's future expectations. Our actual results could differ materially from these statements due to many factors discussed on our latest 10-K and our other periodic reports as well as on Slide 1 and in the appendix of this presentation. 
Turning to Slide 2. We want to remind you that today's presentation includes non-GAAP financial measures. We believe these measures are important indicators of our operations as they exclude items that may not be indicative of or are unrelated to results from our ongoing business operations. We also think the adjusted measures will provide you with a better baseline for analyzing trends in our ongoing business operations. Listeners are directed to the appendix section of our presentation beginning on Slide 36 for the reconciliation of non-GAAP items to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Jeff."

As you saw in our press release this morning, we reported record revenue, ongoing profit and earnings per share for full year 2015. 
Overall, our integration activities in Europe and Asia progressed well and as planned, we delivered significant integration benefits, both in the fourth quarter and for the full year. Our ability to deliver these record results, despite significant volatility in the global economic environment, does demonstrate the strength of our execution and the benefits of our larger global operating platform. 
If you turn to Slide 5, I will review the 2015 financial results, where you see that we delivered strong revenue growth for the year. Our revenues were up 5% versus last year and 18% excluding currency impact. Our ongoing business earnings were a record $12.38 per share and as we expected, we delivered $620 million in free cash flow. 
Turning to Slide 6, you can see our priority -- our 2016 priorities in what we expect to be another record year. We do believe that the challenges we successfully managed in 2015 will carry over into 2016. And by that, we mean we expect the emerging markets will continue to be weak or decline, but we do see that largely offset by growth in our developed markets. We also anticipate that this strong dollar era that we're experiencing will continue into this year. So within this environment, our focus in 2016 is to continue to grow revenues and we see great opportunities to expand our operating margins. 
We plan to invest to grow globally in both our core appliance business and adjacent businesses. We will deliver significant new product innovations to the market. And we continue to expect to deliver very strong cost productivity. 
So turning to Slide 7 where we show our guidance for 2016. We expect to deliver ongoing earnings per share of $14 to $14.75 a share, which represents 15%-plus growth versus last year. We also expect free cash flow generation of between $700 million to $800 million, which is a substantial improvement versus the prior year. 
And while 2015 was a year where we faced several challenges, I think we were able to demonstrate our ability to create value for our shareholders through strong operational execution in this environment. And our current guidance reflects our expectation that this level of execution will continue as we do expect to deliver another year of record results in 2016. 
So at this point, I'd like to turn it over to Marc Bitzer to review our global operations."

Turning to Slide 9, we will review North America's performance in the fourth quarter. As emphasized in our last earnings call, our strategy in North America has not changed. We performed perfectly in line with our",1056,"Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 9, we will review North America's performance in the fourth quarter. As emphasized in our last earnings call, our strategy in North America has not changed. We performed perfectly in line with our expectations as we grew revenues and substantially expanded margins in the fourth quarter. 
We grew our revenue 6.2%, excluding currency, and expanded operating margin to 12.4%, an all-time record. As expected, with our recently launched product fully available and nearly fully floored, the investments we made to drive growth in our U.S. business delivered sequential T6 market share improvement in the fourth quarter. 
In addition to leverage from the revenue growth, our very strong operating margins in the fourth quarter were driven by our ongoing cost productivity programs and favorable mix from our new product introductions, which more than offset nearly $30 million in unfavorable currency impacts in Canada and Mexico.
Turning to Slide 10, we outline our 2016 operation priorities for the North America region. Our expectation is that the industry will continue to show strong 5% annual growth behind improved housing trends and consumer sentiment. And we expect to grow our revenues at/or above industry levels. We also expect to continue accelerating growth of our new products to capitalize on this increased consumer demand and to drive improved price/mix and revenue growth. 
Our strong cost productivity programs will continue to drive margin improvement and remain focused on growing outside the core. We anticipate that these actions will more than offset a point of margin impact from negative currency based on today's rate for the Canadian dollar and Mexican peso. We expect to deliver operating margins between 11.5% and 12.5%, which is fully in line with our long-term goals and another improvement over prior year. 
I will now share the fourth quarter result for our Europe, Middle East and Africa region as shown on Slide 11. Sales were $1.5 billion compared to $1.7 billion in the prior year. Excluding currencies, sales were up 8.1%. Ongoing operating profit was $88 million compared to $101 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. 
During the fourth quarter, strong execution of our integration plans and ongoing cost productivity mostly offset $45 million in unfavorable currency impacts as well as the impact of a significant industry decline in Russia. 
Last year, we saw an unusually strong fourth quarter in Russia as trading consumers bought heavily ahead of the devaluation. As planned and expected, we also invested in marketing technology and products this quarter. 
For the full year, we delivered 4.5% operating margin, which is fully consistent with our guidance at the beginning of the year in spite of $160 million in currency impacts and weaker demand in Eastern Europe. 
On Slide 12, as we look toward the full year 2016, our priorities remain unchanged, with a strong focus on integration activities, ongoing cost productivity and growth from new products both within and beyond the core. We expect industry to be approximately flat to 2%, primarily driven by continued strong demand in Western Europe. 
Based on today's rates, weakness in the ruble and euro will continue, but we plan to more than offset over a point of margin impact from currency through ongoing cost productivity and acquisition synergies. Overall, we expect operating margins to be between 7% and 8% for the year, which is another substantial year-over-year improvement and very consistent with and even ahead of our long-term goals. 
Now we'll discuss our Latin America results on Slide 13. Sales for the quarter were $845 million. Excluding the impact of currencies, sales decreased 8%. 
Our operating profit for the quarter totaled $58 million or nearly 7% of sales, which represents a substantial improvement in operating margin versus the prior 2 quarters. These margin levels are a clear indication that we had readjusted our business for today's operating environment through already deployed price/mix actions and cost and capacity reductions. 
On Slide 14, we summarize our priorities in Latin America. We expect demand through continued volatility and are fully prepared to deploy further actions if necessary. We will continue to invest in new products, grow our business out of Brazil core appliances and are well positioned to capitalize in growth in Brazil when demand does return. 
We expect industry decline of 10% and based on today's rates, a 0.5 point of margin impact from currency primarily in the first half of the year. 
Through growth in our non-Brazil operations, the benefits of previously announced cost-based price increases, implemented reduction of fixed costs and improved mix from our new products, we expect to mitigate both currency and demand impacts. 
Based on our expectations of demand down 10% and the Brazilian real at current spot rates, and this will [ph] benefit of our offsetting actions for 2016, we expect operating margins between 6.5% and 7.5% despite lower revenue due to the currency and emerging market demand. 
Now we turn to our fourth quarter results in the Asia region, which are shown on Slide 15. Net sales were $312 million in comparison to $282 million in the prior year period. Excluding the impact of currency, our sales increased 15%. 
Our fourth quarter ongoing operating profit was $11 million compared to $17 million in the prior year period. Ongoing operating margin was 3.6%, driven by record margins in India and integration benefits in China that were offset by a weak demand and increased product and marketing investments. While these investments in China temporarily reduced our margins in the fourth quarter, we expect them to lead to strong growth in margins in the future. 
Turning to Slide 16, we're showing our 2016 priorities for Asia operations. We will continue to focus on distribution expansion and ongoing cost productivity programs. Our expectation is for flat industry growth in the region. For additional clarity about our assumptions, we are forecasting a 5% industry growth in India and a 2% to 3% industry decline in China. Overall, we expect strong margin performance of 7% to 8%, driven by our larger growth platform and the benefits of our strong innovation pipeline. 
On Slide 17, we summarize our regional margin goals. We expect 2016 to be another year of record performance and see opportunities for strong margin expansions in all regions. 
And now I'd like to turn it over to Larry."

As Jeff mentioned, we had a solid year of performance. You may recall that we entered the year with significant currency headwinds and weakened emerging market demand. Given these challenges, our first half ongoin",827,"Thanks, Marc, and good morning, everyone. As Jeff mentioned, we had a solid year of performance. You may recall that we entered the year with significant currency headwinds and weakened emerging market demand. Given these challenges, our first half ongoing earnings of approximately $4.85 per share were flat with 2014. However, based on the actions we took throughout the year, we were able to deliver second half ongoing earnings of $7.55 per share, which is up 15% from last year's results. Our second half earnings momentum and our fourth quarter run rate entering 2016 are solid. 
Turning to our fourth quarter results on Slides 19 and 20, revenues were $5.6 billion. Currency had a $700 million top line impact, but excluding currency, sales were up 4%. 
We achieved all-time record ongoing earnings of $4.10 per share, driven by acquisition synergies and ongoing cost productivity programs as well as price/mix from new product introductions and previously announced cost-based price actions. 
You'll note from the slide that SG&A as a percent of sales on a GAAP basis decreased approximately 1.5 points. While we did make incrementally higher marketing investments this year to support our product introductions, those were more than offset by acquisition synergies and a planned reduction in acquisition-related cost. 
Our effective tax rate for the year was under 21%. This represents approximately a $0.20 improvement versus our prior full year guidance. 
In summary, we are pleased with the results for the quarter. 
Now turning to 2016. We expect another record year. We will continue to be impacted by currency and emerging market demand. However, we are confident in the actions we are taking to offset these headwinds and deliver 15%-plus earnings per share growth in 2016. 
First, on Slide 21, you can see that we absorbed nearly $6 from the combination of emerging market demand weakness and currency devaluation in 2015. As Marc discussed in the regional reviews, our operational focus and additional actions deployed during the year drove record revenue and earnings performance despite these challenges. 
Now turning to Slide 22, we share the 2016 assumptions for emerging market demand and currency headwinds included in our guidance. As Jeff mentioned, based on current exchange rates, we expect currency devaluation to continue, although at a reduced level compared to the prior year. Accordingly, we anticipate a negative impact of approximately $1 billion in sales and $2.50 in earnings per share from currency headwinds. Additionally, we're anticipating continued demand weakness in most emerging markets. As a result, we will offset $0.50 in earnings per share impact from that. 
It's important to note that these emerging market countries now represent 15% of our global sales. 
Finally, on Slides 23 and 25, we summarize key actions that we would expect will offset the impact on currency and emerging market demand. We expect another very strong year in total cost productivity given material trends, fixed cost reductions taken in Brazil and our normal productivity programs. Our acquisition synergies tied to cost and capacity reduction activities will ramp up during 2016. We expect solid demand trends in developed markets, combined with positive impact from previous and new product launches and growth in adjacent businesses. And our previously announced cost base price increases in Canada, Brazil and Russia are in full effect. 
On Slide 24, you can see an update on the progress of our restructuring and acquisition integration activities. We incurred $200 million in restructuring expense and delivered $200 million in benefits this year, consistent with previous communications. For 2016, we expect $250 million in expense and continue to expect $175 million in benefits. 
On Slide 26, we highlight the cadence of Half 1 versus Half 2 earnings drivers we just addressed. First, given historical seasonality, volume is stronger in the second half of the year. In addition, we should have lower currency headwinds in the back half of the year based on current rates. Traditionally, we see much stronger seasonality in our cost productivity programs in the second half of the year and our acquisition synergies will ramp up throughout the year. As a result, we would expect full year earnings seasonality to approximate 40% in the first half and 60% in the second half. 
On Slide 27, our 2016 guidance should deliver record ongoing earnings of $14 to $14.75 per share, a 15% increase year-over-year. We are forecasting approximately $700 million to $800 million in free cash flow, which includes planned cash outlays of up to $200 million in restructuring related to the acquisitions, $150 million related to our previously announced product warranty cost in Europe and capital spending of between $700 million to $750 million. 
Our priorities for cash deployment have not changed as shown on Slide 28. We did repurchase $155 million of stock during the fourth quarter and have $225 million remaining on our existing authorization. We expect to complete our current share repurchase authorization this year. 
Now I'd like to turn it back over to Jeff."

As a result, we now believe we can grow our revenues to $23 billion to $24 billion in sales by 2018 versus our previous goal of $26 billion to $28 billion. And again, the difference is essentially all purely from currency translation because we have rapidly adjusted to the changed global environment through our previously announced cost-based price increases, fixed cost reductions and continued investment in new product innovation. And we will continue to do so as we go forward. 
We are offsetting these impacts previously discussed with what I believe is very strong operational execution. And as a result, we still expect to deliver operating margins consistent with our 2018 goals. So we haven't changed our view at all that we can deliver double-digit operating margins globally. And with that, we expect to reach also our goal of doubling our free cash flow by 2018. 
In total, this will lead to strong earnings growth, and we now plan to deliver strong growth in earnings per share to $20 to $22 per share in 2018. Again, the difference between this and the previous is simply a reduction in revenues due to currency. 
These revised targets would represent an improvement of 60% to 80% over today's levels of earnings and represent exceptionally strong value creation. 
As always, there are risk of us putting out long-range goals like this. But I think as we've demonstrated last year, we have been able to adjust the environment and still deliver strong results. 
So turning to Slide 32. You can very specifically see the drivers in our ongoing earnings per share improvements. And again, we have multiple paths to drive value creation. We'll drive it through growth, acquisition synergies and cost productivities. And these big levers that we outlined in December of 2014 have not changed. We are on track with our acquisition synergies in Europe, and we expect an additional $2 to $3 per share in benefits by 2018. 
We are assuming demand in emerging markets like Brazil, Russia and China begin to stabilize in 2017 but likely only drive moderate recovery growth during this planning cycle, and we don't expect to see that until 2018. Additionally, demand in the U.S. is rebounding, consistent with our Investor Day assumptions, and we continue to see solid growth in our adjacent businesses. 
We also now are seeing more and more growth, which is enabled by our Indesit and China acquisitions, which are now part of our baseline revenue assumptions. 
And finally, and importantly, from a cost productivity perspective, we fully expect to continue with strong ongoing annual productivity improvements in addition to the benefits from favorable input costs that we're currently seeing and we see great opportunities to further leverage benefits from our global operating platform. And I think over the last couple years, we've had a good track record of delivering on those type of benefits. 
So to sum up, we do expect to grow our earnings per share by nearly 60% to 80% over the next 3 years to between $20 and $22 per share. 
And then on Slide 33, you could see the walk on how we expect to double our free cash flow. And as you can see from this chart, cash flow growth is largely earnings-driven. Working capital is just a bit higher due to growth in the business. We don't expect any fundamental changes in our rate of capital expenditures, which run about 3.5%, and this has not changed. 
So turning to Slide 34, I'd just reconfirm, we are committed to achieving our vision of becoming the best global brand and consumer products company. As a reminder, we are #1 globally in 3 out of the 4 regions in the world. We're the largest Western company in Asia. We have a top market position in 5 of the top 7 largest appliance markets in Europe, and we also have the #1 position in U.S., Canada and Brazil. 
So in total, we have very high confidence that our growth plans give us an outstanding opportunity to continue driving significant shareholder returns. And we believe 2016 will be a strong step forward towards reaching our 2018 goals. 
So with that, I will end our formal remarks and we would like to open it up for questions."

I mean, there are 3 or perhaps 4 segments you can look in that business. The most impacted, for all the reasons we talked about, is the Brazilian appliance business because of the currency and because of demand being down almost 25%, with the -- so that's where the heavy hit. But I would say, and it's -- I think I said this before, we've been in Brazil market for over 60 years and we've never lost money in that market and we continue to be in a positive profit position. So even in that tough situation -- but our margins were hurt very badly in appliances. In our adjacent businesses, other than offsetting the inflation, they've remained intact. Embraco, which is our global compressor business, was hurt by demand in emerging markets and currency but not nearly as much, and we had a reasonably good year in Embraco. And LAR International, I would just say that it got hit by all the same currency -- the currency devaluations came at different times. We have a big position, for example, in Colombia. Colombia peso has devalued by 50%. Late in the year, Argentina obviously devalued. So we adjust, but there's a larger basket of countries to do. So those margins, although hurt some, were not hurt as bad. So the predominant work, I would say, has been to do, which we've already announced, the cost-based price increases, which we've already announced and carried over into this year. We've done significant fixed cost reduction, almost 30%, I think. We drive the heck out of productivity, but we still have to offset inflation and negative demand. So -- and I think Marc said it exactly correct. If you based on our assumption of today's spot in currency and the market going down another 10%, we feel pretty good about our ability to improve our margins. If we have another round of volatility, we'll have to adjust again, and we're fully prepared to do that."

And we do look at total cost, which is comprised of our synergies, our restructuring as well as our ongoing productivity, which includes change in raw material cost. And as we talk about -- and by the way, that we think that's the best way to look at it because that gives you a net number which you ought to expect to see in the P&L or in the margins, which is what we show. The challenge talking about, which caused a little bit of confusion last year, is when you have this volatility in currency. We certainly saw lower net material cost last year. I think we said over $100 million. But we also had -- part of that, the actual gross number was higher than that, but it's offset by currency increases in markets like Brazil and Russia and so on and so forth. So bottom line is, we're going to have a big year of productivity. If you look at the margin walk, it's roughly, between all of those factors, it's about a $400 million reduction, of which, I would suspect, net, and it really depends on currency raw materials ought to be, we ought to expect the same kind of improvement that we saw this year."

Let me actually start with -- first off by saying that we're very pleased with our North America Q4. And I know there were some concerns out there, but these results would have quiet down a lot of concerns. Let me, first of all, on the units, because you mentioned the 3% unit. First of all, and we said that in a number of previous calls, our unit shipments are not comparable to what is AHAM published numbers because we include a lot more in our units. So the numbers are not fully comparable. Having said that, what you can compare is our unit growth versus our organic excess [ph] growth, so the 3% versus 6%. And you're exactly right, I mean, that shows you just how strong our price/mix was, which is a full result of disciplined promotion management and finally, results of our new product introductions. So to have that kind of lift in such a promotion environment is an achievement we're very proud of. Now let me put it in broader context off the fourth quarter. Again, we delivered good ex currency revenue growth, 6%, record margin of 12.4%, which is exactly what we said we would do, drive growth and margin expansion. What is also important to know, we had ex currency revenue growth in all our business units, so Canada, Mexico, small domestic, majors, core appliances; which also means, we had sequential market share growth Q4 compared to Q3, which is something which, as you know, we've been driving for very hard. So now with regards to your question about our expectations for next year's market. As you know, we guide industry to 5%. As I also said in my prepared remarks, we fully expect to grow our revenue in line or above that market assumption. That's what we guide to, and that's our expectation based on run rates which we have developed, based on new product introductions. So we're -- I think we'd say very confident behind these assumptions. Towards -- the comment towards the broader industry assumption about 5%. As you know, we, as we guided in 2015, we initially came up with 4% and we lift it to 5%, 5-plus. The final number was 6.5%. Beginning of the year, many people questioned if North America would come to these growth levels and North America, as an industry, did. Med [ph] is still largely driven, the confidence for 5% is we still do believe the housing is, at best, midpoint of a housing recovery, in terms of cycle. We do see consumer sentiment becoming bigger. We do see wealth creation on the mid- and lower income levels. And so all these factors, if you put it in our macroeconomic model, you have a lot of confidence behind the 5% industry growth."

As you know, we guided at the beginning of '15 to 4% to 5%, and we hit exactly midpoint. I would say, probably -- now some people may be surprised that we're guiding now towards 7% or 8%, which as you recall, they both pretty much our targets in Investor Day. We are fully confident in the mid- 7% to 8%, and the confidence comes from, we do see the benefits from restructuring synergies and ongoing cost productivity. So which, as you know, when you run a business, if you have a confidence in cost, that gives you a lot of confidence. It's just much more predictable than any top line assumptions. And if you look at '15, that was largely cost -- total cost driven, and we know we have a momentum, we know we have agreement of certain restructuring activities and that carries into '16. You will also note that our volume assumption for industry is actually not overly bullish. It's 0% to 2%, and frankly, that magnitude between 0% and 2% is entirely driven by what happens to Russia. So we basically, we're not overly bullish on Russia. If Russia comes around faster, which we've seen in prior decades, or in cycles, then you could see it offset versus 2%, but that's a big assumption right now. But again, on Europe, in our view, on all quarters, we delivered like a clockwork, and that gives us a lot of confidence for '16 as well. On Latin America, I guess back to Jeff's comments, first of all, let me underline, Latin America is obviously heavily influenced by what assumptions you take on Brazil industry growth and the real. So on today's spot rate of real, and with the assumption that Brazil goes down another 10%, which pretty much will be consistent with what we see right now, so further deterioration of the marketplace, based on our already taking cost actions and price/mix, which we have already deployed, we are very confident to hit that 6.5% to 7.5%, which is, by the way, is not too far away from what we had in Q4. So it's not like we -- from a run rate perspective, it's not like we're planning for a huge step up. But again, I want to reiterate that the big assumption about the real exchange rates, and we've seen dramatic moves this year, and it's a big assumption about the industry."

Let me first try to explain what happened in '15 and then maybe give an indication for '16 and how that -- these dynamics come together. If you just look at the full year P&L in Europe, you'll realize there's -- if you take out a currency impact, there's a small revenue growth, but it -- the margin growth expansion came largely from the cost side, to be very straightforward. And the cost side, on the other hand, yes, there's some ongoing productivity coming from raw materials, which in the case for Europe is largely offset through negative currency, that's a transactional impact. So the net bar comes largely from realizing the synergies in procurement, in footprint, in SG&A. So if you want to say, so '15 was largely a restructuring and synergy play. It is, however, important to note that the fact that we held the top line in year 1 in a post-merger integration is a big deal because you typically would see, in such competitive environment, that you're being attacked from all sides. And we even grow it. And some people asked us about the different pieces. Even if you would break down the 2 legacy pieces, both elements grew organically, which again, is a big deal in Year 1 after such a complex integration. Now shifting gears into '16, again, the cost side are carryover benefits and certain restructuring initiatives, which we have just initiated and announced. So that just gives you an unusual high amount of confidence, because you're not relying on certain raw material assumption, whatever, it's in your control. And I would say off margin improvement and profit in Europe, for '16, it's still 70% or 80% is cost-driven. Now you come -- ultimately, it comes back to a question of how much revenue growth can you drive at that's brand and product portfolio. I would expect, and I'll come back to more Jeff's point, the long-term plan, in the planning horizon, it's '17, '18, that's when you start seeing the revenue growth coming in. And the simple reason for that one, it just takes a while to have all these product platform integration plans because that's the most complicated process. And you see, we already put a lot of new products down the market. The vast majority of a new joint product basically comes '17 and '18. And that's when you should expect the top line growth. Even in the interim, and that's an important thing is, as in one of our biggest attractions of Indesit or why we bought it is ultimately strong country position. There are some with #1 in 5 of top 7 markets and may, in all transparency, be large by the profit of Europe. Our market share in these top 5 markets has held up or even expanded in the last year. So that's a very, very important achievement for us."

The -- we did have and we talked about some very, very large, new product transitions, which affected millions of volumes -- millions of units of volume, okay? We always have product transitions, so that is not new. And I would say, if the rest of the world was somewhat stable, that you wouldn't have probably even noticed the impact of the product transition problems we had last year. But the fact of the matter is, we had, in the way I described it, the currency devaluation, and it's part of life, but it is the most impactive move in currencies we've seen ever since we track currency. It cost us over $4 a share. And at the same time, Latin -- emerging markets in general, particularly Latin America, it seems like a long time ago, but in 2014, we had an all-time record year in Latin America. Last year, 1 year, our earnings went down by $300 million and the cash went down by $300 million. We had record years in every other region in the world. So it wasn't the operational challenges we had on product transition. It was that, on top of dealing with a massive currency issue, a massive decline in demand issue. And it means we had to do a lot of things really well to still grow earnings by 9% last year. So I guess -- so let's fast forward into this year, and I should say, we did very well on the cost side last year for a host of reasons, including the synergies, the restructuring, raw material markets, et cetera. So coming into this year, what we all have to mention is, we still have big currency and demand headwinds. But they're less than half the size of last year, if things stay as we see them today. We're going to have another great year of cost productivity. And I would say we have no major known operational execution problems today, that like we had a year ago. So it's -- that's, I guess, as clear as I could try to be to hopefully address your point."

In addition to the margin -- and as we, in the Investor Meeting, showed, Canada used to be roughly $1 billion business for us. That was in the old currency exchange rate. So you have a demand-side. And on top of that, the currency move of Canadian dollar has been massive. Keeping in mind there's no production in Canada. So you have a full currency impact. Having said that in context, I think our teams were very disciplined cost-based price increase, which we already had announced and executed. We maintained a good margin, unfortunately at a much lower base. But the margin in Canada is very intact, very robust, but it's just a much lower base. Mexico is a slightly different story. The Mexico market is steady, pretty much slightly down, but it's -- there's not the huge downside as in Canada. Mexico is a top line issue because also your Mexican peso was 18, it's just dramatically devalued. It's down. So that has obviously a negative impact on the pure revenue side. It doesn't impact us so much on the ongoing margin side, because we're largely -- Mexican production is 60% local to local production -- or 70%."

Our remarks today track with the presentation available on the Investors section of our website at whirlpoolcorp.com.
Before we begin, let me remind you that as we conduct this call, we will be making forward-looking statements to assist you in understanding Whirlpool Corporation's future expectations.
Our actual results could differ materially from these statements due to many factors discussed on our latest 10-K and our other periodic reports as well as on Slide 1 of this presentation.
Turning to Slide 2. We want to remind you that today's presentation includes non-GAAP measures.
We believe these measures are important indicators of our operations as they exclude items that may not be indicative of or are unrelated to results from our ongoing business operations.
We also think the adjusted measures will provide you with a better baseline for analyzing trends in our ongoing business operations.
Listeners are directed to the supplemental information package posted on our Investor Relations for the reconciliation of non-GAAP items to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.
With that, let me turn the call over to Jeff."

As you saw in our press release this morning, we reported record operating results for the first quarter of the year. Our ongoing earnings per share were up 23%, and our ongoing EBIT margins",571,"Well, good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. As you saw in our press release this morning, we reported record operating results for the first quarter of the year. 
Our ongoing earnings per share were up 23%, and our ongoing EBIT margins were up a full point. We also stated in the statement that we are reaffirming our full year guidance after what we view as a good start to the year. 
Our integration activities in Europe and Asia have progressed well, and we're firmly on track to deliver a significant level of cost synergies for the year. And as you will see from our results, consistent with our full year goals, our strong execution more than offset currency and emerging market demand challenges in parts of the world. 
Now I'll turn to Slide 5, where you see our first quarter results. Our revenues were up 1% versus last year, excluding currency. Our ongoing business earnings were a record $2.63 a share, again up 23%, in line with our guidance for the year. Free cash flow declined slightly versus last year and the quarter. However, we are in track to meet our full year goal. 
On Slide 6, you'll see our guidance, which once again we reaffirmed. We expect for the year to deliver ongoing earnings of $14 to $14.75 a share, which represents over a 15% growth versus last year. We also continue to expect to deliver free cash flow in the range of $700 million to $800 million, which is a strong improvement over last year. So overall, our expectation is to continue to build on what we see as positive momentum that developed throughout the quarter, and we managed -- and as we managed to challenge -- to manage through a challenging environment with strong execution and also expect to deliver another year of record results. 
On Slide 7, we do highlight a few items in our 2016 capital allocation plans. And overall, the priorities here remain unchanged, which are to fund the business, to support strong returns to shareholders and to continue to evaluate value-creating M&A opportunities. 
As you saw during the quarter, we did complete our existing share buyback program with $225 million in share repurchases. In last week, our board raised a new $1 billion share buyback program and 11% increase in our quarterly dividend. With our strong business performance, we believe that we have the appropriate flexibility to continue to execute our capital allocation priorities in order to drive long-term value creation. 
Finally, on Slide 8, you can see our 2016 business priorities. Overall, our focus is to continue to grow revenues and expand operating margins through a number of levers: first, by delivering our restructuring and acquisition cost synergies of $175 million for the year; secondly, we do -- are seeing and do expect to continue to see mixed improvements and revenue growth as we benefit from our new product introductions and the strength of our industry-leading brands. We continue to see and target growth opportunities in our adjacent businesses, and we are leveraging our cost productivity actions to continue to deliver benefits to expand our operating margins. So with these actions, we will generate improved free cash flow for the year, which will enable us to continue to create shareholder value through our capital allocation plans. 
So at this point, I'd like to turn it over to Marc Bitzer. Marc?"

Turning to Slide 10, we will review North America performance in the first quarter. We performed in line with our expectations by growing revenues 5%, excluding currency, and expanding operating margins 70 basis",975,"Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 10, we will review North America performance in the first quarter. 
We performed in line with our expectations by growing revenues 5%, excluding currency, and expanding operating margins 70 basis points to 10.5%. We delivered another quarter of sequential T6 market share improvement, and our units sellout in the first quarter outpace the industry, behind the strength of our recently launched products and investments we made to drive profitable growth. 
Our strong operating margins were driven by our ongoing cost productivity programs and operating leverage from revenue growth, which more than offset $30 million in unfavorable currency impacts in Canada and Mexico. 
Turning to Slide 11, we outlined our 2016 operational priorities for the North America region. Our expectations is that the industry will show 5% to 6% annual growth behind strong housing trends and consumer sentiment. We expect to grow at or above the industry rates for the year as we accelerate the growth of our new products and continue to make targeted investments to drive profitable growth. Our strong cost productivity programs will continue to drive margin improvement, and we'll remain focused on growing our adjacent businesses. 
Turning to Slide 12, we highlight our exciting new top load laundry platform. It represents a new area in laundry with an industry-leading capacity and intuitive front touch controls. We saw significant first quarter growth in the top load laundry with very positive consumer and major trade customer support and expect this trend to continue. 
I will now share the first quarter results for our Europe, Middle East and Africa region as shown on Slide 13. Sales were $1.2 billion compared to $1.3 billion in the prior year. Excluding currency, sales declined 3%. The top line was a little soft across Europe due to a slightly weaker industry of down 1%. The market was down slightly, but there were strong and what we believe temporary demand declines in the U.K. and Russia, where we have a much larger business. 
Ongoing operating margin was 4.9%, a 220 basis point increase compared to prior year and in line with our expectation for full year margin improvement. Strong execution of our integration plans and ongoing cost productivity more than offset $20 million in unfavorable currency impact. 
On Slide 14, our 2016 priorities remain unchanged with a strong focus on integration activities, ongoing cost productivity and growth from new products. We expect the industry to be flat to up 2%. For the year, we continue to expect to grow in line with market and to deliver margin expansion, consistent with our full year guidance of 7% to 8%. 
On Slide 15, we're proud to feature Europe's first fully connected appliance suite. These products work together seamlessly to give consumers the performance they expect while offering flexibility and peace of mind. 
Now I will discuss our Latin America results on Slide 16. Sales for the quarter were $705 million. Excluding the impact of currency, sales decreased 4%. Industry in Brazil were down 13%, which was in line with our forecast of down 10% for the full year. However, through strength of our brands and products, we gained market share and continue to outperform industry. 
Our operating profit for the quarter totaled $42 million, nearly 6% of sales compared to 6.6% at prior year. It is important to note that the first quarter of 2015 was the beginning of last year significant real devaluation and industry decline. We have readjusted our business for today's operating environment  previously announced cost-based price increases, new product introduction and substantial cost and capacity reduction and are on track to deliver our full year operating margin guidance. 
On Slide 17, we summarize our priorities in Latin America. We expect to manage through continued volatility through strong cost productivity programs and by maintaining our right-sized fixed cost structure. We will continue to invest in new products and remain well positioned when the consumer demand does return. Based on our expectation of demand down 10% and the benefits of our offsetting actions, we expect to successfully navigate short-term challenges and deliver on our full year guidance. 
Slide 18 is our Consul freestanding range. This is a value-based price product for Brazil that includes several premium cooking features that deliver great value for consumers. The initial sales results of this product have been very strong. 
And now we turn to our first quarter results in the Asia region, which are shown on Slide 19. Net sales were $371 million in comparison to $378 million in the prior year period. Excluding the impact of currency, our sales increased 3%. Our ongoing operating profit was $27 million compared to $26 million in the prior period. Ongoing operating margins were 7.3%, an increase of nearly 0.5 points, driven by revenue growth and ongoing cost productivity. 
Turning to Slide 20. We share our 2016 priority for our Asia operation. We will continue to focus on growth through distribution expansion and ongoing cost productivity programs. Our expectation continues to be flat industry in the region with stronger demand in India and slight weakness in China. Overall, we expect strong margin performance of 7% to 8%, driven by a larger growth platform and the benefits of our strong innovation pipeline. 
On Slide 21, we showcase our new top load laundry product for the China market. Similar to our North American product, it features front touch controls and innovative wash technology for improved fabric care. This is a great example of leveraging our product development capabilities across region. 
And finally, on Slide 22, we summarize our regional margin guidance for the full year. Our first quarter performance was consistent with these goals, which remain unchanged as we continue to see opportunities for strong margin expansion in all regions. 
And now I'd like to turn it over to Larry."

As Jeff mentioned, we had solid performance in the first quarter that was in line with our expectations.

As Jeff mentioned, we had solid performance in the first quarter that was in line with our expectations. Our earnings momentum entering the second quarter and expected run rates for the second half are strong. 
Turning to the our first quarter results on Slide 24. Revenues were $4.6 billion. Currency had a top line impact of nearly $300 million. And excluding currency, sales were up 1%. 
We achieved record ongoing earnings of $2.63 per share, which was up 23% year-over-year, primarily driven by acquisition synergies and ongoing cost productivity programs. We achieved these results while absorbing a currency impact of over $0.50 per share or approximately 1 point in margin. Our ongoing EBIT margin improved by a full point during our lowest volume quarter, and we are on track for the full year guidance of 8% to 8.5%. 
In summary, we are very pleased with our results for the quarter. 
Turning to Slide 25, we expect another record year of performance and are reaffirming our full year guidance. As Marc discussed in the regional reviews, we are confident in our operational plans and as a result, expect to deliver 15%-plus growth in ongoing earnings per share in 2016 and approximately $700 million to $800 million in free cash flow. 
On Slide 26, we outline our expectations for EBIT margin expansion. As previously communicated, we expect to expand our margin by over 1 point, primarily driven by ongoing cost productivity, favorable price mix and acquisition cost synergies. We expect to continue funding our global brand and product innovation and to absorb between 1 and 1.5 points of margin impact from currencies. Currencies very recently have strengthened versus the dollar. While we are not adjusting our currency assumption at this time, should trends continue, we would see lower headwinds. 
On Slide 27, we highlight the cadence of the first half versus second half earnings drivers. First, given seasonality of our business, we expect volume to be stronger in the second half of the year. Second, we should also have lower currency headwinds in the second half of the year. Third, we expect strong results from cost productivity programs, and our acquisition synergies will continue throughout the year. As a result, and consistent with prior disclosures, we would expect full year earnings to approximate 40% in half 1 and 60% in half 2. 
On Slide 28, we share some details on our first quarter free cash flow results and capital allocation actions. Our free cash flow declined slightly versus prior year, primarily due to higher restructuring cash, legacy products actions and temporary working capital funding related to the integration of product transitions in Europe. We executed a balanced approach to capital allocation by funding the capital needs of our business and returning cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and the completion of our share repurchase program. 
Our plan to generate $700 million to $800 million in annual free cash flow are on track. With our recently announced $1 billion share buyback program, we have appropriate flexibility to continue with a balanced approach to capital allocation throughout the year. 
On Slide 29, you can see an update on the progress of our restructuring and integration activities. We incurred $47 million in restructuring expense and delivered $58 million in benefits in the first quarter. For the year, we expect $250 million in expense and $175 million in benefits, consistent with previous communications. 
In summary, our strong first quarter results support the run rates needed to deliver our full year guidance. Given our results and strong balance sheet, we also believe we have the right plans in place to deploy cash in ways that will maximize shareholder value. 
Now I'd like to turn it back over to Jeff."

We delivered a substantial margin improvement of 220 basis points, and we continue to deliver integration cost synergies, and I would argue we are fully on track towards the full year margin target. On the revenue side and I said that in my remarks, we see that it's a slight softness versus what we had in mind, but to underline that, we characterize that as it's a very softness. But particularly driven by the U.K. and Russia whereas you know post-Indesit acquisition, we have a significant exposure, where we saw some weakness. From what we see today, we do not see structural.

So we saw a significant impact obviously, on the top line converted back from U.S. dollars and then also on demand side. We knew that coming to the year, and that's why we put the plans where plans are, and I would say we're extremely pleased with how the team performed on price margin realization, i.e., on delivering cost base and inflation-based price increases speaking. We're very pleased with how the team has been managing capacity and fixed cost, and the results is a margins, which are particularly keep the top line in line very promising, and we're very confident that we will deliver on our full year guidance margins."

Anyhow having said that, and taking that into context, our unit shipments in Q1 in North America were up 5%. That typically would say it's slightly training versus what the AM numbers would show as I mentioned before but not fully comparable. What is, however, very important to keep in mind and I indicated that before our shipment volumes, i.e., sell-in volumes after a weak start in January, we had a very strong February, March. That momentum continued and carried into Q2. And even more important, the measure that we internally look at are we call sell-out volumes, i.e., what is sold through on the trade partner level. And on that level, we even outpaced the overall market. So we're actually very pleased with the U.S. volume of U.S. shipment trends and the momentum we're carrying. To your question was it one category? No it is not one category, but of course, we feel in particular that we've regained strengthen our laundry category, which I do know is our flagship, and we had last year some issues, and we saw strong growth in laundry, but it carried through other categories as well."

Again, excluding the currency headwind, it looks like it was about 100 basis points above the reported number."

So quarter -- Q1 year-over-year, we exactly in line with kind of they midpoint of what we guided on a full year basis, which obviously gives us confidence we're very well on track towards our full year guidance, and that typically, as you also know, and particularly as you follow our share for a long time there's a lot of seasonality in our Q1 business. There's a couple of factors like small domestic appliance showing much strong in Q4 and Q3, and that's the normal issue. You would go back to last couple of years, you see margin lift as the year progresses, and again that's very typical, and that's why we're very confident. Particularly with regard to your question on FX, yes, you're probably correct, particularly in Q1, our FX burden was high. Within North America with 2 currencies very simply it's Canadian dollar and Mexican peso. First of all, both finally regained some strength towards the end of the quarter. However, on a quarter average and particularly compared to last year, it was a tough comparison. That comparison get a lot -- less challenging as the year progresses."

It is tracking in line with our knowledge of the process and our expectations. At a high level, we would expect by midyear or just beginning the third quarter that the Department of Commerce will complete their investigation and establish dumping levels and cash deposits for violating companies. Typically, there's going to be 6 months where the Department of Commerce releases its final anti-dumping determination and then it goes back to ITC, which we would expect within the next month and have a final conclusion to that.

So first of all, as you know, in the full year basis, last year, Europe revenue was pretty much flat, and that's where we are kind of based on market something pretty much expecting this year directionally. So Q1 on constant FX or local currency was minus 3. So we are kind of trading 3 points pretty much behind, where we want to be from a revenue side again. As I mentioned before this is largely driven by Russia and U.K. for different reasons. U.K., British pound weakness. We announced some cost-based price increases. As you also know, we have a safety recall election that is a certain temporary U.K. issue. Russia, the market remains soft throughout Q1. As we set off at Investor Day Russia is a market of extreme volatility. We saw in previous if market comes down very quickly and also comes up very quickly. It's started already last year pretty much around February or also Q1 over Q1 was a slight weakness even we thought beginning of the quarter some signs of stabilization in Russia market, but it's very hard to predict how Russia market evolved going forward. Again, the latest trends have been a little bit more encouraging, but it still remains very soft."

Our remarks today track with the presentation available on the Investors section of our website at whirlpoolcorp.com.
Before we begin, let me remind you that as we conduct this call, we will be making forward-looking statements to assist you in understanding Whirlpool Corporation's future expectations.
Our actual results could differ materially from these statements due to many factors discussed on our latest 10-K and our other periodic reports as well as on Slide 1 of this presentation.

We believe these measures are important indicators of our operations as they exclude items that may not be indicative of or are unrelated to results from our ongoing business operations. We also think the adjusted measures will provide you with a better baseline for analyzing trends in our ongoing business operations.

With that, let me turn the call over to Jeff."
314515,331211256,963107,"Whirlpool Corp., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 26, 2016",2016-04-26,"Earnings Calls","Whirlpool Corporation","Executives","Well, good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. As you saw in our press release this morning, we reported record operating results for the first quarter of the year. Our ongoing earnings per share were up 23%, and our ongoing EBIT margins",571,"Well, good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. As you saw in our press release this morning, we reported record operating results for the first quarter of the year. 
Our ongoing earnings per share were up 23%, and our ongoing EBIT margins were up a full point. We also stated in the statement that we are reaffirming our full year guidance after what we view as a good start to the year. 
Our integration activities in Europe and Asia have progressed well, and we're firmly on track to deliver a significant level of cost synergies for the year. And as you will see from our results, consistent with our full year goals, our strong execution more than offset currency and emerging market demand challenges in parts of the world. 
Now I'll turn to Slide 5, where you see our first quarter results. Our revenues were up 1% versus last year, excluding currency. Our ongoing business earnings were a record $2.63 a share, again up 23%, in line with our guidance for the year. Free cash flow declined slightly versus last year and the quarter. However, we are on track to meet our full year goal. 
On Slide 6, you'll see our guidance, which once again we reaffirmed. We expect for the year to deliver ongoing earnings of $14 to $14.75 a share, which represents over a 15% growth versus last year. We also continue to expect to deliver free cash flow in the range of $700 million to $800 million, which is a strong improvement over last year. So overall, our expectation is to continue to build on what we see as positive momentum that developed throughout the quarter, and we managed -- and as we managed to challenge -- to manage through a challenging environment with strong execution and also expect to deliver another year of record results. 
On Slide 7, we do highlight a few items on our 2016 capital allocation plans. And overall, the priorities here remain unchanged, which are to fund the business, to support strong returns to shareholders and to continue to evaluate value-creating M&A opportunities. 
As you saw during the quarter, we did complete our existing share buyback program with $225 million in share repurchases. In last week, our board authorized a new $1 billion share buyback program and 11% increase in our quarterly dividend. With our strong business performance, we believe that we have the appropriate flexibility to continue to execute our capital allocation priorities in order to drive long-term value creation. 
Finally, on Slide 8, you can see our 2016 business priorities. Overall, our focus is to continue to grow revenues and expand operating margins through a number of levers: first, by delivering our restructuring and acquisition cost synergies of $175 million for the year; secondly, we do -- are seeing and do expect to continue to see mixed improvements and revenue growth as we benefit from our new product introductions and the strength of our industry-leading brands. We continue to see and target growth opportunities in our adjacent businesses, and we are leveraging our cost productivity actions to continue to deliver benefits to expand our operating margins. So with these actions, we will generate improved free cash flow for the year, which will enable us to continue to create shareholder value through our capital allocation plans. 
So at this point, I'd like to turn it over to Marc Bitzer. Marc?"

Turning to Slide 10, we will review North America performance in the first quarter. We performed in line with our expectations by growing revenues 5%, excluding currency, and expanding operating margins 70 basis",974,"Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 10, we will review North America performance in the first quarter. 
We performed in line with our expectations by growing revenues 5%, excluding currency, and expanding operating margins 70 basis points to 10.5%. We delivered another quarter of sequential T6 market share improvement, and our units sellout in the first quarter outpaced the industry, behind the strength of our recently launched products and investments we made to drive profitable growth. 
Our strong operating margins were driven by our ongoing cost productivity programs and operating leverage from revenue growth, which more than offset $30 million in unfavorable currency impacts in Canada and Mexico. 
Turning to Slide 11, we outlined our 2016 operational priorities for the North America region. Our expectations is that the industry will show 5% to 6% annual growth behind strong housing trends and consumer sentiment. We expect to grow at or above the industry rates for the year as we accelerate the growth of our new products and continue to make targeted investments to drive profitable growth. Our strong cost productivity programs will continue to drive margin improvement, and we'll remain focused on growing our adjacent businesses. 
Turning to Slide 12, we highlight our exciting new top-load laundry platform. It represents a new area in laundry with an industry-leading capacity and intuitive front touch controls. We saw significant first quarter growth in the top-load laundry with very positive consumer and major trade customer support and expect this trend to continue. 
I will now share the first quarter results for our Europe, Middle East and Africa region as shown on Slide 13. Sales were $1.2 billion compared to $1.3 billion in the prior year. Excluding currency, sales declined 3%. The top line was a little soft across Europe due to a slightly weaker industry of down 1%. The market was down slightly, but there were strong and what we believe temporary demand declines in the U.K. and Russia, where we have a much larger business. 
Ongoing operating margin was 4.9%, a 220 basis point increase compared to prior year and in line with our expectation for full year margin improvement. Strong execution of our integration plans and ongoing cost productivity more than offset $20 million in unfavorable currency impact. 
On Slide 14, our 2016 priorities remain unchanged, with a strong focus on integration activities, ongoing cost productivity and growth from new products. We expect the industry to be flat to up 2%. For the year, we continue to expect to grow in line with the market and to deliver margin expansion, consistent with our full year guidance of 7% to 8%. 
On Slide 15, we're proud to feature Europe's first fully connected appliance suite. These products work together seamlessly to give consumers the performance they expect while offering flexibility and peace of mind. 
Now I will discuss our Latin America results on Slide 16. Sales for the quarter were $705 million. Excluding the impact of currency, sales decreased 4%. Industry in Brazil was down 13%, which was in line with our forecast of down 10% for the full year. However, through the strength of our brands and products, we gained market share and continue to outperform industry. 
Our operating profit for the quarter totaled $42 million, nearly 6% of sales compared to 6.6% and prior year. It is important to note that the first quarter of 2015 was the beginning of last year's significant real devaluation and industry decline. We have readjusted our business for today's operating environment for previously announced cost-based price increases, new product introduction and substantial cost and capacity reduction and are on track to deliver our full year operating margin guidance. 
On Slide 17, we summarize our priorities in Latin America. We expect to manage through continued volatility through strong cost productivity programs and by maintaining our right-sized fixed cost structure. We will continue to invest in new products and remain well positioned when consumer demand does return. Based on our expectation of demand down 10% and the benefits of our offsetting actions, we expect to successfully navigate short-term challenges and deliver on our full year guidance. 
Slide 18 is our Consul freestanding range. This is a value-based price product for Brazil that includes several premium cooking features that deliver great value for consumers. The initial sales results of this product have been very strong. 
And now we turn to our first quarter results in the Asia region, which are shown on Slide 19. Net sales were $371 million in comparison to $378 million in the prior year period. Excluding the impact of currency, our sales increased 3%. Our ongoing operating profit was $27 million compared to $26 million in the prior period. Ongoing operating margins were 7.3%, an increase of nearly 0.5 point, driven by revenue growth and ongoing cost productivity. 
Turning to Slide 20. We share our 2016 priorities for our Asia operations. We will continue to focus on growth through distribution expansion and ongoing cost productivity programs. Our expectation continues to be flat industry in the region with stronger demand in India and slight weakness in China. Overall, we expect strong margin performance of 7% to 8%, driven by a larger growth platform and the benefits of our strong innovation pipeline. 
On Slide 21, we showcase our new top-load laundry product for the China market. Similar to our North American product, it features front touch controls and innovative wash technology for improved fabric care. This is a great example of leveraging our product development capabilities across region. 
And finally, on Slide 22, we summarize our regional margin guidance for the full year. Our first quarter performance was consistent with these goals, which remain unchanged as we continue to see opportunities for strong margin expansion in all regions. 
And now I'd like to turn it over to Larry."

As Jeff mentioned, we had solid performance in the first quarter that was in line with our expectations. Our earnings momentum entering the second quarter and expected run rates for the second half are strong. T",631,"Thanks, Marc, and good morning, everyone. As Jeff mentioned, we had solid performance in the first quarter that was in line with our expectations. Our earnings momentum entering the second quarter and expected run rates for the second half are strong. 
Turning to the our first quarter results on Slide 24. Revenues were $4.6 billion. Currency had a top line impact of nearly $300 million. And excluding currency, sales were up 1%. 
We achieved record ongoing earnings of $2.63 per share, which was up 23% year-over-year, primarily driven by acquisition synergies and ongoing cost productivity programs. We achieved these results while absorbing a currency impact of over $0.50 per share or approximately 1 point in margin. Our ongoing EBIT margin improved by a full point during our lowest volume quarter, and we are on track for the full year guidance of 8% to 8.5%. 
In summary, we are very pleased with our results for the quarter. 
Turning to Slide 25, we expect another record year of performance and are reaffirming our full year guidance. As Marc discussed in the regional reviews, we are confident in our operational plans and as a result, expect to deliver 15%-plus growth in ongoing earnings per share in 2016 and approximately $700 million to $800 million in free cash flow. 
On Slide 26, we outline our expectations for EBIT margin expansion. As previously communicated, we expect to expand our margin by over 1 point, primarily driven by ongoing cost productivity, favorable price mix and acquisition cost synergies. We expect to continue funding our global brand and product innovation and to absorb between 1 and 1.5 points of margin impact from currencies. Currencies very recently have strengthened versus the dollar. While we are not adjusting our currency assumptions at this time, should trends continue, we would see lower headwinds. 
On Slide 27, we highlight the cadence of the first half versus second half earnings drivers. First, given seasonality of our business, we expect volume to be stronger in the second half of the year. Second, we should also have lower currency headwinds in the second half of the year. Third, we expect strong results from cost productivity programs, and our acquisition synergies will continue throughout the year. As a result, and consistent with prior disclosures, we would expect full year earnings to approximate 40% in half 1 and 60% in half 2. 
On Slide 28, we share some details on our first quarter free cash flow results and capital allocation actions. Our free cash flow declined slightly versus prior year, primarily due to higher restructuring cash, legacy product warranty actions and temporary working capital funding related to the integration of product transitions in Europe. We executed a balanced approach to capital allocation by funding the capital needs of our business and returning cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and the completion of our share repurchase program. 
Our plan to generate $700 million to $800 million in annual free cash flow are on track. With our recently announced $1 billion share buyback program, we have appropriate flexibility to continue with a balanced approach to capital allocation throughout the year. 
On Slide 29, you can see an update on the progress of our restructuring and integration activities. We incurred $47 million in restructuring expense and delivered $58 million in benefits in the first quarter. For the year, we expect $250 million in expense and $175 million in benefits, consistent with previous communications. 
In summary, our strong first quarter results support the run rates needed to deliver our full year guidance. Given our results and strong balance sheet, we also believe we have the right plans in place to deploy cash in ways that will maximize shareholder value. 
Now I'd like to turn it back over to Jeff."

On the revenue side and I said that in my remarks, we see that it's a slight softness versus what we had in mind. But to underline that, we characterize that as a temporary softness. It was particularly driven by the U.K. and Russia where, as you know, post-Indesit acquisition, we have a significant exposure, where we saw some weakness.

So we saw a significant impact obviously, on the top line once converted back to U.S. dollars and then also on demand side. We knew that coming into the year, and that's why we've put the plans where the plans are, and I would say we're extremely pleased with how the team performed on price margin realization, i.e., on delivering cost base and inflation-based price increases [indiscernible].

First of all, and I repeat that from prior calls as well as in a number of calls, our reported unit shipments versus the T6 market share units are not comparable. We're not doing an apple-to-apple comparison because obviously, in our unit shipments, there's a lot more than what is typically the AHAM T6. So don't fully compare it. Anyhow having said that, and taking that into context, our unit shipments in Q1 in North America were up 5%. That technically would say it's slightly trailing versus what the AHAM numbers would show, as I mentioned before, but not fully comparable. What is, however, very important to keep in mind and I indicated that before our shipment volumes, i.e., sell-in volumes after a weak start in January, we had a very strong February, March. And that momentum continued and carried into Q2. And even more important, we have a measure which we internally look at are the so-called sell-out volumes, i.e., what is sold through on the trade partner level. And on that level, we even outpaced the overall market. So we're actually very pleased with the U.S. volume of U.S. shipment trends and the momentum we're carrying. To your question, was it one category? No, it's not one category, but of course, we feel in particular that we've regained strength in our laundry category, which as you know is our flagship, and we had last year some issues.

And that typically, as you also know, and particularly as you follow our share for a long time, there's a lot of seasonality in our Q1 business. There's a couple of factors like small domestic appliance showing much strong in Q4 and Q3, and that's a normal issue. If you would go back the last couple of years, you always see a margin lift as the year progresses. So again, that's very typical and that's why we're very confident. Particularly with regard to your question on FX, yes, you're probably correct, particularly in Q1, our FX burden was high. Within North America with 2 currencies, very simply, it's Canadian dollar and Mexican peso. First of all, both finally regained some strength towards the end of the quarter.

At a high level, we would expect by midyear or just beginning the third quarter that the Department of Commerce will complete their investigation and establish dumping levels and cash deposits for violating companies. Typically, there's going to be 6 months where the Department of Commerce releases its final antidumping determination and then it goes back to the ITC, which we would expect within the next month, and have a final conclusion to that.

But these businesses are -- each one of them are somewhat different, but our view is we'd like to be able to consistently grow this at least double-digit. And these -- and that'll be SDA, there'll be consumer products, ultimately, commercial laundry and so on, given our position. We also have similar businesses like this in Brazil. We're developing them now in Europe with the acquisition. We don't yet have these businesses in China. So it varies a little bit around the world. But on average, yes, these are nicely margin business, probably at least double our margins that we have in our -- what we call our core major appliance business.

Our remarks today track with the presentation available on the Investors section of our website at whirlpoolcorp.com.
Before we begin, let me remind you that as we conduct this call, we will be making forward-looking statements to assist you in understanding Whirlpool Corporation's future expectations.
Our actual results could differ materially from these statements due to many factors discussed on our latest 10-K and our other periodic reports as well as on Slide 1 of this presentation.
Turning to Slide 2. We want to remind you that today's presentation includes non-GAAP measures. We believe these measures are important indicators of our operations as they exclude items that may not be indicative of or are unrelated to results from our ongoing business operations. We also think the adjusted measures will provide you with a better baseline for analyzing trends in our ongoing business operations.
Listeners are directed to the supplemental information package posted on our Investor Relations website for the reconciliation of non-GAAP items to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.
With that, let me turn the call over to Jeff."
314515,331211256,963288,"Whirlpool Corp., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 26, 2016",2016-04-26,"Earnings Calls","Whirlpool Corporation","Executives","Well, good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. As you saw in our press release this morning, we reported record operating results for the first quarter of the year. Our ongoing earnings per share were up 23%, and our ongoing EBIT margins",571,"Well, good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. As you saw in our press release this morning, we reported record operating results for the first quarter of the year. 
Our ongoing earnings per share were up 23%, and our ongoing EBIT margins were up a full point. We also stated in the statement that we are reaffirming our full year guidance after what we view as a good start to the year. 
Our integration activities in Europe and Asia have progressed well, and we're firmly on track to deliver a significant level of cost synergies for the year. And as you will see from our results, consistent with our full year goals, our strong execution more than offset currency and emerging market demand challenges in parts of the world. 
Now I'll turn to Slide 5, where you see our first quarter results. Our revenues were up 1% versus last year, excluding currency. Our ongoing business earnings were a record $2.63 a share, again up 23%, in line with our guidance for the year. Free cash flow declined slightly versus last year and the quarter. However, we are on track to meet our full year goal. 
On Slide 6, you'll see our guidance, which once again we reaffirmed. We expect for the year to deliver ongoing earnings of $14 to $14.75 a share, which represents over a 15% growth versus last year. We also continue to expect to deliver free cash flow in the range of $700 million to $800 million, which is a strong improvement over last year. So overall, our expectation is to continue to build on what we see as positive momentum that developed throughout the quarter, and we managed -- and as we managed to challenge -- to manage through a challenging environment with strong execution and also expect to deliver another year of record results. 
On Slide 7, we do highlight a few items on our 2016 capital allocation plans. And overall, the priorities here remain unchanged, which are to fund the business, to support strong returns to shareholders and to continue to evaluate value-creating M&A opportunities. 
As you saw during the quarter, we did complete our existing share buyback program with $225 million in share repurchases. In last week, our board authorized a new $1 billion share buyback program and 11% increase in our quarterly dividend. With our strong business performance, we believe that we have the appropriate flexibility to continue to execute our capital allocation priorities in order to drive long-term value creation. 
Finally, on Slide 8, you can see our 2016 business priorities. Overall, our focus is to continue to grow revenues and expand operating margins through a number of levers: first, by delivering our restructuring and acquisition cost synergies of $175 million for the year; secondly, we do -- are seeing and do expect to continue to see mixed improvements and revenue growth as we benefit from our new product introductions and the strength of our industry-leading brands. We continue to see and target growth opportunities in our adjacent businesses, and we are leveraging our cost productivity actions to continue to deliver benefits to expand our operating margins. So with these actions, we will generate improved free cash flow for the year, which will enable us to continue to create shareholder value through our capital allocation plans. 
So at this point, I'd like to turn it over to Marc Bitzer. Marc?"

Turning to Slide 10, we will review North America performance in the first quarter. We performed in line with our expectations by growing revenues 5%, excluding currency, and expanding operating margins 70 basis",974,"Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 10, we will review North America performance in the first quarter. 
We performed in line with our expectations by growing revenues 5%, excluding currency, and expanding operating margins 70 basis points to 10.5%. We delivered another quarter of sequential T6 market share improvement, and our units sellout in the first quarter outpaced the industry, behind the strength of our recently launched products and investments we made to drive profitable growth. 
Our strong operating margins were driven by our ongoing cost productivity programs and operating leverage from revenue growth, which more than offset $30 million in unfavorable currency impacts in Canada and Mexico. 
Turning to Slide 11, we outlined our 2016 operational priorities for the North America region. Our expectations is that the industry will show 5% to 6% annual growth behind strong housing trends and consumer sentiment. We expect to grow at or above the industry rates for the year as we accelerate the growth of our new products and continue to make targeted investments to drive profitable growth. Our strong cost productivity programs will continue to drive margin improvement, and we'll remain focused on growing our adjacent businesses. 
Turning to Slide 12, we highlight our exciting new top-load laundry platform. It represents a new area in laundry with an industry-leading capacity and intuitive front touch controls. We saw significant first quarter growth in the top-load laundry with very positive consumer and major trade customer support and expect this trend to continue. 
I will now share the first quarter results for our Europe, Middle East and Africa region as shown on Slide 13. Sales were $1.2 billion compared to $1.3 billion in the prior year. Excluding currency, sales declined 3%. The top line was a little soft across Europe due to a slightly weaker industry of down 1%. The market was down slightly, but there were strong and what we believe temporary demand declines in the U.K. and Russia, where we have a much larger business. 
Ongoing operating margin was 4.9%, a 220 basis point increase compared to prior year and in line with our expectation for full year margin improvement. Strong execution of our integration plans and ongoing cost productivity more than offset $20 million in unfavorable currency impact. 
On Slide 14, our 2016 priorities remain unchanged, with a strong focus on integration activities, ongoing cost productivity and growth from new products. We expect the industry to be flat to up 2%. For the year, we continue to expect to grow in line with the market and to deliver margin expansion, consistent with our full year guidance of 7% to 8%. 
On Slide 15, we're proud to feature Europe's first fully connected appliance suite. These products work together seamlessly to give consumers the performance they expect while offering flexibility and peace of mind. 
Now I will discuss our Latin America results on Slide 16. Sales for the quarter were $705 million. Excluding the impact of currency, sales decreased 4%. Industry in Brazil was down 13%, which was in line with our forecast of down 10% for the full year. However, through the strength of our brands and products, we gained market share and continue to outperform industry. 
Our operating profit for the quarter totaled $42 million, nearly 6% of sales compared to 6.6% and prior year. It is important to note that the first quarter of 2015 was the beginning of last year's significant real devaluation and industry decline. We have readjusted our business for today's operating environment for previously announced cost-based price increases, new product introduction and substantial cost and capacity reduction and are on track to deliver our full year operating margin guidance. 
On Slide 17, we summarize our priorities in Latin America. We expect to manage through continued volatility through strong cost productivity programs and by maintaining our right-sized fixed cost structure. We will continue to invest in new products and remain well positioned when consumer demand does return. Based on our expectation of demand down 10% and the benefits of our offsetting actions, we expect to successfully navigate short-term challenges and deliver on our full year guidance. 
Slide 18 is our Consul freestanding range. This is a value-based price product for Brazil that includes several premium cooking features that deliver great value for consumers. The initial sales results of this product have been very strong. 
And now we turn to our first quarter results in the Asia region, which are shown on Slide 19. Net sales were $371 million in comparison to $378 million in the prior year period. Excluding the impact of currency, our sales increased 3%. Our ongoing operating profit was $27 million compared to $26 million in the prior period. Ongoing operating margins were 7.3%, an increase of nearly 0.5 point, driven by revenue growth and ongoing cost productivity. 
Turning to Slide 20. We share our 2016 priorities for our Asia operations. We will continue to focus on growth through distribution expansion and ongoing cost productivity programs. Our expectation continues to be flat industry in the region with stronger demand in India and slight weakness in China. Overall, we expect strong margin performance of 7% to 8%, driven by a larger growth platform and the benefits of our strong innovation pipeline. 
On Slide 21, we showcase our new top-load laundry product for the China market. Similar to our North American product, it features front touch controls and innovative wash technology for improved fabric care. This is a great example of leveraging our product development capabilities across region. 
And finally, on Slide 22, we summarize our regional margin guidance for the full year. Our first quarter performance was consistent with these goals, which remain unchanged as we continue to see opportunities for strong margin expansion in all regions. 
And now I'd like to turn it over to Larry."

As Jeff mentioned, we had solid performance in the first quarter that was in line with our expectations.

As Jeff mentioned, we had solid performance in the first quarter that was in line with our expectations. Our earnings momentum entering the second quarter and expected run rates for the second half are strong. 
Turning to the our first quarter results on Slide 24. Revenues were $4.6 billion. Currency had a top line impact of nearly $300 million. And excluding currency, sales were up 1%. 
We achieved record ongoing earnings of $2.63 per share, which was up 23% year-over-year, primarily driven by acquisition synergies and ongoing cost productivity programs. We achieved these results while absorbing a currency impact of over $0.50 per share, or approximately 1 point in margin. Our ongoing EBIT margin improved by a full point during our lowest volume quarter, and we are on track for the full year guidance of 8% to 8.5%. 
In summary, we are very pleased with our results for the quarter. 
Turning to Slide 25, we expect another record year of performance and are reaffirming our full year guidance. As Marc discussed in the regional reviews, we are confident in our operational plans and as a result, expect to deliver 15%-plus growth in ongoing earnings per share in 2016 and approximately $700 million to $800 million in free cash flow. 
On Slide 26, we outline our expectations for EBIT margin expansion. As previously communicated, we expect to expand our margin by over 1 point, primarily driven by ongoing cost productivity, favorable price mix and acquisition cost synergies. We expect to continue funding our global brand and product innovation, and to absorb between 1 and 1.5 points of margin impact from currencies. Currencies very recently have strengthened versus the dollar. While we are not adjusting our currency assumptions at this time, should trends continue, we would see lower headwinds. 
On Slide 27, we highlight the cadence of the first half versus second half earnings drivers. First, given seasonality of our business, we expect volume to be stronger in the second half of the year. Second, we should also have lower currency headwinds in the second half of the year. Third, we expect strong results from cost productivity programs, and our acquisition synergies will continue throughout the year. As a result, and consistent with prior disclosures, we would expect full year earnings to approximate 40% in Half 1 and 60% in Half 2. 
On Slide 28, we share some details on our first quarter free cash flow results and capital allocation actions. Our free cash flow declined slightly versus prior year, primarily due to higher restructuring cash, legacy product warranty actions and temporary working capital funding related to the integration of product transitions in Europe. We executed a balanced approach to capital allocation by funding the capital needs of our business and returning cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and the completion of our share repurchase program. 
Our plan to generate $700 million to $800 million in annual free cash flow are on track. With our recently announced $1 billion share buyback program, we have appropriate flexibility to continue with a balanced approach to capital allocation throughout the year. 
On Slide 29, you can see an update on the progress of our restructuring and integration activities. We incurred $47 million in restructuring expense and delivered $58 million in benefits in the first quarter. For the year, we expect $250 million in expense and $175 million in benefits, consistent with previous communications. 
In summary, our strong first quarter results support the run rates needed to deliver our full year guidance. Given our results and strong balance sheet, we also believe we have the right plans in place to deploy cash in ways that will maximize shareholder value. 
Now I'd like to turn it back over to Jeff."

With that in mind, and as I indicated in my prepared remarks, we're actually very pleased with our performance in Europe in Q1. We delivered a substantial margin improvement of 220 basis points, and we continue to deliver integration cost synergies, and I would argue we're fully on track towards the full year margin target. On the revenue side and I said that in my remarks, we see that it's a slight softness versus what we had in mind. But to underline that, we characterize that as a temporary softness. It was particularly driven by the U.K. and Russia where, as you know, post-Indesit acquisition, we have a significant exposure, where we saw some weakness. From what we see today, we do not see this as structural or permanent. We consider that a very temporary issue."

So Q1, what I would say kind of the toughest comparison if you want to say because it was just the beginning of a recession. So we saw a significant impact obviously, on the top line once converted back to U.S. dollars and then also on demand side. We knew that coming into the year, and that's why we've put the plans where the plans are. And I would say we're extremely pleased with how the team performed on price margin realization, i.e., on delivering cost-base and inflation-based price increases, [indiscernible] speaking.

First of all, and I repeat that from prior calls as well as in a number of calls, our reported unit shipments versus the T6 market share units are not comparable. We're not doing an apple-to-apple comparison because obviously, in our unit shipments, there's a lot more than what is typically the AHAM T6. So don't fully compare it. Anyhow having said that, and taking that into context, our unit shipments in Q1 in North America were up 5%. That technically would say it's slightly trailing versus what the AHAM numbers would show, as I mentioned before, but not fully comparable. What is, however, very important to keep in mind and I indicated that before our shipment volumes, i.e., sell-in volumes after a weak start in January we had a very strong February, March. And that momentum continued and carried into Q2. And even more important, we have a measure which we internally look at are the so-called sell-out volumes, i.e., what is sold through on the trade partner level. And on that level, we even outpaced the overall market. So we're actually very pleased with the U.S. volume of U.S. shipment trends and the momentum we're carrying. To your question, was it one category? No, it's not one category, but of course, we feel in particular that we've regained strength in our laundry category, which as you know is our flagship, and we had last year some issues. And we saw strong growth in laundry, but it carried through other categories as well."

And that typically, as you also know, and particularly as you follow our share for a long time, there's a lot of seasonality in our Q1 business. There's a couple of factors like small domestic appliance showing much strong in Q4 and Q3, and that's a normal issue. If you would go back the last couple of years, you always see a margin lift as the year progresses. So again, that's very typical and that's why we're very confident. Particularly with regard to your question on FX, yes, you're probably correct, particularly in Q1, our FX burden was high. Within North America with 2 currencies, very simply, it's Canadian dollar and Mexican peso. First of all, both finally regained some strength towards the end of the quarter. However, on a quarter average and particularly compared to last year, this was a tough comparison. That comparison gets a lot -- less challenging as the year progresses."

At a high level, we would expect by midyear or just beginning the third quarter that the Department of Commerce will complete their investigation and establish dumping levels and cash deposits for violating companies. Typically, there's going to be 6 months where the Department of Commerce releases its final antidumping determination and then it goes back to the ITC, which we would expect within the next month, and have a final conclusion to that.

Before we begin, let me remind you that as we conduct this call, we will be making forward-looking statements to assist you in understanding Whirlpool Corporation's future expectations. Our actual results could differ materially from these statements due to many factors discussed in our latest 10-K and our other periodic reports as well as on Slide 1 of the presentation.
Turning to Slide 2. We want to remind you that today's presentation includes non-GAAP measures. We believe these measures are important indicators of our operations as they exclude items that may not be indicative of or are unrelated to results from our ongoing business operations. We also think the adjusted measures will provide you with a better baseline for analyzing trends in our ongoing business operations.

As you saw in our press release this morning, we reported record operating results for the second quarter, driven by strong ex currency revenue growth and substantial margin expansion of 1.",757,"Well, good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. As you saw in our press release this morning, we reported record operating results for the second quarter, driven by strong ex currency revenue growth and substantial margin expansion of 1.6 points. 
Our integration activities in Europe and Asia continue to progress well, and we remain on track to deliver significant cost synergies for the balance of the year. Our strong operational execution more than offset currency and demand challenges around the world. And as a result, we delivered another record quarter of performance. Following the strong first half performance, we're increasing our full year guidance for ongoing earnings per share to $14.25 to $14.75. 
Before we move to the details of the quarter results, I'd like to highlight an important ruling by the Commerce Department on our washer trade fair trade case. We're very pleased that this ruling confirmed that LG and Samsung continued to dump washing machines in the U.S. market. Both companies are now required to pay substantial deposits for these products which they import from China. 
As we've previously discussed, this unlawful behavior clearly had a negative impact on our washer -- washing machine market share and earnings in 2015 and in the first half of 2016. But despite this, we are pleased that we're still able to deliver record results through the strength of the rest of our portfolio of products and brands. 
I'll now turn to Slide 5 where we'll take a look at the financial results for the second quarter. Our revenues overall grew 3% versus last year ex currency. Our ongoing earnings per share grew by 30% to a record $3.50 per share. And this came through strong execution of acquisition synergies, volume growth and ongoing cost productivity programs and free cash flow improved versus last year.
Turning to Slide 6, you'll see that we are raising our 2016 guidance volume to strong first half performance. Again, we now expect ongoing earnings per share to be $14.25 to $14.75 per share. We are reaffirming our expected free cash flow generation of $700 million to $800 million, which represents a significant improvement over the prior year. We are confident that our continued focus on execution and strong second half actions will enable us to deliver another year of record results.
On Slide 7, you'll see that our 2016 priorities remain unchanged. We do remain confident in our ability to manage economic volatility and have deployed strong operational plans, which we believe will enable us to grow revenues and continue to expand our operating margins.
On Slide 8, our capital allocation strategy remains also unchanged. We continue to prioritize funding the business, along with delivery of strong return to shareholders, and we continue to evaluate opportunistic value-creating M&A opportunities. 
During the second quarter, we did purchase $100 million of shares during the quarter. We intend to continue repurchasing stock through the year and we currently have $900 million of remaining share repurchase authorization. So overall, we do remain confident in our ability to deliver long-term value creation through strong cash generation and the execution of our balanced capital allocation process.
Before I move on to our regional businesses, I wanted to comment on the leadership announcements, which we made in late June. As you probably know, our Chief Financial Officer, Larry Venturelli, has announced his planned retirement. We also have announced that Jim Peters, currently our Vice President, Corporate Controller and Chief Accounting Officer, will succeed Larry as Chief Financial Officer. 
First of all, I'd like to take this opportunity to thank Larry for his over 15 years of service to our company in a number of leadership roles, including the last 5 years as Chief Financial Officer. Larry has played an integral part of our executive management team and in helping us in our global expansion, including most recently the successful acquisitions of Indesit in Europe and Hefei Sanyo in China. 
At Whirlpool where he will be greatly missed but we always wish and his family the very best in his upcoming retirement. At this time, I'm also pleased to welcome Jim Peters into his new role of Chief Financial Officer. Jim does have a very broad background in our global finance leadership and a number of roles and in our business operations And I'm very confident that under his leadership, we will continue to execute our global value creation plans. 
So with that, I'll stop here and turn it over to Marc Bitzer to review our global operations."

Turning to Slide 10, we will review North America's performance in the second quarter. We delivered record operating profit by growing ex currency revenues 4% and expanding operating margin to 12.3%. We improved T",1148,"Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 10, we will review North America's performance in the second quarter. We delivered record operating profit by growing ex currency revenues 4% and expanding operating margin to 12.3%. We improved T6 market share versus prior year and saw strong consumer demand for our products. 
Our record second quarter operating margins were driven by our ongoing cost productivity programs and operating leverage from revenue growth, which more than offset $20 million in unfavorable currency impacts in Canada and Mexico.
Turning to Slide 11. We outline our 2016 operation priorities for the North American region. We continue to expect the industry to grow 5% to 6% for the full year. As we have done consistently, we will make targeted investments to grow profitably at or above the industry rates. We continue to leverage our strong cost productivity programs to drive margin improvement, and we remain focused on growing our adjacent businesses. We are confident that these actions will allow us to deliver at the higher end of our margin targets for 12% to 12.5%.
Turning to Slide 12. We highlight our exciting new French Door bottom-mount refrigeration platform. The jumbo capacity product features the most shelf space among leading brands in the industry. It offers the first-to-market flexible pantry and spread shelving system, delivering both [ph] the capacity and flexibility our customers desire. 
Beginning on Slide 13, I will review the second quarter results for our Europe, Middle East and Africa region. Sales were $1.3 billion, down slightly from the prior year. Excluding the impact of currency, sales were flat. Ongoing operating margin was 4.6%, a 40 basis point increase compared to prior year. This margin expansion included a 200 basis point unfavorable currency impact primarily from the British pound and the Russian ruble. We have deployed previously announced cost-based price increases to offset this currency impact.
Turning to Slide 14. We want to put our European business in context by providing additional details of our first half performance and the plan for the second half. We made significant progress on the integration of Indesit, demonstrated by the substantial first half restructuring and synergy benefits that Larry will discuss in more detail. 
We are confident in our ability to deliver planned 2016 synergies evenly in the third and fourth quarters. We experienced a negative first half currency impact primarily in U.K. and Russia and have deployed previously announced cost-based price increase to improve our operating margins as we progress throughout the second half of the year. We are in the process of integrating product platforms across Europe and expect to make strong progress by year-end. We expect to grow second half revenues by fully deployed marketing and sales activities.
We do believe we have the right actions to address the operating environment, and as a result, we expect operating margins to improve throughout the second half. We expect our exit rate on operating margins in the fourth quarter to be more consistent with our long range expectation of 7% to 8%. 
On Slide 15, in addition to the second half actions we discussed, our 2016 priorities remain largely unchanged, with the continued focus on integration activities, ongoing cost productivity and growth from adjacent businesses. We also continue to expect the industry to be flat to up 2% for the full year, but clearly, there is some uncertainty in the European region. Through the strength of our operating plans and continued acquisition benefit remain confident in our long-term guidance of 7% to 8% operating margins by 2018.
On Slide 16, we're proud to feature award-winning building of our new built-in kitchen suite. This product incorporates advanced cooking technology and on-demand recipes with elegant contemporary aesthetics for sophisticated customers.
Turning to Slide 17, I will discuss our Latin America results. Sales for the quarter were $826 million. Excluding the impact of currency, sales increased 4%. The industry in Brazil continues to be challenging. However, our top line performance in Brazil was strong as we continue to leverage our leading portfolio of brands to drive growth and outperform the industry. We were able to gain several points of market share in the second quarter substantial improving our operating margins. Our operating profit for the quarter totaled $50 million, 190 basis point increase compared to prior year.
The actions we have taken over past year to improve margins in a challenging environment and grow market share have been successful, and we now expect to deliver the higher end of -- range of our margin targets of 7% to 7.5%.
On Slide 18, we summarize our priorities in Latin America, which have not changed. As we've done consistently, we will manage economic volatility through strong cost activity programs and by leveraging our right-sized fixed-cost structure. We will continue to invest in new products and remain well positioned to capitalize on growth in Brazil when consumer demand does return.
On Slide 19, we're highlighting our award-winning Brastemp brand. This year, Brastemp was recognized in a nationwide study as Brazil's most engaging consumer appliance brand, building on 6 decades of inspirational performance and superior design. 
Now we turn to our second quarter results in the Asia region, which are shown on Slide 20. Net sales were $363 million in comparison to $381 million in the prior year period. Excluding the impact of currency, sales were flat. Our ongoing operating profit was $29 million compared to $31 million in the prior year period. Ongoing operating margins were 8.1%, flat to prior year as continued record performance in India and ongoing cost productivity offset weak demand in China.
Turning to Slide 21, you will see that our 2016 priorities for Asia have not changed. We remain focused on growth through distribution expansion and ongoing cost productivity programs. We also continue to focus on the longer-term opportunity in China as we navigate through demand uncertainty.
On Slide 22, we showcase our new front-load washer machine for China. We leverage the integration between Hefei, Indesit and using the best of the best to provide consumers with world-class laundry performance.
Finally on Slide 23, we summarize our regional margin guidance for the full year. Given continued global volatility in some regions and strong first half performance in others, we have adjusted our margin expectations as follows: North America increase to 12% to 12.5%; Latin America increase to 7% to 7.5%; Europe decrease to 5.5% to 6% due to negative currency impacts and the expected timing of our offsetting actions; Asia remains unchanged at 7% to 8%. 
It is important to note that we are on track for strong margin expansion in all regions and have not changed our overall operating margin guidance. We remain confident in our ability to manage for global volatility and to deliver our strong second half plans.
Now I'd like to turn it over one last time to Larry."

As Jeff mentioned, we had strong performance in the second quarter despite a challenging external environment. Net sales were $5.2 billion. Excluding the impact of currency, revenues were up 3%. We achieved record ongoing earnings of $3.50 per share, which was up 30%, primarily driven by acquisition synergies, volume growth and ongoing cost productivity.
In the second quarter, currency impacted our revenues by approximately $150 million, EBIT margin by about 1 point and net earnings by $0.50 per share. Our ongoing EBIT margin improved by more than 1 point, and we are fully on track for our full year guidance of 8% to 8.5%. On a GAAP basis, our second quarter tax rate was driven by the timing of tax settlements and planning activities and does not impact our previous guidance of 22% for the full year. Our ongoing tax rate for the quarter was 22%, consistent with our previous guidance. Overall, we are very pleased with our results for the quarter and the appropriate runways to deliver a very strong second half.
Turning to Slide 26, let me take a moment to discuss the expected impact of currency on the results for the year. You may recall in our original guidance for 2016, we assumed a negative impact of $2.50 per share. During our first quarter call, as currencies began to improve, we indicated that if April rates held, we would expect $0.50 per share lower currency headwinds for the year. 
While there was significant volatility to key currencies in the second quarter, the net result for the basket of currencies we're exposed to has not changed substantially since our last call. We expect the impact of currency to be approximately $2 per share for the full year. We will continue to execute previously announced cost-based price increases and deliver cost reductions to offset negative currency impacts, and our ongoing hedging programs continue to be an effective tool for us to reduce short-term volatility.
On Slide 27, you'll see an update on the progress of our restructuring and acquisition integration activities. Through the first half, we incurred restructuring expense of $87 million and delivered $120 million in benefits. We now expect $200 million in expense for the year and are increasing benefits to $200 million. Overall, we are on track to deliver our previously announced synergy goals through 2017.
Turning to Slide 28, I will discuss our expectations for full year EBIT margin expansion. As previously communicated, we expect to expand our margin by over 1 point, primarily driven by ongoing cost productivity and cost and capacity reductions. Our first half year-over-year EBIT margin improvement continues to support our full year expectation. We expect to continue funding our global brand and product innovation and to absorb approximately 1 point of margin impact from currency.
On Slide 29, we highlight the cadence of second half earnings drivers. Consistent with historical trends, we expect a meaningful step-up in the seasonality of our volumes between Q3 and Q4. We expect negative currency impacts to continue in Q3 but will lessen in Q4. As a result of these trends, we expect our second half earnings to approximate 45% in the third quarter and 55% in the fourth quarter, which is very consistent with what you saw last year. 
On Slide 30, we share some details on our first half free cash flow results and capital allocation actions. Our free cash flow improved versus prior year, primarily due to the improved earnings. Consistent with our strategy, we executed a balanced approach to capital allocation by funding the capital needs of our business and returning cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and previously announced share repurchase program. We plan to buy back additional shares throughout the year.
Turning to Slide 31, we're adjusting our full year guidance in response to our strong first half results. As Marc discussed in the regional reviews, we are confident in our operational plans, and as a result, expect to deliver 15%-plus growth in ongoing earnings per share in 2016 and approximately $700 million to $800 million in free cash flow.
Finally, on a personal note regarding my retirement, I've had the opportunity to work with many of you in the financial community over the past several years. It's been an honor and privilege representing Whirlpool, and I wish you all continued success in the future. I'd like to turn it back over to Jeff."

I'll summarize on Slide 33, which shows again our 2016 priorities, which haven't changed, and our plan is to drive revenue growth, margin expansion and to generate strong free cash flow for the year.
Overall, I think our ongoing efforts to drive margins, especially in the areas of volatility around the world, have demonstrated our ability to manage in the needed actions within our control in response to this global volatility. And I think the first half of the year is really a good example of that because we had many changes that we're able to adapt to. 
We do believe we are well positioned in the second half, and we have deployed strong operational plans across the world to make sure we deliver our goals. So overall, we do expect to deliver record results and while at the same time executing a balanced capital allocation approach. 
Finally on Slide 34, we do continue to execute to our long-term value creation strategy. Overall, we remain confident in our goals. We do expect to be able to continue to leverage our industry-leading brands, keep bringing a strong portfolio of innovation in the marketplace and our best cost position to ensure that we're delivering strong returns to our shareholders.

And the countries involved then were South Korea and Mexico, and we won very decisively in that case. But the companies, which are LG and Samsung, basically moved their production to China immediately to work around this and continue dumping. And so our new case is for dumping against manufacturers in China but it specifically affects LG and Samsung. So that required a new action. We're going through the process. We believe the evidence is compelling, as evidenced by the Commerce Department's preliminary judgment with the duties they've levied. They are now having to pay cash deposits on imports, and in fact, one of them is actually retroactive through the last 3 months because all the product they brought in the marketplace. There's a very clear Commerce Department process that is followed. They will make the final determination duties in December. Then it goes to the International Trade Commissions to evaluate injury, and we expect that judgment to be mid- to late January."

And what it was just operationally in the U.K., like us, most competitors don't produce in the U.K. Almost nobody produce in the U.K. So basically, any currency weakness of the British pound turns into kind of a lower margin for us.

So we're talking substantial so back on a European level, that's more than 200 basis points so that's where the number comes from. Now -- and just for clarity, I'm referring to year-over-year impact of currency. As you also know, Russian ruble even on a weak level, has stabilized. So I think sequentially, we don't see big surprise but still a year-over-year impact. And as you also know, the British pound for the quarter average has deteriorated but obviously, particularly post-Brexit [indiscernible] has been significant and it has a significant impact on our margin."

Also combined a little bit of mix impact we have pretty strong volume growth in Mexico, profitable volume growth in Moscow, but it has a mix impact on the AST.

We're both through cost and cost-based price actions. We are dealing with both currency and inflation, but the third factor is we continue, despite the environment, to invest very strongly a new product and brand innovation.

As you saw in our press release this morning, we reported record operating results for the second quarter, driven by strong ex-currency revenue growth and substantial margin expansion of 1.6 points. 
Our integration activities in Europe and Asia continue to progress well, and we remain on track to deliver significant cost synergies for the balance of the year. Our strong operational execution more than offset currency and demand challenges around the world. And as a result, we delivered another record quarter of performance. Following the strong first half performance, we're increasing our full year guidance for ongoing earnings per share to $14.25 to $14.75. 
Before we move to the details of the quarter results, I'd like to highlight an important ruling by the Commerce Department on our washer trade -- fair trade case. We're very pleased that this ruling confirmed that LG and Samsung continued to dump washing machines in the U.S. market. Both companies are now required to pay substantial deposits for these products, which they import from China. 
As we've previously discussed, this unlawful behavior clearly had a negative impact on our washer -- washing machine market share and earnings in 2015 and in the first half of 2016. But despite this, we are pleased that we're still able to deliver record results through the strength of the rest of our portfolio of products and brands. 
I'll now turn to Slide 5 where we'll take a look at the financial results for the second quarter. Our revenues overall grew 3% versus last year ex currency. Our ongoing earnings per share grew by 30% to a record $3.50 per share. And this came through strong execution of acquisition synergies, volume growth and ongoing cost productivity programs and free cash flow improved versus last year.
Turning to Slide 6, you'll see that we are raising our 2016 guidance volume to strong first half performance. Again, we now expect ongoing earnings per share to be $14.25 to $14.75 per share. We are reaffirming our expected free cash flow generation of $700 million to $800 million, which represents a significant improvement over the prior year. We are confident that our continued focus on execution and strong second half actions will enable us to deliver another year of record results.
On Slide 7, you'll see that our 2016 priorities remain unchanged. We do remain confident in our ability to manage economic volatility and have deployed strong operational plans, which we believe will enable us to grow revenues and continue to expand our operating margins.
On Slide 8, our capital allocation strategy remains also unchanged. We continue to prioritize funding the business, along with delivery of strong return to shareholders, and we continue to evaluate opportunistic value-creating M&A opportunities. 
During the second quarter, we did purchase $100 million of shares during the quarter. We intend to continue repurchasing stock through the year and we currently have $900 million of remaining share repurchase authorization. So overall, we do remain confident in our ability to deliver long-term value creation through strong cash generation and the execution of our balanced capital allocation process.
Before I move on to our regional businesses, I wanted to comment on the leadership announcements, which we made in late June. As you probably know, our Chief Financial Officer, Larry Venturelli, has announced his planned retirement. We also have announced that Jim Peters, currently our Vice President, Corporate Controller and Chief Accounting Officer, will succeed Larry as Chief Financial Officer. 
First of all, I'd like to take this opportunity to thank Larry for his over 15 years of service to our company in a number of leadership roles, including the last 5 years as Chief Financial Officer. Larry has played an integral part of our executive management team and in helping us in our global expansion, including most recently the successful acquisitions of Indesit in Europe and Hefei Sanyo in China. 
At Whirlpool where he will be greatly missed, but we all wish he and his family the very best in his upcoming retirement. At this time, I'm also pleased to welcome Jim Peters into his new role of Chief Financial Officer. Jim does have a very broad background in our global finance leadership and a number of roles and in our business operations. And I'm very confident that under his leadership, we will continue to execute our global value creation plans. 
So with that, I'll stop here and turn it over to Marc Bitzer to review our global operations."

Turning to Slide 10, we will review North America's performance in the second quarter. We delivered record operating profit by growing ex-currency revenues 4% and expanding operating margin to 12.3%. We improved T",1153,"Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 10, we will review North America's performance in the second quarter. We delivered record operating profit by growing ex-currency revenues 4% and expanding operating margin to 12.3%. We improved T6 market share versus prior year and saw a strong consumer demand for our products. 
Our record second quarter operating margins were driven by our ongoing cost productivity programs and operating leverage from revenue growth, which more than offset $20 million in unfavorable currency impacts in Canada and Mexico.
Turning to Slide 11. We outline our 2016 operation priorities for the North American region. We continue to expect the industry to grow 5% to 6% for the full year. And as we have done consistently, we will make targeted investments to grow profitably at or above the industry rates. We continue to leverage our strong cost productivity programs to drive margin improvement, and we remain focused on growing our adjacent businesses. We are confident that these actions will allow us to deliver at the higher end of our margin targets for 12% to 12.5%.
Turning to Slide 12. We highlight our exciting new French Door bottom-mount refrigeration platform. The jumbo capacity product features the most shelf space among leading brands in the industry. It offers the first-to-market flexible pantry-inspired shelving system, delivering both capacity and flexibility our customers desire. 
Beginning on Slide 13, I will review the second quarter results for our Europe, Middle East and Africa region. Sales were $1.3 billion, down slightly from the prior year. Excluding the impact of currency, sales were flat. Ongoing operating margin was 4.6%, a 40 basis point increase compared to prior year. This margin expansion included a 200 basis point unfavorable currency impact primarily from the British pound and the Russian ruble. We have deployed previously announced cost-based price increases to offset this currency impact.
Turning to Slide 14. We want to put our European business in context by providing additional details of our first half performance and the plan for the second half. We made significant progress on the integration of Indesit, demonstrated by the substantial first half restructuring and synergy benefits that Larry will discuss in more detail. 
We are confident in our ability to deliver planned 2016 synergies evenly in the third and fourth quarters. We experienced a negative first half currency impact primarily in U.K. and Russia and have deployed previously announced cost-based price increase to improve our operating margins as we progress throughout the second half of the year. We are in the process of integrating product platforms across Europe and expect to make strong progress by year-end. We expect to grow second half revenues by fully deployed marketing and sales activities.
We do believe we have the right actions to address the operating environment, and as a result, we expect operating margins to improve throughout the second half. We expect our exit rate on operating margins in the fourth quarter to be more consistent with our long range expectation of 7% to 8%. 
On Slide 15, in addition to the second half actions we discussed, our 2016 priorities remain largely unchanged, with the continued focus on integration activities, ongoing cost productivity and growth from adjacent businesses. We also continue to expect the industry to be flat to up 2% for the full year, but clearly, there is some uncertainty in the European region. Through the strength of our operating plans and continued acquisition benefit, we remain confident in our long-term guidance of 7% to 8% operating margins by 2018.
On Slide 16, we're proud to feature our award-winning built-in oven of our new built-in kitchen suite. This product incorporates advanced cooking technology and on-demand recipes with elegant, contemporary aesthetics for sophisticated customers.
Turning to Slide 17, I will discuss our Latin America results. Sales for the quarter were $826 million. Excluding the impact of currency, sales increased 4%. The industry in Brazil continues to be challenging. However, our top line performance in Brazil was strong as we continue to leverage our leading portfolio of brands to drive growth and outperform the industry. We were able to gain several points of market share in the second quarter while substantial improving our operating margins. Our operating profit for the quarter totaled $50 million, 190 basis point increase compared to prior year.
The actions we have taken over the past year to improve margins in a challenging environment and grow market share have been successful, and we now expect to deliver the higher end of the range of our margin targets of 7% to 7.5%.
On Slide 18, we summarize our priorities in Latin America, which have not changed. As we have done consistently, we will manage economic volatility through strong cost productivity programs and by leveraging our right-sized fixed-cost structure. We will continue to invest in new products and remain well positioned to capitalize on growth in Brazil when consumer demand does return.
On Slide 19, we're highlighting our award-winning Brastemp brand. This year, Brastemp was recognized in a nationwide study as Brazil's most engaging consumer appliance brand, building on 6 decades of inspirational performance and superior design. 
Now we turn to our second quarter results in the Asia region, which are shown on Slide 20. Net sales were $363 million in comparison to $381 million in the prior year period. Excluding the impact of currency, sales were flat. Our ongoing operating profit was $29 million compared to $31 million in the prior year period. Ongoing operating margins were 8.1%, flat to prior year as continued record performance in India and ongoing cost productivity to offset weak demand in China.
Turning to Slide 21, you will see that our 2016 priorities for Asia have not changed. We remain focused on growth through distribution expansion and ongoing cost productivity programs. We also continue to focus on the longer-term opportunity in China as we navigate through demand uncertainty.
On Slide 22, we showcase our new front-load washing machine for China. We leverage the integration between Hefei, Indesit and whirlpool using the best of the best to provide consumers with world-class laundry performance.
Finally on Slide 23, we summarize our regional margin guidance for the full year. Given continued global volatility in some regions and strong first half performance in others, we have adjusted our margin expectations as follows: North America increase to 12% to 12.5%; Latin America increase to 7% to 7.5%; Europe decrease to 5.5% to 6% due to negative currency impacts and the expected timing of our offsetting actions; Asia remains unchanged at 7% to 8%. 
It is important to note that we are on track for strong margin expansion in all regions and have not changed our overall operating margin guidance. We remain confident in our ability to manage for global volatility and to deliver our strong second half plans.
Now I'd like to turn it over one last time to Larry."

As Jeff mentioned, we had strong performance in the second quarter despite a challenging external environment. Net sales were $5.2 billion. Excluding the impact of currency, revenues were up 3%. We achieved record ongoing earnings of $3.50 per share, which was up 30%, primarily driven by acquisition synergies, unit volume growth and ongoing cost productivity.
In the second quarter, currency impacted our revenues by approximately $150 million, EBIT margin by about 1 point and net earnings by $0.50 per share. Our ongoing EBIT margin improved by more than 1 point, and we are fully on track for our full year guidance of 8% to 8.5%. On a GAAP basis, our second quarter tax rate was driven by the timing of tax settlements and planning activities and does not impact our previous guidance of 22% for the full year. Our ongoing tax rate for the quarter was 22%, consistent with our previous guidance. Overall, we are very pleased with our results for the quarter and are at the appropriate run rates to deliver a very strong second half.
Turning to Slide 26, let me take a moment to discuss the expected impact of currency on the results for the year. You may recall in our original guidance for 2016, we assumed a negative impact of $2.50 per share. During our first quarter call, as currencies began to improve, we indicated that if April rates held, we would expect $0.50 per share lower currency headwinds for the year. 
While there was significant volatility to key currencies in the second quarter, the net result for the basket of currencies we're exposed to has not changed substantially since our last call. We expect the impact of currency to be approximately $2 per share for the full year. We will continue to execute previously announced cost-based price increases and deliver cost reductions to offset negative currency impacts, and our ongoing hedging programs continue to be an effective tool for us to reduce short-term volatility.
On Slide 27, you'll see an update on the progress of our restructuring and acquisition integration activities. Through the first half, we incurred restructuring expense of $87 million and delivered $120 million in benefits. We now expect $200 million in expense for the year and are increasing benefits to $200 million. Overall, we are on track to deliver our previously announced synergy goals through 2017.
Turning to Slide 28, I will discuss our expectations for full year EBIT margin expansion. As previously communicated, we expect to expand our margin by over 1 point, primarily driven by ongoing cost productivity and cost and capacity reductions. Our first half year-over-year EBIT margin improvement continues to support our full year expectation. We expect to continue funding our global brand and product innovation and to absorb approximately 1 point of margin impact from currency.
On Slide 29, we highlight the cadence of second half earnings drivers. Consistent with historical trends, we expect a meaningful step-up in the seasonality of our volumes between Q3 and Q4. We expect negative currency impacts to continue in Q3, but will lessen in Q4. As a result of these trends, we expect our second half earnings to approximate 45% in the third quarter and 55% in the fourth quarter, which is very consistent with what you saw last year. 
On Slide 30, we share some details on our first half free cash flow results and capital allocation actions. Our free cash flow improved versus prior year, primarily due to the improved earnings. Consistent with our strategy, we executed a balanced approach to capital allocation by funding the capital needs of our business and returning cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and previously announced share repurchase program. We plan to buy back additional shares throughout the year.
Turning to Slide 31, we're adjusting our full year guidance in response to our strong first half results. As Marc discussed in the regional reviews, we are confident in our operational plans, and as a result, we expect to deliver 15%-plus growth in ongoing earnings per share in 2016 and approximately $700 million to $800 million in free cash flow.
Finally, on a personal note regarding my retirement, I've had the opportunity to work with many of you in the financial community over the past several years. It's been an honor and privilege representing Whirlpool, and I wish you all continued success in the future. I'd like to turn it back over to Jeff."

I'll summarize on Slide 33, which shows again our 2016 priorities, which haven't changed, and our plan is to drive revenue growth, margin expansion and to generate strong free cash flow for the year.
Overall, I think our ongoing efforts to drive margins, especially in the areas of volatility around the world, have demonstrated our ability to manage the needed actions within our control in response to this global volatility. And I think the first half of the year is really a good example of that because we had many changes that we're able to adapt to. 
We do believe we are well positioned in the second half, and we have deployed strong operational plans across the world to make sure we deliver our goals. So overall, we do expect to deliver record results and while at the same time executing a balanced capital allocation approach. 
Finally on Slide 34, we do continue to execute to our long-term value creation strategy. Overall, we remain confident in our goals.

But the companies, which are LG and Samsung, basically moved their production to China immediately to work around this and continue dumping. And so our new case is for dumping against manufacturers in China, but it specifically affects LG and Samsung. So that required a new action. We're going through the process. We believe the evidence is compelling, as evidenced by the Commerce Department's preliminary judgment with the duties they've levied. They are now having to pay cash deposits on imports, and in fact, one of them is actually retroactive through the last 3 months because all the product they brought in the marketplace. There's a very clear Commerce Department process that is followed. They will make the final determination and duties in December. Then it goes to the International Trade Commissions to evaluate injury, and we expect that judgment to be mid to late January."

And yes, you're correct. The currency predominantly impacts the margin. And to put that in context, there's obviously a number of currency moves on currency baskets in what flows for our European regions. The most impactful one, just given the size and movement, have been the British pound and the Russian ruble. There are other ones as well, but these are the most impactful ones. And what it means just operationally in the U.K., like us, most competitors don't produce in the U.K. Almost nobody produce in the U.K. So basically, any currency weakness of the British pound turns into kind of a lower margin for us. That's -- so there's an immediate impact. It's somewhat similar in Russia, maybe to a lesser extent, because we produce more in Russia. The combination of these 2 markets, just to put it in absolute terms, was basically $30 million just in the quarter, just these 2 big markets. So we're talking about massive and substantial. So you calculate the back on a European level, that's more than 200 basis points, so that's where the number comes from. Now -- and just for clarity, I'm referring to year-over-year impact of a currency. As you also know, the Russian ruble, even on a weak level, has stabilized. So I think sequentially, we don't see a big surprise but still a year-over-year impact. And as you also know, the British pound for the quarter average has deteriorated, but obviously, particularly post-Brexit, the decline has been significant and it has a significant impact on our margins."

So your question, unfortunately, the short-term probably is the more theoretical question. The reason I'm saying this one, as evidenced by the ruling, of a preliminary ruling, is there has been a significant amount of stockpiling by LG, Samsung in -- at the end of Q2, i.e. inventory-loading. And unfortunately, we see that's still entering the market in Q3. So there is still an impact, and that's just the reality. I would also not be surprised, even though to some extent a speculation at this point, if that both players continue to circumvent.

So the increase of restructuring benefit, that's largely Europe. So the cost side is fully on track. That is going really well. We have 2 elements in Europe. There's a little bit of an overlap. One is the currency, the currency impact to the operating margin. The offsetting action are cost-based price increase. That takes time to ramp up, so I expect the margin impact in this one to go with every month be less than this. But of course, right now, it's a Q3 pending issue. The volume impact is to a lesser extent. We're not -- in Q1, as you may recall, we had in Q1 a volume decline of 4%. Now in Q2, we are at a plus 2.1%, so it's getting better. But it's not yet fully at the pace of the market. And that is largely explainable directly by the platform integrations. And again, that's something which we, to some extent, expected but still a pain as we go through it, that we're basically replacing 80% of our SKUs in Europe this year. There are massive factory moves, product platform moves. And that is, basically, we expect it to be largely completed by the end of the year.

And second quarter is a great example of that, and I imagine the second half will be the same way. So there's no real big changes in any of our assumptions, with the one exception that Marc more pointed out in terms of short-term European margins."

It's been, I would say, a multiyear erosion. And again, that's where the portfolio of strong brands help us very strongly. I would say also, in addition, and I think we've been talking about this repeatedly, we're -- we take pride in our very balanced distribution footprint. What it means, we have, I would say, a very similar balance, I'd say, with most of our national trade partners. So whenever you see movements or wins and losses of one trade partner in the market, we typically don't see the pain because we have a very well-balanced distribution footprint, which obviously also helps us mitigate in any trends you might see in the marketplace by a private label or OEM business."

That is not Latin America in total, and I would argue probably outside Brazil, the rest of Latin America is probably stronger than the minus 10%. So the minus 10%, particularly in Brazil. I would say that given the extreme volatility, which we've seen in Brazil over the last 5, 6 quarters, I would, right now, say closely and possibly predicting exactly what happens by quarter, or -- and if we would know, we probably wouldn't give that guidance. But so right now, it's actually -- we still expect the full year industry to be down minus 10%. We knew in Q1, it was even worse, so maybe it's stabilizing. But bear in mind, it's stabilizing on a very low level because last year, it was already a significant reduction. So we do not see any recovery or any significant recovery in Brazil in the back half of this year. To your question about competitive reaction, we simply do not know. We do not ask them. And frankly, we focus on our own profitability. We did the actions a year ago with all the associated pain.

The demand has been constant -- negative demand has been constant and has carried over into this year. We have -- we had 3 major currency devaluations, the last one being in September, October. And we had to adjust each time to those. And then thirdly is inflation. So this year, demand is pretty much playing out as we expected, and we expect it to be down. We're both through cost and cost-based price actions. We're dealing with both currency and inflation. But the third factor is we continue, despite the environment, to invest very strongly in new product, in brand innovation. That is enabling us to improve our market position. The cost and the price position are allowing us to improve our margins, but the market share gains are purely the fact that we continue to bring new products to the marketplace."

We're very pleased and satisfied with our operating margins, 8% in such a volatile region, and a competitive region is nontrivial, so we're very pleased with that progress. But you're also right, it's a little bit a tale of 2 stories right now. India, in particular, which is a big part of that region, we had steps in strong results. That was a strong market, but we also made very good progress in the market with cost productivity and new product introductions and we gained share. So I would say India is really a very bright spot in that Asia, one. China is impacted, even while integration is on track, but it's impacted by a soft market demand. When I talk about China market demand, typically I refer to so-called T2, so it's not the same definition as North America. But right now, even though we don't have the latest June data, I would, right now, assume Q2 China was high single-digits negative. So this is also obviously nontrivial in a very competitive market, which is characterized by a little bit of overcapacity. So to you and specifically to your question, did our distribution expansion yet translate into market share gains? I would say not yet because there are also underlying levers to opposing moves. We are expanding the Whirlpool brand distribution and we're actually gaining volume of the Whirlpool brand, but at the same time, we're phasing out or reducing some value-brand business. So there's 2 offsetting items, and that's why that, net-net, you don't yet see the market share growth, which, over time, you should expect."

Having said that, of course, like any other markets, in particular, when you talk about kitchen demand, it's still impacted by housing activity. I would say, not to the same extent as North America in terms of statistic correlation, but there is an impact. Do we see any signs of a pullback here yet? No. I just simply do not see it. And so -- but could you expect that over time? Maybe. I would say it's too early to tell. As you also know, and I just now right tried to draw the analogy of other markets where you had sudden currency shifts, you may see all behaviors from a market demand. We have -- it wouldn't be the first market where you're short-term to even see an increase of demand because people are still going for lower-priced appliances, and then you see the opposite effect. So it's too early to see there in U.K. It's speculation, but that's the pattern which we have seen in many markets.

As you saw in our press release this morning, we reported record operating results for the second quarter, driven by strong ex-currency revenue growth and substantial margin expansion of 1.6 points. 
Our integration activities in Europe and Asia continue to progress well, and we remain on track to deliver significant cost synergies for the balance of the year. Our strong operational execution more than offset currency and demand challenges around the world. And as a result, we delivered another record quarter of performance. Following the strong first half performance, we're increasing our full year guidance for ongoing earnings per share to $14.25 to $14.75. 
Before we move to the details of the quarter results, I'd like to highlight an important ruling by the Commerce Department on our washer trade -- fair trade case. We're very pleased that this ruling confirmed that LG and Samsung continue to dump washing machines in the U.S. market. Both companies are now required to pay substantial deposits for these products, which they import from China. 
As we've previously discussed, this unlawful behavior clearly had a negative impact on our washer -- washing machine market share and earnings in 2015 and in the first half of 2016. But despite this, we are pleased that we're still able to deliver record results through the strength of the rest of our portfolio of products and brands. 
I'll now turn to Slide 5 where we'll take a look at the financial results for the second quarter. Our revenues overall grew 3% versus last year ex currency. Our ongoing earnings per share grew by 30% to a record $3.50 per share. And this came through strong execution of acquisition synergies, volume growth and ongoing cost productivity programs and free cash flow improved versus last year.
Turning to Slide 6, you'll see that we are raising our 2016 guidance volume to strong first half performance. Again, we now expect ongoing earnings per share to be $14.25 to $14.75 per share. We are reaffirming our expected free cash flow generation of $700 million to $800 million, which represents a significant improvement over the prior year. We are confident that our continued focus on execution and strong second half actions will enable us to deliver another year of record results.
On Slide 7, you'll see that our 2016 priorities remain unchanged. We do remain confident in our ability to manage economic volatility and have deployed strong operational plans, which we believe will enable us to grow revenues and continue to expand our operating margins.
On Slide 8, our capital allocation strategy remains also unchanged. We continue to prioritize funding the business, along with delivery of strong return to shareholders, and we continue to evaluate opportunistic value-creating M&A opportunities. 
During the second quarter, we did purchase $100 million of shares during the quarter. We intend to continue repurchasing stock through the year and we currently have $900 million of remaining share repurchase authorization. So overall, we do remain confident in our ability to deliver long-term value creation through strong cash generation and the execution of our balanced capital allocation process.
Before I move on to our regional businesses, I wanted to comment on the leadership announcements, which we made in late June. As you probably know, our Chief Financial Officer, Larry Venturelli, has announced his planned retirement. We also have announced that Jim Peters, currently our Vice President, Corporate Controller and Chief Accounting Officer, will succeed Larry as Chief Financial Officer. 
First of all, I'd like to take this opportunity to thank Larry for his over 15 years of service to our company in a number of leadership roles, including the last 5 years as Chief Financial Officer. Larry has played an integral part of our executive management team and in helping us in our global expansion, including most recently the successful acquisitions of Indesit in Europe and Hefei Sanyo in China. 
At Whirlpool, Larry will be greatly missed, but we all wish he and his family the very best in his upcoming retirement. At this time, I'm also pleased to welcome Jim Peters into his new role of Chief Financial Officer. Jim does have a very broad background in our global finance leadership in a number of roles and in our business operations. And I'm very confident that under his leadership, we will continue to execute our global value creation plans. 
So with that, I'll stop here and turn it over to Marc Bitzer to review our global operations."

Turning to Slide 10, we will review North America's performance in the second quarter. We delivered record operating profit by growing ex-currency revenues 4% and expanding operating margin to 12.3%. We improved T",1153,"Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 10, we will review North America's performance in the second quarter. We delivered record operating profit by growing ex-currency revenues 4% and expanding operating margin to 12.3%. We improved T6 market share versus prior year and saw a strong consumer demand for our products. 
Our record second quarter operating margins were driven by our ongoing cost productivity programs and operating leverage from revenue growth, which more than offset $20 million in unfavorable currency impacts in Canada and Mexico.
Turning to Slide 11. We outline our 2016 operation priorities for the North American region. We continue to expect the industry to grow 5% to 6% for the full year. As we have done consistently, we will make targeted investments to grow profitably at or above the industry rates. We continue to leverage our strong cost productivity programs to drive margin improvement, and we remain focused on growing our adjacent businesses. We are confident that these actions will allow us to deliver at the higher end of our margin targets for 12% to 12.5%.
Turning to Slide 12. We highlight our exciting new French Door bottom-mount refrigeration platform. The jumbo capacity product features the most shelf space among leading brands in the industry. It offers the first-to-market flexible pantry-inspired shelving system, delivering both the capacity and flexibility our customers desire. 
Beginning on Slide 13, I will review the second quarter results for our Europe, Middle East and Africa region. Sales were $1.3 billion, down slightly from the prior year. Excluding the impact of currency, sales were flat. Ongoing operating margin was 4.6%, a 40 basis point increase compared to prior year. This [ph] margin expansion included a 200 basis point unfavorable currency impact primarily from the British pound and the Russian ruble. We have deployed previously announced cost-based price increases to offset this currency impact.
Turning to Slide 14. We want to put our European business in context by providing additional details of our first half performance and the plan for the second half. We made significant progress on the integration of Indesit, demonstrated by the substantial first half restructuring and synergy benefits that Larry will discuss in more detail. 
We are confident in our ability to deliver planned 2016 synergies evenly in the third and fourth quarters. We experienced a negative first half currency impact primarily in U.K. and Russia and have deployed previously announced cost-based price increase to improve our operating margins as we progress throughout the second half of the year. We are in the process of integrating product platforms across Europe and expect to make strong progress by year-end. We expect to grow second half revenues with fully deployed marketing and sales activities.
We do believe we have the right actions to address the operating environment, and as a result, we expect operating margins to improve throughout the second half. We expect our exit rate on operating margins in the fourth quarter to be more consistent with our long range expectation of 7% to 8%. 
On Slide 15, in addition to the second half actions we discussed, our 2016 priorities remain largely unchanged, with the continued focus on integration activities, ongoing cost productivity and growth from adjacent businesses. We also continue to expect the industry to be flat to up 2% for the full year, but clearly, there is some uncertainty in the European region. Through the strength of our operating plans and continued acquisition benefit, we remain confident in our long-term guidance of 7% to 8% operating margins by 2018.
On Slide 16, we're proud to feature reward-winning built-in oven of our new built-in kitchen suite. This product incorporates advanced cooking technology and on-demand recipes with elegant, contemporary aesthetics for sophisticated customers.
Turning to Slide 17, I will discuss our Latin America results. Sales for the quarter were $826 million. Excluding the impact of currency, sales increased 4%. The industry in Brazil continues to be challenging. However, our top line performance in Brazil was strong as we continue to leverage our leading portfolio of brands to drive growth and outperform the industry. We were able to gain several points of market share in the second quarter while substantial improving our operating margins. Our operating profit for the quarter totaled $50 million, 190 basis point increase compared to prior year.
The actions we have taken over the past year to improve margins in a challenging environment and grow market share have been successful, and we now expect to deliver the higher end of the range of our margin targets of 7% to 7.5%.
On Slide 18, we summarize our priorities in Latin America, which have not changed. As we have done consistently, we will manage economic volatility through strong cost productivity programs and by leveraging our right-sized fixed-cost structure. We will continue to invest in new products and remain well positioned to capitalize on growth in Brazil when consumer demand does return.
On Slide 19, we're highlighting our award-winning Brastemp brand. This year, Brastemp was recognized in a nationwide study as Brazil's most engaging consumer appliance brand, building on 6 decades of inspirational performance and superior design. 
Now we turn to our second quarter results in the Asia region, which are shown on Slide 20. Net sales were $363 million in comparison to $381 million in the prior year period. Excluding the impact of currency, sales were flat. Our ongoing operating profit was $29 million compared to $31 million in the prior year period. Ongoing operating margins were 8.1%, flat to prior year as continued record performance in India and ongoing cost productivity to offset weak demand in China.
Turning to Slide 21, you will see that our 2016 priorities for Asia have not changed. We remain focused on growth through distribution expansion and ongoing cost productivity programs. We also continue to focus on the longer-term opportunity in China as we navigate through demand uncertainty.
On Slide 22, we showcase our new front-load washing machine for China. We leverage the integration between Hefei, Indesit and Whirlpool using the best of the best to provide consumers with world-class laundry performance.
Finally on Slide 23, we summarize our regional margin guidance for the full year. Given continued global volatility in some regions and strong first half performance in others, we have adjusted our margin expectations as follows: North America increase to 12% to 12.5%; Latin America increase to 7% to 7.5%; Europe decrease to 5.5% to 6% due to negative currency impacts and the expected timing of our offsetting actions; Asia remains unchanged at 7% to 8%. 
It is important to note that we are on track for strong margin expansion in all regions and have not changed our overall operating margin guidance. We remain confident in our ability to manage for global volatility and to deliver our strong second half plans.
Now I'd like to turn it over one last time to Larry."

As Jeff mentioned, we had strong performance in the second quarter despite a challenging external environment. Net sales were $5.2 billion. Excluding the impact of currency, revenues were up 3%. We achieved record ongoing earnings of $3.50 per share, which was up 30%, primarily driven by acquisition synergies, unit volume growth and ongoing cost productivity.
In the second quarter, currency impacted our revenues by approximately $150 million, EBIT margin by about 1 point and net earnings by $0.50 per share. Our ongoing EBIT margin improved by more than 1 point, and we are fully on track for our full year guidance of 8% to 8.5%. On a GAAP basis, our second quarter tax rate was driven by the timing of tax settlements and planning activities and does not impact our previous guidance of 22% for the full year. Our ongoing tax rate for the quarter was 22%, consistent with our previous guidance. Overall, we are very pleased with our results for the quarter and are at the appropriate run rates to deliver a very strong second half.
Turning to Slide 26, let me take a moment to discuss the expected impact of currency on the results for the year. You may recall in our original guidance for 2016, we assumed a negative impact of $2.50 per share. During our first quarter call, as currencies began to improve, we indicated that if April rates held, we would expect $0.50 per share lower currency headwinds for the year. 
While there was significant volatility to key currencies in the second quarter, the net result for the basket of currencies we're exposed to has not changed substantially since our last call. We expect the impact of currency to be approximately $2 per share for the full year. We will continue to execute previously announced cost-based price increases and deliver cost reductions to offset negative currency impacts, and our ongoing hedging programs continue to be an effective tool for us to reduce short-term volatility.
On Slide 27, you'll see an update on the progress of our restructuring and acquisition integration activities. Through the first half, we incurred restructuring expense of $87 million and delivered $120 million in benefits. We now expect $200 million in expense for the year and are increasing benefits to $200 million. Overall, we are on track to deliver our previously announced synergy goals through 2017.
Turning to Slide 28, I will discuss our expectations for full year EBIT margin expansion. As previously communicated, we expect to expand our margin by over 1 point, primarily driven by ongoing cost productivity and cost and capacity reductions. Our first half year-over-year EBIT margin improvement continues to support our full year expectation. We expect to continue funding our global brand and product innovation and to absorb approximately 1 point of margin impact from currency.
On Slide 29, we highlight the cadence of second half earnings drivers. Consistent with historical trends, we expect a meaningful step-up in the seasonality of our volumes between Q3 and Q4. We expect negative currency impacts to continue in Q3, but will lessen in Q4. As a result of these trends, we expect our second half earnings to approximate 45% in the third quarter and 55% in the fourth quarter, which is very consistent with what you saw last year. 
On Slide 30, we share some details on our first half free cash flow results and capital allocation actions. Our free cash flow improved versus prior year, primarily due to the improved earnings. Consistent with our strategy, we executed a balanced approach to capital allocation by funding the capital needs of our business and returning cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and previously announced share repurchase program. We plan to buy back additional shares throughout the year.
Turning to Slide 31, we're adjusting our full year guidance in response to our strong first half results. As Marc discussed in the regional reviews, we are confident in our operational plans, and as a result, we expect to deliver 15%-plus growth in ongoing earnings per share in 2016 and approximately $700 million to $800 million in free cash flow.
Finally, on a personal note regarding my retirement, I've had the opportunity to work with many of you in the financial community over the past several years. It's been an honor and privilege representing Whirlpool, and I wish you all continued success in the future. I'd like to turn it back over to Jeff."

Overall, I think our ongoing efforts to drive margins, especially in the areas of volatility around the world, have demonstrated our ability to manage the needed actions within our control in response to this global volatility. And I think the first half of the year is really a good example of that because we had many changes that we're able to adapt to. 
We do believe we are well positioned in the second half, and we have deployed strong operational plans across the world to make sure we deliver our goals. So overall, we do expect to deliver record results and while at the same time executing a balanced capital allocation approach. 
Finally on Slide 34, we do continue to execute to our long-term value creation strategy. Overall, we remain confident in our goals.

But the companies, which are LG and Samsung, basically moved their production to China immediately to work around this and continue dumping. And so our new case is for dumping against manufacturers in China, but it specifically affects LG and Samsung. So that required a new action. We're going through the process. We believe the evidence is compelling, as evidenced by the Commerce Department's preliminary judgment with the duties they've levied. They are now having to pay cash deposits on all imports, and in fact, one of them is actually retroactive through the last 3 months because all the product they brought in the marketplace. There's a very clear Commerce Department process that is followed. They will make the final determination in duties in December. Then it goes to the International Trade Commissions to evaluate injury, and we expect that judgment to be mid to late January."

And yes, you're correct. The currency predominantly impacts the margin. And to put that in context, there's obviously a number of currency moves and currency baskets in what flows through our European regions. The most impactful one, just given the size and movement, have been the British pound and the Russian ruble. There are other ones as well, but these are the most impactful ones. And what it means just operationally in the U.K., like us, most competitors don't produce in the U.K. Almost nobody produce in the U.K. So basically, any currency weakness of the British pound turns into kind of a lower margin for us. That's -- so there's an immediate impact. It's somewhat similar in Russia, maybe to a lesser extent, because we produce more in Russia. The combination of these 2 ones, just to put it in absolute terms, was basically $30 million just in the quarter, just these 2 big markets. So we're talking about massive and substantial. So you calculate the back on a European level, that's more than 200 basis points, so that's where the number comes from. Now -- and just for clarity, I'm referring to year-over-year impact of the currency. As you also know, the Russian ruble, even on a weak level, has stabilized. So I think sequentially, we don't see a big surprise but still a year-over-year impact. And as you also know, the British pound for the quarter average has deteriorated, but obviously, particularly post-Brexit, the decline has been significant and it has a significant impact on our margins."

More than half of that is just coming from currency. Also combined is a little bit of mix impact for growth. We have pretty strong volume growth in Mexico, profitable volume growth in Mexico, but it has a mix impact on the ASV.

Having said that, if you look at the pure washers, the profitability is clearly, clearly below where we would expect at any normal time when we're losing money, on top of a volume impact. So your question, unfortunately, the short-term probably is the more theoretical question. The reason I'm saying this one, as evidenced by the ruling, or preliminary ruling, is there has been a significant amount of stockpiling by LG, Samsung in -- at the end of Q2, i.e. inventory-loading. And unfortunately, we see that's still entering the market in Q3. So there is still an impact, and that's just the reality. I would also not be surprised, even though to some extent it's speculation at this point, if that both players continue to circumvent. So I would see some relief on our margins on washers, but it needs to be seen to what extent LG and Samsung actually follow the order, and that's not our decision."

First of all, I really want to reiterate the synergies and the integration is fully on track.

So the increase of restructuring benefit, that's largely Europe. So the cost side is fully on track. That is going really well. We have 2 elements in Europe. There's a little bit of an overlap. One is the currency, the currency impact to the operating margin. The offsetting action are cost-based price increase. That takes time to ramp up, so I expect the margin impact in this one to go with every month be less than this. But of course, right now, it's a Q3 pending issue. The volume impact is to a lesser extent. We're not -- in Q1, as you may recall, we had in Q1 a volume decline of 4%. Now in Q2, we are at a plus 2.1%, so it's getting better. But it's not yet fully at the pace of the market. And that is largely explainable directly by the platform integrations. And again, that's something which we, to some extent, expected but still a pain as we go through it, that we're basically replacing 80% of our SKUs in Europe this year. There are massive factory moves, product platform moves. And that is, basically, we expect it to be largely completed by the end of the year.

And that's ultimately a reflection of the strength of our brand portfolio. That trend is continuing, so it's nothing shocking or surprising or all of a sudden. It's been, I would say, a multiyear erosion. And again, that's where the portfolio of strong brands help us very strongly. I would say also, in addition, and I think we've been talking about this repeatedly, we're -- we take pride in our very balanced distribution footprint. What it means, we have, I would say, a very similar balance, I'd say, with most of our national trade partners. So whenever you see movements or wins and losses of one trade partner in the market, we typically don't see the pain because we have a very well-balanced distribution footprint, which obviously also helps us mitigate in any trends you might see in the marketplace by a private label or OEM business."

Again, first of all, as a reference point, the minus 10%, which we gave as guidance refers to Brazil. That is not Latin America in total, and I would argue probably outside Brazil, the rest of Latin America is probably stronger than the minus 10%. So the minus 10%, particularly in Brazil. I would say that given the extreme volatility, which we've seen in Brazil over the last 5, 6 quarters, I would, right now, say it's close to impossible to predicting exactly what happens by quarter, or -- and if we would know, we probably wouldn't give that guidance. But so right now, it's actually -- we still expect the full year industry to be down minus 10%. We knew in Q1, it was even worse, so maybe it's stabilizing. But bear in mind, it's stabilizing on a very low level because last year, it was already a significant reduction. So we do not see any recovery or any significant recovery in Brazil in the back half of this year. To your question about competitive reaction, we simply do not know. We do not ask them. And frankly, we focus on our own profitability. We did the actions a year ago with all the associated pain. And I would say our business is very well on track. And keep also in mind, these are not just mechanics of pricing up and down, these are new products, product introductions, innovation which we brought to the market, so."

The demand has been constant -- negative demand has been constant and has carried over into this year. We have -- we had 3 major currency devaluations, the last one being in September, October. And we had to adjust each time to those. And then thirdly is inflation. So this year, demand is pretty much playing out as we expected, and we expect it to be down. We're -- both through cost and cost-based price actions, we're dealing with both currency and inflation. But the third factor is we continue, despite the environment, to invest very strongly in new product and brand innovation. That is enabling us to improve our market position. The cost and the price position are allowing us to improve our margins, but the market share gains are purely the fact that we continue to bring new products to the marketplace."

We're very pleased and satisfied with our operating margins, 8% in such a volatile region, and a competitive region is nontrivial, so we're very pleased with that progress. But you're also right, it's a little bit a tale of 2 stories right now. India, in particular, which is a big part of that region, we had exceptionally strong results. That was a strong market, but we also made very good progress in the market with cost productivity and new product introductions and we gained share. So I would say India is really a very bright spot in that Asia, one. China is impacted, even while integration is on track, but it's impacted by a soft market demand. When I talk about China market demand, typically I refer to so-called T2, so it's not the same definition as North America. But right now, even though we don't have the latest June data, I would, right now, assume Q2 China was high single-digits negative. So this is also obviously nontrivial in a very competitive market, which is characterized by a little bit of overcapacity. So to you and specifically to your question, did our distribution expansion yet translate into market share gains? I would say not yet because there are also underlying levers, 2 opposing moves. We are expanding the Whirlpool brand distribution and we're actually gaining volume of the Whirlpool brand, but at the same time, we're phasing out or reducing some value-brand business. So there's 2 offsetting items, and that's why that, net-net, you don't yet see the market share growth, which, over time, you should expect."

So first of all, every market around the world is slightly differently set up. So the kind of construction business, which we have in the U.S., what we refer typically to as the build of our contract channel, you don't have it to the same magnitude in the U.K. because there is no typical -- there is a pure national builder, so you don't have this national builder business. Having said that, of course, like any other markets, in particular, when you talk about kitchen demand, it's still impacted by housing activity. I would say, not to the same extent as North America in terms of statistic correlation, but there is an impact. Do we see any signs of a pullback here yet? No. I just simply do not see it. And so -- but could you expect that over time? Maybe. I would say it's too early to tell. As you also know, and I just now -- right now tried to draw the analogy of other markets where you had sudden currency shifts, you may see odd behaviors from a market demand. We have -- it wouldn't be the first market where you're short-term to even see an increase of demand because people are still going for lower-priced appliances, and then you see the opposite effect. So it's too early to see there in U.K. It's speculation, but that's the pattern which we have seen in many markets.

As you saw in our press release this morning, we reported record operating results for the second quarter, driven by strong ex-currency revenue growth and substantial margin expansion of 1.",757,"Well, good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. As you saw in our press release this morning, we reported record operating results for the second quarter, driven by strong ex-currency revenue growth and substantial margin expansion of 1.6 points. 
Our integration activities in Europe and Asia continue to progress well, and we remain on track to deliver significant cost synergies for the balance of the year. Our strong operational execution more than offset currency and demand challenges around the world. And as a result, we delivered another record quarter of performance. Following the strong first half performance, we're increasing our full year guidance for ongoing earnings per share to $14.25 to $14.75. 
Before we move to the details of the quarter results, I'd like to highlight an important ruling by the Commerce Department on our washer trade -- fair trade case. We're very pleased that this ruling confirmed that LG and Samsung continue to dump washing machines in the U.S. market. Both companies are now required to pay substantial deposits for these products, which they import from China. 
As we've previously discussed, this unlawful behavior clearly had a negative impact on our washer -- washing machine market share and earnings in 2015 and in the first half of 2016. But despite this, we are pleased that we're still able to deliver record results through the strength of the rest of our portfolio of products and brands. 
I'll now turn to Slide 5 where we'll take a look at the financial results for the second quarter. Our revenues overall grew 3% versus last year ex currency. Our ongoing earnings per share grew by 30% to a record $3.50 per share. And this came through strong execution of acquisition synergies, volume growth and ongoing cost productivity programs and free cash flow improved versus last year.
Turning to Slide 6, you'll see that we are raising our 2016 guidance following the strong first half performance. Again, we now expect ongoing earnings per share to be $14.25 to $14.75 per share. We are reaffirming our expected free cash flow generation of $700 million to $800 million, which represents a significant improvement over the prior year. We are confident that our continued focus on execution and strong second half actions will enable us to deliver another year of record results.
On Slide 7, you'll see that our 2016 priorities remain unchanged. We do remain confident in our ability to manage economic volatility and have deployed strong operational plans, which we believe will enable us to grow revenues and continue to expand our operating margins.
On Slide 8, our capital allocation strategy remains also unchanged. We continue to prioritize funding the business, along with delivery of strong return to shareholders, and we continue to evaluate opportunistic value-creating M&A opportunities. 
During the second quarter, we did purchase $100 million of shares during the quarter. We intend to continue repurchasing stock through the year and we currently have $900 million of remaining share repurchase authorization. So overall, we do remain confident in our ability to deliver long-term value creation through strong cash generation and the execution of our balanced capital allocation process.
Before I move on to our regional businesses, I wanted to comment on the leadership announcements, which we made in late June. As you probably know, our Chief Financial Officer, Larry Venturelli, has announced his planned retirement. We also have announced that Jim Peters, currently our Vice President, Corporate Controller and Chief Accounting Officer, will succeed Larry as Chief Financial Officer. 
First of all, I'd like to take this opportunity to thank Larry for his over 15 years of service to our company in a number of leadership roles, including the last 5 years as Chief Financial Officer. Larry has played an integral part of our executive management team and in helping us in our global expansion, including most recently the successful acquisitions of Indesit in Europe and Hefei Sanyo in China. 
At Whirlpool, Larry will be greatly missed, but we all wish he and his family the very best in his upcoming retirement. At this time, I'm also pleased to welcome Jim Peters into his new role of Chief Financial Officer. Jim does have a very broad background in our global finance leadership in a number of roles and in our business operations. And I'm very confident that under his leadership, we will continue to execute our global value creation plans. 
So with that, I'll stop here and turn it over to Marc Bitzer to review our global operations."

Turning to Slide 10, we will review North America's performance in the second quarter. We delivered record operating profit by growing ex-currency revenues 4% and expanding operating margin to 12.3%. We improved T",1152,"Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 10, we will review North America's performance in the second quarter. We delivered record operating profit by growing ex-currency revenues 4% and expanding operating margin to 12.3%. We improved T6 market share versus prior year and saw a strong consumer demand for our products. 
Our record second quarter operating margins were driven by our ongoing cost productivity programs and operating leverage from revenue growth, which more than offset $20 million in unfavorable currency impacts in Canada and Mexico.
Turning to Slide 11. We outline our 2016 operation priorities for the North American region. We continue to expect the industry to grow 5% to 6% for the full year. As we have done consistently, we will make targeted investments to grow profitably at or above the industry rates. We continue to leverage our strong cost productivity programs to drive margin improvement, and we remain focused on growing our adjacent businesses. We are confident that these actions will allow us to deliver at the higher end of our margin targets for 12% to 12.5%.
Turning to Slide 12. We highlight our exciting new French Door bottom-mount refrigeration platform. The jumbo capacity product features the most shelf space among leading brands in the industry. It offers the first-to-market flexible pantry-inspired shelving system, delivering both the capacity and flexibility our customers desire. 
Beginning on Slide 13, I will review the second quarter results for our Europe, Middle East and Africa region. Sales were $1.3 billion, down slightly from the prior year. Excluding the impact of currency, sales were flat. Ongoing operating margin was 4.6%, a 40 basis point increase compared to prior year. This [ph] margin expansion included a 200 basis point unfavorable currency impact primarily from the British pound and the Russian ruble. We have deployed previously announced cost-based price increases to offset this currency impact.
Turning to Slide 14. We want to put our European business in context by providing additional details of our first half performance and the plan for the second half. We made significant progress on the integration of Indesit, demonstrated by the substantial first half restructuring and synergy benefits that Larry will discuss in more detail. 
We are confident in our ability to deliver planned 2016 synergies evenly in the third and fourth quarters. We experienced a negative first half currency impact primarily in U.K. and Russia and have deployed previously announced cost-based price increase to improve our operating margins as we progress throughout the second half of the year. We are in the process of integrating product platforms across Europe and expect to make strong progress by year-end. We expect to grow second half revenues with fully deployed marketing and sales activities.
We do believe we have the right actions to address the operating environment, and as a result, we expect operating margins to improve throughout the second half. We expect our exit rate on operating margins in the fourth quarter to be more consistent with our long-range expectation of 7% to 8%. 
On Slide 15, in addition to the second half actions we discussed, our 2016 priorities remain largely unchanged, with the continued focus on integration activities, ongoing cost productivity and growth from adjacent businesses. We also continue to expect the industry to be flat to up 2% for the full year, but clearly, there is some uncertainty in the European region. Through the strength of our operating plans and continued acquisition benefit, we remain confident in our long-term guidance of 7% to 8% operating margins by 2018.
On Slide 16, we're proud to feature award-winning built-in oven of our new built-in kitchen suite. This product incorporates advanced cooking technology and on-demand recipes with elegant, contemporary aesthetics for sophisticated customers.
Turning to Slide 17, I will discuss our Latin America results. Sales for the quarter were $826 million. Excluding the impact of currency, sales increased 4%. The industry in Brazil continues to be challenging. However, our top line performance in Brazil was strong as we continue to leverage our leading portfolio of brands to drive growth and outperform the industry. We were able to gain several points of market share in the second quarter while substantial improving our operating margins. Our operating profit for the quarter totaled $50 million, 190 basis point increase compared to prior year.
The actions we have taken over the past year to improve margins in a challenging environment and grow market share have been successful, and we now expect to deliver the higher end of the range of our margin targets of 7% to 7.5%.
On Slide 18, we summarize our priorities in Latin America, which have not changed. As we have done consistently, we will manage economic volatility through strong cost productivity programs and by leveraging our right-sized fixed-cost structure. We will continue to invest in new products and remain well positioned to capitalize on growth in Brazil when consumer demand does return.
On Slide 19, we're highlighting our award-winning Brastemp brand. This year, Brastemp was recognized in a nationwide study as Brazil's most engaging consumer appliance brand, building on 6 decades of inspirational performance and superior design. 
Now we turn to our second quarter results in the Asia region, which are shown on Slide 20. Net sales were $363 million in comparison to $381 million in the prior year period. Excluding the impact of currency, sales were flat. Our ongoing operating profit was $29 million compared to $31 million in the prior year period. Ongoing operating margins were 8.1%, flat to prior year as continued record performance in India and ongoing cost productivity to offset weak demand in China.
Turning to Slide 21, you will see that our 2016 priorities for Asia have not changed. We remain focused on growth through distribution expansion and ongoing cost productivity programs. We also continue to focus on the longer-term opportunity in China as we navigate through demand uncertainty.
On Slide 22, we showcase our new front-load washing machine for China. We leverage the integration between Hefei, Indesit and Whirlpool using the best of the best to provide consumers with world-class laundry performance.
Finally on Slide 23, we summarize our regional margin guidance for the full year. Given continued global volatility in some regions and strong first half performance in others, we have adjusted our margin expectations as follows: North America increase to 12% to 12.5%; Latin America increase to 7% to 7.5%; Europe decrease to 5.5% to 6% due to negative currency impacts and the expected timing of our offsetting actions; Asia remains unchanged at 7% to 8%. 
It is important to note that we are on track for strong margin expansion in all regions and have not changed our overall operating margin guidance. We remain confident in our ability to manage for global volatility and to deliver our strong second half plans.
Now I'd like to turn it over one last time to Larry."

As Jeff mentioned, we had strong performance in the second quarter despite a challenging external environment. Net sales were $5.2 billion. Excluding the impact of currency, revenues were up 3%. We achieved record ongoing earnings of $3.50 per share, which was up 30%, primarily driven by acquisition synergies, unit volume growth and ongoing cost productivity.
In the second quarter, currency impacted our revenues by approximately $150 million, EBIT margin by about 1 point and net earnings by $0.50 per share. Our ongoing EBIT margin improved by more than 1 point, and we are fully on track for our full year guidance of 8% to 8.5%. On a GAAP basis, our second quarter tax rate was driven by the timing of tax settlements and planning activities and does not impact our previous guidance of 22% for the full year. Our ongoing tax rate for the quarter was 22%, consistent with our previous guidance. Overall, we are very pleased with our results for the quarter and are at the appropriate run rates to deliver a very strong second half.
Turning to Slide 26, let me take a moment to discuss the expected impact of currency on the results for the year. You may recall in our original guidance for 2016, we assumed a negative impact of $2.50 per share. During our first quarter call, as currencies began to improve, we indicated that if April rates held, we would expect $0.50 per share lower currency headwinds for the year. 
While there was significant volatility to key currencies in the second quarter, the net result for the basket of currencies we're exposed to has not changed substantially since our last call. We expect the impact of currency to be approximately $2 per share for the full year. We will continue to execute previously announced cost-based price increases and deliver cost reductions to offset negative currency impacts, and our ongoing hedging programs continue to be an effective tool for us to reduce short-term volatility.
On Slide 27, you'll see an update on the progress of our restructuring and acquisition integration activities. Through the first half, we incurred restructuring expense of $87 million and delivered $120 million in benefits. We now expect $200 million in expense for the year and are increasing benefits to $200 million. Overall, we are on track to deliver our previously announced synergy goals through 2017.
Turning to Slide 28, I will discuss our expectations for full year EBIT margin expansion. As previously communicated, we expect to expand our margin by over 1 point, primarily driven by ongoing cost productivity and cost and capacity reductions. Our first half year-over-year EBIT margin improvement continues to support our full year expectation. We expect to continue funding our global brand and product innovation and to absorb approximately 1 point of margin impact from currency.
On Slide 29, we highlight the cadence of second half earnings drivers. Consistent with historical trends, we expect a meaningful step-up in the seasonality of our volumes between Q3 and Q4. We expect negative currency impacts to continue in Q3, but will lessen in Q4. As a result of these trends, we expect our second half earnings to approximate 45% in the third quarter and 55% in the fourth quarter, which is very consistent with what you saw last year. 
On Slide 30, we share some details on our first half free cash flow results and capital allocation actions. Our free cash flow improved versus prior year, primarily due to the improved earnings. Consistent with our strategy, we executed a balanced approach to capital allocation by funding the capital needs of our business and returning cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and previously announced share repurchase program. We plan to buy back additional shares throughout the year.
Turning to Slide 31, we're adjusting our full year guidance in response to our strong first half results. As Marc discussed in the regional reviews, we are confident in our operational plans, and as a result, we expect to deliver 15%-plus growth in ongoing earnings per share in 2016 and approximately $700 million to $800 million in free cash flow.
Finally, on a personal note regarding my retirement, I've had the opportunity to work with many of you in the financial community over the past several years. It's been an honor and privilege representing Whirlpool, and I wish you all continued success in the future. I'd like to turn it back over to Jeff."

I'll summarize on Slide 33, which shows again our 2016 priorities, which haven't changed, and our plan is to drive revenue growth, margin expansion and to generate strong free cash flow for the year.
Overall, I think our ongoing efforts to drive margins, especially in the areas of volatility around the world, have demonstrated our ability to manage the needed actions within our control in response to this global volatility. And I think the first half of the year is really a good example of that because we had many changes that we're able to adapt to. 
We do believe we are well positioned in the second half, and we have deployed strong operational plans across the world to make sure we deliver our goals. So overall, we do expect to deliver record results and while at the same time executing a balanced capital allocation approach. 
Finally on Slide 34, we do continue to execute to our long-term value creation strategy. Overall, we remain confident in our goals. We do expect to be able to continue to leverage our industry-leading brands, keep bringing a strong portfolio of innovation to the marketplace and our best cost position to ensure that we're delivering strong returns to our shareholders.

And the countries involved then were South Korea and Mexico, and we won very decisively in that case. But the companies, which are LG and Samsung, basically moved their production to China immediately to work around this and continue dumping. And so our new case is for dumping against manufacturers in China, but it specifically affects LG and Samsung. So that required a new action. We're going through the process. We believe the evidence is compelling, as evidenced by the Commerce Department's preliminary judgment with the duties they've levied. They are now having to pay cash deposits on all imports, and in fact, one of them is actually retroactive through the last 3 months because all the product they brought in the marketplace. There's a very clear Commerce Department process that is followed. They will make the final determination in duties in December. Then it goes to the International Trade Commissions to evaluate injury, and we expect that judgment to be mid to late January."

And yes, you're correct. The currency predominantly impacts the margin. And to put that in context, there's obviously a number of currency moves and currency baskets in what flows through our European regions. The most impactful one, just given the size and movement, have been the British pound and the Russian ruble. There are other ones as well, but these are the most impactful ones. And what it means just operationally in the U.K., like us, most competitors don't produce in the U.K. Almost nobody produce in the U.K. So basically, any currency weakness of the British pound turns into kind of a lower margin for us. That's -- so there's an immediate impact. It's somewhat similar in Russia, maybe to a lesser extent, because we produce more in Russia. The combination of these 2 ones, just to put it in absolute terms, was basically $30 million just in the quarter, just these 2 big markets. So we're talking about massive and substantial. So you calculate the back on a European level, that's more than 200 basis points, so that's where the number comes from. Now -- and just for clarity, I'm referring to year-over-year impact of the currency. As you also know, the Russian ruble, even on a weak level, has stabilized. So I think sequentially, we don't see a big surprise but still a year-over-year impact. And as you also know, the British pound for the quarter average has deteriorated, but obviously, particularly post-Brexit, the decline has been significant and it has a significant impact on our margins."

More than half of that is just coming from currency. Also combined is a little bit of mix impact for growth. We have pretty strong volume growth in Mexico, profitable volume growth in Mexico, but it has a mix impact on the ASV. The other part and that goes straight back to Jeff's earlier comment, yes, we are exposed to the continued and sustained dumping practices in the washer business. And that has an impact on our ASV.

Having said that, if you look at the pure washers, the profitability is clearly, clearly below where we would expect at any normal time when we're losing money, on top of a volume impact. So your question, unfortunately, the short-term probably is the more theoretical question. The reason I'm saying this one, as evidenced by the ruling, or preliminary ruling, is there has been a significant amount of stockpiling by LG, Samsung in -- at the end of Q2, i.e. inventory-loading. And unfortunately, we see that's still entering the market in Q3. So there is still an impact, and that's just the reality. I would also not be surprised, even though to some extent it's speculation at this point, if that both players continue to circumvent.

First of all, I really want to reiterate the synergies and the integration is fully on track. So the cost side is a safe bet, i.e. what we control, we do control and actually, we deliver more, as evidenced by Larry's earlier comments. So the increase of restructuring benefit, that's largely Europe. So the cost side is fully on track. That is going really well. We have 2 elements in Europe. There's a little bit of an overlap. One is the currency, the currency impact to the operating margin. The offsetting action are cost-based price increase. That takes time to ramp up, so I expect the margin impact in this one to go with every month be less than this. But of course, right now, it's a Q3 pending issue. The volume impact is to a lesser extent. We're not -- in Q1, as you may recall, we had in Q1 a volume decline of 4%. Now in Q2, we are at a plus 2.1%, so it's getting better. But it's not yet fully at the pace of the market. And that is largely explainable directly by the platform integrations. And again, that's something which we, to some extent, expected but still a pain as we go through it, that we're basically replacing 80% of our SKUs in Europe this year. There are massive factory moves, product platform moves. And that is, basically, we expect it to be largely completed by the end of the year. That is probably the single-biggest driver behind the top line issue.

But so right now, it's actually -- we still expect the full year industry to be down minus 10%. We knew in Q1, it was even worse, so maybe it's stabilizing. But bear in mind, it's stabilizing on a very low level because last year, it was already a significant reduction. So we do not see any recovery or any significant recovery in Brazil in the back half of this year. To your question about competitive reaction, we simply do not know. We do not ask them. And frankly, we focus on our own profitability. We did the actions a year ago with all the associated pain. And I would say our business is very well on track.

The demand has been constant -- negative demand has been constant and has carried over into this year. We have -- we had 3 major currency devaluations, the last one being in September, October. And we had to adjust each time to those. And then thirdly is inflation. So this year, demand is pretty much playing out as we expected, and we expect it to be down. We're -- both through cost and cost-based price actions, we're dealing with both currency and inflation. But the third factor is we continue, despite the environment, to invest very strongly in new product and brand innovation. That is enabling us to improve our market position. The cost and the price position are allowing us to improve our margins, but the market share gains are purely the fact that we continue to bring new products to the marketplace."

We're very pleased and satisfied with our operating margins, 8% in such a volatile region, and a competitive region is nontrivial, so we're very pleased with that progress. But you're also right, it's a little bit a tale of 2 stories right now. India, in particular, which is a big part of that region, we had exceptionally strong results. That was a strong market, but we also made very good progress in the market with cost productivity and new product introductions and we gained share. So I would say India is really a very bright spot in that Asia, one. China is impacted, even while integration is on track, but it's impacted by a soft market demand. When I talk about China market demand, typically I refer to so-called T2, so it's not the same definition as North America. But right now, even though we don't have the latest June data, I would, right now, assume Q2 China was high single-digits negative. So this is also obviously nontrivial in a very competitive market, which is characterized by a little bit of overcapacity. So to you and specifically to your question, did our distribution expansion yet translate into market share gains? I would say not yet because there are also underlying levers, 2 opposing moves. We are expanding the Whirlpool brand distribution and we're actually gaining volume of the Whirlpool brand, but at the same time, we're phasing out or reducing some value-brand business. So there's 2 offsetting items, and that's why that, net-net, you don't yet see the market share growth, which, over time, you should expect."

So first of all, every market around the world is slightly differently set up. So the kind of construction business, which we have in the U.S., what we refer typically to as the build of our contract channel, you don't have it to the same magnitude in the U.K. because there is no typical -- there is a pure national builder, so you don't have this national builder business. Having said that, of course, like any other markets, in particular, when you talk about kitchen demand, it's still impacted by housing activity. I would say, not to the same extent as North America in terms of statistic correlation, but there is an impact. Do we see any signs of a pullback here yet? No. I just simply do not see it. And so -- but could you expect that over time? Maybe. I would say it's too early to tell. As you also know, and I just now -- right now tried to draw the analogy of other markets where you had sudden currency shifts, you may see odd behaviors from a market demand. We have -- it wouldn't be the first market where you're short-term to even see an increase of demand because people are still going for lower-priced appliances, and then you see the opposite effect. So it's too early to see there in U.K. It's speculation, but that's the pattern which we have seen in many markets.

As you saw in our press release this morning, our operational execution offset some significant external challenges that we saw in the quarter. But we did deliver record results for the third quarter. 
During the quarter, currency continued to be volatile and negative and we saw some softness in the appliance demand, most prominently in the U.K. and the U.S. Despite this volatility, we are able to deliver record results, and year-to-date, our earnings have increased by 18%. In North America and Latin America, we expanded margins while gaining market share, which was done by leveraging our leading brands, launching innovative new products and delivering strong ongoing cost productivity. And finally, consistent with our balanced capital allocation approach, we've repurchased $100 million of our common stock during the quarter. 
Overall, the fundamentals of our business remains strong, and we continue to adapt to our operating plans in order to deliver strong results.
I'll now turn to Slide 5, where you'll see our third quarter results. 
Our revenues, ex currency, increased slightly. Our ongoing business earnings grew to a record $3.66 a share. It is [ph] gained through a combination of acquisition synergies, unit volume growth and ongoing cost productivities. And we improved our free cash flow for the year.
Turning to Slide 6. We have an update on the external environment and some of the challenges that we're facing and offsetting. We have seen what we believe is a temporary softness in industry demand in the U.S., particularly what you saw [ph] earlier in the quarter in July and August, with some rebound in September. We believe this is due to consumer confidence we gained [ph] primarily due to the focus around the U.S. elections.
In addition, the promotional environment in the U.S. has been -- has elevated during the quarter, especially in the washing machine category. There, certain import competitors continue to unlawfully dump product, and we're responding with continued investment in our strong brands, launching new, innovative products, as well as our fair trade actions. 
For the year, in Europe, our integration is on track and we're delivering cost synergies in line with our plans. And our previously discussed margin recovery actions in Europe are progressing, and we do expect to see the positive impact of these actions over the next couple of quarters, somewhat later than we originally thought because we continue to see currency and demand volatility, particularly in the U.K. market.
Overall, we expect to deliver a record performance this year with approximately 15% ongoing EPS growth, over 0.5 point of ongoing EBIT margin improvement and good improvement in free cash flow. 
On Slide 7, we've updated our 2016 guidance to reflect these changes. We now expect to deliver ongoing earnings of $14 to $14.25 a share and to generate approximately $700 million in free cash flow.
Turning to Slide 8. We show our balanced capital allocation approach, which has not changed. We continue to appropriately fund our business and expect to invest between $650 million and $700 million in capital this year. As I mentioned, we did repurchase $100 million in share repurchases during the third quarter, and we do intend to continue repurchasing stock in the fourth quarter. So in total, we remain committed to delivering our long-term value creation objectives through our operational execution and a balanced approach to capital allocation.
So with that, I'm going to turn it over to Marc Bitzer to review our global operations."

Turning to Slide 10, we will review our performance in North America. Net sales increased 2% versus prior year and grew 3% excluding currency, and we expanded our ongoing operating margins to a third quarter recor",1316,"Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 10, we will review our performance in North America. Net sales increased 2% versus prior year and grew 3% excluding currency, and we expanded our ongoing operating margins to a third quarter record of 12.1%. Our operating margins were driven by strong ongoing cost productivity programs and unit volume growth, which more than offset approximately $25 million in unfavorable currency impact in Canada and Mexico. 
During the quarter, we gained over 1 point [ph] of market share versus the prior year as consumer demand for our brands and products have continued to be strong. As demonstrated by our performance, we remain focused on driving both revenue growth and margin expansion.
Turning to Slide 11. I will discuss some external factors affecting our North America region. As Jeff outlined earlier, we have seen a temporary slowdown in U.S. appliance industry demand since our last call. We are confident that the stiff [ph] in consumer discretionary purchases is temporary as consumer confidence has been impacted by the upcoming U.S. elections. We increasingly see solid consumer demand for our strong brands and new products and expect to continue to generate profitable market share gains. However, we have seen an increase in promotional activity in the U.S., especially on washers. This corresponds with significant inventory stockpiling by certain competitors at the end of the second quarter, who we believe are continuing to unlawfully dump products. This higher promotional intensity had a significant negative impact on our washer margins in the third quarter. We continue to pursue our fair trade case for washers manufacturers [ph] in China and anticipate a final ruling in early 2017.
Additionally, we have recently announced cost base price increases, primarily in washers, to allow us to recover the cost of our investments in new and compelling products. We expect that these actions, along with a focus on value-creating promotions and strong productivity programs, will offset negative margin impacts from continued dumping by certain competitors.
We fully expect to deliver strong results in the fourth quarter and remain on track to achieve our long-term goal. 
Turning to Slide 12, we'll discuss key drivers of the U.S. appliance industry. The fundamental underpinning U.S. appliance [ph] demand are healthy. During recent years, we have seen steady growth in key macro indicators, including housing starts in both new and existing home sales, as well as improvement of other [ph] relevant indicators such as consumer sentiment and unemployment. While some of the individual monthly data is volatile, the trends overwhelmingly demonstrate strong demand for housing, increasing levels of employment, real wage growth and long-term improvement in consumer sentiment. We've seen 15 consecutive quarters of appliance industry growth in the U.S., and all of these underlying macro trends support continued growth to U.S. appliance industry in the coming years.
As such, we believe that the current industry slowdown is a temporary shift, consistent with what we're seeing in the retail environment for housing, [ph] and we remain confident that the multiyear cycle of U.S. demand growth will continue in 2017 and beyond. 
Turning to Slide 13. We outline our 2016 operational expectations for the North America region.  We now expect the industry to grow 3% to 4% for the full year. Through the end of the third quarter, the industry's up a little over 3.5%. We continue to expect to grow at or above industry rates with targeted investment in our strong brands and new products, as we have done consistently throughout the year. We continue to execute strong cost productivity programs and we remain focused on achieving growth in our adjacent businesses. We now expect to deliver 11.5% to 12% margin in 2016, an increase over the prior year.
Beginning on Slide 14, we will review our third quarter results for our Europe, Middle East and Africa regions. Sales were $1.3 billion, down 9% versus the prior year. Excluding the impact of currency, sales were down 6% as we saw demand softness in certain key countries, particularly in the U.K.
Ongoing operating margins were 3.7%. Our margins were negatively affected by approximately $40 million in unfavorable impact in our U.K. business from a devaluing British pound and softening demand environment.
Turning to Slide 15, we'll provide an update to our previously deployed actions in Europe. 
The integration of Indesit continue to be on track, and we fully expect to deliver planned cost synergies in the fourth quarter and into 2017. Consistent with what we've seen since the Brexit decision, currency continues to be a headwind and demand in the U.K. remains soft, causing our previously announced cost base price increase to be implemented slower than anticipated. Our platform integration and manufacturing transitions remain on track. However, we reduced manufacturing volumes in response to this lower demand, [ph] most of which occurred in the third quarter, and we now expect roughly 0.5 point [ph] margin impact for the full year. As a result, our margin expansion in Europe is slightly delayed. 
In summary, we believe we have the right actions in place to manage through [ph] volatility and deliver our long-term goals.
On Slide 16, our 2016 priorities for the European, Middle East and Africa region remain largely unchanged. There's a continued focus on integration activities, ongoing cost productivity and growth from adjacent businesses. Similar to the third quarter, we plan to manage inventory levels as we continue product and brand transitions [ph] in the fourth quarter.
Our industry guidance remains flat to up 2% for the full year. We now expect to deliver 4.5% to 5% operating margin for the full year and remain confident in our long-term margin guidance of 8%.
I will now discuss our Latin America results on Slide 17.
Sales for the quarter were $800 million, an increase of 7%. Excluding the impact of currencies, sales increased 2%. Our third quarter operating profit totaled $45 million, and margin increased 150 basis points versus the prior year. Despite operating in a challenging demand environment, we expanded margins and delivered strong revenue growth from continued investments in our brands and products. We gained significant market share while also improving price mix in Brazil, and we continue to benefit from substantial fixed cost reduction actions, which we began implementing last year.
On Slide 18, our priorities in Latin America have not changed. We remain well-prepared to manage through volatility, as we have done consistently over the past several quarters through cost productivity, significant market share gains and positive price mix. For a couple quarters now, we've been monitoring the difference between sell-in and sell-out volumes in the Brazilian market, at which time [ph] because we've seen our trade customers build some inventory, we are expecting an inventory correction in the fourth quarter. And as a result, we now expect the Brazil industry to be down 10% to 12% for the full year. We now expect to deliver 6.5% to 7% operating margins for the full year.
Now we turn to our third quarter results for the Asia region, which are shown on Slide 19. 
Net sales were $338 million versus $346 million in the prior year period. Excluding the impact of currency, sales increased 2%. Our ongoing operating profit was $17 million compared to $27 million in the prior year period. Ongoing operating margins were 4.9% as continued demand softness and price/mix challenges in China more than offset continued record performance in India. 
Turning to Slide 20. You will see our 2016 priorities for Asia. We are focused on marketplace investments on our core product offerings, driving strong mix. The brand transition from Sanyo to Whirpool is progressing, and we are now focused on increasing awareness of our Whirlpool brand. As a result of these actions we're confident in our ability to deliver our long-term margin goals in the Asia region. 
Now I'd like to turn it over to Jim Peters."

As Jeff mentioned, we delivered another quarter of record results despite operating in a challenging external environment. 
Turning to our third quarter results on Slide 22. Net sales were $5.2 billion. We achieved record ongoing earnings of $3.66 per share, primarily driven by strong delivery of acquisition synergies, unit volume growth and ongoing cost productivity program. Currency had a top line impact of approximately $40 million and reduced EBIT margins by approximately 1 point. 
Some currencies have strengthened against the U.S. dollar, most notably in Canada and Brazil. However, we are hedged at rates more reflective of last year's environment, and as such, we are not seeing the full benefit of those currencies strengthening in our operating margin. Our third quarter tax rate was driven by the timing of tax settlements and planning activities, and we now expect a 19% tax rate for the full year. Overall, we are pleased with our results through the first 3 quarters of 2016 and are on track to deliver strong full year results.
On Slide 23, we provide an update on the progress of our restructuring and acquisition integration activities. Through the third quarter, we have incurred restructuring expenses of $116 million and delivered $165 million in benefits. We continue to expect $200 million in expense and $200 million in benefits for the full year, which is ahead of plan. I will now discuss our expectations for full year EBIT margin expansion on Slide 24.
As Marc discussed in the regional reviews, we have seen elevated promotional activity in the U.S. since our last call, as well as delayed benefits of our previously announced cost base price increases in the U.K. Both had a negative impact on our price/mix, which we now expect to be flat to slightly negative for the year. We are also slightly reducing our ongoing cost productivity due to the impact of softer global demand on production levels.  As a result of these changes, we now expect to deliver approximately 7.5% EBIT margin for the full year, more than 0.5 point expansion over the prior year. 
On Slide 25, we share some details of our free cash flow results and capital allocation actions through the third quarter. Our free cash flow improved versus prior year, primarily due to improved earnings. We expect full year free cash flow of $700 million, which is inclusive of $150 million of restructuring cash outlays and $155 million associated with legacy product warranty actions in EMEA. Consistent with our strategy, we continue to execute a balanced approach to capital allocation by funding the capital needs of our business and returning cash to our shareholders.
We have executed $425 million in share repurchases year-to-date, and we plan to buy back additional shares in the fourth quarter, consistent with our prior statement.
Turning to Slide 26. We are adjusting our full year guidance, as discussed earlier. We are confident in our operational plans and expect to deliver up to 15% growth in ongoing earnings per share and approximately $700 million in free cash flow in 2016.
Now I'd like to turn it back over to Jeff."

Turning to Slide 28, I'd like to summarize our discussion today. We have deployed strong actions to offset the operating challenges we faced in the third quarter.

We have deployed strong actions to offset the operating challenges we faced in the third quarter. We do expect to deliver another record year, including about a 15% EPS growth and strong free cash flow. 
On Slide 29, you'll see our long-term value creation strategy, which remains unchanged. We are committed to being the best global brand and consumer products company in the world. 
We believe our ability to generate earnings growth and free cash flow is very strong. We have the leading market positions in 3 of the 4 regions [ph] the world, a very strong platform for our continued growth. And our brands are very well-established and reach over 90% [ph] of the clients consumers [ph] globally. So we are confident that our strategy will continue to deliver significant value. 
Finally, on Slide 30, I want to make a few comments on our 2016 operating performance and over a longer period of time. Over the last 5 years, we have delivered record results, including -- counting 2016, with over 20% annualized earnings EPS growth despite what I would describe a challenging external environment. And in the last 2 years, we've absorbed over $6 per share impact from global currencies weakening against the U.S. dollar in a very unprecedented manner. Additionally, we've seen significant demand declines in our major emerging markets, which are Brazil, Russia and China. This has had a $2 impact per share over the last 2 years. But within this environment, we were able to grow our earnings by 10% in 2015, and we expect to grow them additionally by 15% this year. And all while driving strong free cash flow. We've used that cash to reinvest in our business, increase our dividend, pay down debt and buy back nearly $700 million in stock. 
Today, managing through economic volatility is the new normal, and it's part of our everyday operating management system. We believe that we continue to demonstrate our ability to navigate through those challenges, and because of that, we remain confident in our ability to effectively manage our business in this type of environment. 
So in total, we believe we have significant opportunities to continue creating shareholder value going forward. 
So with that, I'm going to end our formal remarks, and we'd like to open it up for questions."

First of all, let me first talk about what happened in Q3 in washers and what we are going to do about it going forward. First of all, in Q3, as we indicated in our remarks, we saw an increased promotional intensity, in particular, in washers. I would say all the other categories had promotional intensity, but nothing earth-shattering [ph] or surprising to our -- from our perspective. In washers, it was more intense. To some extent, we were not completely surprised because we saw certain competitors stockpiling a lot of inventory at the end of Q2, and I think we made a remark on that during the last earnings call. The negative impact on us is kind of twofold, if you want to say. One, because obviously, we cannot and will not participate in certain value-destructing promotions. So of course, you lose volume and, thus, [ph] the leverage in your overall production. Two, is a mix element, because if you basically have the high-end of your range by certain competitor pulled down very much, [ph] you lose a lot of mix. To be more specific, take a typical front load washer, we have a line structure anywhere from $399 or $499 to $999 -- not $399, $499 to $999. [ph] If certain competitors bring that down to $599 or even below, it's hard to build a line structure, and therefore, you lose mix. So you had [ph] a twofold negative impact on our business. What we're going to do about it, apart from continue to invest in new product and innovation, which we are launching in the market, [ph] is two, yes, we have announced certain price increases because we felt that certain price levels just do not reflect the cost investment we [ph] put behind product. These price effects or cost base price increases are in effect for January 1. Thirdly, as Jeff also indicated, we are continuing to pursue the antidumping lawsuits. We remain confident in our ability to win on this one So I think the combination of all these 3 elements make us believe that we can fully restore our margins in the washer business."

We have strong market position and strong above average operating margin. If you just look at a pure currency now Q3 over Q3 last year, you basically have roughly 22% decline. So it's been massive. To Jim's earlier point, it has been a little bit moderated because of some hedging programs, but it's still massive. You also need to keep in mind that about 85% to -- yes roughly 85% of products which we sell in the U.K. are imported or produced on a euro base. So you basically have a full cost base impact on this one. So it's significant. The $40 [ph] million impact, which I referred to in the script, is related to one, obviously the margin loss because of higher cost base; and two, we implemented a price increase in September -- or we started to implement it and yes, we saw significant volume reduction in the month of September. The combination of these 2 things were roughly $40 million. So it's by definition, a massive impact on our operating results in Europe in Q3. To your question about the price increases and the progress, we had a small price increase in July, where we frankly had a hard time getting traction. We're seen the traction on the invoices, but yes, we still have a drag on the volume. And we expect that drag also be there for Q4 a slightly lower level."

As you know in our products and particularly discretionary demand is larger by consumer confidence. Will that improve and recover after November 8? Probably not immediately, not the next day but over time, we expect it to do so.

So if you want to find any negative which could impact that, you can, of course, if the Fed rates would come up too fast, too quickly, that could have an impact. I don't think that's likely, but I don't know. But outside of this one, you would have to find any macro economic outside the housing industry and appliance industry which could impact the confidence."

It's the currency which impacts a lot. If you kind of peel back the onion, of course, a lot of moving pieces I think for us the most promising sign going forward is start seeing recovery in the U.S., in Russia and Ukraine. That's an early sign, but you know in this acquisition, we're very exposed to both U.K. and Russia. And right now, both markets are soft from currency and demand. But we see Russia slowly coming back. And it's now early to call it a recovery but early signs are promising. Specifically to our demand, for us, U.K. markets is better as a market when we saw in our demand. That is directly related to us coming out of price increases in September. The rest of the industry did not fully follow and that impacted our demand. That's the particular impact. Outside of the U.K., I would say by and large, our demand is solid. Probably the only other exception will be Middle East and Africa, which is still being impacted by uncertainty by entire space."

As you saw in our press release this morning, our operational execution offset some significant external challenges that we saw in the quarter. But we did deliver record results for the third quarter. 
During the quarter, currency continued to be volatile and negative and we saw some softness in the appliance demand, most prominently in the U.K. and the U.S. Despite this volatility, we are able to deliver record results, and year-to-date, our earnings have increased by 18%. In North America and Latin America, we expanded margins while gaining market share, which was done by leveraging our leading brands, launching innovative new products and delivering strong ongoing cost productivity. And finally, consistent with our balanced capital allocation approach, we've repurchased $100 million of our common stock during the quarter. 
Overall, the fundamentals of our business remains strong, and we continue to adapt to our operating plans in order to deliver strong results.
I'll now turn to Slide 5, where you'll see our third quarter results. 
Our revenues, ex currency, increased slightly. Our ongoing business earnings grew to a record $3.66 a share. It is gained through a combination of acquisition synergies, unit volume growth and ongoing cost productivities. And we improved our free cash flow for the year.
Turning to Slide 6. We have an update on the external environment and some of the challenges that we're facing and offsetting. We have seen what we believe is a temporary softness in industry demand in the U.S., particularly you saw earlier in the quarter in July and August, with some rebound in September. We believe this is due to consumer confidence we gained primarily due to the focus around the U.S. elections.
In addition, the promotional environment in the U.S. has been -- has elevated during the quarter, especially in the washing machine category. There, certain import competitors continue to unlawfully dump product, and we're responding with continued investment in our strong brands, launching new, innovative products, as well as our fair trade actions. 
For the year, in Europe, our integration is on track and we're delivering cost synergies in line with our plans. And our previously discussed margin recovery actions in Europe are progressing, and we do expect to see the positive impact of these actions over the next couple of quarters, somewhat later than we originally thought because we continue to see currency and demand volatility, particularly in the U.K. market.
Overall, we expect to deliver a record performance this year with approximately 15% ongoing EPS growth, over 0.5 point of ongoing EBIT margin improvement and good improvement in free cash flow. 
On Slide 7, we've updated our 2016 guidance to reflect these changes. We now expect to deliver ongoing earnings of $14 to $14.25 a share and to generate approximately $700 million in free cash flow.
Turning to Slide 8. We show our balanced capital allocation approach, which has not changed. We continue to appropriately fund our business and expect to invest between $650 million and $700 million in capital this year. As I mentioned, we did repurchase $100 million in share repurchases during the third quarter, and we do intend to continue repurchasing stock in the fourth quarter. So in total, we remain committed to delivering our long-term value creation objectives through our operational execution and a balanced approach to capital allocation.
So with that, I'm going to turn it over to Marc Bitzer to review our global operations."

Turning to Slide 10, we will review our performance in North America. Net sales increased 2% versus prior year and grew 3% excluding currency, and we expanded our ongoing operating margins to a third quarter recor",1306,"Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 10, we will review our performance in North America. Net sales increased 2% versus prior year and grew 3% excluding currency, and we expanded our ongoing operating margins to a third quarter record of 12.1%. Our operating margins were driven by strong ongoing cost productivity programs and unit volume growth, which more than offset approximately $25 million in unfavorable currency impact in Canada and Mexico. 
During the quarter, we gained over 1 point of market share versus the prior year as consumer demand for our brands and products have continued to be strong. As demonstrated by our performance, we remain focused on driving both revenue growth and margin expansion.
Turning to Slide 11. I will discuss some external factors affecting our North America region. As Jeff outlined earlier, we have seen a temporary slowdown in U.S. appliance industry demand since our last call. We are confident that the slip in consumer discretionary purchases is temporary as consumer confidence has been impacted by the upcoming U.S. elections. We increasingly see solid consumer demand for our strong brands and new products and expect to continue to generate profitable market share gains. However, we have seen an increase in promotional activity in the U.S., especially on washers. This corresponds with significant inventory stockpiling by certain competitors at the end of the second quarter, who we believe are continuing to unlawfully dump products. This higher promotional intensity had a significant negative impact on our washer margins in the third quarter. We continue to pursue our fair trade case for washers manufacturer in China and anticipate a final ruling in early 2017.
Additionally, we have recently announced cost base price increases, primarily in washers, to allow us to recover the cost of our investments in new and compelling products. We expect that these actions, along with a focus on value-creating promotions and strong productivity programs, will offset negative margin impacts from continued dumping by certain competitors.
We fully expect to deliver strong results in the fourth quarter and remain on track to achieve our long-term goal. 
Turning to Slide 12, we'll discuss key drivers of the U.S. appliance industry. The fundamental underpinning U.S. appliance demand are healthy. During recent years, we have seen steady growth in key macro indicators, including housing starts in both new and existing home sales, as well as improvements to other relevant indicators such as consumer sentiment and unemployment. While some of the individual monthly data is volatile, the trends overwhelmingly demonstrate strong demand for housing, increasing levels of employment, real wage growth and long-term improvement in consumer sentiment. We've seen 15 consecutive quarters of appliance industry growth in the U.S., and all of these underlying macro trends support continued growth to U.S. appliance industry in the coming years.
As such, we believe that the current industry slowdown is a temporary shift, consistent with what we're seeing in the retail environment for household goods and we remain confident that the multiyear cycle of U.S. demand growth will continue in 2017 and beyond. 
Turning to Slide 13. We outline our 2016 operational expectations for the North America region.  We now expect the industry to grow 3% to 4% for the full year. Through the end of the third quarter, the industry's up a little over 3.5%. We continue to expect to grow at or above industry rates with targeted investment in our strong brands and new products, as we have done consistently throughout the year. We continue to execute strong cost productivity programs and we remain focused on achieving growth in our adjacent businesses. We now expect to deliver 11.5% to 12% margin in 2016, an increase over the prior year.
Beginning on Slide 14, we will review our third quarter results for our Europe, Middle East and Africa regions. Sales were $1.3 billion, down 9% versus the prior year. Excluding the impact of currency, sales were down 6% as we saw demand softness in certain key countries, particularly in the U.K.
Ongoing operating margins were 3.7%. Our margins were negatively affected by approximately $40 million in unfavorable impact in our U.K. business from a devaluing British pound and softening demand environment.
Turning to Slide 15, we'll provide an update to our previously deployed actions in Europe. 
The integration of Indesit continue to be on track, and we fully expect to deliver planned cost synergies in the fourth quarter and into 2017. Consistent with what we've seen since the Brexit decision, currency continues to be a headwind and demand in the U.K. remains soft, causing our previously announced cost base price increase to be implemented slower than anticipated. Our platform integration and manufacturing transitions remain on track. However, we reduced manufacturing volumes in response to this lower demand, most of which occurred in the third quarter, and we now expect roughly 0.5 point margin impact for the full year. As a result, our margin expansion in Europe is slightly delayed. 
In summary, we believe we have the right actions in place to manage through volatility and deliver our long-term goals.
On Slide 16, our 2016 priorities for the European, Middle East and Africa region remain largely unchanged. There's a continued focus on integration activities, ongoing cost productivity and growth from adjacent businesses. Similar to the third quarter, we plan to manage inventory levels as we continue product and brand transitions in the fourth quarter.
Our industry guidance remains flat to up 2% for the full year. We now expect to deliver 4.5% to 5% operating margin for the full year and remain confident in our long-term margin guidance of 8%.
I will now discuss our Latin America results on Slide 17.
Sales for the quarter were $800 million, an increase of 7%. Excluding the impact of currencies, sales increased 2%. Our third quarter operating profit totaled $45 million, and margin increased 150 basis points versus the prior year. Despite operating in a challenging demand environment, we expanded margins and delivered strong revenue growth from continued investments in our brands and products. We gained significant market share while also improving price mix in Brazil, and we continue to benefit from substantial fixed cost reduction actions, which we began implementing last year.
On Slide 18, our priorities in Latin America have not changed. We remain well-prepared to manage through volatility, as we have done consistently over the past several quarters through cost productivity, significant market share gains and positive price mix. For a couple quarters now, we've been monitoring the difference between sell-in and sell-out volumes in the Brazilian market, at which time, because we've seen our trade customers build some inventory, we are expecting an inventory correction in the fourth quarter. And as a result, we now expect the Brazil industry to be down 10% to 12% for the full year. We now expect to deliver 6.5% to 7% operating margins for the full year.
Now we turn to our third quarter results for the Asia region, which are shown on Slide 19. 
Net sales were $338 million versus $346 million in the prior year period. Excluding the impact of currency, sales increased 2%. Our ongoing operating profit was $17 million compared to $27 million in the prior year period. Ongoing operating margins were 4.9% as continued demand softness and price/mix challenges in China more than offset continued record performance in India. 
Turning to Slide 20. You will see our 2016 priorities for Asia. We are focused on marketplace investments on our core product offerings, driving strong mix. The brand transition from Sanyo to Whirpool is progressing, and we are now focused on increasing awareness of our Whirlpool brand. As a result of these actions we're confident in our ability to deliver our long-term margin goals in the Asia region. 
Now I'd like to turn it over to Jim Peters."

As Jeff mentioned, we delivered another quarter of record results despite operating in a challenging external environment. 
Turning to our third quarter results on Slide 22. Net sales were $5.2 billion. We achieved record ongoing earnings of $3.66 per share, primarily driven by strong delivery of acquisition synergies, unit volume growth and ongoing cost productivity program. Currency had a top line impact of approximately $40 million and reduced EBIT margins by approximately 1 point. 
Some currencies have strengthened against the U.S. dollar, most notably in Canada and Brazil. However, we are hedged at rates more reflective of last year's environment, and as such, we are not seeing the full benefit of those currencies strengthening in our operating margin. Our third quarter tax rate was driven by the timing of tax settlements and planning activities, and we now expect a 19% tax rate for the full year. Overall, we are pleased with our results through the first 3 quarters of 2016 and are on track to deliver strong full year results.
On Slide 23, we provide an update on the progress of our restructuring and acquisition integration activities. Through the third quarter, we have incurred restructuring expenses of $116 million and delivered $165 million in benefits. We continue to expect $200 million in expense and $200 million in benefits for the full year, which is ahead of plan. I will now discuss our expectations for full year EBIT margin expansion on Slide 24.
As Marc discussed in the regional reviews, we have seen elevated promotional activity in the U.S. since our last call, as well as delayed benefits of our previously announced cost base price increases in the U.K. Both had a negative impact on our price/mix, which we now expect to be flat to slightly negative for the year. We are also slightly reducing our ongoing cost productivity due to the impact of softer global demand on production levels.  As a result of these changes, we now expect to deliver approximately 7.5% EBIT margin for the full year, more than 0.5 point expansion over the prior year. 
On Slide 25, we share some details of our free cash flow results and capital allocation actions through the third quarter. Our free cash flow improved versus prior year, primarily due to improved earnings. We expect full year free cash flow of $700 million, which is inclusive of $150 million of restructuring cash outlays and $155 million associated with legacy product warranty actions in EMEA. Consistent with our strategy, we continue to execute a balanced approach to capital allocation by funding the capital needs of our business and returning cash to our shareholders.
We have executed $425 million in share repurchases year-to-date, and we plan to buy back additional shares in the fourth quarter, consistent with our prior statement.
Turning to Slide 26. We are adjusting our full year guidance, as discussed earlier. We are confident in our operational plans and expect to deliver up to 15% growth in ongoing earnings per share and approximately $700 million in free cash flow in 2016.
Now I'd like to turn it back over to Jeff."

We have deployed strong actions to offset the operating challenges we faced in the third quarter. We do expect to deliver another record year, including about a 15% EPS growth and strong free cash flow. 
On Slide 29, you'll see our long-term value creation strategy, which remains unchanged. We are committed to being the best global brand and consumer products company in the world. 
We believe our ability to generate earnings growth and free cash flow is very strong. We have the leading market positions in 3 of the 4 regions out of the world, a very strong platform for our continued growth. And our brands are very well-established and reach over 90% of the clients/consumers globally. So we are confident that our strategy will continue to deliver significant value. 
Finally, on Slide 30, I want to make a few comments on our 2016 operating performance and over a longer period of time. Over the last 5 years, we have delivered record results, including -- counting 2016, with over 20% annualized earnings EPS growth despite what I would describe a challenging external environment. And in the last 2 years, we've absorbed over $6 per share impact from global currencies weakening against the U.S. dollar in a very unprecedented manner. Additionally, we've seen significant demand declines in our major emerging markets, which are Brazil, Russia and China. This has had a $2 impact per share over the last 2 years. But within this environment, we were able to grow our earnings by 10% in 2015, and we expect to grow them additionally by 15% this year. And all while driving strong free cash flow. We've used that cash to reinvest in our business, increase our dividend, pay down debt and buy back nearly $700 million in stock. 
Today, managing through economic volatility is the new normal, and it's part of our everyday operating management system. We believe that we continue to demonstrate our ability to navigate through those challenges, and because of that, we remain confident in our ability to effectively manage our business in this type of environment. 
So in total, we believe we have significant opportunities to continue creating shareholder value going forward. 
So with that, I'm going to end our formal remarks, and we'd like to open it up for questions."

To some extent, we were not completely surprised because we saw certain competitors stockpiling a lot of inventory at the end of Q2, and I think we made a remark on that during the last earnings call. The negative impact on us is kind of twofold, if you want to say. One, because obviously, we cannot and will not participate in certain value-destructing promotions. So of course, you lose the volume and, thus, the leverage in your overall production. Two, is a mix element, because if you basically have the high-end of your range by a certain competitor pulled down very much, you lose a lot of mix. To be more specific, take a typical front load washer, we have a line structure anywhere from $399 or $499 to $999 -- not $399, $499 to $999. If certain competitors bring that down to $599 or even below, it's hard to build a line structure, and therefore, you lose mix. So we had a twofold negative impact on our business. What we're going to do about it, apart from continue to invest in new product and innovation, which we are launching in the market, is two, yes, we have announced certain price increases, because we felt that certain price levels just do not reflect the cost investment we put behind products. These price effects or cost base price increases are in effect for January 1. Thirdly, as Jeff also indicated, we are continuing to pursue the antidumping lawsuits. We remain confident in our ability to win on this one So I think the combination of all these 3 elements make us believe that we can fully restore our margins in the washer business."

As we indicated in earlier calls, our U.K. business at the time of the acquisition was roughly about $1 billion. So it's a very significant business where we have, historically, a strong market position and a strong above average operating margin. If you just look at the pure currency now, Q3 over Q3 last year, you basically have roughly 22% decline. So it's been massive. To Jim's earlier point, it has been a little bit moderated because of some hedging programs, but it's still massive. You also need to keep in mind that about 85% to -- roughly 85% of our products which we sell in the U.K. are imported or  now what's produced on a euro base. So you basically have a full year cost base impact on this one. So it's significant. The $40 million impact, which I referred to in the script, is related to, one, obviously, the margin loss because of a higher cost base; and two, we implemented a price increase in September -- or we started to implement it, and yes, we saw significant volume reduction in the month of September. The combination of these 2 things were roughly $40 million. So it's -- by definition, it's a massive impact on our operating results in Europe in Q3. To your question about the price increases and the progress, we had a small price increase in July, where we frankly had a hard time getting full traction. We had another one in September where we're seeing the traction on the invoices, but yes, we still have a drag on the volume. And we expect that drag to also be there for Q4 even though at a slightly lower level."

So to your first question about the consumer demand, to some extent, it's of course, a little bit speculative of that answer. But it's -- we do see consumer -- just span of attention is right now shifting towards other topics and discretionary demand, and ultimately, yes, we see what we think is a temporary softness of consumer confidence. As you know, in our products in particular, the discretionary demand is largely driven by consumer confidence. Will that improve and recover after November 8? Probably not immediately, not the next day. But over time, we expect it to do so. If you also look at the fundamentals, and that was what we included in the presentation, in the script, the fundamentals of the housing market are 100% intact.

Having said that, that also means in refrigeration, dishwashing and cooking, we had almost more than 1 share point of growth. [indiscernible] actually very satisfying. Then you have the other component which is the branded versus non-branded part of our sales. As you can imagine, the not own-brand piece, which is largely for our  big customer, that has been coming down year-over-year, but the branded piece has seen very strong growth in the entire Q3."

In December, it's expected the Department of Commerce will establish the final tariffs. And you may remember, the preliminary tariffs were over 50% for one competitor and over 100% for another one. So they're substantial. And then -- so that will happen in December. And then the ITC will make the final ruling on -- that dumping has caused injury to the washer business in the U.S., and we expect that ruling in January. So at that point in time, and we do see assume we're going to be successful here, then those competitors will have to pay really high tariffs or they'll have to do something else. And at the same time -- and again, I don't want to over emphasize this, but as Marc said, I mean,  we had one competitor in the second quarter ship in months and months of supply in advance of trying to -- as the DOC ruled, beat the cash deposits. And unloading that inventory in the third, and perhaps, part of the fourth quarter, has been a real strain on the operating margins and has caused a lot of injury to the washer business. So basically, again I can't speak what competitors are going to do. I know we're going to run our business in an economical way. We're going to earn our market share through great products, and we're fully -- but we fully expect to make positive margins on them as well."

So you have a lot of -- and mortgages and affordability is still very positive. So you have a lot of the positive trends there. We always argued for the last 3 years, and I would still argue, the entire, call it, housing boom has been a little bit constrained by the supply side. There has not been enough developed lots. When we had issues about getting enough construction workers, so there's been a severe supply constraint, which also explains a little bit why the house prices came up so quickly. So there was a constraint, which we slowly see easing, but not a rapid pace. So if you want to find any negative which could impact that, you can put up theories then. Of course, if the Fed rates would come up too fast, too quickly, that could have an impact. I don't think that's likely, but I don't know. But outside of this one, you would have to find any macro economic shocks outside the housing industry and appliance industry which could impact consumer in such confidence."

So first of all, let's differentiate overall industry trends from our own demand, which we'll see. I would say, overall, the European market -- and we don't yet have a final sell-in data for Europe -- I would expect them to be closer to 2%. We earlier indicated 0% to 2% for the full year. And in Q3, I would expect it right now somewhere between 1.5% and 2%. But it's too early because we don't have the final data. Also on a full year basis, I would say the entire European market still in 0% to 2%, probably ending close to over 2%. So the fundamentals of demand in Europe are not that horrible. It's the currency which impacts a lot. If you kind of peel back the onion, of course, there's a lot of moving pieces. I think for us, the most promising sign going forward, we start seeing recovery in Russia and Ukraine. That's an early sign. But you know we're -- in this acquisition, we're very exposed to both U.K. and Russia. And right now, both markets are very soft from currency and demand. But we see Russia slowly coming back. And now, it's too early to yet call it a recovery, but I would say the early signs have been promising. Now specific to our demand, for us, U.K. markets did better as a market than we saw in our demand. And that is directly related to us coming out of a price increase in September, which the rest of the industry did not fully follow and that impacted our demand. That's the particular impact. Outside of the U.K., I would say by and large, our demand is solid. Probably the only other exception will be Middle East and Africa, which is still impacted by a lot of uncertainty in demand and by the entire space."

Welcome to the Whirlpool Corporation Third Quarter 2016 Conference Call. Joining me today are Jeff Fettig, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Marc Bitzer, our President and Chief Operating Officer; and Jim Peters, our Chief Financial Officer. Our remarks today track with the presentation available on the Investors section of our website at whirlpoolcorp.com.
Before we begin, let me remind you that as we conduct this call, we will be making forward-looking statements to assist you in understanding Whirlpool Corporation's future expectations. Our actual results could differ materially from these statements due to many factors discussed on our latest 10-K and our other periodic reports, as well as on Slide 1 of the presentation.
Turning to Slide 2. We want to remind you that today's presentation includes non-GAAP measures. We believe these measures are important indicators of our operations and they exclude items that may not be indicative of or are unrelated to results from our ongoing business operations. We also think the adjusted measures will provide you with a better baseline for analyzing trends in our ongoing business operations. Listeners are directed to the supplemental information package posted on our Investor Relations section of our website for the reconciliation of non-GAAP items to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.

As you saw in our press release this morning, our operational execution offset some significant external challenges that we saw in the quarter. But we did deliver record results for the third quarter. 
During the quarter, currency continued to be volatile and negative and we saw some softness in the appliance demand, most prominently in the U.K. and the U.S. Despite this volatility, we are able to deliver record results, and year-to-date, our earnings have increased by 18%. In North America and Latin America, we expanded margins while gaining market share, which was done by leveraging our leading brands, launching innovative new products and delivering strong ongoing cost productivity. And finally, consistent with our balanced capital allocation approach, we repurchased $100 million of our common stock during the quarter. Overall, the fundamentals of our business remains strong, and we continue to adapt to our operating plans in order to deliver strong results.
I'll now turn to Slide 5, where you'll see our third quarter results. Our revenues, ex currency, increased slightly. Our ongoing business earnings grew to a record $3.66 a share. And this came through a combination of acquisition synergies, unit volume growth and ongoing cost productivities. And we improved our free cash flow for the year.
Turning to Slide 6. We have an update on the external environment and some of the challenges that we're facing and offsetting. We have seen what we believe is a temporary softness in industry demand in the U.S., particularly you saw earlier in the quarter in July and August, with some rebound in September. We believe this is due to consumer confidence we gained primarily due to the focus around the U.S. elections.
In addition, the promotional environment in the U.S. has been -- has elevated during the quarter, especially in the washing machine category. There, certain import competitors continue to unlawfully dump product, and we're responding with continued investment in our strong brands, launching new, innovative products, as well as our fair trade actions. 
For the year, in Europe, our integration is on track and we're delivering cost synergies in line with our plans. And our previously discussed margin recovery actions in Europe are progressing, and we do expect to see the positive impact of these actions over the next couple of quarters, somewhat later than we originally thought because we continue to see currency and demand volatility, particularly in the U.K. market. Overall, we expect to deliver a record performance this year with approximately 15% ongoing EPS growth, over 0.5 point of ongoing EBIT margin improvement and good improvement in free cash flow. 
On Slide 7, we've updated our 2016 guidance to reflect these changes. We now expect to deliver ongoing earnings of $14 to $14.25 a share and to generate approximately $700 million in free cash flow.
Turning to Slide 8. We show our balanced capital allocation approach, which has not changed. We continue to appropriately fund our business and expect to invest between $650 million and $700 million in capital this year. As I mentioned, we did repurchase $100 million in share repurchases during the third quarter, and we do intend to continue repurchasing stock in the fourth quarter. So in total, we remain committed to delivering our long-term value creation objectives through our operational execution and a balanced approach to capital allocation.
So with that, I'm going to turn it over to Marc Bitzer to review our global operations."

Turning to Slide 10, we will review our performance in North America. Net sales increased 2% versus prior year and grew 3% excluding currency, and we expanded our ongoing operating margins to a third quarter recor",1306,"Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 10, we will review our performance in North America. Net sales increased 2% versus prior year and grew 3% excluding currency, and we expanded our ongoing operating margins to a third quarter record of 12.1%. Our operating margins were driven by strong ongoing cost productivity programs and unit volume growth, which more than offset approximately $25 million in unfavorable currency impact in Canada and Mexico. During the quarter, we gained over 1 point of market share versus the prior year as consumer demand for our brands and products have continued to be strong. As demonstrated by our performance, we remain focused on driving both revenue growth and margin expansion.
Turning to Slide 11. I will discuss some external factors affecting our North America region. As Jeff outlined earlier, we have seen a temporary slowdown in U.S. appliance industry demand since our last call. We are confident that the slip in consumer discretionary purchases is temporary as consumer confidence has been impacted by the upcoming U.S. elections. We increasingly see solid consumer demand for our strong brands and new products and expect to continue to generate profitable market share gains. However, we have seen an increase in promotional activity in the U.S., especially on washers. This corresponds with significant inventory stockpiling by certain competitors at the end of the second quarter, who we believe are continuing to unlawfully dump products. This higher promotional intensity had a significant negative impact on our washer margins in the third quarter. We continue to pursue our fair trade case for washers manufactured in China and anticipate a final ruling in early 2017.
Additionally, we have recently announced cost base price increases, primarily in washers, to allow us to recover the cost of our investment in new and compelling products. We expect that these actions, along with a focus on value-creating promotions and strong productivity programs, will offset negative margin impacts from continued dumping by certain competitors. We fully expect to deliver strong results in the fourth quarter and remain on track to achieve our long-term goal. 
Turning to Slide 12, we'll discuss key drivers of the U.S. appliance industry. The fundamental underpinning U.S. appliance demand are healthy. During recent years, we have seen steady growth in key macro indicators, including housing starts in both new and existing home sales, as well as improvements to other relevant indicators such as consumer sentiment and unemployment. While some of the individual monthly data is volatile, the trends overwhelmingly demonstrate strong demand for housing, increasing levels of employment, real wage growth and long-term improvement in consumer sentiment. We've seen 15 consecutive quarters of appliance industry growth in the U.S., and all of these underlying macro trends support continued growth to U.S. appliance industry in the coming years. As such, we believe that the current industry slowdown is a temporary shift, consistent with what we're seeing in the retail environment for household goods and we remain confident that the multiyear cycle of U.S. demand growth will continue in 2017 and beyond. 
Turning to Slide 13. We outline our 2016 operational expectations for the North America region.  We now expect the industry to grow 3% to 4% for the full year. Through the end of the third quarter, the industry's up a little over 3.5%. We continue to expect to grow at or above industry rates with targeted investment in our strong brands and new products, as we have done consistently throughout the year. We continue to execute strong cost productivity programs and we remain focused on achieving growth in our adjacent businesses. We now expect to deliver 11.5% to 12% margin in 2016, an increase over the prior year.
Beginning on Slide 14, we will review our third quarter results for our Europe, Middle East and Africa regions. Sales were $1.3 billion, down 9% versus the prior year. Excluding the impact of currency, sales were down 6% as we saw demand softness in certain key countries, particularly in the U.K. Ongoing operating margins were 3.7%. Our margins were negatively affected by approximately $40 million in unfavorable impact in our U.K. business from a devaluing British pound and softening demand environment.
Turning to Slide 15, we'll provide an update to our previously deployed actions in Europe. The integration of Indesit continues to be on track, and we fully expect to deliver planned cost synergies in the fourth quarter and into 2017. Consistent with what we've seen since the Brexit decision, currency continues to be a headwind and demand in the U.K. remains soft, causing our previously announced cost base price increase to be implemented slower than anticipated. Our platform integration and manufacturing transitions remain on track. However, we reduced manufacturing volumes in response to this lower demand, most of which occurred in the third quarter, and we now expect roughly 0.5 point margin impact for the full year. As a result, our margin expansion in Europe is slightly delayed.  In summary, we believe we have the right actions in place to manage through volatility and deliver our long-term goals.
On Slide 16, our 2016 priorities for the European, Middle East and Africa region remain largely unchanged. There's a continued focus on integration activities, ongoing cost productivity and growth from adjacent businesses. Similar to the third quarter, we plan to manage inventory levels as we continue product and brand transitions in the fourth quarter. Our industry guidance remains flat to up 2% for the full year. We now expect to deliver 4.5% to 5% operating margin for the full year and remain confident in our long-term margin guidance of 8%.
I will now discuss our Latin America results on Slide 17. Sales for the quarter were $800 million, an increase of 7%. Excluding the impact of currency, sales increased 2%. Our third quarter operating profit totaled $45 million, and margin increased 150 basis points versus the prior year. Despite operating in a challenging demand environment, we expanded margins and delivered strong revenue growth through continued investments in our brands and products. We gained significant market share while also improving price mix in Brazil, and we continue to benefit from substantial fixed cost reduction actions, which we began implementing last year.
On Slide 18, our priorities in Latin America have not changed. We remain well-prepared to manage through volatility, as we have done consistently over the past several quarters through cost productivity, significant market share gains and positive price mix. For a couple quarters now, we've been monitoring the difference between sell-in and sell-out volumes in the Brazilian market, at which time, because we've seen our trade customers build some inventory, we are expecting an inventory correction in the fourth quarter. And as a result, we now expect the Brazil industry to be down 10% to 12% for the full year. We now expect to deliver 6.5% to 7% operating margins for the full year.
Now we turn to our third quarter results for the Asia region, which are shown on Slide 19.  Net sales were $338 million versus $346 million in the prior year period. Excluding the impact of currency, sales increased 2%. Our ongoing operating profit was $17 million compared to $27 million in the prior year period. Ongoing operating margins were 4.9% as continued demand softness and price/mix challenges in China more than offset continued record performance in India. 
Turning to Slide 20. You will see our 2016 priorities for Asia. We are focused on marketplace investments on our core product offerings, driving strong mix. The brand transition from Sanyo to Whirpool is progressing, and we are now focused on increasing awareness of our Whirlpool brand. As a result of these actions we're confident in our ability to deliver our long-term margin goals in the Asia region. 
Now I'd like to turn it over to Jim Peters."

As Jeff mentioned, we delivered another quarter of record results despite operating in a challenging external environment. 
Turning to our third quarter results on Slide 22. Net sales were $5.2 billion. We achieved record ongoing earnings of $3.66 per share, primarily driven by strong delivery of acquisition synergies, unit volume growth and ongoing cost productivity programs. Currency had a top line impact of approximately $40 million and reduced EBIT margins by approximately 1 point. 
Some currencies have strengthened against the U.S. dollar, most notably in Canada and Brazil. However, we are hedged at rates more reflective of last year's environment, and as such, we are not seeing the full benefit of those currencies strengthening in our operating margin. Our third quarter tax rate was driven by the timing of tax settlements and planning activity, and we now expect a 19% tax rate for the full year. Overall, we are pleased with our results through the first 3 quarters of 2016 and are on track to deliver strong full year results.
On Slide 23, we provide an update on the progress of our restructuring and acquisition integration activities. Through the third quarter, we have incurred restructuring expenses of $116 million and delivered $165 million in benefits. We continue to expect $200 million in expense and $200 million in benefits for the full year, which is ahead of plan. 
I will now discuss our expectations for full year EBIT margin expansion on Slide 24. As Marc discussed in the regional reviews, we have seen elevated promotional activity in the U.S. since our last call, as well as delayed benefits of our previously announced cost base price increases in the U.K. Both had a negative impact on our price/mix, which we now expect to be flat to slightly negative for the year. We are also slightly reducing our ongoing cost productivity due to the impact of softer global demand on production levels.  As a result of these changes, we now expect to deliver approximately 7.5% EBIT margin for the full year, more than 0.5 point expansion over the prior year. 
On Slide 25, we share some details of our free cash flow results and capital allocation actions through the third quarter. Our free cash flow improved versus prior year, primarily due to improved earnings. We expect full year free cash flow of $700 million, which is inclusive of $150 million of restructuring cash outlays and $155 million associated with legacy product warranty actions in EMEA. Consistent with our strategy, we continue to execute a balanced approach to capital allocation by funding the capital needs of our business and returning cash to our shareholders. We have executed $425 million in share repurchases year-to-date, and we plan to buy back additional shares in the fourth quarter, consistent with our prior statement.
Turning to Slide 26. We are adjusting our full year guidance, as discussed earlier. We are confident in our operational plans and expect to deliver up to 15% growth in ongoing earnings per share and approximately $700 million in free cash flow in 2016.
Now I'd like to turn it back over to Jeff."

We have deployed strong actions to offset the operating challenges we faced in the third quarter. We do expect to deliver another record year, including about a 15% EPS growth and strong free cash flow. 
On Slide 29, you'll see our long-term value creation strategy, which remains unchanged. We are committed to being the best global branded consumer products company in the world. We believe our ability to generate earnings growth and free cash flow is very strong. We have the leading market positions in 3 of the 4 regions out of the world, a very strong platform for our continued growth. And our brands are very well-established and reach over 90% of appliance consumers globally. So we are confident that our strategy will continue to deliver significant value. 
Finally, on Slide 30, I want to make a few comments on our 2016 operating performance and over a longer period of time. Over the last 5 years, we have delivered record results, including -- counting 2016, with over 20% annualized earnings EPS growth despite what I would describe a challenging external environment. And in the last 2 years, we've absorbed over $6 per share impact from global currencies weakening against the U.S. dollar in a very unprecedented manner. Additionally, we've seen significant demand declines in our major emerging markets, which are Brazil, Russia and China. This has had a $2 impact per share over the last 2 years. But within this environment, we were able to grow our earnings by 10% in 2015, and we expect to grow them additionally by 15% this year. And all while driving strong free cash flow. We've used that cash to reinvest in our business, increase our dividend, pay down debt and buy back nearly $700 million in stock. 
Today, managing through economic volatility is the new normal, and it's part of our everyday operating management system. We believe that we continue to demonstrate our ability to navigate through those challenges, and because of that, we remain confident in our ability to effectively manage our business in this type of environment. So in total, we believe we have significant opportunities to continue creating shareholder value going forward. 
So with that, I'm going to end our formal remarks, and we'd like to open it up for questions."

First of all, let me first talk about what happened in Q3 in washers and what we are going to do about it going forward. First of all, in Q3, as we indicated in our remarks, we saw an increased promotional intensity, in particular, in washers. I would say all the other categories had promotional intensity, but nothing earth-shattering or surprising to our -- from our perspective. In washers, it was more intense. To some extent, we were not completely surprised because we saw certain competitors stockpiling a lot of inventory at the end of Q2, and I think we made a remark on that during our last earnings call. The negative impact on us is kind of twofold, if you want to say. One, because obviously, we cannot and will not participate in certain value-destructing promotions. So of course, you lose the volume and, thus, the leverage in your overall production. Two, is a mix element, because if you basically have the high end of your range by a certain competitor pulled down very much, you lose a lot of mix. To be more specific, take a typical front load washer, we have a line structure anywhere from $399 or $499 to $999 -- not $399, $499 to $999. If certain competitors bring that down to $599 or even below, it's hard to build a line structure, and therefore, you lose mix. So we had a twofold negative impact on our business. What we're going to do about it, apart from continue to invest in new product and innovation, which we are launching in the market, is two, yes, we have announced certain price increases, because we felt that certain price levels just do not reflect the cost investment which we put behind the products. These price effects or cost base price increases are in effect for January 1. Thirdly, as Jeff also indicated, we are continuing to pursue the antidumping lawsuits. And we remain confident in our ability to win on this one. So I think the combination of all these 3 elements make us believe that we can fully restore our margins in the washer business."

As we indicated in earlier calls, our U.K. business at the time of the acquisition was roughly about $1 billion. So it's a very significant business where we have, historically, a strong market position and a strong above average operating margin. If you just look at the pure currency now, Q3 over Q3 last year, you basically have roughly 22% decline. So it's been massive. To Jim's earlier point, it has been a little bit moderated because of some hedging programs, but it's still massive. You also need to keep in mind that about 85% to -- roughly 85% of the products which we sell in the U.K. are imported or now what's produced on a euro base. So you basically have a full year cost base impact on this one. So it's significant. The $40 million impact, which I referred to in the script, is related to, one, obviously, the margin loss because of a higher cost base; and two, we implemented a price increase in September -- or we started to implement it, and yes, we saw significant volume reduction in the month of September. The combination of these 2 things were roughly $40 million. So it's -- by definition, it's a massive impact on our operating results in Europe in Q3. To your question about the price increases and the progress, we had a small price increase in July, where we frankly had a hard time getting full traction. We had another one in September where we're seeing the traction on the invoices, but yes, we still have a drag on the volume. And we expect that drag to also be there for Q4 even though at a slightly lower level."

What we're dealing with right now, as you saw, is we're dealing with some fairly substantial external shocks that we have taken actions for, and some things, like as Marc mentioned, the demand in the U.S., we think, will right itself in the coming months. The U.K. is going to take longer, and we got to see the effect of this elevated promotional scheme in the U.S. But so having said all that, I would say that the goals, we feel good about.

So to your first question about the consumer demand, to some extent, it's of course, a little bit speculative of that answer. But it's -- we do see consumer -- just span of attention is right now shifting towards other topics and discretionary demand, and ultimately, yes, we see what we think is a temporary softness of consumer confidence. As you know, in our products in particular, the discretionary demand is largely driven by consumer confidence. Will that improve and recover after November 8? Probably not immediately, not the next day, but over time, we expect to do so. If you also look at the fundamentals, and that was what we included in the presentation, in the script, the fundamentals of the housing market are 100% intact.

Having said that, if you want to kind of pinpoint 2 elements which explain the slight ASV decline, average sales value decline, is, one, is what we related to earlier, is the promotion intensity in washers; and two, yes, we had higher KitchenAid small domestic appliance growth, quite a bit above our average growth in the region, which negatively impacts the average sales value. But knowing that it's a very strong margin product, it helps our profitability."

First of all, if you split by product, our washer market share has not been there. Actually, year-over-year, it's been disappointing. Having said that, that also means in refrigeration, dishwashing and cooking, we had almost more than 1 share point of growth. So that was actually very satisfying. Then you have the other component which is the branded versus non-branded part of our sales. As you can imagine, the not own-brand piece, which is largely for big customer, that has been coming down year-over-year, but the branded piece has seen very strong growth in the entire Q3."

In December, it's expected the Department of Commerce will establish the final tariffs. And you may remember, the preliminary tariffs were over 50% for one competitor and over 100% for another one. So they're substantial. And then -- so that will happen in December. And then the ITC will make the final ruling on -- that dumping has caused injury to the washer business in the U.S., and we expect that ruling in January. So at that point in time, and we do see assume we're going to be successful here, then those competitors will either have to pay really high tariffs or they'll have to do something else. And at the same time -- and again, I don't want to overemphasize this, but as Marc said, I mean,  we had one competitor in the second quarter ship in months and months of supply in advance of trying to -- as the DOC ruled, beat the cash deposits. And unloading that inventory in the third, and perhaps, part of the fourth quarter, has been a real strain on the operating margins and has caused a lot of injury to the washer business. So basically, again I can't speak what competitors are going to do. I know we're going to run our business in an economical way. We're going to earn our market share through great products, and we're fully -- but we fully expect to make positive margins on them as well."

So you have a lot of -- and mortgages and affordability is still very positive. So you have a lot of positive demand trends there. We always argued for the last 3 years, and I would still argue, the entire, call it, housing boom has been a little bit constrained by the supply side. There has not been enough developed lots. When we had issues about getting enough construction workers, so there's been a severe supply constraint, which also explains a little bit why the house prices came up so quickly. So that was a constraint, which we slowly see easing, but not a rapid pace. So if you want to find any negative which could impact that, you can put up theories then. Of course, if the Fed rates would come up too fast, too quickly, that could have an impact. I don't think that's likely, but I don't know. But outside of this one, you would have to find any macroeconomic shocks outside the housing industry and appliance industry which could impact consumer in such confidence."

I would say, overall, the European market, and we don't yet have a final sell-in data for Europe, I would expect them to be closer to 2%. We earlier indicated 0% to 2% for the full year. And in Q3, I would expect it right now somewhere between 1.5% and 2%. But it's too early because we don't have the final data. Also on a full year basis, I would say the entire European market still in 0% to 2%, probably ending close to the 2%. So the fundamentals of demand in Europe are not that horrible. It's the currency which impacts a lot. If you kind of peel back the onion, of course, there's a lot of moving pieces. I think for us, the most promising sign going forward, we start seeing recovery in Russia and Ukraine. That's an early sign. But you know we're -- in this acquisition, we're very exposed to both U.K. and Russia. And right now, both markets are very soft from currency and demand. But we see Russia slowly coming back. And now, it's too early to yet call it a recovery, but I would say the early signs have been promising. Now specific to our demand, for us, U.K. markets did better as a market than we saw in our demand. That is directly related to us coming out of a price increase in September, which the rest of the industry did not fully follow and that impacted our demand. That's the particular impact. Outside of the U.K., I would say by and large, our demand is solid. Probably the only other exception will be Middle East and Africa, which is still impacted by a lot of uncertainty in demand and by the entire space."

As you saw in our press release this morning, our operational execution offset some significant external challenges that we saw in the quarter. But we did deliver record results for the third quarter. 
During the quarter, currency continued to be volatile and negative and we saw some softness in the appliance demand, most prominently in the U.K. and the U.S. Despite this volatility, we are able to deliver record results, and year-to-date, our earnings have increased by 18%. In North America and Latin America, we expanded margins while gaining market share, which was done by leveraging our leading brands, launching innovative new products and delivering strong ongoing cost productivity. And finally, consistent with our balanced capital allocation approach, we repurchased $100 million of our common stock during the quarter. Overall, the fundamentals of our business remains strong, and we continue to adapt to our operating plans in order to deliver strong results.
I'll now turn to Slide 5, where you'll see our third quarter results. Our revenues, ex currency, increased slightly. Our ongoing business earnings grew to a record $3.66 a share. And this came through a combination of acquisition synergies, unit volume growth and ongoing cost productivities. And we improved our free cash flow for the year.
Turning to Slide 6. We have an update on the external environment and some of the challenges that we're facing and offsetting. We have seen what we believe is a temporary softness in industry demand in the U.S., particularly you saw earlier in the quarter in July and August, with some rebound in September. We believe this is due to consumer confidence we gained primarily due to the focus around the U.S. elections.
In addition, the promotional environment in the U.S. has been -- has elevated during the quarter, especially in the washing machine category. There, certain import competitors continue to unlawfully dump product, and we're responding with continued investment in our strong brands, launching new, innovative products as well as our fair trade actions. 
For the year, in Europe, our integration is on track and we're delivering cost synergies in line with our plans. And our previously discussed margin recovery actions in Europe are progressing, and we do expect to see the positive impact of these actions over the next couple of quarters, somewhat later than we originally thought because we continue to see currency and demand volatility, particularly in the U.K. market. Overall, we expect to deliver a record performance this year with approximately 15% ongoing EPS growth, over 0.5 point of ongoing EBIT margin improvement and good improvement in free cash flow. 
On Slide 7, we've updated our 2016 guidance to reflect these changes. We now expect to deliver ongoing earnings of $14 to $14.25 a share and to generate approximately $700 million in free cash flow.
Turning to Slide 8. We show our balanced capital allocation approach, which has not changed. We continue to appropriately fund our business and expect to invest between $650 million and $700 million in capital this year. As I mentioned, we did repurchase $100 million in share repurchases during the third quarter, and we do intend to continue repurchasing stock in the fourth quarter. So in total, we remain committed to delivering our long-term value creation objectives through our operational execution and a balanced approach to capital allocation.
So with that, I'm going to turn it over to Marc Bitzer to review our global operations."

Turning to Slide 10, we will review our performance in North America. Net sales increased 2% versus prior year and grew 3% excluding currency, and we expanded our ongoing operating margins to a third quarter recor",1306,"Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 10, we will review our performance in North America. Net sales increased 2% versus prior year and grew 3% excluding currency, and we expanded our ongoing operating margins to a third quarter record of 12.1%. Our operating margins were driven by strong ongoing cost productivity programs and unit volume growth, which more than offset approximately $25 million in unfavorable currency impact in Canada and Mexico. During the quarter, we gained over 1 point of market share versus the prior year as consumer demand for our brands and products have continued to be strong. As demonstrated by our performance, we remain focused on driving both revenue growth and margin expansion.
Turning to Slide 11. I will discuss some external factors affecting our North America region. As Jeff outlined earlier, we have seen a temporary slowdown in U.S. appliance industry demand since our last call. We are confident that the slip in consumer discretionary purchases is temporary as consumer confidence has been impacted by the upcoming U.S. elections. We increasingly see solid consumer demand for our strong brands and new products and expect to continue to generate profitable market share gains. However, we have seen an increase in promotional activity in the U.S., especially on washers. This corresponds with significant inventory stockpiling by certain competitors at the end of the second quarter, who we believe are continuing to unlawfully dump products. This higher promotional intensity had a significant negative impact on our washer margins in the third quarter. We continue to pursue our fair trade case for washers manufactured in China and anticipate a final ruling in early 2017.
Additionally, we have recently announced cost base price increases, primarily in washers, to allow us to recover the cost of our investment in new and compelling products. We expect that these actions, along with a focus on value-creating promotions and strong productivity programs, will offset negative margin impacts from continued dumping by certain competitors. We fully expect to deliver strong results in the fourth quarter and remain on track to achieve our long-term goal. 
Turning to Slide 12, we'll discuss key drivers of the U.S. appliance industry. The fundamental underpinning U.S. appliance demand are healthy. During recent years, we have seen steady growth in key macro indicators, including housing starts in both new and existing home sales as well as improvements to other relevant indicators such as consumer sentiment and unemployment. While some of the individual monthly data is volatile, the trends overwhelmingly demonstrate strong demand for housing, increasing levels of employment, real wage growth and long-term improvement in consumer sentiment. We've seen 15 consecutive quarters of appliance industry growth in the U.S., and all of these underlying macro trends support continued growth to U.S. appliance industry in the coming years. As such, we believe that the current industry slowdown is a temporary shift, consistent with what we're seeing in the retail environment for household goods and we remain confident that the multiyear cycle of U.S. demand growth will continue in 2017 and beyond. 
Turning to Slide 13. We outline our 2016 operational expectations for the North America region. We now expect the industry to grow 3% to 4% for the full year. Through the end of the third quarter, the industry's up a little over 3.5%. We continue to expect to grow at or above industry rates with targeted investment in our strong brands and new products, as we have done consistently throughout the year. We continue to execute strong cost productivity programs and we remain focused on achieving growth in our adjacent businesses. We now expect to deliver 11.5% to 12% margin in 2016, an increase over the prior year.
Beginning on Slide 14, we will review our third quarter results for our Europe, Middle East and Africa regions. Sales were $1.3 billion, down 9% versus the prior year. Excluding the impact of currency, sales were down 6% as we saw demand softness in certain key countries, particularly in the U.K. Ongoing operating margins were 3.7%. Our margins were negatively affected by approximately $40 million in unfavorable impact in our U.K. business from a devaluing British pound and softening demand environment.
Turning to Slide 15, we'll provide an update to our previously deployed actions in Europe. The integration of Indesit continues to be on track, and we fully expect to deliver planned cost synergies in the fourth quarter and into 2017. Consistent with what we've seen since the Brexit decision, currency continues to be a headwind and demand in the U.K. remains soft, causing our previously announced cost base price increase to be implemented slower than anticipated. Our platform integration and manufacturing transitions remain on track. However, we reduced manufacturing volumes in response to this lower demand, most of which occurred in the third quarter, and we now expect roughly 0.5 point margin impact for the full year. As a result, our margin expansion in Europe is slightly delayed. In summary, we believe we have the right actions in place to manage through volatility and deliver our long-term goals.
On Slide 16, our 2016 priorities for the European, Middle East and Africa region remain largely unchanged. There's a continued focus on integration activities, ongoing cost productivity and growth from adjacent businesses. Similar to the third quarter, we plan to manage inventory levels as we continue product and brand transitions in the fourth quarter. Our industry guidance remains flat to up 2% for the full year. We now expect to deliver 4.5% to 5% operating margin for the full year and remain confident in our long-term margin guidance of 8%.
I will now discuss our Latin America results on Slide 17. Sales for the quarter were $800 million, an increase of 7%. Excluding the impact of currency, sales increased 2%. Our third quarter operating profit totaled $45 million, and margin increased 150 basis points versus the prior year. Despite operating in a challenging demand environment, we expanded margins and delivered strong revenue growth through continued investments in our brands and products. We gained significant market share while also improving price mix in Brazil, and we continue to benefit from substantial fixed cost reduction actions, which we began implementing last year.
On Slide 18, our priorities in Latin America have not changed. We remain well-prepared to manage through volatility, as we have done consistently over the past several quarters through cost productivity, significant market share gains and positive price mix. For a couple quarters now, we've been monitoring the difference between sell-in and sell-out volumes in the Brazilian market, at which time, because we've seen our trade customers build some inventory, we are expecting an inventory correction in the fourth quarter. And as a result, we now expect the Brazil industry to be down 10% to 12% for the full year. We now expect to deliver 6.5% to 7% operating margins for the full year.
Now we turn to our third quarter results for the Asia region, which are shown on Slide 19. Net sales were $338 million versus $346 million in the prior year period. Excluding the impact of currency, sales increased 2%. Our ongoing operating profit was $17 million compared to $27 million in the prior year period. Ongoing operating margins were 4.9% as continued demand softness and price/mix challenges in China more than offset continued record performance in India. 
Turning to Slide 20. You will see our 2016 priorities for Asia. We are focused on marketplace investments on our core product offerings, driving strong mix. The brand transition from Sanyo to Whirpool is progressing, and we are now focused on increasing awareness of our Whirlpool brand. As a result of these actions we're confident in our ability to deliver our long-term margin goals in the Asia region. 
Now I'd like to turn it over to Jim Peters."

As Jeff mentioned, we delivered another quarter of record results despite operating in a challenging external environment. 
Turning to our third quarter results on Slide 22. Net sales were $5.2 billion. We achieved record ongoing earnings of $3.66 per share, primarily driven by strong delivery of acquisition synergies, unit volume growth and ongoing cost productivity programs. Currency had a top line impact of approximately $40 million and reduced EBIT margins by approximately 1 point. 
Some currencies have strengthened against the U.S. dollar, most notably in Canada and Brazil. However, we are hedged at rates more reflective of last year's environment, and as such, we are not seeing the full benefit of those currencies strengthening in our operating margin. Our third quarter tax rate was driven by the timing of tax settlements and planning activity, and we now expect a 19% tax rate for the full year. Overall, we are pleased with our results through the first 3 quarters of 2016 and are on track to deliver strong full year results.
On Slide 23, we provide an update on the progress of our restructuring and acquisition integration activities. Through the third quarter, we have incurred restructuring expenses of $116 million and delivered $165 million in benefits. We continue to expect $200 million in expense and $200 million in benefits for the full year, which is ahead of plan. 
I will now discuss our expectations for full year EBIT margin expansion on Slide 24. As Marc discussed in the regional reviews, we have seen elevated promotional activity in the U.S. since our last call, as well as delayed benefits of our previously announced cost base price increases in the U.K. Both had a negative impact on our price/mix, which we now expect to be flat to slightly negative for the year. We are also slightly reducing our ongoing cost productivity due to the impact of softer global demand on production levels. As a result of these changes, we now expect to deliver approximately 7.5% EBIT margin for the full year, more than 0.5 point expansion over the prior year. 
On Slide 25, we share some details of our free cash flow results and capital allocation actions through the third quarter. Our free cash flow improved versus prior year, primarily due to improved earnings. We expect full year free cash flow of $700 million, which is inclusive of $150 million of restructuring cash outlays and $155 million associated with legacy product warranty actions in EMEA. Consistent with our strategy, we continue to execute a balanced approach to capital allocation by funding the capital needs of our business and returning cash to our shareholders. We have executed $425 million in share repurchases year-to-date, and we plan to buy back additional shares in the fourth quarter, consistent with our prior statement.
Turning to Slide 26. We are adjusting our full year guidance, as discussed earlier. We are confident in our operational plans and expect to deliver up to 15% growth in ongoing earnings per share and approximately $700 million in free cash flow in 2016.
Now I'd like to turn it back over to Jeff."

We have deployed strong actions to offset the operating challenges we faced in the third quarter. We do expect to deliver another record year, including about a 15% EPS growth and strong free cash flow. 
On Slide 29, you'll see our long-term value creation strategy, which remains unchanged. We are committed to being the best global branded consumer products company in the world. We believe our ability to generate earnings growth and free cash flow is very strong. We have the leading market positions in 3 of the 4 regions out of the world, a very strong platform for our continued growth. And our brands are very well-established and reach over 90% of appliance consumers globally. So we are confident that our strategy will continue to deliver significant value. 
Finally, on Slide 30, I want to make a few comments on our 2016 operating performance and over a longer period of time. Over the last 5 years, we have delivered record results, including -- counting 2016, with over 20% annualized earnings EPS growth despite what I would describe a challenging external environment. And in the last 2 years, we've absorbed over $6 per share impact from global currencies weakening against the U.S. dollar in a very unprecedented manner. Additionally, we've seen significant demand declines in our major emerging markets, which are Brazil, Russia and China. This has had a $2 impact per share over the last 2 years. But within this environment, we were able to grow our earnings by 10% in 2015, and we expect to grow them additionally by 15% this year. And all while driving strong free cash flow. We've used that cash to reinvest in our business, increase our dividend, pay down debt and buy back nearly $700 million in stock. 
Today, managing through economic volatility is the new normal, and it's part of our everyday operating management system. We believe that we continue to demonstrate our ability to navigate through those challenges, and because of that, we remain confident in our ability to effectively manage our business in this type of environment. So in total, we believe we have significant opportunities to continue creating shareholder value going forward. 
So with that, I'm going to end our formal remarks, and we'd like to open it up for questions."

First of all, let me first talk about what happened in Q3 in washers and what we are going to do about it going forward. First of all, in Q3, as we indicated in our remarks, we saw an increased promotional intensity, in particular, in washers. I would say all the other categories had promotional intensity, but nothing earth-shattering or surprising to our -- from our perspective. In washers, it was more intense. To some extent, we were not completely surprised because we saw certain competitors stockpiling a lot of inventory at the end of Q2, and I think we made a remark on that during our last earnings call. The negative impact on us is kind of twofold, if you want to say. One, because obviously, we cannot and will not participate in certain value-destructing promotions. So of course, you lose the volume and, thus, the leverage in your overall production. Two, is a mix element, because if you basically have the high end of your range by a certain competitor pulled down very much, you lose a lot of mix. To be more specific, take a typical front load washer, we have a line structure anywhere from $399 or $499 to $999 -- not $399, $499 to $999. If certain competitors bring that down to $599 or even below, it's hard to build a line structure, and therefore, you lose mix. So we had a twofold negative impact on our business. What we're going to do about it, apart from continue to invest in new product and innovation, which we are launching in the market, is two, yes, we have announced certain price increases, because we felt that certain price levels just do not reflect the cost investment which we put behind the products. These price effects or cost base price increases are in effect for January 1. Thirdly, as Jeff also indicated, we are continuing to pursue the antidumping lawsuits. And we remain confident in our ability to win on this one. So I think the combination of all these 3 elements make us believe that we can fully restore our margins in the washer business."

As we indicated in earlier calls, our U.K. business at the time of the acquisition was roughly about $1 billion. So it's a very significant business where we have, historically, a strong market position and a strong above average operating margin. If you just look at the pure currency now, Q3 over Q3 last year, you basically have roughly 22% decline. So it's been massive. To Jim's earlier point, it has been a little bit moderated because of some hedging programs, but it's still massive. You also need to keep in mind that about 85% to -- roughly 85% of the products which we sell in the U.K. are imported or now what's produced on a euro base. So you basically have a full year cost base impact on this one. So it's significant. The $40 million impact, which I referred to in the script, is related to, one, obviously, the margin loss because of a higher cost base; and two, we implemented a price increase in September -- or we started to implement it, and yes, we saw significant volume reduction in the month of September. The combination of these 2 things were roughly $40 million. So it's -- by definition, it's a massive impact on our operating results in Europe in Q3. To your question about the price increases and the progress, we had a small price increase in July, where we frankly had a hard time getting full traction. We had another one in September where we're seeing the traction on the invoices, but yes, we still have a drag on the volume. And we expect that drag to also be there for Q4 even though at a slightly lower level."

But it's -- we do see consumer -- just span of attention is right now shifting towards other topics and discretionary demand, and ultimately, yes, we see what we think is a temporary softness of consumer confidence. As you know, in our products in particular, the discretionary demand is largely driven by consumer confidence. Will that improve and recover after November 8? Probably not immediately, not the next day, but over time, we expect to do so. If you also look at the fundamentals, and that was what we included in the presentation, in the script, the fundamentals of the housing market are 100% intact.

The promotional environment in U.S., it's probably going to last in Q4, but not beyond. U.K. will be less, but still somewhat impacting Q4. So that's on a macro level. Now specifically to Europe, when you basically take the $40 million, which I referred to earlier, Brexit-related, that is an entire, or almost more than entire year-over-year drop. Or in other words, we continue to make excellent progress on the cost takeout related to the integration and the synergies, but it's been entirely offset by the impact which we had in the U.K. And that's obviously been very impactful.

Then you have the other component which is the branded versus non-branded part of our sales.

In December, it's expected the Department of Commerce will establish the final tariffs. And you may remember, the preliminary tariffs were over 50% for one competitor and over 100% for another one. So they're substantial. And then -- so that will happen in December. And then the ITC will make the final ruling on -- that dumping has caused injury to the washer business in the U.S., and we expect that ruling in January. So at that point in time, and we do see assume we're going to be successful here, then those competitors will either have to pay really high tariffs or they'll have to do something else. And at the same time -- and again, I don't want to overemphasize this, but as Marc said, I mean, we had one competitor in the second quarter ship in months and months of supply in advance of trying to -- as the DOC ruled, beat the cash deposits. And unloading that inventory in the third, and perhaps, part of the fourth quarter, has been a real strain on the operating margins and has caused a lot of injury to the washer business. So basically, again I can't speak what competitors are going to do. I know we're going to run our business in an economical way.

We always argued for the last 3 years, and I would still argue, the entire, call it, housing boom has been a little bit constrained by the supply side. There has not been enough developed lots. When we had issues about getting enough construction workers, so there's been a severe supply constraint, which also explains a little bit why the house prices came up so quickly. So that was a constraint, which we slowly see easing, but not a rapid pace. So if you want to find any negative which could impact that, you can put up theories then. Of course, if the Fed rates would come up too fast, too quickly, that could have an impact. I don't think that's likely, but I don't know.

And then, we look at other household product categories and we saw similar trends. So I think most of the data suggests that the consumer got cautious. Typically, that doesn't last for long periods of time, particularly when there's certainty ahead. And that's why we have confidence we'll continue to see growth."

So first of all, let's differentiate overall industry trends from our own demand, which we see. I would say, overall, the European market, and we don't yet have a final sell-in data for Europe, I would expect them to be closer to 2",312,"Yes. Denise, it's Marc. So first of all, let's differentiate overall industry trends from our own demand, which we see. I would say, overall, the European market, and we don't yet have a final sell-in data for Europe, I would expect them to be closer to 2%. We earlier indicated 0% to 2% for the full year. And in Q3, I would expect it right now somewhere between 1.5% and 2%. But it's too early because we don't have the final data. Also on a full year basis, I would say the entire European market still in 0% to 2%, probably ending close to the 2%. So the fundamentals of demand in Europe are not that horrible. It's the currency which impacts a lot. If you kind of peel back the onion, of course, there's a lot of moving pieces. I think for us, the most promising sign going forward, we start seeing recovery in Russia and Ukraine. That's an early sign. But you know we're -- in this acquisition, we're very exposed to both U.K. and Russia. And right now, both markets are very soft from currency and demand. But we see Russia slowly coming back. And now it's too early to yet call it a recovery, but I would say the early signs have been promising. Now specific to our demand, for us, U.K. markets did better as a market than we saw in our demand. That is directly related to us coming out of a price increase in September, which the rest of the industry did not fully follow and that impacted our demand. That's the particular impact. Outside of the U.K., I would say by and large, our demand is solid. Probably the only other exception will be Middle East and Africa, which is still impacted by a lot of uncertainty in demand and by the entire space."
