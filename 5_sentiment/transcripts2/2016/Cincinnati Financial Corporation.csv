260681,321310419,926589,"Cincinnati Financial Corp., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 04, 2016",2016-02-04,"Earnings Calls","Cincinnati Financial Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Dennis, and good morning. I'm speaking with you today from Murfreesboro, Tennessee. This week, we began our annual tour of sales meeting with our independent agents in more than 20 states. Meeting with agents is essential to our relationship-or",1211,"Thank you, Dennis, and good morning. I'm speaking with you today from Murfreesboro, Tennessee. This week, we began our annual tour of sales meeting with our independent agents in more than 20 states. Meeting with agents is essential to our relationship-oriented agency-centered strategy that reflects our culture, where we believe actions speak louder in person.
There are many benefits to strengthening those relationships and getting information on a first-hand basis. And being with agencies, energizes our local and headquarter's management teams. We enjoy this chance to thank our agents in person for all they contribute to the success of Cincinnati Insurance. They're trusting us to serve the people and businesses in their communities to produce another great year of underlying profit and premium growth.
Next, I want to highlight our financial performance and reiterate our confidence and our strategy and our ability to execute it well. The strong operating results we reported for the fourth quarter and for the full year 2015 continue to reflect the steady effort by our associates as we carefully underwrite and price policies, provide overwhelming claims service, manage investments and provide support for our operations and agency partners.
Excellent company performance in 2015 provided the opportunity to further reward shareholders and was the main driver of the special dividend paid in December.
We are very satisfied with our recent overall underwriting results as we reported a fourth quarter 2015 combined ratio of 87.0, and a full year ratio of 91.1%. More favorable weather in 2015 contributed to the full year combined ratio improvement compared with 2014. It's also important to note that most of the underlying measures also improved due to contributions from all areas of the company.
Our commercial insurance results were our highlight this quarter as our associates and agents achieved a profitable growth and steady pricing. We continue to further segment our renewals and new business opportunities using pricing precision and risk selection decisions that combine data models and underwriter judgment on a policy-by-policy basis. We know that work is critical as we seek to further improve underwriting results.
We believe we can successfully balance prudent underwriting and business growth to meet 2016 combined ratios in the low to mid-90% range and 2016's property casualty premium growth rate within a percentage point of 2015. Our 2015 catastrophe loss ratio was 2.3 points below the average of the previous 10 years. We recognized that weather and significant changes in the industry market conditions that influence insurance policy pricing trends are variables that will affect the property casualty results we ultimately report.
In 2015, it looks like we met our premium growth objective of outpacing property casualty industry growth based on the industry's 9 months result. We continue to experience outstanding policy retention and average renewal price increases for each of our property casualty segments. That's a tribute to the excellent way our agencies conduct business as well as to how our underwriters do their jobs.
Policy retention rates for both personal and commercial lines was generally consistent with the year ago. For commercial lines, our policy retention continued near the high end of the mid-80% range. And for personal lines, we continued in the low to mid-90% range. Our long-term growth strategy includes deploying agencies in areas where we are underrepresented, taking care to preserve relationships with established agencies in the franchise-like benefit they value.
In 2015, we appointed 114 new independent agencies. Similar to recent years, in 2016, we plan to appoint approximately 100 additional agencies that will offer most or all of our property casualty insurance products. We also plan to appoint other agencies to focus on high net worth personal lines clients.
In 2016, we are targeting approximately $25 million in high net worth new business written premiums. That includes premiums from our Executive Capstone's suite of insurance products and services. We continue to earn new business through our agencies in part to new products and services like our high net worth expansion initiative. For full year 2015, each of our property casualty segments reported an increase of production of new business written premiums.
One of the bright spots was the increase in high net worth new business. While its contribution was relatively small amount of overall 2015 new business increase, its growth rate was approximately double the rest of the personal lines operations.
The launch of Executive Capstone and prudent expansion of our reinsurance operations provides additional confidence in our ability to continue to diversify and profitably grow premiums in an increasingly tough operating environment.
For renewal business in the fourth quarter, overall average renewal price increases were similar to the third quarter. Average renewal price increases for commercial lines continued their percentages in the low-single-digit range. That average includes the muting effect of 3-year policies that were not yet subject to renewal during the fourth quarter.
For commercial property and commercial auto policies that did renew during the fourth quarter, we continue to obtain meaningful price increases with property averaging in the mid-single-digit range in auto, averaging near the high end of the low single-digit range.
Our most profitable line of business in recent quarters, workers' compensation, averaged negative renewal price changes during the fourth quarter. While the average pricing change may have been negative, we continue to price on a policy-by-policy basis. Certain policies that we determine needed a price increase received it. Approximately half of our workers' compensation in 2015 renewal premiums were for policies with price increases.
Our personal auto policy's average renewal price increases in the mid-single-digit range, while homeowner policies averaged a low-single-digit range, down from the third quarter. For our excess or surplus line segments, fourth quarter 2015 average renewal price increases were near the high end of the low-single-digit range, down slightly from the third quarter measure.
Our Life Insurance subsidiary and term life insurance premiums its largest product lines. This business supports account retention for our agents and provide steady contributions to our earnings as it has less correlation to the weather than our property casualty business. 
On January 1 of this year, we again renewed all of our primary property casualty treaties that transferred part of our risk to reinsurers. For both our pro risk treaties and our property catastrophe treaty, terms and conditions for 2016 are similar to 2015. While we did receive some modest rate reductions, we expect the amount of season premiums for both years to be similar because our direct written premiums subject to those treaties are growing.
In conclusion, our primary measure of long-term financial performance, the value creation ratio was 3.4% for full year 2015. The contribution from operating income was the highest it's been in the past 5 years. However, VCR total was below our range due to a decline in securities market value.
For 2016 and beyond, we'll stay focused on areas where we have more influence, underwriting profitability and growth. Our insurance business remains in excellent shape. We are as confident as ever in our associates, in the relationships we build with independent agencies and in the ongoing benefits of our strategic initiatives and aim to continually improve performance.
I'll now as our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell, to comment on investments and other important aspects of our recent financial performance."

Thank you, Steve, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. I'll start with some analysis of investment results. Investment income growth for the fourth quarter 2015 was especially strong at 7%, boosting the full year result to just over 4%. F",1030,"Great. Thank you, Steve, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. I'll start with some analysis of investment results. Investment income growth for the fourth quarter 2015 was especially strong at 7%, boosting the full year result to just over 4%. Fourth quarter dividend income was up 14%. Dividend amounts in the last quarter of the year tend to be the most variable as some entities return capital or pay special dividends near the end of the calendar year.
Interest income rose 4% in the fourth quarter and 3% for the year as we continue to invest the majority of annual net operating cash flow in our bond portfolio.
Other than temporary impairments to securities and our stock and bond portfolios, totaled more than a typical quarter at $40 million. Most of that related to energy stocks affected by declining oil prices. Securities market trends took a toll on the valuation of our investments during 2015. The company has experienced that before and we've maintained our current proven investment approach for over 5 decades and we have no plans to change it.
Our stock portfolio evaluation rebounded nicely in the fourth quarter, but at the year-end 2015 fair value was 3% below where it began the year. The stock market's rocky ride so far in 2016 has been well publicized, but we choose to keep our focus on the long-term investment strategy and performance.
Fair value of our bond portfolio rose 2% for the year despite a significant drop in unrealized gains due to rising interest rates. That drop was offset by net purchases of additional bonds for the portfolio as it's amortized cost was up almost 5%.
In terms of bond portfolio yields, we reported a fourth quarter 2015 pretax average yield of 4.66%, 6 basis points lower than a year ago. That measure on a full year basis also declined by 6 basis points.
Taxable bonds purchased during the fourth quarter had an average pretax yield of 4.34%, while tax-exempt bonds purchased averaged 3.36%. Our bond portfolio's effective duration at the end of 2015 was 4.7 years, up from 4.4 years at year-end 2014. That increase was due primarily to the impact from rising interest rates on our callable bonds and does not represent a change in strategy.
Cash flow from operating activities continues to help us grow investment income. Funds generated from net operating cash flows for the year 2015 were up 22% to just over $1 billion, contributing to the $631 million of net purchases of securities for our investment portfolio.
Turning to property casualty underwriting results. I'll first comment on 2 typical items. Number one, careful expense management is still one of our top priorities and is balanced with strategically investing in several parts of our business. That approach, combined with premium growth, resulted in a slight increase of 0.3 percentage points for our full year 2015 underwriting expense ratio, bringing it to 30.9%. That increase was largely due to investments to support our expansion of high net worth personal lines markets.
Number two, the primary measures pertaining to our reserves for losses and loss expenses continued to fairly -- continued in a fairly stay pattern as we continue to follow a consistent approach. We've now experienced 27 consecutive years of overall favorable reserve development. Full year 2015 favorable reserve development on prior accident years benefited our combined ratio by 4.3 percentage points. That was better than the 2.4 points for 2014 when we strengthened commercial casualty reserves. But the 4.3 points was consistent with the 4.1 points we reported for the year 2013.
Other than commercial and personal auto, each of our major lines of businesses developed favorably in 2015. We continue to take underwriting and pricing actions to improve our auto results and maintain that we believe is a prudent level of reserves.
Our full year 2015 net favorable development was again spread over several accident years, including 33% for accident year 2014, 22% for accident year 2013, 26% for accident year 2012 and 19% for all order accident years in aggregate.
Consistent with past years, we continue to aim for reserve reported in our balance sheet to be at levels reflecting net amounts well into the upper half of the actuarially estimated range of net loss and loss expense reserves. Our consolidated property casualty growth and net carry reserves was 5% during 2015. 
I also want to highlight the $33 million of fourth quarter 2015 net written premiums we reported for our reinsurance assumed operations known as Cincinnati Re. At the end of the year, 7 diverse treaties were in effect. We are recording written premiums when the period treaties become effective and will follow the common practice of estimating assumed premium amounts for each treaty's term based on current information. Premiums will be earned over the coverage period on a pro rata basis, similar to our other property casualty policies. Net of applicable retrocessions 2015 net earned premiums totaled $10 million.
One capital management item I'll touch on is additional share repurchases during the fourth quarter of 2015. Shares repurchased during the quarter totaled 200,000 shares at an average price per share of $60.11. That brought the full year 2015 share repurchases to a total of 1 million shares at an average price per share of $53.08.
As usual, I'll conclude my prepared comments by summarizing the contributions during the fourth quarter to book value per share. Property casualty underwriting increased book value by $0.57; life insurance operations added $0.06; investment income, other than life insurance and reduced by noninsurance items, contributed $0.47; the change in unrealized gains at December 31 for the fixed income portfolio net of realized gains and losses decreased book value per share by $0.45; the change in unrealized gains at December 31 for the equity portfolio net of realized gains and losses increased book value by $0.70; and we declared $0.92 per share in dividends to shareholders with half of that representing the special dividend. The net effect was a book value increase of $0.43 during the fourth quarter to $39.20 per share.
And now I'll turn the call back over to Steve."

The topic is a conversation that we've had in the last 3 days of last meetings, I think I would characterize it as being surprisingly fewer conversations about terrific competition or anything of that nature. I think the expectation right now is that the account has performed well, that they would have flat renewals, maybe some slight decreases is the way agencies would tee it up with us and their discussions with us. They also understand, and I hear from other carriers that segmentation is the key here. Is that there's still policy offers out there that deserve, in our book of business are getting rate increases. So I guess I would characterize, Mark, places not out of control. There's a few more stories that come through that there are some surprising things going on. Clearly, everyone's results are good. Everyone wants to increase shelf spacing agencies. A lot of agencies would be discussing to prospective clients, saying that you should expect a price decrease. But I guess I've come away from these last 3 sales meetings feeling pretty good about stability. Our 3-year policy in a marketplace like this, in any marketplace, really, but in this marketplace, plays out well. There's a lot of policyholders that are appreciative with the consistency of our approach with them. Their policies aren't renewing this year just because there may be some chatter out there about rate decreases doesn't mean they want to go through the process of completely reevaluating the insurance program. So clearly there's going to be a fair amount of competition out there. We are seeing indexes of surplus lines areas a little bit of a pickup of the E&S business going back to the standard market which is pretty typical for this type of pace of the marketplace. So maybe that's a little more than you're asking for but that kind of gives you a little bit of flavor we're experiencing."

We're getting a lot of favorable feedback on that relative to our activity. As you can imagine, there's less choice out there for independent agencies that had represented Fireman's fund and companies. So they're looking for more choice. Feedback has been good, not only from our current agency force. In fact, in Atlanta, on Tuesday, we had a workshop, if you will, an introductory workshop our agents and 90 agencies attended, which you just have to take my word for it, that's a huge number of agencies that's showing interest in high net worth. We've been very successful in appointing our first wave of agencies in New York City, Long Island, Westchester County area and New Jersey, which we will open in March. We've had quite a few agencies calling us interested in representing Cincinnati Insurance Company. I think it's worth noting the person that will be spearheading our East Coast strategy is a gentleman in the name of Joe Kenzie. Joe previously was President of Fireman's Fund personal lines. He joined us a few months ago. Joe had worked with previously, so we're pleased to get that kind of talent to the company. Will was in California a couple of weeks ago, talking to agents out there, there's a lot of interest there. So I think between the talent of the people that are working with this in high net worth, the reputation we have among agents the financial strength that we represent repetition, as a company, we're feeling really good about where we are right now in high net worth."

I'm speaking with you today from Murfreesboro, Tennessee. This week, we began our annual tour of sales meetings with our independent agents in more than 20 states.

This week, we began our annual tour of sales meetings with our independent agents in more than 20 states. Meeting with agents is essential to our relationship-oriented agency-centered strategy that reflects our culture, where we believe actions speak louder in person.
There are many benefits to strengthening those relationships and getting information on a first-hand basis. And being with agencies, energizes our local and headquarters' management teams. We enjoy this chance to thank our agents in person for all they contribute to the success of Cincinnati Insurance. They're trusting us to serve the people and businesses in their communities to produce another great year of underwriting profit and premium growth.
Next, I want to highlight our financial performance and reiterate our confidence in our strategy and our ability to execute it well. The strong operating results we reported for the fourth quarter and for the full year 2015 continue to reflect the steady effort by our associates as we carefully underwrite and price policies, provide overwhelming claims service, manage investments and provide support for our operations and agency partners.
Excellent company performance in 2015 provided the opportunity to further reward shareholders and was the main driver of the special dividend paid in December.
We are very satisfied with our recent overall underwriting results as we reported a fourth quarter 2015 combined ratio of 87.0%, and a full year ratio of 91.1%. More favorable weather in 2015 contributed to the full year combined ratio improvement compared with 2014. It's also important to note that most of the underlying measures also improved due to contributions from all areas of the company.
Our commercial insurance results were a highlight this quarter as our associates and agents achieved a profitable growth and steady pricing. We continue to further segment our renewal and new business opportunities using pricing precision and risk selection decisions that combine data models and underwriter judgment on a policy-by-policy basis. We know that work is critical as we seek to further improve underwriting results.
We believe we can successfully balance prudent underwriting and business growth to main 2016 combined ratios in the low to mid-90% range and 2016's property casualty premium growth rate within a percentage point of 2015. Our 2015 catastrophe loss ratio was 2.3 points below the average of the previous 10 years. We recognize that weather and significant changes in the industry market conditions that influence insurance policy pricing trends are variables that will affect the property casualty results we ultimately report.
In 2015, it looks like we met our premium growth objective of outpacing property casualty industry growth based on the industry's 9-month result. We continue to experience outstanding policy retention and average renewal price increases for each of our property casualty segments. That's a tribute to the excellent way our agencies conduct business as well as to how our underwriters do their jobs.
Policy retention rates for both personal and commercial lines were generally consistent with a year ago. For commercial lines, our policy retention continued near the high end of the mid-80% range. And for personal lines, we continued in the low to mid-90% range. Our long-term growth strategy includes deploying agencies in areas where we are underrepresented, taking care to preserve relationships with established agencies in the franchise-like benefit they value.
In 2015, we appointed 114 new independent agencies. Similar to recent years, in 2016, we plan to appoint approximately 100 additional agencies that will offer most or all of our property casualty insurance products. We also plan to appoint other agencies that focus on high net worth personal lines clients.
In 2016, we are targeting approximately $25 million in high net worth new business written premiums. That includes premiums from our Executive Capstone suite of insurance products and services. We continue to earn new business through our agencies in part through new products and services like our high net worth expansion initiative. For full year 2015, each of our property casualty segments reported an increase in production of new business written premiums.
One of the bright spots was the increase in high net worth new business. While its contribution was a relatively small amount of overall 2015 new business increase, its growth rate was approximately double the rest of the personal lines operations.
The launch of Executive Capstone and prudent expansion of our reinsurance-assumed operation provides additional confidence in our ability to continue to diversify and profitably grow premiums in an increasingly tough operating environment.
For renewal business in the fourth quarter, overall average renewal price increases were similar to the third quarter. Average renewal price increases for commercial lines continued at percentages in the low-single-digit range. That average includes the muting effect of 3-year policies that were not yet subject to renewal during the fourth quarter.
For commercial property and commercial auto policies that did renew during the fourth quarter, we continue to obtain meaningful price increases with property averaging in the mid-single-digit range and auto averaging near the high end of the low single-digit range.
Our most profitable line of business in recent quarters, workers' compensation, averaged negative renewal price changes during the fourth quarter. While the average pricing change may have turned negative, we continue to price on a policy-by-policy basis. Certain policies that we determine needed a price increase received it. Approximately half of our workers' compensation 2015 renewal premiums were for policies with price increases.
Our personal auto policies average renewal price increases in the mid-single-digit range, while homeowner policies averaged a low-single-digit range, down from the third quarter. For our excess and surplus line segments, fourth quarter 2015 average renewal price increases were near the high end of the low-single-digit range, down slightly from the third quarter measure.
Our Life Insurance subsidiary again grew term life insurance premiums, its largest product line. This business supports account retention for our agents and provide steady contributions to our earnings as it has less correlation to the weather than our property casualty business. 
On January 1 of this year, we again renewed all of our primary property casualty treaties that transferred part of our risk to reinsurers. For both our per risk treaties and our property catastrophe treaty, terms and conditions for 2016 are similar to 2015. While we did receive some modest rate reductions, we expect the amount of seasoned premium for both years to be similar because our direct written premiums subject to those treaties are growing.
In conclusion, our primary measure of long-term financial performance, the value creation ratio was 3.4% for full year 2015. The contribution from operating income was the highest it's been in the past 5 years. However, VCR total was below our range due to a decline in securities market value.
For 2016 and beyond, we'll stay focused on areas where we have more influence, underwriting profitability and growth. Our insurance business remains in excellent shape. We are as confident as ever in our associates, in the relationships we build with independent agencies and in the ongoing benefits of our strategic initiatives that aim to continually improve performance.
I'll now as our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell, to comment on investments and other important aspects of our recent financial performance."
260681,321310419,926916,"Cincinnati Financial Corp., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 04, 2016",2016-02-04,"Earnings Calls","Cincinnati Financial Corporation","Executives","Great. Thank you, Steve, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. I'll start with some analysis of investment results. Investment income growth for the fourth quarter 2015 was especially strong at 7%, boosting the full year result to just over 4%. F",1030,"Great. Thank you, Steve, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. I'll start with some analysis of investment results. Investment income growth for the fourth quarter 2015 was especially strong at 7%, boosting the full year result to just over 4%. Fourth quarter dividend income was up 14%. Dividend amounts in the last quarter of the year tend to be the most variable as some entities return capital or pay special dividends near the end of the calendar year.
Interest income rose 4% in the fourth quarter and 3% for the year as we continue to invest the majority of annual net operating cash flow in our bond portfolio.
Other-than-temporary impairments to securities and our stock and bond portfolios totaled more than a typical quarter at $40 million. Most of that related to energy stocks affected by declining oil prices. Securities market trends took a toll on the valuation of our investments during 2015. The company has experienced that before and we've maintained our current proven investment approach for over 5 decades and we have no plans to change it.
Our stock portfolio valuation rebounded nicely in the fourth quarter, but at the year-end 2015 fair value was 3% below where it began the year. The stock market's rocky ride so far in 2016 has been well publicized, but we choose to keep our focus on the long-term investment strategy and performance.
Fair value of our bond portfolio rose 2% for the year despite a significant drop in unrealized gains due to rising interest rates. That drop was offset by net purchases of additional bonds for the portfolio as its amortized cost was up almost 5%.
In terms of bond portfolio yields, we reported a fourth quarter 2015 pretax average yield of 4.66%, 6 basis points lower than a year ago. That measure on a full year basis also declined by 6 basis points.
Taxable bonds purchased during the fourth quarter had an average pretax yield of 4.34%, while tax-exempt bonds purchased averaged 3.36%. Our bond portfolio's effective duration at the end of 2015 was 4.7 years, up from 4.4 years at year-end 2014. That increase was due primarily to the impact from rising interest rates on our callable bonds and does not represent a change in strategy.
Cash flow from operating activities continues to help us grow investment income. Funds generated from net operating cash flows for the year 2015 were up 22% to just over $1 billion, contributing to the $631 million of net purchases of securities for our investment portfolio.
Turning to property casualty underwriting results. I'll first comment on 2 typical items. Number one, careful expense management is still one of our top priorities and is balanced with strategically investing in several parts of our business. That approach, combined with premium growth, resulted in a slight increase of 0.3 percentage points for our full year 2015 underwriting expense ratio, bringing it to 30.9%. That increase was largely due to investments to support our expansion of high net worth personal lines markets.
Number two, the primary measures pertaining to our reserves for losses and loss expenses continued to fairly -- continued in a fairly steady pattern as we continued to follow a consistent approach. We have now experienced 27 consecutive years of overall favorable reserve development. Full year 2015 favorable reserve development on prior accident years benefited our combined ratio by 4.3 percentage points. That was better than the 2.4 points for 2014 when we strengthened commercial casualty reserves. But the 4.3 points was consistent with the 4.1 points we reported for the year 2013.
Other than commercial and personal auto, each of our major lines of businesses developed favorably in 2015. We continue to take underwriting and pricing actions to improve our auto results and maintain that we believe is a prudent level of reserves.
Our full year 2015 net favorable development was again spread over several accident years, including 33% for accident year 2014, 22% for accident year 2013, 26% for accident year 2012 and 19% for all older accident years in aggregate.
Consistent with past years, we continue to aim for reserves reported on our balance sheet to be at levels reflecting net amounts well into the upper half of the actuarially estimated range of net loss and loss expense reserves. Our consolidated property casualty gross and net carry reserves was 5% during 2015. 
I also want to highlight the $33 million of fourth quarter 2015 net written premiums we reported for our reinsurance-assumed operations known as Cincinnati Re. At the end of the year, 7 diverse treaties were in effect. We are recording written premiums in the period treaties become effective and will follow the common practice of estimating assumed premium amounts for each treaty's term based on current information. Premiums will be earned over the coverage period on a pro rata basis, similar to our other property casualty policies. Net of applicable retrocessions Cincinnati Re's 2015 net earned premiums totaled $10 million.
One capital management item I'll touch on is additional share repurchases during the fourth quarter of 2015. Shares repurchased during the quarter totaled 200,000 shares at an average price per share of $60.11. That brought the full year 2015 share repurchases to a total of 1 million shares at an average price per share of $53.08.
As usual, I'll conclude my prepared comments by summarizing the contributions during the fourth quarter to book value per share. Property casualty underwriting increased book value by $0.57; life insurance operations added $0.06; investment income, other than life insurance and reduced by noninsurance items, contributed $0.47; the change in unrealized gains at December 31 for the fixed income portfolio net of realized gains and losses decreased book value per share by $0.45; the change in unrealized gains at December 31 for the equity portfolio net of realized gains and losses increased book value by $0.70; and we declared $0.92 per share in dividends to shareholders with half of that representing the special dividend. The net effect was a book value increase of $0.43 during the fourth quarter to $39.20 per share.
And now I'll turn the call back over to Steve."

I'm just trying to get a little bit into the mindset of what the average Cincinnati Financial customer is thinking when their policy renewal comes up."

I think the expectation right now is that the account has performed well, that they would have flat renewals, maybe some slight decreases is the way agencies would tee it up with us in their discussions with us. They also understand, and they hear from other carriers, that segmentation is the key here. Is that there's still policy holders out there that deserve and, in our book of business, are getting rate increases. So I guess I would characterize, Mark, place is not out of control. There's a few war stories that come through that there are some surprising things going on. Clearly, everyone's results are good. Everyone wants to increase shelf spacing agencies. A lot of agencies would be discussing to prospective clients, saying that you should expect a price decrease. But I guess I've come away from these last 3 sales meetings feeling pretty good about stability. Our 3-year policy in a marketplace like this, in any marketplace, really, but in this marketplace, plays out well. There's a lot of policyholders that are appreciative of the consistency of our approach with them. Their policies aren't renewing this year just because there may be some chatter out there about rate decreases doesn't mean they want to go through the process of completely reevaluating their insurance program. 
So clearly there's going to be a fair amount of competition out there. We are seeing excess and surplus lines areas a little bit of a pickup of E&S business going back to the standard market which is pretty typical for this type of phase of the marketplace. So maybe that's a little more than you're asking for but that kind of gives you a little bit of flavor we're experiencing."

We've been very successful in appointing our first wave of agencies in New York City, Long Island, Westchester County area and New Jersey, which we will open in March. We've had quite a few agencies calling us interested in representing Cincinnati Insurance Company. I think it's worth noting the person that will be spearheading our East Coast strategy is a gentleman by the name of Joe Kinsey. Joe previously was President of Fireman's Fund personal lines. He joined us a few months ago. Joe had worked with Will Van Den Heuvel previously, so we're pleased to get that kind of talent to the company. Will was in California a couple of weeks ago, talking to agents out there, there's a lot of interest there.

260681,321310419,927023,"Cincinnati Financial Corp., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 04, 2016",2016-02-04,"Earnings Calls","Cincinnati Financial Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Dennis, and good morning. I'm speaking with you today from Murfreesboro, Tennessee. This week, we began our annual tour of sales meetings with our independent agents in more than 20 states.

This week, we began our annual tour of sales meetings with our independent agents in more than 20 states. Meeting with agents is essential to our relationship-oriented agency-centered strategy that reflects our culture, where we believe actions speak louder in person.
There are many benefits to strengthening those relationships and getting information on a first-hand basis. And being with agencies, energizes our local and headquarters' management teams. We enjoy this chance to thank our agents in person for all they contribute to the success of Cincinnati Insurance. They're trust in us to serve the people and businesses in their communities produced another great year of underwriting profit and premium growth.
Next, I want to highlight our financial performance and reiterate our confidence in our strategy and our ability to execute it well. The strong operating results we reported for the fourth quarter and for the full year 2015 continue to reflect the steady effort by our associates as we carefully underwrite and price policies, provide overwhelming claim service, manage investments and provide support for our operations and agency partners.
Excellent company performance in 2015 provided the opportunity to further reward shareholders and was the main driver of the special dividend paid in December.
We are very satisfied with our recent overall underwriting results as we reported a fourth quarter 2015 combined ratio of 87.0%, and a full year ratio of 91.1%. More favorable weather in 2015 contributed to the full year combined ratio improvement compared with 2014. It's also important to note that most of the underlying measures also improved due to contributions from all areas of the company.
Our commercial insurance results were a highlight this quarter as our associates and agents achieved profitable growth and steady pricing. We continue to further segment our renewal and new business opportunities using pricing precision and risk selection decisions that combine data models and underwriter judgment on a policy-by-policy basis. We know that work is critical as we seek to further improve underwriting results.
We believe we can successfully balance prudent underwriting and business growth to maintain 2016 combined ratios in the low to mid-90% range and 2016's property casualty premium growth rate within a percentage point of 2015. Our 2015 catastrophe loss ratio was 2.3 points below the average of the previous 10 years. We recognize that weather and significant changes in the industry market conditions that influence insurance policy pricing trends are variables that will affect the property casualty results we ultimately report.
In 2015, it looks like we met our premium growth objective of outpacing property casualty industry growth based on the industry's 9-month result. We continue to experience outstanding policy retention and average renewal price increases for each of our property casualty segments. That's a tribute to the excellent way our agencies conduct business as well as to how our underwriters do their jobs.
Policy retention rates for both personal and commercial lines were generally consistent with a year ago. For commercial lines, our policy retention continues near the high end of the mid-80% range. And for personal lines, we continued in the low to mid-90% range. Our long-term growth strategy includes appointing agencies in areas where we are underrepresented, taking care to preserve relationships with established agencies and the franchise-like benefit they value.
In 2015, we appointed 114 new independent agencies. Similar to recent years, in 2016, we plan to appoint approximately 100 additional agencies that will offer most or all of our property casualty insurance products. We also plan to appoint other agencies that focus on high net worth personal lines clients.
In 2016, we are targeting approximately $25 million in high net worth new business written premiums. That includes premiums from our Executive Capstone suite of insurance products and services. We continue to earn new business through our agencies in part through new products and services like our high net worth expansion initiative. For full year 2015, each of our property casualty segments reported an increase in production of new business written premiums.
One of the bright spots was the increase in high net worth new business. While its contribution was a relatively small amount of overall 2015 new business increase, its growth rate was approximately double the rest of the personal lines operations.
The launch of Executive Capstone and prudent expansion of our reinsurance-assumed operation provides additional confidence in our abilities to continue to diversify and profitably grow premiums in an increasingly tough operating environment.
For renewal business in the fourth quarter, overall average renewal price increases were similar to the third quarter. Average renewal price increases for commercial lines continued at percentages in the low-single-digit range. That average includes the muting effect of 3-year policies that were not yet subject to renewal during the fourth quarter.
For commercial property and commercial auto policies that did renew during the fourth quarter, we continue to obtain meaningful price increases with property averaging in the mid-single-digit range and auto averaging near the high end of the low single-digit range.
Our most profitable line of business in recent quarters, workers' compensation, averaged negative renewal price changes during the fourth quarter. While the average pricing change may have turned negative, we continue to price on a policy-by-policy basis. Certain policies that we determine needed a price increase received it. Approximately half of our workers' compensation 2015 renewal premiums were for policies with price increases.
Our personal auto policies averaged renewal price increases in the mid-single-digit range, while homeowner policies averaged a low-single-digit range, down from the third quarter. For our excess and surplus line segments, fourth quarter 2015 average renewal price increases were near the high end of the low-single-digit range, down slightly from the third quarter measure.
Our Life Insurance subsidiary again grew term life insurance premiums; its largest product line. This business supports account retention for our agents and provide steady contributions to our earnings as it has less correlation to the weather than our property casualty business. 
On January 1 of this year, we again renewed all of our primary property casualty treaties that transferred part of our risk to reinsurers. For both our per risk treaties and our property catastrophe treaty, terms and conditions for 2016 are similar to 2015. While we did receive some modest rate reductions, we expect the amount of seasoned premium for both years to be similar because our direct written premiums subject to those treaties are growing.
In conclusion, our primary measure of long-term financial performance: The value creation ratio was 3.4% for full year 2015. The contribution from operating income was the highest it's been in the past 5 years. However, VCR total was below our range due to a decline in securities market value.
For 2016 and beyond, we'll stay focused on areas where we have more influence, underwriting profitability and growth. Our insurance business remains in excellent shape. We are as confident as ever in our associates, in the relationships we build with independent agencies and in the ongoing benefits of our strategic initiatives that aim to continually improve performance.
I'll now ask our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell, to comment on investments and other important aspects of our recent financial performance."
260681,321310419,927023,"Cincinnati Financial Corp., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 04, 2016",2016-02-04,"Earnings Calls","Cincinnati Financial Corporation","Executives","Great. Thank you, Steve, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. I'll start with some analysis of investment results. Investment income growth for the fourth quarter 2015 was especially strong at 7%, boosting the full year result to just over 4%. F",1028,"Great. Thank you, Steve, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. I'll start with some analysis of investment results. Investment income growth for the fourth quarter 2015 was especially strong at 7%, boosting the full year result to just over 4%. Fourth quarter dividend income was up 14%. Dividend amounts in the last quarter of the year tend to be the most variable, as some entities return capital or pay special dividends near the end of the calendar year.
Interest income rose 4% in the fourth quarter and 3% for the year as we continue to invest the majority of annual net operating cash flow in our bond portfolio.
Other-than-temporary impairments to securities and our stock and bond portfolios totaled more than a typical quarter at $40 million. Most of that related to energy stocks affected by declining oil prices. Securities market trends took a toll on the valuation of our investments during 2015. The company has experienced that before and we've maintained our current proven investment approach for over 5 decades and we have no plans to change it.
Our stock portfolio valuation rebounded nicely in the fourth quarter, but its year-end 2015 fair value was 3% below where it began the year. The stock market's rocky ride so far in 2016 has been well publicized, but we choose to keep our focus on long-term investment strategy and performance.
Fair value of our bond portfolio rose 2% for the year despite a significant drop in unrealized gains due to rising interest rates. That drop was offset by net purchases of additional bonds for the portfolio as its amortized cost was up almost 5%.
In terms of bond portfolio yields, we reported a fourth quarter 2015 pretax average yield of 4.66%, 6 basis points lower than a year ago. That measure on a full year basis also declined by 6 basis points.
Taxable bonds purchased during the fourth quarter had an average pretax yield of 4.34%, while tax-exempt bonds purchased averaged 3.36%. Our bond portfolio's effective duration at the end of 2015 was 4.7 years, up from 4.4 years at year-end 2014. That increase was due primarily to the impact from rising interest rates on our callable bonds and does not represent a change in strategy.
Cash flow from operating activities continues to help us grow investment income. Funds generated from net operating cash flows for the year 2015 were up 22% to just over $1 billion, contributing to the $631 million of net purchases of securities for our investment portfolio.
Turning to property casualty underwriting results. I'll first comment on 2 typical items. Number one, careful expense management is still one of our top priorities and is balanced with strategically investing in several parts of our business. That approach, combined with premium growth, resulted in a slight increase of 0.3 percentage points for our full year 2015 underwriting expense ratio, bringing it to 30.9%. That increase was largely due to investments to support our expansion of high net worth personal lines markets.
Number two, the primary measures pertaining to our reserves for losses and loss expenses continued to fairly -- continued in a fairly steady pattern as we continued to follow a consistent approach. We have now experienced 27 consecutive years of overall favorable reserve development. Full year 2015 favorable reserve development on prior accident years benefited our combined ratio by 4.3 percentage points. That was better than the 2.4 points for 2014 when we strengthened commercial casualty reserves. But the 4.3 points was consistent with the 4.1 points we reported for the year 2013.
Other than commercial and personal auto, each of our major lines of businesses developed favorably in 2015. We continue to take underwriting and pricing actions to improve our auto results and maintain what we believe is a prudent level of reserves.
Our full year 2015 net favorable development was again spread over several accident years, including 33% for accident year 2014, 22% for accident year 2013, 26% for accident year 2012 and 19% for all older accident years in aggregate.
Consistent with past years, we continue to aim for reserves reported on our balance sheet to be at levels reflecting net amounts well into the upper half of the actuarially estimated range of net loss and loss expense reserves. Our consolidated property casualty gross and net carried reserves rose 5% during 2015. 
I also want to highlight the $33 million of fourth quarter 2015 net written premiums we reported for our reinsurance-assumed operation known as Cincinnati Re. At the end of the year, 7 diverse treaties were in effect. We are recording written premiums in the period treaties become effective and will follow the common practice of estimating assumed premium amounts for each treaty's term based on current information. Premiums will be earned over the coverage period on a pro rata basis, similar to our other property casualty policies. Net of applicable retrocessions Cincinnati Re's 2015 net earned premiums totaled $10 million.
One capital management item I'll touch on is additional share repurchases during the fourth quarter of 2015. Shares repurchased during the quarter totaled 200,000 shares at an average price per share of $60.11. That brought the full year 2015 share repurchases to a total of 1 million shares at an average price per share of $53.08.
As usual, I'll conclude my prepared comments by summarizing the contributions during the fourth quarter to book value per share. Property casualty underwriting increased book value by $0.57; life insurance operations added $0.06; investment income, other than life insurance and reduced by noninsurance items, contributed $0.47; the change in unrealized gains at December 31 for the fixed income portfolio net of realized gains and losses decreased book value per share by $0.45; the change in unrealized gains at December 31 for the equity portfolio net of realized gains and losses increased book value by $0.70; and we declared $0.92 per share in dividends to shareholders with half of that representing a special dividend. The net effect was a book value increase of $0.43 during the fourth quarter to $39.20 per share.
And now I'll turn the call back over to Steve."

They also understand, and they hear from other carriers, that segmentation is the key here. Is that there's still policy holders out there that deserve and, in our book of business, are getting rate increases. So I guess I would characterize, Mark, place is not out of control. There's a few war stories that come through that there are some surprising things going on. Clearly, everyone's results are good. Everyone wants to increase shelf space in agencies. A lot of agencies would be discussing to prospective clients, saying that you should expect a price decrease. But I guess I've come away from these last 3 sales meetings feeling pretty good about stability. Our 3-year policy in a marketplace like this, in any marketplace, really, but in this marketplace, plays out well. There's a lot of policyholders that are appreciative of the consistency of our approach with them. Their policies aren't renewing this year just because there may be some chatter out there about rate decreases doesn't mean they want to go through the process of completely reevaluating their insurance program. 
So clearly there's going to be a fair amount of competition out there. We are seeing in the excess and surplus lines areas a little bit of a pickup of E&S business going back to the standard market which is pretty typical for this type of phase of the marketplace. So maybe that's a little more than you're asking for but that kind of gives you a little bit of flavor we're experiencing."

In New Jersey, which we will open in March, we've had quite a few agencies calling us interested in representing Cincinnati Insurance Company.

260681,321310419,927065,"Cincinnati Financial Corp., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 04, 2016",2016-02-04,"Earnings Calls","Cincinnati Financial Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Dennis, and good morning. I'm speaking with you today from Murfreesboro, Tennessee. This week, we began our annual tour of sales meetings with our independent agents in more than 20 states.

This week, we began our annual tour of sales meetings with our independent agents in more than 20 states. Meeting with agents is essential to our relationship-oriented agency-centered strategy that reflects our culture, where we believe actions speak louder in person.
There are many benefits to strengthening those relationships and getting information on a first-hand basis. And being with agencies, energizes our local and headquarters' management teams. We enjoy this chance to thank our agents in person for all they contribute to the success of Cincinnati Insurance. Their trust in us to serve the people and businesses in their communities produced another great year of underwriting profit and premium growth.
Next, I want to highlight our financial performance and reiterate our confidence in our strategy and our ability to execute it well. The strong operating results we reported for the fourth quarter and for the full year 2015 continue to reflect the steady effort by our associates as we carefully underwrite and price policies, provide overwhelming claim service, manage investments and provide support for our operations and agency partners.
Excellent company performance in 2015 provided the opportunity to further reward shareholders and was the main driver of the special dividend paid in December.
We are very satisfied with our recent overall underwriting results as we reported a fourth quarter 2015 combined ratio of 87.0%, and a full year ratio of 91.1%. More favorable weather in 2015 contributed to the full year combined ratio improvement compared with 2014. It's also important to note that most of the underlying measures also improved due to contributions from all areas of the company.
Our commercial insurance results were a highlight this quarter as our associates and agents achieved profitable growth and steady pricing. We continue to further segment our renewal and new business opportunities using pricing precision and risk selection decisions that combine data models and underwriter judgment on a policy-by-policy basis. We know that work is critical as we seek to further improve underwriting results.
We believe we can successfully balance prudent underwriting and business growth to maintain 2016 combined ratios in the low to mid-90% range and 2016's property casualty premium growth rate within a percentage point of 2015. Our 2015 catastrophe loss ratio was 2.3 points below the average of the previous 10 years. We recognize that weather and significant changes in the industry market conditions that influence insurance policy pricing trends are variables that will affect the property casualty results we ultimately report.
In 2015, it looks like we met our premium growth objective of outpacing property casualty industry growth based on the industry's 9-month result. We continue to experience outstanding policy retention and average renewal price increases for each of our property casualty segments. That's a tribute to the excellent way our agencies conduct business as well as to how our underwriters do their jobs.
Policy retention rates for both personal and commercial lines were generally consistent with a year ago. For commercial lines, our policy retention continues near the high end of the mid-80% range. And for personal lines, we continued in the low to mid-90% range. Our long-term growth strategy includes appointing agencies in areas where we are underrepresented, taking care to preserve relationships with established agencies and the franchise-like benefit they value.
In 2015, we appointed 114 new independent agencies. Similar to recent years, in 2016, we plan to appoint approximately 100 additional agencies that will offer most or all of our property casualty insurance products. We also plan to appoint other agencies that focus on high net worth personal lines clients.
In 2016, we are targeting approximately $25 million in high net worth new business written premiums. That includes premiums from our Executive Capstone suite of insurance products and services. We continue to earn new business through our agencies in part through new products and services like our high net worth expansion initiative. For full year 2015, each of our property casualty segments reported an increase in production of new business written premiums.
One of the bright spots was the increase in high net worth new business. While its contribution was a relatively small amount of overall 2015 new business increase, its growth rate was approximately double the rest of the personal lines operations.
The launch of Executive Capstone and prudent expansion of our reinsurance-assumed operation provides additional confidence in our abilities to continue to diversify and profitably grow premiums in an increasingly tough operating environment.
For renewal business in the fourth quarter, overall average renewal price increases were similar to the third quarter. Average renewal price increases for commercial lines continued at percentages in the low-single-digit range. That average includes the muting effect of 3-year policies that were not yet subject to renewal during the fourth quarter.
For commercial property and commercial auto policies that did renew during the fourth quarter, we continue to obtain meaningful price increases with property averaging in the mid-single-digit range and auto averaging near the high end of the low single-digit range.
Our most profitable line of business in recent quarters, workers' compensation, averaged negative renewal price changes during the fourth quarter. While the average pricing change may have turned negative, we continue to price on a policy-by-policy basis. Certain policies that we determine needed a price increase received it. Approximately half of our workers' compensation 2015 renewal premiums were for policies with price increases.
Our personal auto policies averaged renewal price increases in the mid-single-digit range, while homeowner policies averaged a low-single-digit range, down from the third quarter. For our excess and surplus line segments, fourth quarter 2015 average renewal price increases were near the high end of the low-single-digit range, down slightly from the third quarter measure.
Our Life Insurance subsidiary again grew term life insurance premiums; its largest product line. This business supports account retention for our agents and provide steady contributions to our earnings as it has less correlation to the weather than our property casualty business. 
On January 1 of this year, we again renewed all of our primary property casualty treaties that transferred part of our risk to reinsurers. For both our per risk treaties and our property catastrophe treaty, terms and conditions for 2016 are similar to 2015. While we did receive some modest rate reductions, we expect the amount of seasoned premium for both years to be similar because our direct written premiums subject to those treaties are growing.
In conclusion, our primary measure of long-term financial performance: The value creation ratio was 3.4% for full year 2015. The contribution from operating income was the highest it's been in the past 5 years. However, VCR total was below our range due to a decline in securities market value.
For 2016 and beyond, we'll stay focused on areas where we have more influence, underwriting profitability and growth. Our insurance business remains in excellent shape. We are as confident as ever in our associates, in the relationships we build with independent agencies and in the ongoing benefits of our strategic initiatives that aim to continually improve performance.
I'll now ask our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell, to comment on investments and other important aspects of our recent financial performance."
260681,321310419,927065,"Cincinnati Financial Corp., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 04, 2016",2016-02-04,"Earnings Calls","Cincinnati Financial Corporation","Executives","Great. Thank you, Steve, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. I'll start with some analysis of investment results. Investment income growth for the fourth quarter 2015 was especially strong at 7%, boosting the full year result to just over 4%. F",1028,"Great. Thank you, Steve, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. I'll start with some analysis of investment results. Investment income growth for the fourth quarter 2015 was especially strong at 7%, boosting the full year result to just over 4%. Fourth quarter dividend income was up 14%. Dividend amounts in the last quarter of the year tend to be the most variable, as some entities return capital or pay special dividends near the end of the calendar year.
Interest income rose 4% in the fourth quarter and 3% for the year as we continue to invest the majority of annual net operating cash flow in our bond portfolio.
Other-than-temporary impairments to securities and our stock and bond portfolios totaled more than a typical quarter at $40 million. Most of that related to energy stocks affected by declining oil prices. Securities market trends took a toll on the valuation of our investments during 2015. The company has experienced that before and we've maintained our current proven investment approach for over 5 decades and we have no plans to change it.
Our stock portfolio valuation rebounded nicely in the fourth quarter, but its year-end 2015 fair value was 3% below where it began the year. The stock market's rocky ride so far in 2016 has been well publicized, but we choose to keep our focus on long-term investment strategy and performance.
Fair value of our bond portfolio rose 2% for the year despite a significant drop in unrealized gains due to rising interest rates. That drop was offset by net purchases of additional bonds for the portfolio as its amortized cost was up almost 5%.
In terms of bond portfolio yields, we reported a fourth quarter 2015 pretax average yield of 4.66%, 6 basis points lower than a year ago. That measure on a full year basis also declined by 6 basis points.
Taxable bonds purchased during the fourth quarter had an average pretax yield of 4.34%, while tax-exempt bonds purchased averaged 3.36%. Our bond portfolio's effective duration at the end of 2015 was 4.7 years, up from 4.4 years at year-end 2014. That increase was due primarily to the impact from rising interest rates on our callable bonds and does not represent a change in strategy.
Cash flow from operating activities continues to help us grow investment income. Funds generated from net operating cash flows for the year 2015 were up 22% to just over $1 billion, contributing to the $631 million of net purchases of securities for our investment portfolio.
Turning to property casualty underwriting results. I'll first comment on 2 typical items. Number one, careful expense management is still one of our top priorities and is balanced with strategically investing in several parts of our business. That approach, combined with premium growth, resulted in a slight increase of 0.3 percentage points for our full year 2015 underwriting expense ratio, bringing it to 30.9%. That increase was largely due to investments to support our expansion of high net worth personal lines markets.
Number two, the primary measures pertaining to our reserves for losses and loss expenses continued to fairly -- continued in a fairly steady pattern as we continued to follow a consistent approach. We have now experienced 27 consecutive years of overall favorable reserve development. Full year 2015 favorable reserve development on prior accident years benefited our combined ratio by 4.3 percentage points. That was better than the 2.4 points for 2014 when we strengthened commercial casualty reserves. But the 4.3 points was consistent with the 4.1 points we reported for the year 2013.
Other than commercial and personal auto, each of our major lines of businesses developed favorably in 2015. We continue to take underwriting and pricing actions to improve our auto results and maintain what we believe is a prudent level of reserves.
Our full year 2015 net favorable development was again spread over several accident years, including 33% for accident year 2014, 22% for accident year 2013, 26% for accident year 2012 and 19% for all older accident years in aggregate.
Consistent with past years, we continue to aim for reserves reported on our balance sheet to be at levels reflecting net amounts well into the upper half of the actuarially estimated range of net loss and loss expense reserves. Our consolidated property casualty gross and net carried reserves rose 5% during 2015. 
I also want to highlight the $33 million of fourth quarter 2015 net written premiums we reported for our reinsurance-assumed operation known as Cincinnati Re. At the end of the year, 7 diverse treaties were in effect. We are recording written premiums in the period treaties become effective and will follow the common practice of estimating assumed premium amounts for each treaty's term based on current information. Premiums will be earned over the coverage period on a pro rata basis, similar to our other property casualty policies. Net of applicable retrocessions Cincinnati Re's 2015 net earned premiums totaled $10 million.
One capital management item I'll touch on is additional share repurchases during the fourth quarter of 2015. Shares repurchased during the quarter totaled 200,000 shares at an average price per share of $60.11. That brought the full year 2015 share repurchases to a total of 1 million shares at an average price per share of $53.08.
As usual, I'll conclude my prepared comments by summarizing the contributions during the fourth quarter to book value per share. Property casualty underwriting increased book value by $0.57; life insurance operations added $0.06; investment income, other than life insurance and reduced by noninsurance items, contributed $0.47; the change in unrealized gains at December 31 for the fixed income portfolio net of realized gains and losses decreased book value per share by $0.45; the change in unrealized gains at December 31 for the equity portfolio net of realized gains and losses increased book value by $0.70; and we declared $0.92 per share in dividends to shareholders with half of that representing a special dividend. The net effect was a book value increase of $0.43 during the fourth quarter to $39.20 per share.
And now I'll turn the call back over to Steve."

In concluding our prepared remarks, I want to acknowledge the fourth quarter ratings upgrade by A.M. Best for our excess and surplus line subsidiary; the Cincinnati Specialty Underwriters insurance company, also known as CSU. With that upgrade, A.M. Best rates CSU's financial strength with a rating of A+ superior. Performance of our EMF company has been outstanding. For the past 2 years, its combined ratio has been under 80%, while it has maintained double-digit premium growth. We salute our CSU team and the agents who bring us excess and surplus lines business.
Also in the fourth quarter, A.M. Best affirmed their strong ratings on our standard market property casualty and life insurance companies. With all of our operating segments delivering another year of strong performance, we remain confident that we can deliver long-term shareholder value for years to come.
The Board of Directors demonstrated that they share that confidence by recently increasing the quarterly cash dividend to $0.48 per share, setting the stage for 56 consecutive years of shareholder dividend increases by your company.
We appreciate this opportunity to respond to your questions, and also look forward to meeting in person with many of you during the remainder of the year. 
As a reminder, with Mike and me today are Jack Schiff Jr., Ken Stecher, J.F. Scherer, Eric Mathews, Marty Mullen and Marty Hollenbeck. Sally, please open the call for questions."

They also understand, and they hear from other carriers, that segmentation is the key here. Is that there's still policy holders out there that deserve and, in our book of business, are getting rate increases. So I guess I would characterize, Mark, place is not out of control. There's a few war stories that come through that there are some surprising things going on. Clearly, everyone's results are good. Everyone wants to increase shelf space in agencies. A lot of agencies would be discussing to prospective clients, saying that you should expect a price decrease. But I guess I've come away from these last 3 sales meetings feeling pretty good about stability. Our 3-year policy in a marketplace like this, in any marketplace, really, but in this marketplace, plays out well. There's a lot of policyholders that are appreciative of the consistency of our approach with them. Their policies aren't renewing this year just because there may be some chatter out there about rate decreases doesn't mean they want to go through the process of completely reevaluating their insurance program. 
So clearly there's going to be a fair amount of competition out there. We are seeing in the excess and surplus lines areas a little bit of a pickup of E&S business going back to the standard market which is pretty typical for this type of phase of the marketplace. So maybe that's a little more than you're asking for but that kind of gives you a little bit of flavor we're experiencing."

In New Jersey, which we will open in March, we've had quite a few agencies calling us interested in representing Cincinnati Insurance Company.

We are pleased to report another strong quarter of operating performance. We continue to see ongoing benefits from executing our agency-centered strategy and working to enhance performance through various initiatives.
Underwriting and pricing on a policy-by-policy basis, which requires strong cooperation between our underwriting staff and the local independent agents who represent us, made a solid contribution to our excellent first quarter 2016 results.
Our consolidated property casualty combined ratio of 91.4% represented a 6.1 percentage point improvement over last year's first quarter.
The combined ratio before catastrophe effects, was 88.3%, 5.1 points better than the first quarter of 2015 and consistent with full year 2015. 
Each of our segments grew profitably. The performance of our 2 auto lines of business needs to improve, and we remain confident that all of the actions we are taking, including first quarter 2016 average price increases that were higher than in the fourth quarter of last year, will improve results.
Premium growth continues to be a bright spot as we work to earn quality new business from local independent agencies and expand our reinsurance assumed operation known as Cincinnati Re.
We remain focused on same discipline as we grow profitably that business in the midst of the challenging reinsurance market.
So far, we've reported an underwriting profit for Cincinnati Re for each quarter since we commenced business.
Commercial lines premium growth remains healthy in a very competitive marketplace, with net [indiscernible] premiums up 6% over the same quarter a year ago. Strong personal lines growth was enhanced by steady increases in the personal lines products and services we offer to our agencies' higher net worth clients.
Almost all of the first quarter 2016 increase in personal lines new business with improvements came from high net worth policies. 
While we increased our focus on high net worth personal insurance beginning in 2014, we have written high net worth clients for many years. In fact, prior to 2014, approximately 10% of our homeowners premium was already derived from higher net worth policies. However we knew that to integrate this area profitably, we needed to have the right talent. The associates we've hired to lead this expansion are highly experienced, having averaged more than 20 years of experience in the high net worth marketplace.
They understand its unique requirements for inspection of risks, coverage valuation and specialized claim service.
Those leaders, in turn, have trained staff who can deliver enhanced services and quality underwriting, including local face-to-face interaction with agents and policyholders. 
During the first quarter, we launched our Executive Capstone suite of high net worth insurance products in New Jersey and things continue to go well with the agencies we have appointed in New York City and nearby areas.
Turning to renewals of property casualty properties in the first quarter of 2016, we are pleased with the average price increases that were generally in line with the fourth quarter of 2015. Average renewal price increases for commercial lines continue at percentages in the low single range.  That average includes the muting effect of 3-year policies that were not yet subject to renewal during the first quarter.
For commercial property and commercial auto policies that did renew during the first quarter, we continue to obtain meaningful price increases, both averaging in the mid-single-digit range. Our most profitable commercial lines of business in recent quarters, commercial casualty and Worker's Compensation, had price changes similar to a quarter ago. Commercial casualty averaged first quarter increases in the low single digit range, while workers' compensation average decreases in the low single-digit range.
Our personal auto policies averaged first quarter renewal price percentage increases in the mid-single digit range and the average for our homeowners policies was also in that range.
For our excess and surplus lines segment, each first quarter 2016 average renewal price percentage increases remain near the high end of the low single-digit range. That segment experienced another outstanding quarter, including a combined ratio below 70%.
Our life insurance subsidiary, including income from its investment portfolio, also had a strong quarter of performance. Term premiums rose 9% and operating profit was 25% higher than the first quarter of 2015.
Our primary measure of financial performance, the value creation ratio, came in at 5.7%. Generally how evaluations and securities markets boosted the contribution of our strong operating performance, setting a good pace to reaching our goal of an average annual VCR of 10% to 13%.
While we are pleased with the recent good performance, we remain keenly focused on underwriting profitability and growth. We are very confident in company associates and the agencies they partner with as we seek to continually improve performance. 
I'll now ask, our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell, to share his highlights for other areas of our financial performance."

It was a great quarter for investments, in part because we reported our 11th consecutive quarter of year-over-year investment income growth, with an increase of 4%.
We also had increases in the fair value in unrealized gain positions of both our equity and bond portfolios and ended the first quarter of 2016 with a net unrealized gain of more than $2.3 billion before taxes, including over $1.9 billion for our common stock portfolio.
Our bond portfolio, interest income again rose despite declining average yields, in part due to the first quarter 2016 net purchases. The bond portfolio's pretax average yield reported a 4.65% was 5 basis points lower than a year ago.
Taxable bonds purchased during the first quarter had an average pretax yield of 4.77%, 43 basis points higher than what we experienced a year ago. Tax exempt bonds purchased average 3.03%, 10 basis points lower than a year ago.
Our bond portfolio's effective duration of March 31 was 4.8 years, up slightly from 4.7 years at year-end.
Cash flow from operating activities continue to fuel investment income growth. Funds generated from net operating cash flows for the first 3 months of 2016 rose 20% compared to a year ago to $257 million and help generate $111 million of net purchases of securities for investment portfolio.
As always, we work carefully to manage our expenses. At the same time, strategically investing in our business. Our first quarter 2016 property casualty underwriting expense ratio improved slightly compared with a year ago. 
Our loss reserves experienced another quarter of consistency, both in our approach to setting overall reserves and in favorable reserve development on prior accident years. For the first quarter of 2016, favorable reserve development benefited our combined ratio by 5.6 percentage points, better than the 2.2 points for the first quarter of last year and more in line with the 5.0 points for the last 3 quarters of 2015.
Reserve development so far in 2016 had a good spread, over most of our major lines of businesses and over recent accident years, including 63% for accident year 2015 and 27% for accident year 2014.
Overall, reserves, including accident year 2016 rose $99 million in the first quarter, including $95 million for the IBNR portion.  Even with that prudent increase in IBNR reserves, our first quarter underwriting results were very good as the combined ratio nearly matched the 91.1% full year 2015 ratio.
We remained in excellent shape regarding our capital strength, liquidity and financial flexibility. Cash and marketable securities for our parent company at the end of the quarter totaled just over $1.9 billion, up 9% from year end. Our capital is well-positioned to support future profitable growth of our insurance operations and other capital management actions, such as returning capital to shareholders.
As they usually do, I'll conclude my prepared remarks with a summary of the contributions during the first quarter to book value per share. They represent the main drivers of our value creation ratio. 
Property casualty underwriting increased book value by $0.38. Life insurance operations added $0.06. Investment income, other than life insurance and reduced by noninsurance items, contributed $0.41. The change in unrealized gains at March 31 for the fixed income portfolio, net of realized gains and losses, increased book value per share by $0.46. The change in unrealized gains at March 31 for the equity portfolio, net of realized gains and losses, increased book value by $0.93. And we declared $0.48 per share in dividends to shareholders.  The net effect was a book value increase of $1.76 during the first quarter, to a record $40.96 per share. 
And now I'll turn the call back over to Steve."

So I think this next 6, 12 months, you'd probably see us more or less in there. I think equity allocation is going to hover in that low to mid-30s range for a while here.

As you saw, the net written premiums were up 7% for the quarter to $45 million and the combined ratio doing well with the prior year development and so forth. But we used a consistent approach to setting those reserves in the recent years. Although we lack many years of paid loss data and with a high growth rates in insured exposures, which, of course, is reflected in the premium growth, increases, the uncertainty of the estimated ultimate losses. And so we tended to be conservative while setting those E&S reserves because we don't have that long history but we are getting there. So the current process, what I can tell you, is consistent with the prior year. And time will tell, but we aim to be consistent with our process and we think we're on the right path there."

And so on the personal line site, we did have $18 million of favorable development between the personal and homeowners, which is primarily where it was at. Personal auto, it was $9 million, homeowners was $8 million. First, what I'll start off is to say we do follow a steady and consistent methodology in saving the reserves. And we do look at that process every reporting period. So from time-to-time, we make refinements to better estimate for changing times, trends, cost indicators, efforts applied, et cetera. And so as we stated in our 10-Q, we did made a refinement during the quarter, to our expense reserves, which is also known as AOE, which are an estimate for the cost related to our Claims Department associates as they settle claims. And so that estimate includes assumptions of really varying labor intensity by type of claims or line of business. So this refinement, mentioned, it moved AOE reserves among all the lines of businesses that we have. But in total, it had a 0 effect amongst all the lines for the company in total. So on a given line, like personal lines auto, you can actually see the refinement a little bit better. So all of the $9 million favorable development in the personal lines auto was really related to this refinement, while there was virtually little to really no effect to be seen on the personal lines homeowners. So had we not reflected this refinement personal lines auto prior to development, really been nearly flat or about $1 million adverse. So when you put all that together, it is a -- there was a little something special in there, but we are constantly looking at our processes, how we settle reserves from time to time. We do have refinements. And so you're seeing a little bit of that in the personal lines that you may or may not be able to see refinements in the future but they do occur. So I'm sorry for the long answer, but I hope that got to the basis of your question."

We could be happier with the improvement in our loss ratio and the services that we're offering. It's just the -- a line of business that just requires a lot of cautiousness in our opinion."

There are some competitors in the margin that are kind of distinguished themselves as being out there. But anecdotally, the feedback we've got it from both agents and mentioned before field underwriters, is that it's a competitive market. But it's stable and the field reps have felt very comfortable that we've got good submission flow. And we have to pick our way through things. I think the concern that are out there at the agency level is that there is competition. So there are probably are more accounts there that are being shopped. Just to protect and make certain that they're comfortable with the pricing. One of the areas that we're pleased about is our 3-year policy strategy. That keeps cash because of the commitment we make to policyholders and with that -- with a 3-year guarantee, we think fewer of our policies are shopped through soft markets and hard markets, but particularly right now it's attractive from our standpoint. The one area that I would mention that we are seeing conspicuous amount of competition will be in the E&S side. We have a fairly conservative underwriting appetite in E&S. I Guess it's fair to say that we might be a little bit on the margin between standard and nonstandard. And a lot of the business that we write. But we are seeing more larger E&S accounts that are being taken into the standard site. And so -- that's probably a little bit of why the growth rate wasn't as robust it has been in the past because we have seen some larger accounts leave us. And so, once those standard market carrier is willing to take the account, there's no amount of pricing that we can apply if we wanted to, to retain it."

We are pleased to report another strong quarter of operating performance. We continue to see ongoing benefits from executing our agency-centered strategy and working to enhance performance through various initiatives.
Underwriting and pricing on a policy-by-policy basis, which requires strong cooperation between our underwriting staff and the local independent agents who represent us, made a solid contribution to our excellent first quarter 2016 results. Our consolidated property casualty combined ratio of 91.4% represented a 6.1 percentage point improvement over last year's first quarter. The combined ratio before catastrophe effects, was 88.3%, 5.1 points better than the first quarter of 2015 and consistent with full year 2015. 
Each of our segments grew profitably. The performance of our 2 auto lines of business needs to improve, and we remain confident that all of the actions we are taking, including first quarter 2016 average price increases that were higher than in the fourth quarter of last year, will improve results.
Premium growth continues to be a bright spot as we work to earn quality new business from local independent agencies and expand our reinsurance assumed operation known as Cincinnati Re.
We remain focused on staying disciplined as we grow profitably that business in the midst of a challenging reinsurance market. So far, we've reported an underwriting profit for Cincinnati Re for each quarter since it commenced business.
Commercial line's premium growth remains healthy in a very competitive marketplace with net written premiums up 6% over the same quarter a year ago. Strong personal lines growth was enhanced by steady increases in the personal lines products and services we offer to our agencies' higher net worth clients. Almost all of the first quarter 2016 increase in personal line's new business written premiums came from high net worth policies. 
While we increased our focus on high net worth personal insurance beginning in 2014, we have written high net worth clients for many years. In fact, prior to 2014, approximately 10% of our homeowners premium was already derived from higher net worth policies. However, we knew that to really grow this area profitably, we needed to have the right talent. The associates we've hired to lead this expansion are highly experienced, having averaged more than 20 years of experience in the high net worth marketplace. They understand its unique requirements for inspection of risks, coverage valuation and specialized claim service. Those leaders, in turn, have trained staff who can deliver enhanced services and quality underwriting, including local face-to-face interaction with agents and policyholders. 
During the first quarter, we launched our Executive Capstone suite of high net worth insurance products in New Jersey and things continue to go well with the agencies we have appointed in New York City and nearby areas [ph] .
Turning to renewals of property casualty properties in the first quarter of 2016, we are pleased with average price increases that were generally in line with the fourth quarter of 2015. Average renewal price increases for commercial lines continued at percentages in the low single-digit range. That average includes the muting effect of 3-year policies that were not yet subject to renewal during the first quarter.
For commercial property and commercial auto policies that did renew during the first quarter, we continue to obtain meaningful price increases, both averaging in the mid-single-digit range. Our most profitable commercial lines of business in recent quarters, commercial casualty and workers' compensation, had price changes similar to a quarter ago. Commercial casualty averaged first quarter increases in the low single-digit range while workers' compensation averaged decreases in the low single-digit range.
Our personal auto policies averaged first quarter renewal price percentage increases in the mid-single-digit range, and the average for our homeowners policies was also in that range.
For our excess and surplus lines segment, each first quarter 2016 average renewal price percentage increases remain near the high end of the low single-digit range. That segment experienced another outstanding quarter, including a combined ratio below 70%.
Our life insurance subsidiary, including income from its investment portfolio, also had a strong quarter of performance. Earned premiums rose 9%, and operating profit was 25% higher than the first quarter of 2015.
Our primary measure of financial performance, the value creation ratio, came in at 5.7%. Generally higher valuations in securities markets boosted the contribution of our strong operating performance, setting a good pace for reaching our goal of an average annual VCR of 10% to 13%.
While we're pleased with the recent good performance, we remain keenly focused on underwriting profitability and growth. We are very confident in company associates and the agencies they partner with as we seek to continually improve performance. 
I'll now ask our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell, to share his highlights for other areas of our financial performance."

It was a great quarter for investments, in part because we reported our 11th consecutive quarter of year-over-year investment income growth with an increase of 4%. We also had increases in the fair value in unrealized gain positions of both our equity and bond portfolios and ended the first quarter of 2016 with a net unrealized gain of more than $2.3 billion before taxes, including over $1.9 billion for our common stock portfolio.
Our bond portfolio, interest income again rose despite declining average yields, in part due to the first quarter 2016 net purchases. The bond portfolio's pretax average yield, reported at 4.65%, was 5 basis points lower than a year ago.
Taxable bonds purchased during the first quarter had an average pretax yield of 4.77%, 43 basis points higher than what we experienced a year ago. Tax-exempt bonds purchased average 3.03%, 10 basis points lower than a year ago.
Our bond portfolio's effective duration of March 31 was 4.8 years, up slightly from 4.7 years at year-end.
Cash flow from operating activities continue to fuel investment income growth. Funds generated from net operating cash flows for the first 3 months of 2016 rose 20% compared to a year ago to $257 million and helped generate $111 million of net purchases of securities for our investment portfolio.
As always, we work carefully to manage our expenses, at the same time, strategically investing in our business. Our first quarter 2016 property casualty underwriting expense ratio improved slightly compared with a year ago. 
Our loss reserves experienced another quarter of consistency, both in our approach to setting overall reserves and in favorable reserve development on prior accident years. For the first quarter of 2016, favorable reserve development benefited our combined ratio by 5.6 percentage points, better than the 2.2 points for the first quarter of last year and more in line with the 5.0 points for the last 3 quarters of 2015.
Reserve development so far in 2016 had a good spread over most of our major lines of businesses and over recent accident years, including 63% for accident year 2015 and 27% for accident year 2014.
Overall reserves, including accident year 2016, rose $99 million in the first quarter, including $95 million for the IBNR portion. Even with that prudent increase in IBNR reserves, our first quarter underwriting results were very good as our combined ratio nearly matched the 91.1% full year 2015 ratio.
We remained in excellent shape regarding our capital strength, liquidity and financial flexibility. Cash and marketable securities for our parent company at the end of the quarter totaled just over $1.9 billion, up 9% from year-end. Our capital is well positioned to support future profitable growth of our insurance operations and other capital management actions, such as returning capital to shareholders.
As I usually do, I'll conclude my prepared remarks with a summary of the contributions during the first quarter to book value per share. They represent the main drivers of our value-creation ratio. 
Property casualty underwriting increased book value by $0.38. Life insurance operations added $0.06. Investment income, other than life insurance and reduced by noninsurance items, contributed $0.41. The change in unrealized gains at March 31 for the fixed income portfolio, net of realized gains and losses, increased book value per share by $0.46. The change in unrealized gains at March 31 for the equity portfolio, net of realized gains and losses, increased book value by $0.93. And we declared $0.48 per share in dividends to shareholders. The net effect was a book value increase of $1.76 during the first quarter to a record $40.96 per share. 
And now I'll turn the call back over to Steve."

So I'd say this next 6, 12 months, you'll probably see us more or less hold in there. I think equity allocation is going to hover in that low to mid-30s range for a while here.

As you saw, the net written premiums were up 7% for the quarter to $45 million, the combined ratio doing well with the prior year development and so forth. But we've used a consistent approach to setting those reserves in the recent years. Although we lack many years of paid loss data and with the high growth rates in insured exposures, which, of course, is reflected in the premium growth, increases the uncertainty of the estimated ultimate losses. And so we tended to be conservative while setting those E&S reserves because we don't have that long history, but we're getting there. So the current process, what I can tell you, is consistent with the prior year. And time will tell, but we aim to be consistent with our process, and we think we're on the right path there."

She wrote personal lines in the East Coast, and she said, without a doubt, without hesitation that our diamond personal line system was highly efficient, allowed them to do business efficiently. So I think that infrastructure is a plus. Also our expense ratio for personal lines came in the quarter at 29.2%, so I think that bodes well for us.

So on the personal line side, we did have $18 million of favorable development between the personal and homeowners, which is primarily where it was at. Personal auto, it was $9 million, homeowners was $8 million. First, what I'll start off with is to say, again, we do follow a steady and consistent methodology in saving the reserves. And we do look at that process every reporting period. So from time-to-time, we make refinements to better the estimate for changing times, trends, cost indicators, efforts applied, et cetera. And so as we stated in our 10-Q, we did -- made a refinement during the quarter to our expense reserves, which is also known as AOE, which are an estimate for the costs related to our Claims Department associates as they settle claims. And so that estimate includes assumptions of, really, varying labor intensity by type of claims or line of business. So this refinement, while mentioned, is it moved AOE reserves among all the lines of businesses that we have. But in total, it had a 0 effect amongst all the lines for the company in total. So on a given line, like personal lines auto, you can actually see the refinement a little bit better. So all of the $9 million favorable development in the personal lines auto was really related to this refinement, while there was virtually little to really no effect to be seen on the personal lines homeowners. So had we not reflected this refinement personal lines auto prior year development, really would have been nearly flat or about $1 million adverse. So when you put all that together, it is a -- there was a little something special in there, but we are constantly looking at our processes, how we settle reserves from time to time. We do have refinements. And so you're seeing a little bit of that in the personal lines that you may or may not be able to see refinements in the future, but they do occur. So I hope -- sorry for the long answer, but I hope that got to the basis of your question."

There are some competitors on the margin that are -- they kind of distinguish themselves as being out there. But anecdotally, the feedback we've gotten from both agents and, like I mentioned before, our field underwriters, is that it's a competitive market. But it's stable, and the field reps have felt very comfortable that we've got good submission flow and that we have to pick our way through things. I think the concerns that are out there at the agency level is that there is competition. So there are probably are more accounts that are being shopped. Just to protect, make certain that they're comfortable with the pricing. One of the areas that we're pleased about is our 3-year policy strategy. That keeps -- because of the commitment we make to policyholders and with that -- with the 3-year guarantees, we think fewer of our policies are shopped through soft markets and hard markets but, particularly right now, it's attractive from our standpoint. The one area that I would mention that we are seeing a conspicuous amount of competition would be in the E&S side. We have a fairly conservative underwriting appetite in E&S. So I guess it's fair to say that we might be a little bit on the margin between standard and nonstandard in a lot of the business that we write. But we are seeing more larger E&S accounts that are being taken into the standard side. And so -- and that's probably a little bit of why the E&S growth rate wasn't as robust as it has been in the past is that we have seen some larger accounts leave us. And so, and once the standard market carrier is willing to take the account, there's no amount of pricing that we can apply, if we wanted to, to retain it."

We are pleased to report another strong quarter of operating performance. We continue to see ongoing benefits from executing our agency-centered strategy and working to enhance performance through various initiatives.
Underwriting and pricing on a policy-by-policy basis, which requires strong cooperation between our underwriting staff and the local independent agents who represent us, made a solid contribution to our excellent first quarter 2016 results. Our consolidated property casualty combined ratio of 91.4% represented a 6.1 percentage point improvement over last year's first quarter. The combined ratio before catastrophe effects, was 88.3%, 5.1 points better than the first quarter of 2015 and consistent with full year 2015. 
Each of our segments grew profitably. The performance of our 2 auto lines of business needs to improve, and we remain confident that all of the actions we are taking, including first quarter 2016 average price increases that were higher than in the fourth quarter of last year, will improve results.
Premium growth continues to be a bright spot as we work to earn quality new business from local independent agencies and expand our reinsurance assumed operation, known as Cincinnati Re.
We remain focused on staying disciplined as we grow profitably that business in the midst of a challenging reinsurance market. So far, we've reported an underwriting profit for Cincinnati Re each quarter since it commenced business.
Commercial line's premium growth remains healthy in a very competitive marketplace, with net written premiums up 6% over the same quarter a year ago. Strong personal lines growth was enhanced by steady increases in the personal lines products and services we offer to our agencies' higher net worth clients. Almost all of the first quarter 2016 increase in personal line's new business written premiums came from high net worth policies. 
While we increased our focus on high net worth personal insurance beginning in 2014, we have written high net worth clients for many years. In fact, prior to 2014, approximately 10% of our homeowners premium was already derived from higher net worth policies. However, we knew that to really grow this area profitably, we needed to have the right talent. The associates we've hired to lead this expansion are highly experienced, having averaged more than 20 years of experience in the high net worth marketplace. They understand its unique requirements for inspection of risks, coverage valuation and specialized claim service. Those leaders, in turn, have trained staff who can deliver enhanced services and quality underwriting, including local face-to-face interaction with agents and policyholders. 
During the first quarter, we launched our Executive Capstone suite of high net worth insurance products in New Jersey and things continue to go well with the agencies we have appointed in New York City and nearby areas.
Turning to renewals of property casualty policies in the first quarter of 2016, we are pleased with average price increases that were generally in line with the fourth quarter of 2015. Average renewal price increases for commercial lines continued at percentages in the low single-digit range. That average includes the muting effect of 3-year policies that were not yet subject to renewal during the first quarter.
For commercial property and commercial auto policies that did renew during the first quarter, we continue to obtain meaningful price increases, both averaging in the mid-single-digit range. Our most profitable commercial lines of business in recent quarters, commercial casualty and workers' compensation, had price changes similar to a quarter ago. Commercial casualty averaged first quarter increases in the low single-digit range while workers' compensation averaged decreases in the low single-digit range.
Our personal auto policies averaged first quarter renewal price percentage increases in the mid-single-digit range, and the average for our homeowners policies was also in that range.
For our excess and surplus lines segment, each first quarter 2016 average renewal price percentage increases remain near the high end of the low single-digit range. That segment experienced another outstanding quarter, including a combined ratio below 70%.
Our life insurance subsidiary, including income from its investment portfolio, also had a strong quarter of performance. Earned premiums rose 9%, and operating profit was 25% higher than the first quarter of 2015.
Our primary measure of financial performance, the value creation ratio, came in at 5.7%. Generally higher valuations in securities markets boosted the contribution of our strong operating performance, setting a good pace for reaching our goal of an average annual VCR of 10% to 13%.
While we're pleased with the recent good performance, we remain keenly focused on underwriting profitability and growth. We are very confident in company associates and the agencies they partner with as we seek to continually improve performance. 
I'll now ask our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell, to share his highlights for other areas of our financial performance."

Our bond portfolio interest income again rose despite declining average yields, in part due to the first quarter 2016 net purchases. The bond portfolio's pretax average yield, reported at 4.65%, was 5 basis points lower than a year ago.
Taxable bonds purchased during the first quarter had an average pretax yield of 4.77%, 43 basis points higher than what we experienced a year ago. Tax-exempt bonds purchased average 3.03%, 10 basis points lower than a year ago.
Our bond portfolio's effective duration of March 31 was 4.8 years, up slightly from 4.7 years at year-end.
Cash flow from operating activities continued to fuel investment income growth. Funds generated from net operating cash flows for the first 3 months of 2016 rose 20% compared to a year ago to $257 million and helped generate $111 million of net purchases of securities for our investment portfolio.
As always, we work carefully to manage our expenses, at the same time, strategically investing in our business. Our first quarter 2016 property casualty underwriting expense ratio improved slightly compared with a year ago. 
Our loss reserves experienced another quarter of consistency, both in our approach to setting overall reserves and in favorable reserve development on prior accident years. For the first quarter of 2016, favorable reserve development benefited our combined ratio by 5.6 percentage points, better than the 2.2 points for the first quarter of last year and more in line with the 5.0 points for the last 3 quarters of 2015.
Reserve development so far in 2016 had a good spread over most of our major lines of businesses and over recent accident years, including 63% for accident year 2015 and 27% for accident year 2014.
Overall reserves, including accident year 2016, rose $99 million in the first quarter, including $95 million for the IBNR portion. Even with that prudent increase in IBNR reserves, our first quarter underwriting results were very good as our combined ratio nearly matched the 91.1% full year 2015 ratio.
We remain in excellent shape regarding our capital strength, liquidity and financial flexibility. Cash and marketable securities for our parent company at the end of the quarter totaled just over $1.9 billion, up 9% from year-end. Our capital is well positioned to support future profitable growth of our insurance operations and other capital management actions, such as returning capital to shareholders.
As I usually do, I'll conclude my prepared remarks with a summary of the contributions during the first quarter to book value per share. They represent the main drivers of our value-creation ratio. 
Property casualty underwriting increased book value by $0.38. Life insurance operations added $0.06. Investment income, other than life insurance and reduced by noninsurance items, contributed $0.41. The change in unrealized gains at March 31 for the fixed income portfolio, net of realized gains and losses, increased book value per share by $0.46. The change in unrealized gains at March 31 for the equity portfolio, net of realized gains and losses, increased book value by $0.93. And we declared $0.48 per share in dividends to shareholders. The net effect was a book value increase of $1.76 during the first quarter to a record $40.96 per share. 
And now I'll turn the call back over to Steve."

So I'd say this next 6 to 12 months, you'll probably see us more or less hold in there. I think equity allocation is going to hover in that low to mid-30s range for a while here.

As you saw, the net written premiums were up 7% for the quarter to $45 million, the combined ratio doing well with the prior year development and so forth. But we've used a consistent approach to setting those reserves in the recent years. Although we lack many years of paid loss data and with the high growth rates in insured exposures, which, of course, is reflected in the premium growth, increases the uncertainty of the estimated ultimate losses. And so we tended to be conservative while setting those E&S reserves because we don't have that long history, but we're getting there. So the current process, what I can tell you, is consistent with the prior year. And time will tell, but we aim to be consistent with our process, and we think we're on the right path there."

So on the personal line side, we did have $18 million of favorable development between the personal and homeowners, which is primarily where it was at. The personal auto was $9 million. The homeowners was $8 million. First, what I'll start off with is to say, again, we do follow a steady and consistent methodology in setting the reserves. And we do look at that process every reporting period. So from time to time, we make refinements to better the estimates for changing times, trends, cost indicators, efforts applied, et cetera. And so as we stated in our 10-Q, we did need a refinement during the quarter to our expense reserves, which is also known as AOE, which are an estimate for the costs related to our Claims Department associates as they settle claims. And so that estimate includes assumptions of, really, varying labor intensity by type of claims or line of business. So this refinement, while mentioned, is it moved AOE reserves among all the lines of businesses that we have, but in total, it had a 0 effect amongst all the lines for the company in total. So on a given line, like personal lines auto, you can actually see the refinement a little bit better. So all of the $9 million favorable development in the personal lines auto was really related to this refinement, while there was virtually little to really no effect to be seen on the personal lines homeowners. So had we not reflected this refinement personal lines auto prior year development, really would have been nearly flat or about $1 million adverse. So when you put all that together, it is a -- there was a little something special in there, but we are constantly looking at our processes, how we set our reserves. From time to time, we do have refinements. And so you're seeing a little bit of that in the personal lines that you may or may not be able to see, refinements in the future, but they do occur. So I hope -- sorry for the long answer, but I hope that got to the basis of your question."

So when we're writing the package, the auto, the umbrella and we're comfortable based on underwriting that we'd like to write the comp and then we'll go after it. We're -- but I would say you would never describe us as an aggressive player in comp, notwithstanding the fact that it's going well for us. We couldn't be happier with the improvement in our loss ratio and the services that we're offering. It's just the -- a line of business that just requires a lot of cautiousness, in our opinion."

There are some competitors on the margin that are -- they kind of distinguish themselves as being out there. But anecdotally, the feedback we've gotten from both agents and, like I mentioned before, our field underwriters, is that it's a competitive market. But it's stable, and the field reps have felt very comfortable that we've got good submission flow and that we have to pick our way through things. I think the concerns that are out there at the agency level is that there is competition. So there probably are more accounts that are being shopped just to protect and make certain that they're comfortable with the pricing. One of the areas that we're pleased about is our 3-year policy strategy. That keeps -- because of the commitment we make to policyholders and with that -- with the 3-year guarantees, we think fewer of our policies are shopped through soft markets and hard markets but, particularly right now, it's attractive from our standpoint. The one area that I would mention that we are seeing a conspicuous amount of competition would be in the E&S side. We have a fairly conservative underwriting appetite in E&S. So I guess it's fair to say that we might be a little bit on the margin between standard and nonstandard in a lot of the business that we write. But we are seeing more, larger E&S accounts that are being taken into the standard side. And so -- and that's probably a little bit of why the E&S growth rate wasn't as robust as it has been in the past, is that we have seen some larger accounts leave us. And so, and once the standard market carrier is willing to take the account, there's no amount of pricing that we can apply, if we wanted to, to retain it."

We are pleased to report another strong quarter of operating performance. We continue to see ongoing benefits from executing our agency-centered strategy and working to enhance performance through various initiatives.
Underwriting and pricing on a policy-by-policy basis, which requires strong cooperation between our underwriting staff and the local independent agents who represent us, made a solid contribution to our excellent first quarter 2016 results. Our consolidated property casualty combined ratio of 91.4% represented a 6.1 percentage point improvement over last year's first quarter. The combined ratio before catastrophe effects, was 88.3%, 5.1 points better than the first quarter of 2015 and consistent with full year 2015. 
Each of our segments grew profitably. The performance of our 2 auto lines of business needs to improve, and we remain confident that all of the actions we are taking, including first quarter 2016 average price increases that were higher than in the fourth quarter of last year, will improve results.
Premium growth continues to be a bright spot as we work to earn quality new business from local independent agencies and expand our reinsurance assumed operation, known as Cincinnati Re.
We remain focused on staying disciplined as we grow profitably that business in the midst of a challenging reinsurance market. So far, we've reported an underwriting profit for Cincinnati Re each quarter since it commenced business.
Commercial line's premium growth remains healthy in a very competitive marketplace, with net written premiums up 6% over the same quarter a year ago. Strong personal lines growth was enhanced by steady increases in the personal lines products and services we offer to our agencies' higher net worth clients. Almost all of the first quarter 2016 increase in personal line's new business written premiums came from high net worth policies. 
While we increased our focus on high net worth personal insurance beginning in 2014, we have written high net worth clients for many years. In fact, prior to 2014, approximately 10% of our homeowners premium was already derived from higher net worth policies. However, we knew that to really grow this area profitably, we needed to have the right talent. The associates we've hired to lead this expansion are highly experienced, having averaged more than 20 years of experience in the high net worth marketplace. They understand its unique requirements for inspection of risks, coverage valuation and specialized claim service. Those leaders, in turn, have trained staff who can deliver enhanced services and quality underwriting, including local face-to-face interaction with agents and policyholders. 
During the first quarter, we launched our Executive Capstone suite of high net worth insurance products in New Jersey and things continue to go well with the agencies we have appointed in New York City and nearby areas.
Turning to renewals of property casualty policies in the first quarter of 2016, we are pleased with average price increases that were generally in line with the fourth quarter of 2015. Average renewal price increases for commercial lines continued at percentages in the low single-digit range. That average includes the muting effect of 3-year policies that were not yet subject to renewal during the first quarter.
For commercial property and commercial auto policies that did renew during the first quarter, we continue to obtain meaningful price increases, both averaging in the mid-single-digit range. Our most profitable commercial lines of business in recent quarters, commercial casualty and workers' compensation, had price changes similar to a quarter ago. Commercial casualty averaged first quarter increases in the low single-digit range while workers' compensation averaged decreases in the low single-digit range.
Our personal auto policies averaged first quarter renewal price percentage increases in the mid-single-digit range, and the average for our homeowners policies was also in that range.
For our excess and surplus lines segment, each first quarter 2016 average renewal price percentage increases remain near the high end of the low single-digit range. That segment experienced another outstanding quarter, including a combined ratio below 70%.
Our life insurance subsidiary, including income from its investment portfolio, also had a strong quarter of performance. Earned premiums rose 9%, and operating profit was 25% higher than the first quarter of 2015.
Our primary measure of financial performance, the value creation ratio, came in at 5.7%. Generally higher valuations in securities markets boosted the contribution of our strong operating performance, setting a good pace for reaching our goal of an average annual VCR of 10% to 13%.
While we're pleased with the recent good performance, we remain keenly focused on underwriting profitability and growth. We are very confident in company associates and the agencies they partner with as we seek to continually improve performance. 
I'll now ask our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell, to share his highlights for other areas of our financial performance."

It was a great quarter for investments, in part because we reported our 11th consecutive quarter of year-",638,"Great. Thank you, Steve, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. I'll start with some key points about our first quarter investment results. 
It was a great quarter for investments, in part because we reported our 11th consecutive quarter of year-over-year investment income growth, with an increase of 4%. We also had increases in the fair value and unrealized gain positions of both our equity and bond portfolios and ended the first quarter of 2016 with a net unrealized gain of more than $2.3 billion before taxes, including over $1.9 billion for our common stock portfolio.
Our bond portfolio interest income again rose despite declining average yields, in part due to the first quarter 2016 net purchases. The bond portfolio's pretax average yield, reported at 4.65%, was 5 basis points lower than a year ago.
Taxable bonds purchased during the first quarter had an average pretax yield of 4.77%, 43 basis points higher than what we experienced a year ago. Tax-exempt bonds purchased average 3.03%, 10 basis points lower than a year ago.
Our bond portfolio's effective duration of March 31 was 4.8 years, up slightly from 4.7 years at year-end.
Cash flow from operating activities continued to fuel investment income growth. Funds generated from net operating cash flows for the first 3 months of 2016 rose 20% compared to a year ago to $257 million and helped generate $111 million of net purchases of securities for our investment portfolio.
As always, we work carefully to manage our expenses, at the same time, strategically investing in our business. Our first quarter 2016 property casualty underwriting expense ratio improved slightly compared with a year ago. 
Our loss reserves experienced another quarter of consistency, both in our approach to setting overall reserves and in favorable reserve development on prior accident years. For the first quarter of 2016, favorable reserve development benefited our combined ratio by 5.6 percentage points, better than the 2.2 points for the first quarter of last year and more in line with the 5.0 points for the last 3 quarters of 2015.
Reserve development so far in 2016 had a good spread over most of our major lines of businesses and over recent accident years, including 63% for accident year 2015 and 27% for accident year 2014.
Overall reserves, including accident year 2016, rose $99 million in the first quarter, including $95 million for the IBNR portion. Even with that prudent increase in IBNR reserves, our first quarter underwriting results were very good as our combined ratio nearly matched the 91.1% full year 2015 ratio.
We remain in excellent shape regarding our capital strength, liquidity and financial flexibility. Cash and marketable securities for our parent company at the end of the quarter totaled just over $1.9 billion, up 9% from year-end. Our capital is well positioned to support future profitable growth of our insurance operations and other capital management actions, such as returning capital to shareholders.
As I usually do, I'll conclude my prepared remarks with a summary of the contributions during the first quarter to book value per share. They represent the main drivers of our value-creation ratio. 
Property casualty underwriting increased book value by $0.38. Life insurance operations added $0.06. Investment income, other than life insurance and reduced by noninsurance items, contributed $0.41. The change in unrealized gains at March 31 for the fixed income portfolio, net of realized gains and losses, increased book value per share by $0.46. The change in unrealized gains at March 31 for the equity portfolio, net of realized gains and losses, increased book value by $0.93. And we declared $0.48 per share in dividends to shareholders. The net effect was a book value increase of $1.76 during the first quarter to a record $40.96 per share. 
And now I'll turn the call back over to Steve."

As we work together with our agency partners to maintain this momentum, we continue to seek incremental operational improvements to produce value for shareholders in the near term and for the long term.

As you know by now, we don't do a lot of short-term manipulation of the portfolio. We try to build a solid foundation and let it go. Our investing style, particularly on the equity front, didn't hold up all that well last year. Nondividend payers, nonquality names kind of ruled the day. First quarter clearly went our way, both with our style and with a few names in particular that had caused us a couple issues last year really nicely rebounding. So I'd say this next 6 to 12 months, you'll probably see us more or less hold in there. I think equity allocation is going to hover in that low to mid-30s range for a while here. On the fixed income front, we still tend to see value in municipals, an area I think we've got room to put some money. Energy names had taken a bit of a hit. We've seen some rebound there both on the equity and fixed income fronts. So to answer your question, I don't see a lot of large-scale reconfiguring of the portfolio."

First of all, we still -- we remain very excited about the progress that we've been making, the growth that's occurred since we started E&S. As you saw, the net written premiums were up 7% for the quarter to $45 million, the combined ratio doing well with the prior year development and so forth. But we've used a consistent approach to setting those reserves in the recent years. Although we lack many years of paid loss data and with the high growth rates in insured exposures, which, of course, is reflected in the premium growth, increases the uncertainty of the estimated ultimate losses. And so we tended to be conservative while setting those E&S reserves because we don't have that long history, but we're getting there. So the current process, what I can tell you, is consistent with the prior year. And time will tell, but we aim to be consistent with our process, and we think we're on the right path there."

So obviously, there's been a little bit of disruption in that marketplace where the realignment has had an effect. Agencies do want to have a choice, a broad choice, to provide to their policyholders. And so between Will's experience and credibility in the marketplace as well as his team's and our good reputation with independent agents, we're pleased with the response we're getting.

She wrote personal lines in the East Coast, and she said, without a doubt, without hesitation that our diamond personal line system was highly efficient, allowed them to do business efficiently.

So on the personal line side, we did have $18 million of favorable development between the personal and homeowners, which is primarily where it was at. The personal auto was $9 million. The homeowners was $8 million. First, what I'll start off with is to say, again, we do follow a steady and consistent methodology in setting the reserves. And we do look at that process every reporting period. So from time to time, we make refinements to better the estimates for changing times, trends, cost indicators, efforts applied, et cetera. And so as we stated in our 10-Q, we did need a refinement during the quarter to our expense reserves, which is also known as AOE, which are an estimate for the costs related to our Claims Department associates as they settle claims. And so that estimate includes assumptions of, really, varying labor intensity by type of claims or line of business. So this refinement, while mentioned, is it moved AOE reserves among all the lines of businesses that we have, but in total, it had a 0 effect amongst all the lines for the company in total. So on a given line, like personal lines auto, you can actually see the refinement a little bit better. So all of the $9 million favorable development in the personal lines auto was really related to this refinement, while there was virtually little to really no effect to be seen on the personal lines homeowners. So had we not reflected this refinement personal lines auto prior year development, really would have been nearly flat or about $1 million adverse. So when you put all that together, it is a -- there was a little something special in there, but we are constantly looking at our processes, how we set our reserves. From time to time, we do have refinements. And so you're seeing a little bit of that in the personal lines that you may or may not be able to see, refinements in the future, but they do occur. So I hope -- sorry for the long answer, but I hope that got to the basis of your question."

There are some competitors on the margin that are -- they kind of distinguish themselves as being out there. But anecdotally, the feedback we've gotten from both agents and, like I mentioned before, our field underwriters, is that it's a competitive market. But it's stable, and the field reps have felt very comfortable that we've got good submission flow and that we have to pick our way through things. I think the concerns that are out there at the agency level is that there is competition. So there probably are more accounts that are being shopped just to protect and make certain that they're comfortable with the pricing. One of the areas that we're pleased about is our 3-year policy strategy. That keeps -- because of the commitment we make to policyholders and with that -- with the 3-year guarantees, we think fewer of our policies are shopped through soft markets and hard markets but, particularly right now, it's attractive from our standpoint. The one area that I would mention that we are seeing a conspicuous amount of competition would be in the E&S side. We have a fairly conservative underwriting appetite in E&S. So I guess it's fair to say that we might be a little bit on the margin between standard and nonstandard in a lot of the business that we write. But we are seeing more, larger E&S accounts that are being taken into the standard side. And so -- and that's probably a little bit of why the E&S growth rate wasn't as robust as it has been in the past, is that we have seen some larger accounts leave us. And so, and once the standard market carrier is willing to take the account, there's no amount of pricing that we can apply, if we wanted to, to retain it."

Good morning, and thank you for joining us today to hear more about our second quarter results. We are pleased to report satisfactory operating performance despite second quarter catastrophe loss effects that were slightly higher than our long-term average. Thanks to the steady efforts of our associates to support the local independent agents that represent Cincinnati insurance, we still managed to generate a modest operating -- modest underwriting profit in the second quarter, and our first half 2016 consolidated property casualty combined ratio of 95.4% is within 0.5 point of the first half of last year.
We are encouraged by improving underwriting results before the effects of catastrophes and believe we'll see ongoing benefits from our various initiatives focus on profitability.
Rise in investment and robust portfolio valuations at quarter-end were another bright spot for recent performance. Higher investment income for the first half of 2016 offset a small degrees in property casualty underwriting profit leading to a 3% increase in operating income. Mike Sewell will comment further on at any moment. 
First, I'll highlight some important points about our insurance operations. Each of our segments continued to grow satisfactorily as we earn quality new business produced by our agencies. Pricing was generally consistent with the first quarter. However, personal auto was an exception with average renewal rate percentage increases will be from the mid-single-digit range to the high single-digit range. We believe that improved pricing for both our personal and commercial auto along with other incidents will improve our results for those lines of business.
The expansion of our reinsurance assumed operation, known as Cincinnati Re, also continues to progress nicely. Cincinnati Re generated an underwriting loss of just under $1 million for the second quarter as a result of a $4 million estimated share of losses from the Fort McMurray Canada wildfire affecting the industry, plus what we believe is appropriate reserving for a diverse portfolio of reinsurance treaties.
We are also satisfied with the progress of expanding of the personalized products and services we offer to our agencies higher net worth clients. Nearly 1/4 of the total $59 million in personal lines new business written premiums for the 6 -- first 6 months of 2016 came from high net worth policies. We reported an underwriting profit for each of our property casualty segments in the first half of 2016. As in most years, we anticipate the second half to be better than the first.
Our commercial line segment produced a combined ratio just over 95% for the first half of the year, while that ratio for our excess and surplus segment was just under 75%.
Our life insurance subsidiary, including income from its investment portfolio, also experienced another good quarter and first half of the year. For the first 6 months of 2016, current premiums grew 11%, and net income for our life insurance subsidiary rose 10% compared with last year.
Our primary measure of financial performance to value creation ratio was again strong at 4.6% for the second quarter and 10.5% for the first half of 2016. Generally higher valuations in securities markets augmented the contribution of our operating performance. 
While we're pleased with ongoing good performance, we understand the need to remain focused on underwriting profitability and growth. We'll do that as we seek to continually improve performance.
I'll now ask our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell, to share his highlights for other areas of our financial performance."

We ended the second quarter of 2016 with a net unrealized gain of nearly $2.7 billion before taxes, including more than $2 billion for our common stock portfolio that reached more than $5 billion in fair value.
For our bond portfolio, interest income again grew 4% in part due to net purchases of $309 million, over the past 4 quarters. The bond portfolio's pretax average yield reported at 4.64% for the second quarter and 4.65% for the first half of 2016 matched the year-ago periods.
Taxable bonds purchased during the first 6 months of 2016 had an average pretax yield of 4.5%, 8 basis points higher than we experienced a year ago.
Tax-exempt bonds purchased averaged 3.01%, 33 basis points lower than a year ago. Our bond portfolio's effective duration at June 30 was 4.8 years, up slightly from 4.7 years at year-end.
Cash flow from operating activities continued to fuel the investment income growth. Funds generated from net operating cash flows for the first half of 2016 rose 4% compared with a year-ago to $490 million and helped generate $292 million of net purchases of securities for our investment portfolio.
As always, we work to carefully manage our expenses at the same time of strategically investing in our business. Our first half of 2016 property casualty underwriting expense ratio rose 0.2 percentage points compared with a year ago.
Our loss reserves continued to experience favorable development as we apply a consistent approach to setting overall reserves. For the first 6 months of 2016, favorable reserve development benefited our combined ratio by 5 percentage points compared with 4.4 points for the same period of last year and similar to the 5.2 point rolling average for the prior 4 quarters.
Reserve development so far in 2016 continued to be spread over most of our major lines and over recent accident years, including 55% for accident year 2015 and 22% for accident year 2014.
Overall reserves, including accident year 2016 and net of reinsurance, rose $229 million in the first half of 2016, including $133 million for the IBNR portion.
Our capital strength, liquidity and financial flexibility continued at healthy levels. Our capital remains ready to support future profitable growth of our insurance operations and other capital management actions, such as returning capital to shareholders.
As usual, I'll conclude with a summary of our contributions during the second quarter to book value per share. They represent the main drivers of our value creation ratio. Property casualty underwriting increased book value by $0.04. Life insurance operations added $0.07. Investment income other than life insurance and reduced by noninsurance items contributed $0.47. The change in unrealized gains at June 30 for the fixed income portfolio, net of realized gains and losses, increased book value per share by $0.72. The change in unrealized gains at June 30 for the equity portfolio, net of realized gains and losses, increased book value by $0.59. And we declared $0.48 per share in dividends to shareholders.
The net effect was a book value increase of $1.41 during the second quarter to a record $42.37 per share. And now I'll turn the call back over to Steve."

As we work together with our agency partners to maintain this momentum, we're confident that we'll continue to produce value for shareholders in the near term and for the long term.
We appreciate this opportunity to respond to your questions and also look forward to meeting in person with many of you during the remainder of the year.
I'll also note that many of you know Eric Mathews, who we announced last fall will be retiring on July 29 after nearly 40 years with the company. We thank Eric for his leadership of our accounting operations and wish him the best. Senior Vice President Theresa Hoffer will participate in future earnings conference calls instead of Eric.

I think probably your comment might be specifically related to the personal lines and how maybe that fluctuate a little bit from the first quarter of this year to the second quarter and how maybe second quarter was probably a little bit more in line with 2015 and 2014. Really, as we have noted in our first quarter 10-Q, I think I may have made some comments in there. We did have a slight refinement on our personal lines business, which was really related to what we call the AOE reserves. And so there were some expenses, there that we refined. It moved about $9 million, $10 million worth of reserves from the personal line side to the commercial lines side. Had we not made that refinement, it would have actually placing the personal lines prior development in the first quarter really be flat. So because we did that, you saw some favorable development there. And now in the second quarter, really what's running the temperature is the personal auto as well as commercial auto when you look at prior year reserve development. So absence some refinements, I think we're fairly consistent. We are consistent in the process, and I think the numbers really show that. So I don't know if Steve or anyone else has any additional comments, but that might've been a little long-winded for you."

And with the M&A activity that the carry, a lot of consolidation in each of these from time to time we would run into a case where if we needed to augment our agencies in any particular area, the group from which we can choose might be smaller. But fortunately, the desire for agencies that don't represent us to have a contract with us is still high. So we rarely are turned down when we prospect for agencies. And so I'd say, consequently, and the fact is that there are a lot of agencies that don't represent us in a lot of territories. I am -- that's not a big concern for us. We've been able to find agencies to appoint 30%, 40% of the volume in the agencies an ambitious target. We certainly want to be consequential to the agency. As you know we talk about being #1 or #2. After we've been in an agency for 5 years. But we're not seeing any lack of opportunity for us to do that. It's worked out pretty darn well in newer states particularly with what has been doing in the high net worth area between the very good reputation that our agencies have earned for our company and they talked to agencies and some of these newer stage for us. The door is pretty wide open for us to appoint agencies, for example, in lower New York, Manhattan, Long Island, just recently open New Jersey. California's soon to be opened and really no shortage of agencies to point there. So fortunately, I think across the board, new states and existing states were in pretty good shape."

Actually, the direct writers write tremendous percentage of that business. So it's not all in common to see that. And then from the usual characters, we're competing pretty favorably against everybody right now. And I think what's happening is that agencies when they take a contract with us, they know as part of the approach we take to them is that if we agree to a point fewer agencies, then perhaps Brand x might have appoint. In return for that, we ask that the agency concentrate on making the relationship with us work. So we're very pleased with the number of bad backs we're getting.

Relative to loss cost and all the other lines, there's still a lot of initiatives that are in the works here, loss control and inspections, more specialization and, by line of business as well as by industry that we think and then, of course, the segmentation in the analytics that we're employing, we just think we're being better selectors of risks and we're also addressing loss mitigation issues that with our loss cost.

We we're segmenting our book of business better than we have ever had. I think we've done a job of integrating it with a little more of standard underwriting with [indiscernible] the we talk about in the past. Our agents have been doing great and cooperate with that for an agent to explain the science part of this to policyholders. So I think we've done a good job there. And agencies have come through for us. We've expanded our loss control significantly over the last 5 years, really that last 6 or 7 years. We're inspecting risk that we hadn't expected in the past, so the inspections that we're making are much more in-depth than we have in the past. We're discovering things both good and bad that allowed us to make more informed decisions. So we got off risks that we shouldn't got enough. We have said yes to risk that maybe in the past we would have thought we are a little tough in terms of their industry classifications. So that's working out really well. I say, in particular, in personal lines, the inspection have also afforded a lift in the area of insurance to value, so we're increasing premiums there getting a better ratio of premium through risk for ourselves there.

Good morning, and thank you for joining us today to hear more about our second quarter results. We are pleased to report satisfactory operating performance despite second quarter catastrophe loss effects that were slightly higher than our long-term average. Thanks to the steady efforts of our associates to support the local independent agents who represent Cincinnati Insurance, we still managed to generate a modest operating -- modest underwriting profit in the second quarter, and our first half 2016 consolidated property casualty combined ratio of 95.4% is within a 0.5 point of the first half of last year.
We are encouraged by improving underwriting results before the effects of catastrophes, and believe we will see ongoing benefits from our various initiatives focused on profitability.
Rise in investment income and robust portfolio valuations at quarter-end were another bright spot for recent performance. Higher investment income for the first half of 2016 offset a small decrease in property casualty underwriting profit leading to a 3% increase in operating income. Mike Sewell will comment further on that in a moment.  
First, I'll highlight some important points about our insurance operations. Each of our segments continued to grow satisfactorily, as we earn quality new business produced by our agencies. Pricing was generally consistent with the first quarter. However, personal auto was an exception with average renewal rate percentage increases moving from the mid-single-digit range to the high single-digit range. We believe that improved pricing for both our personal and commercial auto, along with other initiatives, will improve our results for those lines of business.
Expansion of our reinsurance assumed operation, known as Cincinnati Re, also continues to progress nicely. Cincinnati Re generated an underwriting loss of just under $1 million for the second quarter as a result of a $4 million estimated share of losses from the Fort McMurray Canada wildfire affecting the industry, plus what we believe is appropriate reserving for a diverse portfolio of reinsurance treaties.
We are also satisfied with the progress of expanding the personal lines products and services we offer to our agencies higher net worth clients. Nearly 1/4 of the total $59 million in personal lines new business written premiums for the 6 -- first 6 months of 2016 came from high net worth policies. We reported an underwriting profit for each of our property casualty segments in the first half of 2016. As in most years, we anticipate the second half to be better than the first.
Our commercial line segment produced a combined ratio just over 95% for the first half of the year, while that ratio for our excess and surplus segment was just under 75%.
Our life insurance subsidiary, including income from its investment portfolio, also experienced another good quarter in first half of the year. For the first 6 months of 2016, earned premiums grew 11%, and net income for our life insurance subsidiary rose 10% compared with last year.
Our primary measure of financial performance, the value creation ratio, was again strong at 4.6% for the second quarter and 10.5% for the first half of 2016. Generally higher valuations in securities markets augmented the contribution of our operating performance. While we're pleased with ongoing good performance, we understand the need to remain focused on underwriting profitability and growth. We'll do that as we seek to continually improve performance.
I'll now ask our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell, to share his highlights for other areas of our financial performance."

I'll open with highlights of second quarter investment results. It was another stellar quarter for investments, including 6% growth in pretax investment income and 7% on an after-tax basis. We also experienced increases in the fair value and unrealized gains positions of both our equity and bond portfolios. We ended the second quarter of 2016 with a net unrealized gain of nearly $2.7 billion before taxes, including more than $2 billion for our common stock portfolio that reached more than $5 billion in fair value.
For our bond portfolio, interest income, again, grew 4% in part due to net purchases of $309 million, over the past 4 quarters. The bond portfolio's pretax average yield reported at 4.64% for the second quarter and 4.65% for the first half of 2016 matched the year-ago periods. 
Taxable bonds purchased during the first 6 months of 2016 had an average pretax yield of 4.5%, 8 basis points higher than we experienced a year ago.
Tax-exempt bonds purchased average 3.01%, 33 basis points lower than a year ago. Our bond portfolio's effective duration at June 30 was 4.8 years, up slightly from 4.7 years at year-end.
Cash flow from operating activities continued to fuel the investment income growth. Funds generated from net operating cash flows for the first half of 2016 rose 4% compared with a year ago to $490 million and helped generate $292 million of net purchases of securities for our investment portfolio.
As always, we work to carefully manage our expenses at the same time of strategically investing in our business. Our first half of 2016 property casualty underwriting expense ratio rose 0.2 percentage points compared with a year ago.
Our loss reserves continued to experience favorable development, as we apply a consistent approach to setting overall reserves. For the first 6 months of 2016, favorable reserve development benefited our combined ratio by 5 percentage points compared with 4.4 points for the same period last year and similar to the 5.2-point rolling average for the prior 4 quarters.
Reserve development so far in 2016 continued to be spread over most of our major lines and over recent accident years, including 55% for accident year 2015 and 22% for accident year 2014.
Overall reserves, including accident year 2016 and net of reinsurance, rose $229 million in the first half of 2016, including $133 million for the IBNR portion.
Our capital strength, liquidity and financial flexibility continued at healthy levels. Our capital remains ready to support future profitable growth of our insurance operations and other capital management actions, such as returning capital to shareholders.
As usual, I'll conclude with a summary of our contributions during the second quarter to book value per share. They represent the main drivers of our value creation ratio. Property casualty underwriting increased book value by $0.04. Life insurance operations added $0.07. Investment income other than life insurance and reduced by noninsurance items contributed $0.47. The change in unrealized gains at June 30 for the fixed income portfolio, net of realized gains and losses, increased book value per share by $0.72. The change in unrealized gains at June 30 for the equity portfolio, net of realized gains and losses, increased book value by $0.59. And we declared $0.48 per share in dividends to shareholders. The net effect was a book value increase of a $1.41 during the second quarter to a record $42.37 per share. 
And now I'll turn the call back over to Steve."

I'm not sure I probably would have defined it that way. We do follow a consistent approach with -- or actuaries, not changing how we do the reserves and look at them. But from time to time, we will have, I'll call them, refinements to the process as more information becomes available and so forth. I think probably your comment might be specifically related to the personal lines and how maybe that fluctuate a little bit from the first quarter of this year to the second quarter, and how -- maybe the second quarter was probably a little bit more in line with 2015 and 2014. Really, as we noted in our first quarter 10-Q, I think I may have made some comments in there. We did have a slight refinement on our personal lines business, which was really related to what we call the AOE reserves. And so there were some expenses there that we refined. It moved about $9 million, $10 million worth of reserves from the personal line side to the commercial line side. Had we not made that refinement, you would have actually placing the personal lines prior year development in the first quarter really be flat. So because we did that, you saw some favorable development there. And now in the second quarter, really what's running the temperature is the personal auto as well as commercial auto when you look at prior year reserve development. So absence some refinements, I think, we're fairly consistent. We are consistent in the process, and I think the numbers really show that. So I don't know if Steve or anyone else has any additional comments, but that might have been a little long-winded for you."

In existing territories, we've always taken the approach with the relatively low number of agencies we have to really appoint as few as possible in the particular area. And with the M&A activity that's occurring and lot of consolidation in agencies from time to time, we would run into a case, where if we needed to augment our agencies in any particular area, the group from which we can choose might be smaller. But fortunately, the desire for agencies that don't represent us to have a contract with us is still high. So we rarely are turned down when we prospect for agencies. And so, I'd say, consequently, and the fact is that there are a lot of agencies that don't represent us in a lot of territories. So that's not a big concern for us, where we've been able to find agencies to appoint 30%, 40% of the volume in an agency is an ambitious target. We certainly want to be consequential to the agency, as you know, we talk about being #1 or #2, after we've been in an agency for 5 years. But we are not seeing any lack of opportunity for us to do that. It's worked out pretty darn well in newer states, particularly with what Will Van Den Heuvel's doing in the high net worth area between the very good reputation that our agencies have earned for our company and they talked to agencies in some of these newer states for us. The door is pretty wide open for us to appoint agencies, for example, in lower New York, Manhattan, Long Island, we just recently opened New Jersey. California's soon to be opened and really no shortage of agencies to appoint there. So, fortunately, I think across the board, new states and existing states were in pretty good shape."

Actually, the direct writers write tremendous percentage of that business. So it's not all in common to see that. And then from the usual characters, we're competing pretty favorably against everybody right now. I think what's happening is that agencies when they take a contract with us, they know as part of the approach we take to them is that if we'll agree to a point fewer agencies, then perhaps brand x might appoint. In return for that, we ask that the agency concentrate on making the relationship with us work. So we're very pleased with the number of add backs we're getting. I think that's the most important thing.

I'd say, in particular, in personal lines, the inspections have also afforded a lift in the area of insurance to value, so we are increasing premiums there, getting a better ratio of premium-to-risk for ourselves there. So it's not one thing, it's a lot of things that are working well. I don't think there's anything particularly unique to what we're doing as to what other comedies are doing. I just think we probably executed pretty well so far in this process. And as Steve said few minutes ago, there's still, I think, a lot of optimism moving forward we can continue to improve."

But it performed 10 points better than our middle market personal lines book of business. So as you can tell from the weighting of new business and high net worth this quarter versus middle market, we're increasing the proportion of high net worth. And so there'd been a lot of deliberate steps that we've taken to position our book of business to perform better than the 95 to 100 that Mike mentioned."

Good morning, and thank you for joining us today to hear more about our second quarter results. We are pleased to report satisfactory operating performance despite second quarter catastrophe loss effects that were slightly higher than our long-term average. Thanks to the steady efforts of our associates to support the local independent agents who represent Cincinnati Insurance, we still managed to generate a modest operating -- modest underwriting profit in the second quarter, and our first half 2016 consolidated property casualty combined ratio of 95.4% is within a 0.5 point of the first half of last year.
We are encouraged by improving underwriting results before the effects of catastrophes, and believe we will see ongoing benefits from our various initiatives focused on profitability.
Rising investment income and robust portfolio valuations at quarter-end were another bright spot for recent performance. Higher investment income for the first half of 2016 offset a small decrease in property casualty underwriting profit leading to a 3% increase in operating income. Mike Sewell will comment further on that in a moment.  
First, I'll highlight some important points about our insurance operations. Each of our segments continued to grow satisfactorily, as we earn quality new business produced by our agencies. Pricing was generally consistent with the first quarter. However, personal auto was an exception with average renewal rate percentage increases moving from the mid-single-digit range to the high single-digit range. We believe that improved pricing for both our personal and commercial auto, along with other initiatives, will improve our results for those lines of business.
Expansion of our reinsurance assumed operation, known as Cincinnati Re, also continues to progress nicely. Cincinnati Re generated an underwriting loss of just under $1 million for the second quarter as a result of a $4 million estimated share of losses from the Fort McMurray Canada wildfire affecting the industry, plus what we believe is appropriate reserving for a diverse portfolio of reinsurance treaties.
We are also satisfied with the progress of expanding the personal lines products and services we offer to our agencies' higher net worth clients. Nearly 1/4 of the total $59 million in personal lines new business written premiums for the 6 -- first 6 months of 2016 came from high net worth policies. We reported an underwriting profit for each of our property casualty segments in the first half of 2016. As in most years, we anticipate the second half to be better than the first.
Our commercial line segment produced a combined ratio just over 95% for the first half of the year, while that ratio for our excess and surplus segment was just under 75%.
Our life insurance subsidiary, including income from its investment portfolio, also experienced another good quarter and first half of the year. For the first 6 months of 2016, earned premiums grew 11%, and net income for our life insurance subsidiary rose 10% compared with last year.
Our primary measure of financial performance, the value creation ratio, was again strong at 4.6% for the second quarter and 10.5% for the first half of 2016. Generally higher valuations in securities markets augmented the contribution of our operating performance. While we're pleased with ongoing good performance, we understand the need to remain focused on underwriting profitability and growth. We'll do that as we seek to continually improve performance.
I'll now ask our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell, to share his highlights for other areas of our financial performance."

I'll open with highlights of second quarter investment results. It was another stellar quarter for investments, including 6% growth in pretax investment income and 7% on an after-tax basis. We also experienced increases in the fair value and unrealized gains positions of both our equity and bond portfolios. We ended the second quarter of 2016 with a net unrealized gain of nearly $2.7 billion before taxes, including more than $2 billion for our common stock portfolio that reached more than $5 billion in fair value.
For our bond portfolio, interest income, again, grew 4% in part due to net purchases of $309 million, over the past 4 quarters. The bond portfolio's pretax average yield reported at 4.64% for the second quarter and 4.65% for the first half of 2016 matched the year-ago periods. 
Taxable bonds purchased during the first 6 months of 2016 had an average pretax yield of 4.5%, 8 basis points higher than we experienced a year ago.
Tax-exempt bonds purchased average 3.01%, 33 basis points lower than a year ago. Our bond portfolio's effective duration at June 30 was 4.8 years, up slightly from 4.7 years at year-end.
Cash flow from operating activities continued to fuel the investment income growth. Funds generated from net operating cash flows for the first half of 2016 rose 4% compared with a year ago to $490 million and helped generate $292 million of net purchases of securities for our investment portfolio.
As always, we work to carefully manage our expenses at the same time of strategically investing in our business. Our first half of 2016 property casualty underwriting expense ratio rose 0.2 percentage points compared with a year ago.
Our loss reserves continued to experience favorable development, as we apply a consistent approach to setting overall reserves. For the first 6 months of 2016, favorable reserve development benefited our combined ratio by 5 percentage points compared with 4.4 points for the same period last year and similar to the 5.2-point rolling average for the prior 4 quarters.
Reserve development so far in 2016 continued to be spread over most of our major lines and over recent accident years, including 55% for accident year 2015 and 22% for accident year 2014.
Overall reserves, including accident year 2016 and net of reinsurance, rose $229 million in the first half of 2016, including $133 million for the IBNR portion.
Our capital strength, liquidity and financial flexibility continued at healthy levels. Our capital remains ready to support future profitable growth of our insurance operations and other capital management actions, such as returning capital to shareholders.
As usual, I'll conclude with a summary of contributions during the second quarter to book value per share. They represent the main drivers of our value creation ratio. Property casualty underwriting increased book value by $0.04. Life insurance operations added $0.07. Investment income other than life insurance and reduced by noninsurance items contributed $0.47. The change in unrealized gains at June 30 for the fixed income portfolio, net of realized gains and losses, increased book value per share by $0.72. The change in unrealized gains at June 30 for the equity portfolio, net of realized gains and losses, increased book value by $0.59. And we declared $0.48 per share in dividends to shareholders. The net effect was a book value increase of a $1.41 during the second quarter to a record $42.37 per share. 
And now I'll turn the call back over to Steve."

I'm not sure I probably would have defined it that way. We do follow a consistent approach with -- our actuaries, not changing how we do the reserves and look at them. But from time to time, we will have, I'll call them, refinements to the process as more information becomes available and so forth. I think probably your comment might be specifically related to the personal lines and how maybe that fluctuated a little bit from the first quarter of this year to the second quarter, and how -- maybe the second quarter was probably a little bit more in line with 2015 and 2014. Really, as we noted in our first quarter 10-Q, I think I may have made some comments in there. We did have a slight refinement on our personal lines business, which was really related to what we call the AOE reserves. And so there were some expenses there that we refined. It moved about $9 million, $10 million worth of reserves from the personal line side to the commercial line side. Had we not made that refinement, you would have actually probably seen the personal lines prior year development in the first quarter really be flat. So because we did that, you saw some favorable development there. And now in the second quarter, really what's running the temperature is the personal auto as well as commercial auto when you look at prior year reserve development. So absent some refinements, I think, we're fairly consistent. We are consistent in the process, and I think the numbers really show that. So I don't know if Steve or anyone else has any additional comments, but that might have been a little long-winded for you."

In existing territories, we've always taken the approach with the relatively low number of agencies we have to really appoint as few as possible in a particular area. Now with the M&A activity that's occurring and lot of consolidation in agencies from time to time, we would run into a case, where if we needed to augment our agencies in any particular area, the group from which we can choose might be smaller. But fortunately, the desire for agencies that don't represent us to have a contract with us is still high. So we rarely are turned down when we prospect for agencies. And so, I'd say, consequently, and the fact is that there are a lot of agencies that don't represent us in a lot of territories. So that's not a big concern for us, where we've been able to find agencies to appoint 30%, 40% of the volume in an agency is an ambitious target. We certainly want to be consequential to the agency, as you know, we talk about being #1 or #2, after we've been in an agency for 5 years. But we are not seeing any lack of opportunity for us to do that. It's worked out pretty darn well in newer states, particularly with what Will Van Den Heuvel's doing in the high net-worth area between the very good reputation that our agencies have earned for our company and they talk to agencies in some of these newer states for us. The door is pretty wide open for us to appoint agencies, for example, in lower New York, Manhattan, Long Island, we just recently opened New Jersey. California's soon to be opened and really no shortage of agencies to appoint there. So, fortunately, I think across the board, new states and existing states we're in pretty good shape."

Actually, the direct writers write tremendous percentage of that business. So it's not all uncommon to see that. And then from the usual characters, we're competing pretty favorably against everybody right now. I think what's happening is that agencies when they take a contract with us, they know as part of the approach we take to them is that if we'll agree to appoint fewer agencies, than perhaps brand x might appoint. In return for that, we ask that the agency concentrate on making the relationship with us work. So we're very pleased with the number of at-bats we're getting.

There were some other ones in there that were in the, I'll call it, in the $15 million to $25 million range, but probably not necessarily a surprise when we look at the 5-year, 10-year averages and so forth.

It's about a $56 million end of second quarter loss for us in San Antonio all commercial. And everything you read -- San Antonio was not on the map in Texas as far as being a hail risk for the industry. It was supposed to be an area that really wasn't very prolific as far as previous hail events. And so I think it caught everybody by a little bit of a surprise to the extent that the hailstorm hit San Antonio. As a result of that, I think the losses were a little greater in the industry that were probably anticipated for us. We certainly took our share of those commercial losses. That actually was twice the size of any other cat we had for the quarter. And the other ones were mainly midwestern storms related to particularly hail losses in several states over several days. So other than that, there really wasn't anything unusual in the quarter as far as those events."

Our agents have been great in cooperating with that [indiscernible] for an agent to explain the science part of this to policyholders, but I think we've done a good job there and agencies have come through for us. We've expanded our loss control significantly over the last 5 years, really that last 6 or 7 years. We're inspecting risks that we hadn't inspected in the past. The inspections that we're making are much more in-depth than we have in the past. We're discovering things both good and bad that allow us to make a more informed decision. So we've got an off risk that we shouldn't gotten off of. We have said yes to risks that maybe in the past we would have thought were a little tough in terms of their industry classifications, so that's working out real well. I'd say, in particular, in personal lines, the inspections have also afforded a lift in the area of insurance to value, so we are increasing premiums there, getting a better ratio of premium-to-risk for ourselves there. So it's not one thing, it's a lot of things that are working well. I don't think there's anything particularly unique to what we're doing as to what other comedies are doing. I just think we probably executed pretty well so far in this process. And as Steve said a few minutes ago, there's still, I think, a lot of optimism moving forward we can continue to improve."

Good morning, and thank you for joining us today to hear more about our second quarter results. We are pleased to report satisfactory operating performance despite second quarter catastrophe loss effects that were slightly higher than our long-term average. Thanks to the steady efforts of our associates to support the local independent agents who represent Cincinnati Insurance, we still managed to generate a modest operating -- modest underwriting profit in the second quarter, and our first half 2016 consolidated property casualty combined ratio of 95.4% is within a 0.5 point of the first half of last year.
We are encouraged by improving underwriting results before the effects of catastrophes, and believe we will see ongoing benefits from our various initiatives focused on profitability.
Rising investment income and robust portfolio valuations at quarter-end were another bright spot for recent performance. Higher investment income for the first half of 2016 offset a small decrease in property casualty underwriting profit leading to a 3% increase in operating income. Mike Sewell will comment further on that in a moment.  
First, I'll highlight some important points about our insurance operations. Each of our segments continued to grow satisfactorily, as we earn quality new business produced by our agencies. Pricing was generally consistent with the first quarter. However, personal auto was an exception with average renewal rate percentage increases moving from the mid-single-digit range to the high single-digit range. We believe that improved pricing for both our personal and commercial auto, along with other initiatives, will improve our results for those lines of business.
Expansion of our reinsurance assumed operation, known as Cincinnati Re, also continues to progress nicely. Cincinnati Re generated an underwriting loss of just under $1 million for the second quarter as a result of a $4 million estimated share of losses from the Fort McMurray Canada wildfire affecting the industry, plus what we believe is appropriate reserving for a diverse portfolio of reinsurance treaties.
We are also satisfied with the progress of expanding the personal lines products and services we offer to our agencies' higher net worth clients. Nearly 1/4 of the total $59 million in personal lines new business written premiums for the 6 -- first 6 months of 2016 came from high net worth policies. We reported an underwriting profit for each of our property casualty segments in the first half of 2016. As in most years, we anticipate the second half to be better than the first.
Our commercial line segment produced a combined ratio just over 95% for the first half of the year, while that ratio for our excess and surplus segment was just under 75%.
Our life insurance subsidiary, including income from its investment portfolio, also experienced another good quarter and first half of the year. For the first 6 months of 2016, earned premiums grew 11%, and net income for our life insurance subsidiary rose 10% compared with last year.
Our primary measure of financial performance, the value creation ratio, was again strong at 4.6% for the second quarter and 10.5% for the first half of 2016. Generally higher valuations in securities markets augmented the contribution of our operating performance. While we're pleased with ongoing good performance, we understand the need to remain focused on underwriting profitability and growth. We'll do that as we seek to continually improve performance.
I'll now ask our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell, to share his highlights for other areas of our financial performance."

I'll open with highlights of second quarter investment results. It was another stellar quarter for investments, including 6% growth in pretax investment income and 7% on an after-tax basis. We also experienced increases in the fair value and unrealized gains positions of both our equity and bond portfolios. We ended the second quarter of 2016 with a net unrealized gain of nearly $2.7 billion before taxes, including more than $2 billion for our common stock portfolio that reached more than $5 billion in fair value.
For our bond portfolio, interest income, again, grew 4% in part due to net purchases of $309 million, over the past 4 quarters. The bond portfolio's pretax average yield reported at 4.64% for the second quarter and 4.65% for the first half of 2016 matched the year-ago periods. 
Taxable bonds purchased during the first 6 months of 2016 had an average pretax yield of 4.5%, 8 basis points higher than we experienced a year ago.
Tax-exempt bonds purchased average 3.01%, 33 basis points lower than a year ago. Our bond portfolio's effective duration at June 30 was 4.8 years, up slightly from 4.7 years at year-end.
Cash flow from operating activities continued to fuel the investment income growth. Funds generated from net operating cash flows for the first half of 2016 rose 4% compared with a year ago to $490 million and helped generate $292 million of net purchases of securities for our investment portfolio.
As always, we work to carefully manage our expenses at the same time of strategically investing in our business. Our first half of 2016 property casualty underwriting expense ratio rose 0.2 percentage points compared with a year ago.
Our loss reserves continued to experience favorable development, as we apply a consistent approach to setting overall reserves. For the first 6 months of 2016, favorable reserve development benefited our combined ratio by 5 percentage points compared with 4.4 points for the same period last year and similar to the 5.2-point rolling average for the prior 4 quarters.
Reserve development so far in 2016 continued to be spread over most of our major lines and over recent accident years, including 55% for accident year 2015 and 22% for accident year 2014.
Overall reserves, including accident year 2016 and net of reinsurance, rose $229 million in the first half of 2016, including $133 million for the IBNR portion.
Our capital strength, liquidity and financial flexibility continued at healthy levels. Our capital remains ready to support future profitable growth of our insurance operations and other capital management actions, such as returning capital to shareholders.
As usual, I'll conclude with a summary of contributions during the second quarter to book value per share. They represent the main drivers of our value creation ratio. Property casualty underwriting increased book value by $0.04. Life insurance operations added $0.07. Investment income other than life insurance and reduced by noninsurance items contributed $0.47. The change in unrealized gains at June 30 for the fixed income portfolio, net of realized gains and losses, increased book value per share by $0.72. The change in unrealized gains at June 30 for the equity portfolio, net of realized gains and losses, increased book value by $0.59. And we declared $0.48 per share in dividends to shareholders. The net effect was a book value increase of a $1.41 during the second quarter to a record $42.37 per share. 
And now I'll turn the call back over to Steve."

I'm not sure I probably would have defined it that way. We do follow a consistent approach with -- our actuaries, not changing how we do the reserves and look at them. But from time to time, we will have, I'll call them, refinements to the process as more information becomes available and so forth. I think probably your comment might be specifically related to the personal lines and how maybe that fluctuated a little bit from the first quarter of this year to the second quarter, and how -- maybe the second quarter was probably a little bit more in line with 2015 and 2014. Really, as we noted in our first quarter 10-Q, I think I may have made some comments in there. We did have a slight refinement on our personal lines business, which was really related to what we call the AOE reserves. And so there were some expenses there that we refined. It moved about $9 million, $10 million worth of reserves from the personal line side to the commercial line side. Had we not made that refinement, you would have actually probably seen the personal lines prior year development in the first quarter really be flat. So because we did that, you saw some favorable development there. And now in the second quarter, really what's running the temperature is the personal auto as well as commercial auto when you look at prior year reserve development. So absent some refinements, I think, we're fairly consistent. We are consistent in the process, and I think the numbers really show that. So I don't know if Steve or anyone else has any additional comments, but that might have been a little long-winded for you."

In existing territories, we've always taken the approach with the relatively low number of agencies we have to really appoint as few as possible in a particular area. Now with the M&A activity that's occurring and lot of consolidation in agencies from time to time, we would run into a case, where if we needed to augment our agencies in any particular area, the group from which we can choose might be smaller. But fortunately, the desire for agencies that don't represent us to have a contract with us is still high. So we rarely are turned down when we prospect for agencies. And so, I'd say, consequently, and the fact is that there are a lot of agencies that don't represent us in a lot of territories. So that's not a big concern for us, where we've been able to find agencies to appoint 30%, 40% of the volume in an agency is an ambitious target. We certainly want to be consequential to the agency, as you know, we talk about being #1 or #2, after we've been in an agency for 5 years. But we are not seeing any lack of opportunity for us to do that. It's worked out pretty darn well in newer states, particularly with what Will Van Den Heuvel's doing in the high net-worth area between the very good reputation that our agencies have earned for our company and they talk to agencies in some of these newer states for us. The door is pretty wide open for us to appoint agencies, for example, in lower New York, Manhattan, Long Island, we just recently opened New Jersey. California's soon to be opened and really no shortage of agencies to appoint there. So, fortunately, I think across the board, new states and existing states we're in pretty good shape."

It was from a direct writer that we actually wrote the business that frankly hadn't that particular business hadn't been very well attended to, but it's coming across the board. Actually, the direct writers write tremendous percentage of that business. So it's not all uncommon to see that. And then from the usual characters, we're competing pretty favorably against everybody right now. I think what's happening is that agencies when they take a contract with us, they know as part of the approach we take to them is that if we'll agree to appoint fewer agencies, than perhaps brand x might appoint. In return for that, we ask that the agency concentrate on making the relationship with us work. So we're very pleased with the number of at-bats we're getting. I think that's the most important thing. Those agencies aren't forced to put any business with us, but if they are giving us the opportunities, which we're pleased that they are, we're very pleased with the result."

We think that things are going in the right direction on auto. Relative to loss cost and all the other lines, there is still a lot of initiatives that are in the works here, loss control, inspections, more specialization by line of business as well as by industry that we think, and then, of course, the segmentation in the analytics that we're employing. We just think we're being better selectors of risks, and we're also addressing loss mitigation issues that's helping with our loss cost.

It's about a $56 million end of second quarter loss for us in San Antonio all commercial. And everything you read -- San Antonio was not on the map in Texas as far as being a hail risk for the industry. It was supposed to be an area that really wasn't very prolific as far as previous hail events. And so I think it caught everybody by a little bit of a surprise to the extent that the hailstorm hit San Antonio. As a result of that, I think the losses were a little greater in the industry that were probably anticipated for us. We certainly took our share of those commercial losses. That actually was twice the size of any other cat we had for the quarter. And the other ones were mainly midwestern storms related to particularly hail losses in several states over several days.

We've expanded our loss control significantly over the last 5 years, really that last 6 or 7 years. We're inspecting risks that we hadn't inspected in the past. The inspections that we're making are much more in-depth than we have in the past. We're discovering things both good and bad that allow us to make a more informed decision. So we've got an off risk that we shouldn't gotten off of. We have said yes to risks that maybe in the past we would have thought were a little tough in terms of their industry classifications, so that's working out real well. I'd say, in particular, in personal lines, the inspections have also afforded a lift in the area of insurance to value, so we are increasing premiums there, getting a better ratio of premium-to-risk for ourselves there. So it's not one thing, it's a lot of things that are working well. I don't think there's anything particularly unique to what we're doing as to what other comedies are doing.

Those results represent another solid quarter of carefully executing our strategy. They reflect personal interactions by our associates working with our agents and others to steadily improve our long-term performance by building one relationship at a time.
While our 92.4% third quarter combined ratio was quite good, it was above the outstanding sub-90% result a year ago. However, it's satisfying to see our 9-month combined ratio measures before the effects of catastrophes performing about 1 percentage point better than a year ago.
We're also pleased with another quarter of strong investment performance. And Mike will soon comment on investment income growth and portfolio valuation gains. 
Before that, I'll highlight a few more aspects of our insurance operations. We believe we're reporting a healthy rate of premium growth for each of our insurance segments.
Our work toward greater pricing precision allows us to underwrite on a policy-by-policy basis and strengthens our confidence in selecting and pricing new business from our agencies.
Pricing was generally in line with the second quarter. Consistent with where loss ratios for us in the industry indicate the most need for higher premium rates, our commercial auto and personal auto policies experienced third quarter average renewal price increases that were the highest among our major lines of business. Both had average percentage increases in the mid-single-digit range with personal auto near the high end of that range. 
Our reinsurance assumed operations, known as Cincinnati Re, saw another quarter of steady growth as our team works to selectively build out a diversified portfolio of 3 business.
Third quarter underwriting results benefited from the June 30 loss reserves that are developing favorably as we obtain additional information on reinsured claims. The resulting favorable effect for the short tail portion of the portfolio contributed to a $6 million third quarter underwriting profit for Cincinnati Re.
We also experienced ongoing progress in expanding personalized products and services we offer to our agencies' higher net worth clients. Almost 1/4 of the total $91 million in personal lines of new business written premiums for the first 9 months of 2016 came from high net worth policies.
We continue to see good performance for our commercial line segment with a third quarter combined ratio near 90%. Our excess and surplus line segment continued to report superb results, with a combined ratio of below 70% for both the 3 and 9 months ended September 2016.
For our life insurance subsidiary, earned premiums continue to rise at a double-digit clip for both the third quarter and first 9 months of 2016, even though unlocking of interest rate and similar actuarial assumptions slowed our year-to-date growth and income.
Our primary measure of financial performance to value creation ratio reached 14% on a year-to-date basis with generally higher investment portfolio valuations, boosting the strong 6% contribution from operating performance.
I'll also briefly comment on estimated effects of Hurricane Matthew on the fourth quarter results. While it's still early, we estimate the catastrophe incurred loss effect to be between $40 million and $65 million pretax, including a net effect of $5 million to $10 million from our reinsurance assumed operation.
While the financial impacts are important, the real story for us lies in the hard work of our field claims representatives. More than 50 associates volunteered to leave their families to help policyholders in Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina put their lives back together. We're here to pay claims as our associates fulfill that promise with efficiency and empathy, they become our greatest sales advantage. Satisfied policyholders will share their experience with their neighbors, giving our agents and us the opportunity to write more business and continue growing our company.
With that, our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell, will comment on other areas of our financial performance."

I'll begin my comments with a few third quarter investment highlights. The third quarter 2016 was our 13th consecutive quarter of investment income growth as it rose 3% on a pretax basis and 4% on an aftertax basis. That growth continues to reflect an increase in both interest and dividend income. Our equity portfolio experienced another quarter of nice growth and unrealized gains and we reported a 1% increase in fair value.
In total, we ended the third quarter of 2016 with a net unrealized gain of more than $2.7 billion before taxes, including more than $2.1 billion in our equity portfolio. The bond portfolio's pretax average yield reported at 4.63% for the third quarter, slightly exceeded 4.62% from the last year's third quarter. Taxable bonds purchased during the first 9 months of 2016 had an average pretax yield of 4.27%, 23 basis points lower than we experienced a year ago. Tax-exempt bonds purchased averaged 2.89%, 45 basis points lower than a year ago.
Our bond portfolio's effective duration at September 30 was 4.9 years, up slightly from 4.8 years at the June -- at the end of June.
Cash flow from operating activities continued to provide funds for our investment portfolio. Funds generated from net operating cash flows for the first 9 months of 2016 rose 9% compared with a year ago and helped generate $375 million of net purchases of securities for our investment portfolio.
As always, we work to carefully manage our expenses. At the same time, strategically invest in our business. Our 9 months 2016 property casualty underwriting expense ratio rose slightly, up 0.3 percentage points compared with a year ago.
Moving to the other side of the balance sheet. Our loss reserves continue to experience favorable development as we apply a consistent approach to setting overall reserves. For the first 9 months of 2016, favorable reserve development benefited our combined ratio by 4.6 percentage points, very similar to the same period a year ago and full year 2015. Reserve development for the first 3 quarters continue to be spread over most of our major lines and over recent accident years, including 55% for accident year 2015, 24% for accident year 2014 and 15% for accident year 2013.
Overall reserves at the end of September, including accident year 2016 and net of reinsurance ceded rose 6% from last year with IBNR representing more than half of that.
Our assessment of the company's capital strength, liquidity and financial flexibility is that they remain at healthy levels. Capital management objectives includes supporting future profitable growth of our insurance operations plus other areas such as returning capital to shareholders.
As usual, I'll conclude with a summary of contributions during the third quarter to book value per share. They represent the main drivers of our value creation ratio. Property casualty underwriting increased book value by $0.35. Life insurance operations added $0.05. Investment income other than life insurance and reduced by noninsurance items contributed $0.48. The change in unrealized gains at September 30 for the fixed income portfolio net of realized gains and losses decreased book value per share by $0.04. The change in unrealized gains at September 30 for the equity portfolio that of realized gains and losses increased book value by $0.51. And we declared $0.48 per share in dividends to shareholders. The net effect was a book value increase of $0.87 during the third quarter to a record $43.24 per share.
And now I'll turn the call back over to Steve."

We did, particularly relative to commercial auto, we the counsel of agents and brokers meeting a couple of weeks ago, met with 40 agencies, the larger agencies out there. And the topic of conversation among those agencies was commercial auto. And the fact that, that market is firming up and that they're prepared to deliver rate increases. So that's kind of a big hurdle but there's an acknowledgment throughout the industry of the need for more rate. And so we would anticipate that will continue into the future. But there's things we continue to do on there to try to address the severity issue. I think most of what we would say is are the exact same things that others in the industry are talking about. Whole variety of things, newer cars are more expensive to fix. Aluminum is being used more than steel and that's more expensive to repair. A lot of the same things, distracted driving continues to be an issue. A lot of accidents that we've noticed in those skidmarks. A lot of distracted walking and biking. We've had 2 very severe accidents in the Chicago area. You may have heard about them that where people in bike lanes and maybe not in bike lanes, a lot more biking, for example, in metropolitan areas have resulted in some larger claims. The issue related to this driver shortage continues to be one that's talked about a lot. Drivers, some statistics from the PCI conference, drivers that are under 30 years old are 2 times more likely to have accidents. And so a lot of discussion about older drivers being brought back, folks that haven't retired and drivers that are above 60 are 1.5 times more after they have accidents. So we're seeing a lot of issues related to that. So what we're trying to do is to ramp up our loss control and making certain that as we visit policyholders, that they have a driver education programs, things of that nature. And then as we in the right business, an awful lot of attention, visual attention is being applied to the driver information, age of drivers, the types of vehicles that those drivers are assigned to. In other words, young drivers to heavy trucks is a bad formula. So all of those things are going to be taken into consideration in addition to the rate that we expect to get."

We test that as far as the amount of opportunity we have in our agencies is somewhere in the area of $2 billion of E&S premium is written with Cincinnati Insurance Company agents. We visit agencies in person, in many cases with our excess and surplus lines, underwriters, our field reps that are in the E&S side of things. We include the premium, intermingle the premium with our standard market premiums and losses on the profit-sharing contract. So I think our agencies appreciate what we're doing. They want to make certain that the business they put with us isn't, for the lack of a better word, the type of thing you throw against the wall and see if it sticks it's more carefully placed with us. I think our appetite is perhaps a little bit more conservative than most. Having said that, we'll finish this year at $200 million at the end of our ninth full year in the E&S business. And it's not as though we don't write some tougher risks that I think the balance there has been good. Don and his team have been very disciplined about what we're doing.

Those results represent another solid quarter of carefully executing our strategy. They reflect personal interactions by our associates working with our agents and others to steadily improve our long-term performance by building one relationship at a time.
While our 92.4% third quarter combined ratio was quite good, it was above the outstanding sub-90% result a year ago. However, it's satisfying to see our 9-month combined ratio measures before the effects of catastrophes performing about 1 percentage point better than a year ago.
We're also pleased with another quarter of strong investment performance. And Mike will soon comment on investment income growth and portfolio valuation gains. 
Before that, I'll highlight a few more aspects of our insurance operations. We believe we're reporting a healthy rate of premium growth for each of our insurance segments.
Our work toward greater pricing precision allows us to underwrite on a policy-by-policy basis and strengthens our confidence in selecting and pricing new business from our agencies.
Pricing was generally in line with the second quarter. Consistent with where loss ratios for us in the industry indicate the most need for higher premium rates, our commercial auto and personal auto policies experienced third quarter average renewal price increases that were the highest among our major lines of business. Both had average percentage increases in the mid-single-digit range with personal auto near the high end of that range. 
Our reinsurance assumed operations, known as Cincinnati Re, saw another quarter of steady growth as our team works to selectively build out a diversified portfolio of 3 business.
Third quarter underwriting results benefited from the June 30 loss reserves that are developing favorably as we obtain additional information on reinsured claims. The resulting favorable effect for the short tail portion of the portfolio contributed to a $6 million third quarter underwriting profit for Cincinnati Re.
We also experienced ongoing progress in expanding personalized products and services we offer to our agencies' higher net worth clients. Almost 1/4 of the total $91 million in personal lines of new business written premiums for the first 9 months of 2016 came from high net worth policies.
We continue to see good performance for our commercial line segment with a third quarter combined ratio near 90%. Our excess and surplus line segment continued to report superb results, with a combined ratio of below 70% for both the 3 and 9 months ended September 2016.
For our life insurance subsidiary, earned premiums continue to rise at a double-digit clip for both the third quarter and first 9 months of 2016, even though unlocking of interest rate and similar actuarial assumptions slowed our year-to-date growth and income.
Our primary measure of financial performance to value creation ratio reached 14% on a year-to-date basis with generally higher investment portfolio valuations, boosting the strong 6% contribution from operating performance.
I'll also briefly comment on estimated effects of Hurricane Matthew on the fourth quarter results. While it's still early, we estimate the catastrophe incurred loss effect to be between $40 million and $65 million pretax, including a net effect of $5 million to $10 million from our reinsurance assumed operation.
While the financial impacts are important, the real story for us lies in the hard work of our field claims representatives. More than 50 associates volunteered to leave their families to help policyholders in Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina put their lives back together. We're here to pay claims as our associates fulfill that promise with efficiency and empathy, they become our greatest sales advantage. Satisfied policyholders will share their experience with their neighbors, giving our agents and us the opportunity to write more business and continue growing our company.
With that, our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell, will comment on other areas of our financial performance."

I'll begin my comments with a few third quarter investment highlights. The third quarter 2016 was our 13th consecutive quarter of investment income growth as it rose 3% on a pretax basis and 4% on an after-tax basis. That growth continues to reflect an increase in both interest and dividend income. Our equity portfolio experienced another quarter of nice growth and unrealized gains and we reported a 1% increase in fair value.
In total, we ended the third quarter of 2016 with a net unrealized gain of more than $2.7 billion before taxes, including more than $2.1 billion in our equity portfolio. The bond portfolio's pretax average yield reported at 4.63% for the third quarter, slightly exceeded 4.62% from the last year's third quarter. Taxable bonds purchased during the first 9 months of 2016 had an average pretax yield of 4.27%, 23 basis points lower than we experienced a year ago. Tax-exempt bonds purchased averaged 2.89%, 45 basis points lower than a year ago.
Our bond portfolio's effective duration at September 30 was 4.9 years, up slightly from 4.8 years at the June -- at the end of June.
Cash flow from operating activities continued to provide funds for our investment portfolio. Funds generated from net operating cash flows for the first 9 months of 2016 rose 9% compared with a year ago and helped generate $375 million of net purchases of securities for our investment portfolio.
As always, we work to carefully manage our expenses, at the same time, strategically investing in our business. Our 9-month 2016 property casualty underwriting expense ratio rose slightly, up 0.3 percentage points compared with a year ago.
Moving to the other side of the balance sheet. Our loss reserves continued to experience favorable development as we apply a consistent approach to setting overall reserves. For the first 9 months of 2016, favorable reserve development benefited our combined ratio by 4.6 percentage points, very similar to the same period a year ago and full year 2015. Reserve development for the first 3 quarters continued to be spread over most of our major lines and over recent accident years, including 55% for accident year 2015, 24% for accident year 2014 and 15% for accident year 2013.
Overall reserves at the end of September, including accident year 2016 and net of reinsurance ceded rose 6% from last year with IBNR representing more than half of that.
Our assessment of the company's capital strength, liquidity and financial flexibility is that they remain at healthy levels. Capital management objectives includes supporting future profitable growth of our insurance operations plus other areas such as returning capital to shareholders.
As usual, I'll conclude with a summary of contributions during the third quarter to book value per share. They represent the main drivers of our value creation ratio. Property casualty underwriting increased book value by $0.35. Life insurance operations added $0.05. Investment income other than life insurance and reduced by noninsurance items contributed $0.48. The change in unrealized gains at September 30 for the fixed income portfolio net of realized gains and losses decreased book value per share by $0.04. The change in unrealized gains at September 30 for the equity portfolio net of realized gains and losses increased book value by $0.51. And we declared $0.48 per share in dividends to shareholders. The net effect was a book value increase of $0.87 during the third quarter to a record $43.24 per share.
And now I'll turn the call back over to Steve."

We did, particularly relative to commercial auto, we -- we were at the counsel of agents and brokers meeting a couple of weeks ago, met with 40 agencies, the larger agencies out there. And the topic of conversation among those agencies was commercial auto. And the fact that, that market is firming up and that they are prepared to deliver rate increases. So that's kind of a big hurdle, but there's an acknowledgment throughout the industry of the need for more rate. And so we would anticipate that will continue into the future. But there's a variety of things we continue to do on the -- to try to address the severity issue. I think most of what we would say is, are the exact same things that others in the industry are talking about. A whole variety of things, newer cars are more expensive to fix. Aluminum's being used more than steel and that's more expensive to repair. A lot of the same things, distracted driving continues to be an issue. A lot of accidents that we've noticed, no skid marks. A lot of distracted walking and biking. We've had 2 very severe accidents in the Chicago area. You may have heard about them, that where people in bike lanes and maybe not in bike lanes, a lot more biking, for example, in metropolitan areas have resulted in some larger claims. The issue related to this driver shortage continues to be one that's talked about a lot. Drivers, some statistics from the PCI conference, drivers that are under 30 years old are 2 times more likely to have accidents. And so a lot of discussion about older drivers being brought back, folks that haven't retired and drivers that are above 60 are 1.5 times more have to, to have accidents. So we're seeing a lot of issues related to that. So what we're trying to do is to amp up our loss control, making certain that as we visit policyholders, that they have driver education programs, things of that nature. And then as we underwrite business, an awful lot of attention, additional attention is being applied to the driver information, age of drivers, the types of vehicles that those drivers are assigned to. In other words, young drivers to heavy trucks is a bad formula. So all of those things are going to be taken into consideration in addition to the rate that we expect to get."

And then, but not a frequency issue until perhaps recently. And then on the auto side, it was the opposite. We've had sort of ongoing severity running at a frequency, or pardon me, ongoing severity running sort of 3 to 5 per years, but frequency only rose sort of beginning of, well early, beginning of 2015, and have gone through the increases. And it sounds like we've had some other companies talking about sort of a spike and higher frequency, particularly on the commercial auto, recently. You're saying it's not a frequency issue.

Unlike others in the E&S business, we're not going through wholesalers. We're only doing business with established relationships with the Cincinnati Insurance Company. We test that as far as the amount of opportunity we have in our agencies, they're somewhere in the area of $2 billion of E&S premium is written, with Cincinnati Insurance Company agents. We visit the agencies in person, in many cases with our excess and surplus lines, underwriters, our field reps that are in the E&S side of things. We include the premium, intermingle the premium with our standard market premiums and losses on the profit-sharing contract. So I think our agencies appreciate what we're doing. They want to make certain that the business they put with us isn't, for a lack of a better word, the type of thing you throw against the wall and see if it sticks. It's more carefully placed with us. I think our appetite is perhaps a little bit more conservative than most. Having said that, we'll finish this year at $200 million at the end of our ninth full year in the E&S business. And it's not as though we don't write some tougher risk, that I think the balance there has been good. Don Doyle and his team have been very disciplined about what we're doing. About 85% of what we write is on the casualty side, and we stay pretty strong with our terms and conditions. So I wouldn't say there's anything magical about it other than I think our model of doing businesses with just Cincinnati Insurance Company agencies has probably paid off for us."

Those results represent another solid quarter of carefully executing our strategy. They reflect personal interactions by our associates working with our agents and others to steadily improve our long-term performance by building one relationship at a time.
While our 92.4% third quarter combined ratio was quite good, it was above the outstanding sub-90% result a year ago. However, it's satisfying to see our 9-month combined ratio measures before the effects of catastrophes performing about 1 percentage point better than a year ago.
We're also pleased with another quarter of strong investment performance. And Mike will soon comment on investment income growth and portfolio valuation gains. 
Before that, I'll highlight a few more aspects of our insurance operations. We believe we're reporting a healthy rate of premium growth for each of our insurance segments.
Our work toward greater pricing precision allows us to underwrite on a policy-by-policy basis and strengthens our confidence in selecting and pricing new business from our agencies.
Pricing was generally in line with the second quarter. Consistent with where loss ratios for us and the industry indicate the most need for higher premium rates, our commercial auto and personal auto policies experienced third quarter average renewal price increases that were the highest among our major lines of business. Both had average percentage increases in the mid-single-digit range with personal auto near the high end of that range. 
Our reinsurance assumed operations, known as Cincinnati Re, saw another quarter of steady growth as our team works to selectively build out a diversified portfolio of treaty business.
Third quarter underwriting results benefited from the June 30 loss reserves that are developing favorably as we obtain additional information on reinsured claims. The resulting favorable effect for the short tail portion of the portfolio contributed to a $6 million third quarter underwriting profit for Cincinnati Re.
We also experienced ongoing progress in expanding personal lines products and services we offer to our agencies' higher net worth clients. Almost 1/4 of the total $91 million in personal lines of new business written premiums for the first 9 months of 2016 came from high net worth policies.
We continue to see good performance for our commercial line segment with a third quarter combined ratio near 90%. Our excess and surplus lines segment continued to report superb results, with a combined ratio below 70% for both the 3 and 9 months ended September 2016.
For our life insurance subsidiary, earned premiums continue to rise at a double-digit clip for both the third quarter and first 9 months of 2016, even though unlocking of interest rate and similar actuarial assumptions slowed our year-to-date growth and income.
Our primary measure of financial performance, the value creation ratio, reached 14% on a year-to-date basis with generally higher investment portfolio valuations boosting the strong 6% contribution from operating performance.
I'll also briefly comment on estimated effects of Hurricane Matthew on the fourth quarter results. While it's still early, we estimate the catastrophe incurred loss effect to be between $40 million and $65 million pretax, including a net effect of $5 million to $10 million from our reinsurance assumed operation.
While the financial impacts are important, the real story for us lies in the hard work of our field claims representatives. More than 50 associates volunteered to leave their families to help policyholders in Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina put their lives back together. We're here to pay claims. As our associates fulfill that promise with efficiency and empathy, they become our greatest sales advantage. Satisfied policyholders will share their experience with their neighbors, giving our agents and us the opportunity to write more business and continue growing our company.
With that, our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell, will comment on other areas of our financial performance."

I'll begin my comments with a few third quarter investment highlights. The third quarter 2016 was our 13th consecutive quarter of investment income growth as it rose 3% on a pretax basis and 4% on an after-tax basis. That growth continues to reflect an increase in both interest and dividend income. Our equity portfolio experienced another quarter of nice growth and unrealized gains and we reported a 1% increase in fair value.
In total, we ended the third quarter of 2016 with a net unrealized gain of more than $2.7 billion before taxes, including more than $2.1 billion in our equity portfolio. The bond portfolio's pretax average yield reported at 4.63% for the third quarter, slightly exceeded 4.62% from the last year's third quarter. Taxable bonds purchased during the first 9 months of 2016 had an average pretax yield of 4.27%, 23 basis points lower than we experienced a year ago. Tax-exempt bonds purchased averaged 2.89%, 45 basis points lower than a year ago.
Our bond portfolio's effective duration at September 30 was 4.9 years, up slightly from 4.8 years at the June -- at the end of June.
Cash flow from operating activities continued to provide funds for our investment portfolio. Funds generated from net operating cash flows for the first 9 months of 2016 rose 9% compared with a year ago and helped generate $375 million of net purchases of securities for our investment portfolio.
As always, we work to carefully manage our expenses, at the same time, strategically investing in our business. Our 9-month 2016 property casualty underwriting expense ratio rose slightly, up 0.3 percentage points compared with a year ago.
Moving to the other side of the balance sheet. Our loss reserves continued to experience favorable development as we apply a consistent approach to setting overall reserves. For the first 9 months of 2016, favorable reserve development benefited our combined ratio by 4.6 percentage points, very similar to the same period a year ago and full year 2015. Reserve development for the first 3 quarters continued to be spread over most of our major lines and over recent accident years, including 55% for accident year 2015, 24% for accident year 2014 and 15% for accident year 2013.
Overall reserves at the end of September, including accident year 2016 and net of reinsurance ceded rose 6% from last year with IBNR representing more than half of that.
Our assessment of the company's capital strength, liquidity and financial flexibility is that they remain at healthy levels. Capital management objectives include supporting future profitable growth of our insurance operations plus other areas such as returning capital to shareholders.
As usual, I'll conclude with a summary of contributions during the third quarter to book value per share. They represent the main drivers of our value creation ratio. Property casualty underwriting increased book value by $0.35. Life insurance operations added $0.05. Investment income other than life insurance and reduced by noninsurance items contributed $0.48. The change in unrealized gains at September 30 for the fixed income portfolio net of realized gains and losses decreased book value per share by $0.04. The change in unrealized gains at September 30 for the equity portfolio net of realized gains and losses increased book value by $0.51. And we declared $0.48 per share in dividends to shareholders. The net effect was a book value increase of $0.87 during the third quarter to a record $43.24 per share.
And now I'll turn the call back over to Steve."

We did, particularly relative to commercial auto, we -- we were at the council of agents and brokers meeting a couple of weeks ago, met with 40 agencies, the larger agencies out there. And the topic of conversation among those agencies was commercial auto. And the fact that, that market is firming up and that they are prepared to deliver rate increases. So that's kind of a big hurdle, that there's an acknowledgment throughout the industry of the need for more rate. And so we would anticipate that will continue into the future. But there's a variety of things we continue to do on the -- to try to address the severity issue. I think most of what we would say is, are the exact same things that others in the industry are talking about. A whole variety of things, newer cars are more expensive to fix. Aluminum's being used more than steel and that's more expensive to repair. A lot of the same things, distracted driving continues to be an issue. A lot of accidents that we've noticed, no skid marks. A lot of distracted walking and biking. We've had 2 very severe accidents in the Chicago area. You may have heard about them, that where people in bike lanes and maybe not in bike lanes, a lot more biking, for example, in metropolitan areas have resulted in some larger claims. The issue related to this driver shortage continues to be one that's talked about a lot. Drivers, some statistics from the PCI conference, drivers that are under 30 years old are 2 times more likely to have accidents. And there's a lot of discussion about older drivers being brought back, folks that haven't retired and drivers that are above 60 are 1.5 times more apt to have accidents. So we're seeing a lot of issues related to that. So what we're trying to do is to amp up our loss control, making certain that as we visit policyholders, that they have driver education programs, things of that nature. And then as we underwrite business, an awful lot of attention, additional attention is being applied to the driver information, age of drivers, the types of vehicles that those drivers are assigned to. In other words, young drivers to heavy trucks is a bad formula. So all of those things are going to be taken into consideration in addition to the rate that we expect to get."

And then, but not a frequency issue until perhaps recently. And then on the auto side, it was the opposite. We've had sort of ongoing severity running at a frequency, or pardon me, ongoing severity running sort of 3 to 5 per years, but frequency only rose sort of beginning of, well early, beginning of 2015, and have gone through increases. And it sounds like we've had some other companies talking about sort of a spike and higher frequency, particularly on the commercial auto, recently. You're saying it's not a frequency issue.

Unlike others in the E&S business, we're not going through wholesalers. We're only doing business with established relationships with the Cincinnati Insurance Company. We test that as far as the amount of opportunity we have in our agencies, there's somewhere in the area of $2 billion of E&S premium that's written, with Cincinnati Insurance Company agents. We visit the agencies in person, in many cases with our excess and surplus lines underwriters, our field reps that are in the E&S side of things. We include the premium, intermingle the premium with our standard market premiums and losses on the profit-sharing contract. So I think our agencies appreciate what we're doing. They want to make certain that the business they put with us isn't, for a lack of a better word, the type of thing you throw against the wall and see if it sticks. It's more carefully placed with us. I think our appetite is perhaps a little bit more conservative than most. Having said that, we'll finish this year at $200 million at the end of our ninth full year in the E&S business. And it's not as though we don't write some tougher risk, but I think the balance there has been good. Don Doyle and his team have been very disciplined about what we're doing. About 85% of what we write is on the casualty side, and we stay pretty strong with our terms and conditions. So I wouldn't say there's anything magical about it other than I think our model of doing business with just Cincinnati Insurance Company agencies has probably paid off for us."

Those results represent another solid quarter of carefully executing our strategy. They reflect personal interactions by our associates working with our agents and others to steadily improve our long-term performance by building one relationship at a time.
While our 92.4% third quarter combined ratio was quite good, it was above the outstanding sub-90% result a year ago. However, it's satisfying to see our 9-month combined ratio measures before the effects of catastrophes performing about 1 percentage point better than a year ago.
We're also pleased with another quarter of strong investment performance. And Mike will soon comment on investment income growth and portfolio valuation gains. 
Before that, I'll highlight a few more aspects of our insurance operations. We believe we're reporting a healthy rate of premium growth for each of our insurance segments.
Our work toward greater pricing precision allows us to underwrite on a policy-by-policy basis and strengthens our confidence in selecting and pricing new business from our agencies.
Pricing was generally in line with the second quarter. Consistent with where loss ratios for us and the industry indicate the most need for higher premium rates, our commercial auto and personal auto policies experienced third quarter average renewal price increases that were the highest among our major lines of business. Both had average percentage increases in the mid-single-digit range with personal auto near the high end of that range. 
Our reinsurance assumed operations, known as Cincinnati Re, saw another quarter of steady growth as our team works to selectively build out a diversified portfolio of treaty business.
Third quarter underwriting results benefited from the June 30 loss reserves that are developing favorably as we obtain additional information on reinsured claims. The resulting favorable effect for the short tail portion of the portfolio contributed to a $6 million third quarter underwriting profit for Cincinnati Re.
We also experienced ongoing progress in expanding personal lines products and services we offer to our agencies' higher net worth clients. Almost 1/4 of the total $91 million in personal lines of new business written premiums for the first 9 months of 2016 came from high net worth policies.
We continue to see good performance for our commercial line segment with a third quarter combined ratio near 90%. Our excess and surplus lines segment continued to report superb results, with a combined ratio below 70% for both the 3 and 9 months ended September 2016.
For our life insurance subsidiary, earned premiums continue to rise at a double-digit clip for both the third quarter and first 9 months of 2016, even though unlocking of interest rate and similar actuarial assumptions slowed our year-to-date growth and income.
Our primary measure of financial performance, the value creation ratio, reached 14% on a year-to-date basis with generally higher investment portfolio valuations boosting the strong 6% contribution from operating performance.
I'll also briefly comment on estimated effects of Hurricane Matthew on the fourth quarter results. While it's still early, we estimate the catastrophe incurred loss effect to be between $40 million and $65 million pretax, including a net effect of $5 million to $10 million from our reinsurance assumed operation.
While the financial impacts are important, the real story for us lies in the hard work of our field claims representatives. More than 50 associates volunteered to leave their families to help policyholders in Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina put their lives back together. We're here to pay claims. As our associates fulfill that promise with efficiency and empathy, they become our greatest sales advantage. Satisfied policyholders will share their experience with their neighbors, giving our agents and us the opportunity to write more business and continue growing our company.
With that, our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell, will comment on other areas of our financial performance."

I'll begin my comments with a few third quarter investment highlights. The third quarter 2016 was our 13th consecutive quarter of investment income growth as it rose 3% on a pretax basis and 4% on an after-tax basis. That growth continues to reflect an increase in both interest and dividend income. Our equity portfolio experienced another quarter of nice growth and unrealized gains and we reported a 1% increase in fair value.
In total, we ended the third quarter of 2016 with a net unrealized gain of more than $2.7 billion before taxes, including more than $2.1 billion in our equity portfolio. The bond portfolio's pretax average yield reported at 4.63% for the third quarter, slightly exceeded 4.62% from the last year's third quarter. Taxable bonds purchased during the first 9 months of 2016 had an average pretax yield of 4.27%, 23 basis points lower than we experienced a year ago. Tax-exempt bonds purchased averaged 2.89%, 45 basis points lower than a year ago.
Our bond portfolio's effective duration at September 30 was 4.9 years, up slightly from 4.8 years at the June -- at the end of June.
Cash flow from operating activities continued to provide funds for our investment portfolio. Funds generated from net operating cash flows for the first 9 months of 2016 rose 9% compared with a year ago and helped generate $375 million of net purchases of securities for our investment portfolio.
As always, we work to carefully manage our expenses, at the same time, strategically investing in our business. Our 9-month 2016 property casualty underwriting expense ratio rose slightly, up 0.3 percentage points compared with a year ago.
Moving to the other side of the balance sheet. Our loss reserves continued to experience favorable development as we apply a consistent approach to setting overall reserves. For the first 9 months of 2016, favorable reserve development benefited our combined ratio by 4.6 percentage points, very similar to the same period a year ago and full year 2015. Reserve development for the first 3 quarters continued to be spread over most of our major lines and over recent accident years, including 55% for accident year 2015, 24% for accident year 2014 and 15% for accident year 2013.
Overall reserves at the end of September, including accident year 2016 and net of reinsurance ceded rose 6% from last year with IBNR representing more than half of that.
Our assessment of the company's capital strength, liquidity and financial flexibility is that they remain at healthy levels. Capital management objectives include supporting future profitable growth of our insurance operations plus other areas such as returning capital to shareholders.
As usual, I'll conclude with a summary of contributions during the third quarter to book value per share. They represent the main drivers of our value creation ratio. Property casualty underwriting increased book value by $0.35. Life insurance operations added $0.05. Investment income other than life insurance and reduced by noninsurance items contributed $0.48. The change in unrealized gains at September 30 for the fixed income portfolio net of realized gains and losses decreased book value per share by $0.04. The change in unrealized gains at September 30 for the equity portfolio net of realized gains and losses increased book value by $0.51. And we declared $0.48 per share in dividends to shareholders. The net effect was a book value increase of $0.87 during the third quarter to a record $43.24 per share.
And now I'll turn the call back over to Steve."

We did, particularly relative to commercial auto, we -- we were at the council of agents and brokers meeting a couple of weeks ago, met with 40 agencies, the larger agencies out there. And the topic of conversation among those agencies was commercial auto. And the fact that, that market is firming up and that they are prepared to deliver rate increases. So that's kind of a big hurdle, that there's an acknowledgment throughout the industry of the need for more rate. And so we would anticipate that will continue into the future. But there's a variety of things we continue to do on the -- to try to address the severity issue. I think most of what we would say is, are the exact same things that others in the industry are talking about. A whole variety of things, newer cars are more expensive to fix. Aluminum's being used more than steel and that's more expensive to repair. A lot of the same things, distracted driving continues to be an issue. A lot of accidents that we've noticed, no skid marks. A lot of distracted walking and biking. We've had 2 very severe accidents in the Chicago area. You may have heard about them, that where people in bike lanes and maybe not in bike lanes, a lot more biking, for example, in metropolitan areas have resulted in some larger claims. The issue related to this driver shortage continues to be one that's talked about a lot. Drivers, some statistics from the PCI conference, drivers that are under 30 years old are 2 times more likely to have accidents. And there's a lot of discussion about older drivers being brought back, folks that haven't retired and drivers that are above 60 are 1.5 times more apt to have accidents. So we're seeing a lot of issues related to that. So what we're trying to do is to amp up our loss control, making certain that as we visit policyholders, that they have driver education programs, things of that nature. And then as we underwrite business, an awful lot of attention, additional attention is being applied to the driver information, age of drivers, the types of vehicles that those drivers are assigned to. In other words, young drivers to heavy trucks is a bad formula. So all of those things are going to be taken into consideration in addition to the rate that we expect to get."

And then, but not a frequency issue until perhaps recently. And then on the auto side, it was the opposite. We've had sort of ongoing severity running at a frequency, or pardon me, ongoing severity running sort of 3 to 5 per years, but frequency only rose sort of beginning of, well early, beginning of 2015, and have gone through increases. And it sounds like we've had some other companies talking about sort of a spike and higher frequency, particularly on the commercial auto, recently. You're saying it's not a frequency issue. It's all about the severity in your book. Is that fair, or am I oversimplifying?"

Unlike others in the E&S business, we're not going through wholesalers. We're only doing business with established relationships with the Cincinnati Insurance Company. We test that as far as the amount of opportunity we have in our agencies, there's somewhere in the area of $2 billion of E&S premium that's written, with Cincinnati Insurance Company agents. We visit the agencies in person, in many cases with our excess and surplus lines underwriters, our field reps that are in the E&S side of things. We include the premium, intermingle the premium with our standard market premiums and losses on the profit-sharing contract. So I think our agencies appreciate what we're doing. They want to make certain that the business they put with us isn't, for a lack of a better word, the type of thing you throw against the wall and see if it sticks. It's more carefully placed with us. I think our appetite is perhaps a little bit more conservative than most. Having said that, we'll finish this year at $200 million at the end of our ninth full year in the E&S business. And it's not as though we don't write some tougher risk, but I think the balance there has been good. Don Doyle and his team have been very disciplined about what we're doing. About 85% of what we write is on the casualty side, and we stay pretty strong with our terms and conditions. So I wouldn't say there's anything magical about it other than I think our model of doing business with just Cincinnati Insurance Company agencies has probably paid off for us."

And so we feel good about it, but we're not going to be, as a start-up here, we're not going to put demands in terms of growth or particular mixes of business. We just want them to look at them one by one, try to determine how much capital that we would want to allocate to that particular contract, really make sure that we understand it quantitatively and qualitatively and if we do, then we'll go forward with that contract. And we'll keep you posted as the numbers might move, but I have to say it's been pretty balanced as it's turned out."

About, I think 70% of the premium or so comes from our P&C agencies. And as you know, whenever multiple policies are involved, the retention rate on all of them goes up. We do have some exciting products, I think, that are on the development board that we've talked about with our agents and they're excited about, and it would be an easy issue term policy that would be marketed through our P&C agents, where we would be able to ask just a few questions and draw on data that they've provided through their personal lines applications to be inputs into a predictive model such that we could offer up to $500,000 in term coverage right on the spot, so that we think that's going to roll out early next year. The early trials that we've been putting that through seem to make it something that we're confident in. The work site products that we have on the commercial line side are a nice complement to what we're doing through our commercial insurance. And so we do think it very much complements what we do on the P&C side, allows us to have higher retention and we're confident in the growth of Cincinnati Life going forward."
