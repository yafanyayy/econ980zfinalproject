29574,322158320,934575,"Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 17, 2016",2016-02-17,"Earnings Calls","Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Gee. Good morning, everyone. Looking back on our performance in 2015, we had an active year and undertook a number of initiatives to capitalize on value enhancing opportunities to better position our company for continued growth and success. We so",2142,"Thanks, Gee. Good morning, everyone. Looking back on our performance in 2015, we had an active year and undertook a number of initiatives to capitalize on value enhancing opportunities to better position our company for continued growth and success. We sold more than $1 billion worth of hotels, including 5 of our 9 hotels in Asia as we made good progress on our plans to exit the Asia-Pacific market. We returned $1.3 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. We invested more than $1 billion in new assets in capital improvements, including the acquisition of the iconic Phoenician Resort and the completion of the major redevelopment of 4 hotels. And finally, we refinanced more than $1.4 billion of debt, reducing our average interest rate by 110 basis points to 3.7%, spending our maturity schedule and further solidifying our industry-leading balance sheet. 
Looking ahead to 2016, we will continue to support a disciplined approach to actively managing our portfolio and efficiently allocating capital. We remained focused on continually improving operational and financial performance to better drive results for our shareholders.
Now, let's review our results for the quarter and the year. Comparable hotel RevPAR for the quarter increased 3.6%, with rate growth of 1.7% and an increase in occupancy of 1.4 percentage points. For the full year, our portfolio achieved an average occupancy of more than 77%, allowing the hotels to drive average rate increase of 3.3%, resulting in an improvement in comparable hotel RevPAR of 3.8%, which equals 4% when adjusted for the impact of the USALI accounting changes.
Adjusted EBITDA was $344 million for the quarter, and $1.409 billion for the year, exceeding consensus estimates and our prior forecast. Our adjusted FFO per diluted share was $0.39 for the fourth quarter and $1.54 for the full year, also exceeding consensus estimates and reflecting a 2.7% increase over 2014.
Even though we were below our RevPAR forecast for the year, adjusted EBITDA was positively affected by the higher-than-expected profits from food and beverage and from our Maui timeshare project, as well as $5 million associated with the write-off of deferred IMF relating to a hotel that converted to a franchise and a reduction in our restricted stock expense.
The quarterly results were driven by an increase in group room nights of more than 2.5%, as Association business grew by more than 6%. Group rate improved by nearly 1.5% as corporate rate growth was up by 4%, which was significantly higher than our year-to-date results. In total, group revenues grew 4%. 
Transient demand increased by 1.5%, although it was primarily in the discount segment as corporate demand was weaker than anticipated, which may reflect the weaker GDP growth the U.S. economy experienced in Q4.
While rate growth in the discount segment was fairly solid, the negative mix shift resulted in average rate increasing just 1% and transient revenue grew just 2.5%. 
Some of the transient weakness was likely due to reduced international travel. While arrivals into the U.S. continued to grow at a healthy pace in the fourth quarter, spending declined slightly would suggest our customer still made the trip, but stayed for fewer days and likely shop less. Our census at international business declined by 5% to 10% in our hotels in the quarter.
The strong group performance translated into strong banquet and catering activity as banquet and catering revenues grew by 6.8% or 5.4% after adjusting for USALI. We experienced above expected catering activity in our Florida hotel and in our larger San Diego and San Francisco assets. Our outlets were also busy as revenues at our restaurants and lounges improved by more than 4.5%. 
Overall, SMB revenues increased 6.1%, or 4.7% after adjusting for USALI, which was one of our best quarters of the year. The higher revenues drove improved margin and our profits exceeded our expectations.
Total revenues for the quarter increased 3.6% and EBITDA margins improved by 55 basis points as a 9% reduction in utility expense and a 15% reduction in insurance costs were partially offset by a 7% increase in property taxes and an increasing ground run in one of our L.A. assets.
Transient demand represented 58% of our total room nights for the full year, an increase just slightly from last year. Transient rate increased 2.8% for the full year, as most segments experienced strong rate growth other than our OTA business. For the full year, transient revenues grew 2.9%. 
Despite starting the year with no additional group room nights on the books, compared to 2014, bookings during the year were solid and group demand improved 1.1% for the year, led by a 3% increase in association business. Overall, group demand represented 37% of our sold rooms and group revenues grew 3.1%. 
F&B revenues grew 5.2% for the full year or 2.5% after adjusting for USALI. The increase resulted from banquet revenue growth of 5.9% for the year and outlook revenue improvement of 3.8%. Reduced construction in our meeting space helped spark a 4.2% USALI adjusted SMB growth in the second half of the year.
Total revenue growth for the year improved by 3.3%, and full year EBITDA margins improved 35 basis points after adjusting for USALI. In 2015, we continued to execute on our strategic plan of reallocating capital out of markets where we expect lower growth or higher capital expenditure requirements. This approach has also enabled us to benefit from the arbitrage between private and public market valuations in the current environment. We had a very active fourth quarter for dispositions with approximately $630 million in sales completed. These included the Sheraton in Perth, the European portfolio, the Novotel in EBITs in Auckland, and the Novotel Queenstown. In addition, as we announced this morning, we closed the sale of the San Diego Mission Valley Marriott, a suburban hotel with 350 rooms, and the Novotel Wellington, a 139-room hotel located in New Zealand, for a combined sales price of almost $100 million. The average RevPAR for these hotels was approximately $116, which is consistent with our primary focus of selling lower RevPAR hotels.
The disposition of non-core assets continues to be a priority. We have an additional $117 million in assets under binding contracts, with closing slated over the next 3 months. We are currently marketing an additional $800 million of assets, with more than 1/3 of those fairly far along the process. We have been pleased with the response to our marketing efforts and remain optimistic that we will continue to complete sales, although there can be no assurances that, that will occur.
As we mentioned last fall, the sales we are targeting to complete will generate a significant amount of taxable income, which will likely result in a special dividend paid at the end of the year. Last year, we suffered significant disruptions from a number of comprehensive renovations that closed parts of several hotels at significant portions of the year. Each of the most impactful renovations: The Logan in Philadelphia, The Camby in Phoenix, the Axiom in San Francisco, and the Houston Airport Marriott, has been or is about to be completed. All the hotels are now open for business and the initial customer reaction has been quite positive. The new rooms started has been well received and the F&B outlets, especially the Urban Farm or The Logan and the at The Camby have generated significant favorable felicity.
Last year, these 4 hotels generated a loss of approximately $4 million. This year, we expect them to contribute between $28 million to $30 million in EBITDA, with additional above average growth expected in 2017.
This year, we are also completing major redevelopments of the Denver Tech marriott, the Hyatt San Francisco Airport and the exhibit Hall of the San Diego Marriott Marquis. While we expect that there will be disruptive impact at the first 2 assets I referenced, we currently anticipate that the San Diego Exhibit Hall project will be completed in midyear and the additional income it will generate will offset the negative impact from the other 2 assets on a full-year basis when compared to 2015.
All 3 hotels should generate above transient improvement in 2017. This morning, based on our closing price from last night, we are trading at the value of 260,000 a key, compared to an estimated replacement cost that exceeds 500,000 a key. Based on the midpoint of our guidance range, which I will discuss shortly, we are trading at 1.5 EBITDA multiple and an 8.5% cap rate. Both measures reflect valuations that are significantly lower than our historical averages, and we believe our stock represents an excellent value opportunity.
As we generate cash flow from operations and asset sales, we believe the best way to deliver the most value for shareholders is to repurchase our undervalued stock. In line with this approach, we purchased a total of $325 million of stock in the fourth quarter, bringing our total for the year to $675 million. When combined with almost $650 million in dividends, we paid over the last 12 months, we have returned approximately $1.3 billion in capital to our shareholders. Assuming 2016 plays out consistently with our expectations, we would continue to execute on our existing share repurchase program and revisit the size of the program later in the year.
The guidance we announced this morning reflects the following: Nationwide supplier growth when net and for likely closures is now approaching the long-term average of 2% for the next couple of years. However, supply growth in the top 20 major markets has accelerated more quickly, and is now likely to exceed 3%. While upper upscale supply in these markets, which is most directly competitive with our portfolio should not exceed 1.5%, strong supply growth in the upscale and midscale segments is driving the overall supply level higher, our portfolio will not be immune to impact from this new supply.
Over the last 3 years, demand growth has averaged more than 3% in the top 20 markets, but consensus forecasts suggest that may moderate slightly in 2016, given the weak economic growth in the fourth quarter and the general lowering of GDP forecast for 2016. We are also watching international travel carefully as it impacts the gateway markets. The combined effect of these 2 factors, which likely influenced the weaker-than-expected fourth quarter room revenue growth in the industry, suggest that demand may not match the flag growth of 2016 progresses.
On a positive side, we had very strong group bookings in the fourth quarter, with the bookings up more than 4.5%. We are starting 2016 with group revenues up more than 6% compared to 2015, which positions us to maintain strong occupancies and drive higher rate of transient business.
In addition, our negotiated rates in those markets have increased more in 2016 than they did in 2015, providing support for transient rate growth. Finally, we have had a solid start in January, reversing the trend we experienced in the fourth quarter as our preliminary RevPAR growth estimate for the month is approximately 3.8%, and that is after the negative impact of about 1% of lost RevPAR driven by cancellations in Washington and New York due to the severe snowstorm.
As we indicated last year, we also expect to benefit from this construction disruption in 2016 as our maintenance capital spending should decline by more than 18% and the hotels we invested in last year not only face an easier year-over-year comp, but also have an approved product to sell. Given all these factors, we projected in 2016 total comparable hotel RevPAR will increase by 3% to 4% in constant currency and EBITDA margins will increase 0 to 40 basis points. This will translate to adjusted EBITDA of $1.450 billion to $1.480 billion and adjusted FFO per share of $1.65 to $1.69.
It is worth noting that our EBITDA and FFO estimates have been reduced by $14 million to reflect the impact of the $215 million of 2016 asset sales we have identified. However, our balance sheet does not reflect the receipt of the proceeds that these sales will generate.
Overall, I'm pleased to say that we are still seeing positive indicators within our portfolio, with continued strong demand, especially in the group segment. The capital we have invested in our hotels ensures that our portfolio has an excellent condition and our industry's leading balance sheet remains strong. We also remained focused on generating cash from asset sales and operations that can be deployed stock repurchases and returning value to our shareholders. We are confident in the future of our business and our entire team is built focus on delivering another positive year of growth. 
Thank you, and I'll let me turn the call over to Greg Larson, our Chief Financial Officer, who will discuss our operating and financial performance in more detail."

Despite the fourth quarter headwinds that Ed described, several of our important markets, including Florida, Los Angeles, Atlanta, San Diego and Boston, experienced excellent RevPAR growth and continued to give us confidence as we look ahea",1949,"Thank you, Ed. Despite the fourth quarter headwinds that Ed described, several of our important markets, including Florida, Los Angeles, Atlanta, San Diego and Boston, experienced excellent RevPAR growth and continued to give us confidence as we look ahead into 2016.
Let me provide some specific commentary on our major markets. Florida performed very well, and produced the best domestic market performance, with 11.7% RevPAR growth in the fourth quarter, 310 basis points above the STAR upper upscale market RevPAR. Strong group business at our Orlando World Center, Ritz-Carlton Naples, Harbor Beach Marriott and Tampa Airport Marriott, contributed to high average rate growth at these properties.
With the group revenue increase of almost 22%, our managers at our Florida hotels were able to institute more aggressive pricing strategies, which increased transient rates by approximately 7%. In addition, strong group business resulted in more than 23% growth in food and beverage revenues. 
RevPAR at the hotels in Los Angeles grew 9.8% in the fourth quarter, as several of our properties benefited from renovations that occurred during the same time last year. Once again, strong RevPAR growth in Los Angeles was the result of robust average rate growth of more than 5% in both transient and group business.
On the back of group business strength at our hotels, our managers were able to drive food and beverage revenue growth of more than 17%. Looking forward, group booking pays in Los Angeles looks very strong as the market is expected to host 8 additional citywide in 2016. As a result, we expect continued solid performance from our Los Angeles properties.
In Atlanta, RevPAR increased 8.2% for the quarter, primarily as a result of average rate growth of 6.3%. Transient average rate increased 6.6% and 5.2%, respectively. Food and beverage revenues at our properties in the market grew by 8.7%, mainly due to healthy banquet and catering business at the JW Marriott and Grand Hyatt Marriott hotel. We expect our asset in Atlanta will continue to have a solid year in 2016, based on an excellent group booking pays for the year. Atlanta is expected to add more than 8,500 room nights related to 2 additional megacitywide. Our hotels in San Diego produce results that outperformed the average of our portfolio, with RevPAR increasing by 7.5% in the fourth quarter. The Manchester Grand Hyatt benefited from having all of its meeting space available for bookings after renovations last year.
In addition, our managers in San Diego strategically focused on group business at the expense of transient room nights to drive the hotel's overall average rate. In the quarter, group demand increased 7.3% and transient room nights fell 9.8%. As hotels filled with group business, it enabled our managers to become more aggressive with average rate, which resulted in group and transient average rate growth of 9.2% and 7.5%, respectively.
Overall, group revenues increased by more than 17%, contributing to a food and beverage revenue increase of nearly 18%, while transient revenues declined 3%. 
I should point out that nearly all of the increase in food and beverage came from the more profitable banquet and catering business. We expect the trend of our San Diego Hotel outperforming the portfolio to continue in 2016. Even though the city is expected to have fewer citywides this year, total room nights from the citywide is expected to increase by more than 20%. 
In Boston, our assets outperformed the portfolio average with a RevPAR increase of 6.9%, driven by an occupancy gain of 3.5%, coupled with an average rate increase of 1.9%. 
In October, group room nights where our properties in the market grew at 24.4%, with a 3.5% increase in average rates, again, this helps contribute to an 18% increase in food and beverage revenues this quarter. As we look forward to 2016, I would note that although the Boston market is expected to have an average number of citywide, the Convention Center is expected to host 5 additional events. This bodes well for both our Boston Marriott and Sheraton Boston Hotels as we expect these hotels to benefit from these additional events and lead our Boston hotels supposed solid results in 2016.
Moving to some of our markets that witnessed some weakness in the quarter. RevPAR at our hotels in D.C. increased 0.6%, with average rate growth of 1.6%, and an occupancy decline of 70 basis points. The main reason for properties in the markets underperforming the STAR upper upscale market by 250 basis points was due to a combination of the lack of in-house groups and softer transient business.
In 2016, the number of citywide events was flat 2015. However, the number of citywide room nights was up approximately 85,000 over last year. For 2016, the group booking pays for our D.C. hotels was very strong and many of these hotels are expected to benefit from substantial renovations that were completed in 2015.
Unfortunately, RevPAR at our assets in Houston declined 1.1%. However, the good news is that our properties outperformed the STAR upper upscale markets by 690 basis points. The decline in the market continues to be attributable to an overall slowdown in the Houston economy as a result of severely depressed oil prices, increasing market supply and specifically for Host, the renovation of the Houston Marriott Medical Center Hotel.
Our managers continue to focus on growing group room nights to offset the transient decline caused by weaker market fundamentals. We do not expect Houston's market conditions to improve in 2016, therefore, we expect these hotels to continue underperforming the portfolio. Bear in mind that the hotels in the Houston market represent only 2% of our total EBITDA.
Likewise, our New York hotels experienced a 2.4% RevPAR decline in the fourth quarter, slightly outperforming the STAR upper upscale market RevPAR decline of 2.5%. Much of the weakness was due to average rate, which decreased 2%, although occupancy declined 40 basis points. These results continued to indicate that the well-understood supply in the market and a decrease in demand from international travelers, due to the strength of the U.S. dollar, are impacting the overall marketability to raise rates. We expect RevPAR in New York to significantly lag the portfolio in 2016, and acknowledge that the dynamics that impacted the market in 2015 will likely persist this year.
Moving to our international assets. These hotels in an impressive constant of dollar RevPAR growth of 15.5% in the quarter. Latin America drove much of the international growth, with a constant dollar RevPAR increase of 39%. This growth was spurred by the benefit of the renovated hotels at JW Marriott Mexico City, despite economic turmoil related to weakness in the global oil markets and tourism issues related to Zika virus in Brazil, the JW Marriott Rio had an outstanding quarter.
As we continued to simplify the portfolio through non-core asset sales of both Latin America and Asia-Pacific, we expect the EBITDA impact from our international hotels to decline.
Shifting to our European joint venture. Despite the negative impact of the terrorist attacks in Paris in the subsequent lockdown in Brussels, our assets in the region performed relatively well with a constant year of RevPAR increase of 1.7% for the quarter as the significant decline in RevPAR at the hotels in these 2 markets were more than offset by the robust growth of more than 10% at the hotels in our other European markets. RevPAR increase was due to an increase in average rate of over 6%, which was offset by a decline in occupancy of about 3 percentage points. As occupancies for both transient and group business declined, it is encouraging to see that our managers were able to increase transient and group rates in the quarter by 6% and 10%, respectively.
There were some uncertainties surrounding 2016 in light of the 2015 Paris terrorist attack and economic and political recovery that is ongoing in the European Union. However, many positive market fundamentals exist, including the fact that supply remains low in Europe at approximately 1%, and weak euro to the U.S. dollar will likely drive demand from the U.S. to Europe, and the economic environment in Europe is cautiously optimistic.
Now, let's move to our forecast for 2016. With respect to the RevPAR guidance we gave today of 3% to 4% for the portfolio, it is worth noting that we expect 13 of our top 17 domestic markets to experience RevPAR growth that will exceed the high end of our portfolio RevPAR forecast. These markets are expected to perform well based on advanced group bookings, less capital disruption and lower supply. In fact, we expect some of our best-performing markets will be Los Angeles, San Diego, Phoenix, Atlanta and New Orleans. However, the challenges in New York and Houston will continue in 2016.
Other factors to keep in mind for 2016 are the calendar shift as these will affect the overall quarterly results. Eastern moves to the first quarter and a Jewish holiday to the fourth quarter this year. This is reflect it in our group bookings as they are strongest in the second and third quarters, but still positive in all 4 quarters. We expect approximately 22% to 22.5% of our total EBITDA for the year to be generated in the first quarter.
As disclosed in our press release, during the fourth quarter, we repurchased 19.6 million shares to our total purchase price of $325 million, bringing a total for 2015 to 38.3 million shares of common stock, for a total purchase price of approximately 675 million. We currently have $325 million of capacity under the repurchase program.
With respect to dividends, we paid a regular fourth quarter dividend of $0.20 per share, which represents a yield of 5.4% on the current stock price. Further, as stated in today's press release, the Board of Directors authorized a regular first quarter dividend of $0.20 per share on its common stock.
Given our strong operating outlook and significant free cash flow generation, we are committed to sustaining a meaningful dividend. In addition, based on the robust asset sales plan we've outlined and continued to execute on, we anticipate that asset sales will likely result in taxable gains, which could lead to special dividends. While these special dividends will vary and the one-time distribution, they should result in a meaningful return to our stockholders.
Moving to one of our key pillars of strength and competitive advantage, our balance sheet. In 2015, we repaid or refinanced more than $1.4 billion of debt with a weighted average interest rate of 5%, with proceeds from the issuance of $1.5 billion of debt with a weighted average rate of 3.1%. As a result of these transactions, we decreased our weighted average interest rate by 110 basis points to 3.7% and lowered our annualized interest expense by $24 million to $165 million, and extended our weighted average debt maturity by 0.8 years to 6 yes. We have no significant maturities until 2019 and our operating position, financial strength and flexibility.
At year-end, we had approximately $239 million of cash, $702 million in available capacity under our revolving credit facility and $4 billion of debt, while maintaining a leverage within our stated goals of 2.5 to 3x.
In summary, we feel good about the results -- about our results and accomplishments in 2015 and look forward to a solid year of growth in 2016, as we believe the softness we witnessed in transit business in the fourth quarter will be offset by our aggressive asset management strategies and the tailwinds we received from our comprehensive capital program in 2015.
This concludes our prepared remarks. We are now interested in answering any questions you may have."

So I don't see that if I -- there's always going to be an asset or 2 where we made a conscious decision not to do capital for a variety of reasons, and some of those are the ones that we're intending on selling, because we think that allowing the buyer to do that capital will ultimately enhance the total price that they be able to pay for the assets taking into account the CapEx that might be required. But outside of some handful of unique situations like that, our portfolio is in good shape.

All of those hotels are for our RevPAR purposes, are forecast non-comparable. So the incredible increase in revenues that we will see at those hotels is not included in our RevPAR forecast. And so that's one of the reasons why I think people as -- we are getting the lift from that and we're trying to describe the lift that we're getting from an EBITDA perspective, but the benefits of that are not showing up in our comparable RevPAR numbers, those numbers will not likely show up until most likely '17, when those projects have been in our portfolio operating on a stable -- not stabilized fashion, but operating as a complete the total for a full year.

A lot of those renovations had started at the very end of the quarter. And frankly, with December being a low occupancy month, I don't know that we necessarily saw as much benefit in '15 as we might have anticipated. We will see some lift and some positive benefits from that in the first half of the year.

So in the markets where we've seen, such as in New York, there's no secret that New York got a lot of supply, and we have consciously tried to improve the level of group activity that we do in that market as a way to offset some of the increased supply that we expect to see."

It was -- October was filled because you had have the movement in the holiday, the Jewish holiday, from September from October to prior year into September. So October was a very busy month, but there wasn't really any capacity at the hotels to take a lot of additional group.

I think what we ran into in the fourth quarter was because we did see what is generally assumed to be some weakness in corporate travel, there was a little bit more use of OTA options than we had necessarily predicted and what do so with that was slightly lower pricing in an effort to attract more of that business.

And of course, this is one place we're working with a lot of the major operators is probably helpful for us, to push towards pricing strategies that, in effect, create some frictional cost around changing reservations at the last minute. And we will continue to encourage that they look at either nonrefundable rooms or extending the time period for which when you have to cancel in order to make it more difficult for people to reserve a room with us for a long period of time, and then change their mind at the last minute, and rebook elsewhere. For your fundamental point, we do not see an acceleration of that activity in the fourth quarter. On the margin piece of it, you know, I'd say that the some of the fact of the margins, no real expense that we necessarily have highlighted that would drive weaker margin performance.

As we -- because we sold so many rooms already to potential group customers, it wouldn't surprise us that as we work our way through the year that the actual increase in group revenues that we experienced by the end of the year would be a smaller number than that. In other words, it's not abnormal to see some follow-up in that area, especially with an extended booking cycle. So my guess is as that we report group revenues throughout the course of the year, the actual beat there will be a little bit less than that. So that probably addresses some of what you're looking at. I'd say more broadly, as we maybe as a more broad commentary on our guidance, in general, our properties are more optimistic than our guidance would necessarily reflect. And we do see some benefits whether it's in the Special Corporate weights that I talked about before, the fact that our government rates are up meaningfully year-over-year, well, that's not a huge job of our business where you see some rate increases. There are a number of factors like that, that will help with transient pricing. We're not expecting a lot of transient occupancy increase, we think it will be primarily a rate gain this year. If we add -- but I think you're right, you're sort of fundamental assumption is that if we hit our numbers, and that hit the projections that we've identified, we're probably see it will be slightly more weighted towards group and slightly less weighted towards transient in terms of revenue growth."

What we've been noticing in a number of markets over here is that the outlook for supply is in each of the last few years what's expected to be delivered at the beginning of the year and what's actually delivered by the end of the year turns out to be a lower number, because the deliveries don't happen at the same pace it's originally forecasted, so that might help mitigate that. But I'd say, at this stage, as we look at the year, the only reason why I might anticipate that the first half could be a little stronger than the second half as it relates to construction disruption because we had more in the first half than we had in the second half.

You know, the wild card in group over the years has tended to be what I think you were directing your question at, which is happening on the corporate side. And what we saw this past year was fairly good, we saw some improvement on the -- in terms of Association. But as I say mentioned in my prepared comments, we saw some really good corporate rate improvement, as well as some improvement in corporate demand in the fourth quarter. And I think what we're looking at in terms of why we've seen an improvement in group pays this year is a combination of a slight, probably a slightly better convention calendar riches affect itself in a slight increase in Association business across all of our hotels. But more importantly, more activity coming out of the corporate side and companies recognizing that they are going to have events and their now of a mind that they're convinced enough that they're going to have them and that they're making a decision to book those events in advance and not wait till the last minute because what they realized if they wait to the last minute, they're not going to end up with the time or the hotels that they want. So I suspect as we work our way through this year, while it's fair to assume that they'll be some pickup in Association business, I'm hopeful that we're going to see good strong corporate growth. That also tends to tie in with the fact that we're -- it could reflect itself in terms of better F&B growth too. So I think, ultimately, because corporate -- the corporate group is the part that ebbs and flows from those, based upon the overall economy, the fact that we are seeing the strong growth is likely  primarily due to strong corporate growth. I'm sure that the oil industry, to your point about different business, I'm sure the oil industry with all the challenges that they have, is not necessarily booking as many group events as they might have in the past. So it is sort of interesting to see, as Greg just referenced, how strong our group booking pays is in Houston. I suspect that has more to do with a smaller, overall group profile for the hotel. But I don't know that we've heard of any other industry besides the energy industry that's cutting back at this point. If anything, our numbers, which again as we suggested, not only strong for '16, they're strong for '17, that suggested there's meaningful level of confidence in companies that are making commitments."

29574,322158320,934836,"Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 17, 2016",2016-02-17,"Earnings Calls","Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Gee. Good morning, everyone. Looking back on our performance in 2015, we had an active year and undertook a number of initiatives to capitalize on value enhancing opportunities to better position our company for continued growth and success. We so",2156,"Thanks, Gee. Good morning, everyone. Looking back on our performance in 2015, we had an active year and undertook a number of initiatives to capitalize on value enhancing opportunities to better position our company for continued growth and success. We sold more than $1 billion worth of hotels, including 5 of our 9 hotels in Asia as we made good progress on our plans to exit the Asia-Pacific market.
We returned $1.3 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. We invested more than $1 billion in new assets and capital improvements, including the acquisition of the iconic Phoenician Resort and the completion of the major redevelopment of 4 hotels.
And finally, we refinanced more than $1.4 billion of debt, reducing our average interest rate by 110 basis points to 3.7%, spending our maturity schedule and further solidifying our industry-leading balance sheet.
Looking ahead to 2016, we will continue to support a disciplined approach to actively managing our portfolio and efficiently allocating capital. We remain focused on continually improving operational and financial performance to better drive results for our shareholders.
Now let's review our results for the quarter and the year. Comparable hotel RevPAR for the quarter increased 3.6%, with rate growth of 1.7% and an increase in occupancy of 1.4 percentage points. For the full year, our portfolio achieved an average occupancy of more than 77%, allowing the hotels to drive average rate increase of 3.3%, resulting in an improvement in comparable hotel RevPAR of 3.8%, which equals 4% when adjusted for the impact of the USALI accounting changes.
Adjusted EBITDA was $344 million for the quarter, and $1.409 billion for the full year, exceeding consensus estimates and our prior forecast. Our adjusted FFO per diluted share was $0.39 for the fourth quarter and $1.54 for the full year, also exceeding consensus estimates and reflecting a 2.7% increase over 2014.
Even though we were below our RevPAR forecast for the year, adjusted EBITDA was positively affected by the higher-than-expected profits from food and beverage and from our Maui timeshare project, as well as $5 million associated with the write-off of deferred IMF relating to a hotel that converted to a franchise and a reduction in our restricted stock expense.
The quarterly results were driven by an increase in group room nights of more than 2.5%, as Association business grew by more than 6%. Group room rate improved by nearly 1.5% as corporate rate growth was up by 4%, which was significantly higher than our year-to-date results. In total, group revenues grew 4%.
Transient demand increased by 1.5%, although it was primarily in the discount segment as corporate demand was weaker than anticipated, which may reflect the weaker GDP growth, the U.S. economy experienced in Q4.
While rate growth in the discount segment was fairly solid, the negative mix shift resulted in average rate increasing just 1% and transient revenue grew just 2.5%.
Some of the transient weakness was likely due to reduced international travel. While arrivals into the U.S. continued to grow at a healthy pace in the fourth quarter, spending declined slightly which suggest that our customers still made the trip, but stayed for fewer days and likely shop less. Our census at international business declined by 5% to 10% in our hotels, in the quarter.
The strong group performance translated into strong banquet and catering activity as banquet and catering revenues grew by 6.8% or 5.4% after adjusting for USALI. We experienced above expected catering activity in our Florida hotel and in our larger San Diego and San Francisco assets. Our outlets were also busy as revenues at our restaurants and lounges improved by more than 4.5%. 
Overall, SMB revenues increased 6.1%, or 4.7% after adjusting for USALI, which was one of our best quarters of the year. The higher revenues drove improved margin and our profits exceeded our expectations.
Total revenues for the quarter increased 3.6% and EBITDA margins improved by 55 basis points, as a 9% reduction in utility expense and a 15% reduction in insurance costs were partially offset by a 7% increase in property taxes and an increase in ground rent in one of our L.A. assets.
Transient demand represented 58% of our total room nights for the full year, an increase just slightly from last year. Transient rate increased 2.8% for the full year, as most segments experienced strong rate growth other than our OTA business. For the full year, transient revenues grew 2.9%.
Despite starting the year with no additional group room nights on the books, compared to 2014, bookings during the year were solid and group demand improved 1.1% for the year, led by a 3% increase in association business. Overall, group demand represented 37% of our sold rooms and group revenues grew 3.1%.
F&B revenues grew 5.2% for the full year or 2.5% after adjusting for USALI. The increase resulted from banquet revenue growth of 5.9% for the year and outlook revenue improvement of 3.8%. Reduced construction in our meeting space helped to spark a 4.2% USALI adjusted SMB growth in the second half of the year.
Total revenue growth for the year improved by 3.3%, and full year EBITDA margins improved 35 basis points after adjusting for USALI. In 2015, we continued to execute on our strategic plan of reallocating capital out of markets where we expect lower growth or higher capital expenditure requirements. This approach has also enabled us to benefit from the arbitrage between private and public market valuations in the current environment. We had a very active fourth quarter for dispositions with approximately $630 million in sales completed. These included the Sheraton Four Points in Perth, the 8 property European portfolio, the Novotel and ibis in Auckland, and the Novotel Queenstown.
In addition, as we announced this morning, we closed the sale of the San Diego Mission Valley Marriott, a suburban hotel with 350 rooms, and the Novotel Wellington, a 139-room hotel located in New Zealand, for a combined sales price of almost $100 million. The average RevPAR for these 2 hotels was approximately $116, which is consistent with our primary focus of selling lower RevPAR hotels.
The disposition of non-core assets continues to be a priority. We have an additional $117 million in assets under binding contracts, with closing slated over the next 3 months. We are currently marketing an additional $800 million of assets, with more than 1/3 of those fairly far along the process. We have been pleased with the response to our marketing efforts and remain optimistic that we will continue to complete sales, although there can be no assurances that, that will occur.
As we mentioned in the last call, the sales we are targeting to complete will generate a significant amount of taxable income, which will likely result in a special dividend paid at the end of the year. Last year, we suffered significant disruptions from a number of comprehensive renovations that closed parts of several hotels at significant portions of the year.
Each of the most impactful renovations: The Logan in Philadelphia, The Camby in Phoenix, the Axiom in San Francisco, and the Houston Airport Marriott, has been or is about to be completed. All the hotels are now open for business and the initial customer reaction has been quite positive. The new rooms product has been well received and the F&B outlets, especially the Urban Farm versus The Logan and the [indiscernible] at The Camby have generated significant, favorable publicity.
Last year, these 4 hotels generated a loss of approximately $4 million. This year, we expect them to contribute between $28 million to $30 million in EBITDA, with additional above average growth expected in 2017.
This year, we are also completing major redevelopments of the Denver Tech Marriott, the Hyatt San Francisco Airport and the exhibit Hall of the San Diego Marriott Marquis. While we expect that there will be disruptive impact at the first 2 assets I referenced, we currently anticipate that the San Diego Exhibit Hall project will be completed in midyear and the additional income it will generate will offset the negative impact from the other 2 assets on a full-year basis when compared to 2015.
All 3 hotels should generate above trend improvement in 2017. This morning, based on our closing price from last night, we are trading at a value of 260,000 a key, compared to an estimated replacement cost that exceeds 500,000 a key. Based on the midpoint of our guidance range, which I will discuss shortly, we are trading at 10.5 EBITDA multiple and an 8.5% cap rate. Both measures reflect valuations that are significantly lower than our historical averages, and we believe our stock represents an excellent value opportunity.
As we generate cash flow from operations and asset sales, we believe the best way to deliver the most value for shareholders is to repurchase our undervalued stock. In line with this approach, we purchased a total of $325 million of stock in the fourth quarter, bringing our total for the year to $675 million. When combined with almost $650 million in dividends, we paid over the last 12 months, we have returned approximately $1.3 billion in capital to our shareholders. Assuming 2016 plays out consistently with our expectations, we would continue to execute on our existing share repurchase program and revisit the size of the program later in the year.
The guidance we announced this morning reflects the following: Nationwide supplier growth when netted for likely closures is now approaching the long-term average of 2% for the next couple of years. However, supply growth in the top 20 major markets has accelerated more quickly, and is now likely to exceed 3%. While upper upscale supply in these markets, which is most directly competitive with our portfolio should not exceed 1.5%, strong supply growth in the upscale and mid-scale segments is driving the overall supply levels higher, our portfolio will not be immune to impact from this new supply.
Over the last 3 years, demand growth has averaged more than 3% in the top 20 markets, but consensus forecasts suggest they may moderate slightly in 2016, given the weak economic growth in the fourth quarter and the general lowering of GDP forecast for 2016. We are also launching international travel carefully as it impacts the gateway markets. The combined effect of these 2 factors, which likely influence the weaker-than-expected fourth quarter room revenue growth in the industry, suggest that demand may not match supply growth as 2016 progresses.
On the positive side, we had very strong group bookings in the fourth quarter, with the bookings up more than 4.5%. We are starting 2016 with group revenues up more than 6% compared to 2015, which positions us to maintain strong occupancies and drive higher rate of transient business.
In addition, our negotiated rates in most markets have increased more in 2016 than they did in 2015, providing support for transient rate growth. Finally, we have had a solid start in January, reversing the trend we experienced in the fourth quarter as our preliminary RevPAR growth estimate for the month is approximately 3.8%, and that is after the negative impact of about 1% of lost RevPAR driven by cancellations in Washington and New York due to the severe snowstorm.
As we indicated last year, we also expect to benefit from less construction disruption in 2016 as our maintenance capital spending should decline by more than 18%. And the hotels we invested in last year not only face an easier year-over-year comp, but also have an improved product to sell.
Given all these factors, we projected in 2016 total comparable hotel RevPAR will increase by 3% to 4% in constant currency and EBITDA margins will increase 0 to 40 basis points. This will translate to adjusted EBITDA of $1.450 billion to $1.480 billion and adjusted FFO per share of $1.65 to $1.69.
It is worth noting that our EBITDA and FFO estimates have been reduced by $14 million to reflect the impact of the $215 million of 2016 asset sales we have identified. However, our balance sheet does not reflect the receipt of the proceeds that these sales will generate.
Overall, I'm pleased to say that we are still seeing positive indicators within our portfolio, with continued strong demand, especially in the group segment. The capital we have invested in our hotels ensures that our portfolio has an excellent condition and our industry's leading balance sheet remains strong. We also remained focused on generating cash from asset sales and operations that can be deployed at the stock repurchases and returning value to our shareholders. We are confident in the future of our business and our entire team is built to focus on delivering another positive year of growth.
Thank you, and now let me turn the call over to Greg Larson, our Chief Financial Officer, who will discuss our operating and financial performance in more detail."

Despite the fourth quarter headwinds that Ed described, several of our important markets, including Florida, Los Angeles, Atlanta, San Diego and Boston, experienced excellent RevPAR growth and continued to give us confidence as we look ahea",1955,"Thank you, Ed. Despite the fourth quarter headwinds that Ed described, several of our important markets, including Florida, Los Angeles, Atlanta, San Diego and Boston, experienced excellent RevPAR growth and continued to give us confidence as we look ahead into 2016.
Let me provide some specific commentary on our major markets. Florida performed very well, and produced the best domestic market performance, with 11.7% RevPAR growth in the fourth quarter, 310 basis points above the STAR upper upscale market RevPAR. Strong group business at our Orlando World Center, Ritz-Carlton Naples, Harbor Beach Marriott and Tampa Airport Marriott, contributed to high average rate growth at these properties.
With the group revenue increase of almost 22%, our managers at our Florida hotels were able to institute more aggressive pricing strategies, which increased transient rates by approximately 7%. In addition, strong group business resulted in more than 23% growth in food and beverage revenues.
RevPAR at the hotels in Los Angeles grew 9.8% in the fourth quarter, as several of our properties benefited from renovations that occurred during the same time last year. Once again, strong RevPAR growth in Los Angeles was the result of robust average rate growth of more than 5% in both transient and group business.
On the back of [ph] group business strength at our hotels, our managers were able to drive food and beverage revenue growth of more than 17%. Looking forward, group booking pays in Los Angeles looks very strong as the market is expected to host 8 additional citywide in 2016. As a result, we expect continued solid performance from our Los Angeles properties.
In Atlanta, RevPAR increased 8.2% for the quarter, primarily as a result of average rate growth of 6.3%. Transient average rate increased 6.6% and 5.2%, respectively. Food and beverage revenues at our properties in the market grew by 8.7%, mainly due to healthy banquet and catering business at the JW Marriott [indiscernible] and Grand Hyatt [indiscernible] hotel. We expect our assets in Atlanta will continue to have a solid year in 2016, based on an excellent group booking pays for the year. Atlanta is expected to add more than 8,500 room nights related to 2 additional mega citywide. [ph] Our hotels in San Diego produce results that outperformed the average of our portfolio, with RevPAR increasing by 7.5% in the fourth quarter. The Manchester Grand Hyatt benefited from having all of its meeting space available for bookings after renovations last year.
In addition, our managers in San Diego strategically focused on group business at the expense of transient room nights to drive the hotel's overall average rate. In the quarter, group demand increased 7.3% and transient room nights fell 9.8%. As hotels filled with group business, it enabled our managers to become more aggressive with average rate, which resulted in group and transient average rate growth of 9.2% and 7.5%, respectively.
Overall, group revenues increased by more than 17%, contributing to a food and beverage revenue increase of nearly 18%, while transient revenues declined 3%. 
I should point out that nearly all of the increase in food and beverage came from the more profitable banquet and catering business. We expect the trend of our San Diego Hotel outperforming the portfolio to continue in 2016. Even though the city is expected to have fewer citywide this year, total room nights from the citywide is expected to increase by more than 20%. 
In Boston, our assets outperformed the portfolio average with a RevPAR increase of 6.9%, driven by an occupancy gain of 3.5%, coupled with an average rate increase of 1.9%. 
In October, group room nights where our properties in the market grew at 24.4%, with a 3.5% increase in average rates, again, this helps contribute to an 18% increase in food and beverage revenues this quarter. As we look forward to 2016, I would note that although the Boston market is expected to have an average number of citywide, the Convention Center is expected to host 5 additional events. This bodes well for both our Boston Marriott and Sheraton Boston Hotels, as we expect these hotels to benefit from these additional events and lead our Boston hotels to post solid results in 2016.
Moving to some of our markets that witnessed some weakness in the quarter. RevPAR at our hotels in D.C. increased 0.6%, with average rate growth of 1.6%, and an occupancy decline of 70 basis points. The main reason for our properties in the markets underperforming the STAR upper upscale market by 250 basis points was due to a combination of the lack of in-house groups and softer transient business.
In 2016, the number of citywide events was flat for [ph] 2015. However, the number of citywide room nights was up approximately 85,000 over last year. For 2016, the group booking pays for our D.C. hotels was very strong and many of these hotels are expected to benefit from substantial renovations that were completed in 2015.
Unfortunately, RevPAR at our assets in Houston declined 1.1%. However, the good news is that our properties outperformed the STAR upper upscale markets by 690 basis points. The decline in the market continues to be attributable to an overall slowdown in the Houston economy as a result of severely depressed oil prices, increasing market supply and specifically for Host, the renovation of the Houston Marriott Medical Center Hotel.
Our managers continue to focus on growing group room nights to offset the transient decline caused by weaker market fundamentals. We do not expect Houston's market conditions to improve in 2016, therefore, we expect these hotels to continue underperforming the portfolio. Bear in mind that the hotels in the Houston market represent only 2% of our total EBITDA.
Likewise, our New York hotels experienced a 2.4% RevPAR decline in the fourth quarter, slightly outperforming the STAR upper upscale market RevPAR decline of 2.5%. Much of the weakness was due to average rate, which decreased 2%, although occupancy declined 40 basis points. These results continued to indicate that the well-understood supply in the market and a decrease in demand from international travelers, due to the strength of the U.S. dollar, are impacting the overall marketability to raise rates. We expect RevPAR in New York to significantly lag the portfolio in 2016, and acknowledge that the dynamics that impacted the market in 2015 will likely persist this year.
Moving to our international assets. These hotels in an impressive constant dollar RevPAR growth of 15.5% in the quarter. Latin America drove much of the international growth, with a constant dollar RevPAR increase of 39%. This growth was spurred by the benefit of the renovated hotels at JW Marriott Mexico City, despite economic turmoil related to weakness in the global oil markets and tourism issues related to Zika virus in Brazil, the JW Marriott Rio had an outstanding quarter.
As we continued to simplify the portfolio through non-core asset sales of both Latin America and Asia-Pacific, we expect the EBITDA impact from our international hotels to decline.
Shifting to our European joint venture. Despite the negative impact of the terrorist attacks in Paris and the subsequent lockdown in Brussels, our assets in the region performed relatively well with a constant year of RevPAR increase of 1.7% for the quarter as the significant decline in RevPAR at the hotels in these 2 markets were more than offset by the robust growth of more than 10% at the hotels in our other European markets. RevPAR increase was due to an increase in average rate of over 6%, which was offset by a decline in occupancy of about 3 percentage points. As occupancies for both transient and group business declined, it is encouraging to see that our managers were able to increase transient and group rates in the quarter by 6% and 10%, respectively.
There were uncertainties surrounding 2016 in light of the 2015 Paris terrorist attack and economic and political recovery that is ongoing in the European Union. However, many positive market fundamentals exist, including the fact that supply remains low in Europe at approximately 1%, and weak euro to the U.S. dollar will likely drive demand from the U.S. to Europe, and the economic environment in Europe is cautiously optimistic.
Now let's move to our forecast for 2016. With respect to the RevPAR guidance we gave today of 3% to 4% for the portfolio, it is worth noting that we expect 13 of our top 17 domestic markets to experience RevPAR growth that will exceed the high end of our portfolio RevPAR forecast. These markets are expected to perform well based on advanced group bookings, less capital disruption and lower supply. In fact, we expect some of our best-performing markets will be Los Angeles, San Diego, Phoenix, Atlanta and New Orleans. However, the challenges in New York and Houston will continue in 2016.
Other factors to keep in mind for 2016 are the calendar shift as these will affect the overall quarterly results. Eastern moves to the first quarter and a Jewish holiday moves to the fourth quarter this year. This is reflected in our group bookings as they are strongest in the second and third quarters, but still positive in all 4 quarters. We expect approximately 22% to 22.5% of our total EBITDA for the year to be generated in the first quarter.
As disclosed in our press release, during the fourth quarter, we repurchased 19.6 million shares to our total purchase price of $325 million, bringing a total for 2015 to 38.3 million shares of common stock, for a total purchase price of approximately $675 million. We currently have $325 million of capacity under the repurchase program.
With respect to dividends, we paid a regular fourth quarter dividend of $0.20 per share, which represents a yield of 5.4% on the current stock price. Further, as stated in today's press release, the Board of Directors authorized a regular first quarter dividend of $0.20 per share on its common stock.
Given our strong operating outlook and significant free cash flow generation, we are committed to sustaining a meaningful dividend. In addition, based on the robust asset sales plan we've outlined and continued to execute on, we anticipate that asset sales will likely result in taxable gains, which could lead to special dividends. While these special dividends will vary may be [ph] one-time distribution, they should result in a meaningful return to our stockholders.
Moving to one of our key pillars of strength and competitive advantage, our balance sheet. In 2015, we repaid or refinanced more than $1.4 billion of debt with a weighted average interest rate of 5%, with proceeds from the issuance of $1.5 billion of debt with a weighted average rate of 3.1%. As a result of these transactions, we decreased our weighted average interest rate by 110 basis points to 3.7% and lowered our annualized interest expense by $24 million to $165 million, and extended our weighted average debt maturity by 0.8 years to 6 yes. We have no significant maturities until 2019 and our operating position, financial strength and flexibility.
At year-end, we had approximately $239 million of cash, $702 million in available capacity under our revolving credit facility and $4 billion of debt, while maintaining leverage within our stated goals of 2.5 to 3x.
In summary, we feel good about the results -- about our results and accomplishments in 2015 and look forward to a solid year of growth in 2016, as we believe the softness we witnessed in transit business in the fourth quarter will be offset by our aggressive asset management strategies and the tailwinds we received from our comprehensive capital program in 2015.
This concludes our prepared remarks. We are now interested in answering any questions you may have."

So I don't see that if I -- there's always going to be an asset or 2 where we made a conscious decision not to do capital for a variety of reasons. And some of those are the ones that we're intending on selling, because we think that allowing the buyer to do that capital will ultimately enhance the total price that they would be able to pay for the assets taking into account the CapEx that might be required. But outside of some handful of unique situations like that, our portfolio is in good shape. And the fact that we're spending less this year, and a little -- almost likely next year, is not an indication of shorting the portfolio of capital that it needs, it's more an indication of the fact that we're in good condition."

All of those hotels are for our RevPAR purposes, are forecast non-comparable. So the incredible increase in revenues that we will see at those hotels is not included in our RevPAR forecast. And so that's one of the reasons why I think people are -- we are getting a lift from that and we're trying to describe the lift that we're getting from an EBITDA perspective, but the benefits of that are not showing up in our comparable RevPAR numbers, those numbers will not likely show up until most likely '17, when those projects have been in our portfolio operating on a stable -- not on stabilized fashion, but operating as a completed hotel for a full year.

A lot of those renovations had started at the very end of the quarter. And frankly, with December being a low occupancy month, I don't know that we necessarily saw as much benefit in '15 as we might have anticipated.

So in the markets where we've seen, such as in New York, there's no secret that New York got a lot of supply, and we have consciously tried to improve the level of group activity that we do in that market as a way to offset some of the increased supply that we expect to see."

The way the third -- the fourth quarter played out, my guess is at the end of the quarter -- fourth quarter bookings were not particularly strong, but the reason for that was the bulk of the group's strength was really in the first 5 to 6 weeks of the quarter. It was -- October was filled because you have had the movement in the holiday, the Jewish holiday, from September -- from October to prior year into September. So October was a very busy month, but there wasn't really any capacity at the hotels to take a lot of additional group. And once we got beyond that period of time, you're really at a stage during the year when there's not a lot of group pickup in general.

As we -- because we sold so many rooms already to potential group customers, it wouldn't surprise us as we work our way through the year that the actual increase in group revenues that we experienced by the end of the year would be a smaller number than that. In other words, it's not abnormal to see some follow-up in that area, especially with an extended booking cycle. So my guess is as that we report group revenues throughout the course of the year, the actual beat there will be a little bit less than that. So that probably addresses some of what you're looking at. I'd say more broadly, as we maybe as a more broad commentary on our guidance, in general, our properties are more optimistic than our guidance would necessarily reflect. And we do see some benefits whether it's in the Special Corporate rates that I talked about before, the fact that our government rates are up meaningfully year-over-year, well, that's not a huge chunk of our business it's one more place for you to see some rate increases. We have a number of factors like that, that will help with transient pricing. We're not expecting a lot of transient occupancy increase, we think it will be primarily a rate gain this year. If we add -- but I think you're right, and you're sort of fundamental assumption is that if we hit our numbers, that hit the projections that we've identified, we probably see it be slightly more weighted towards group and slightly less weighted towards transient in terms of revenue growth."

I don't -- I think that -- I don't know that a lot of these markets supply necessarily accelerates through the second half of the year, but that's one of the things we'll need to see how that actually plays out. What we've been noticing in a number of markets over here is that the outlook for supply is less in each of the last few years what's expected to be delivered at the beginning of the year and what's actually delivered by the end of the year turns out to be a lower number, because the deliveries don't happen at the same pace it's originally forecasted, so that might help mitigate that. But I'd say, at this stage, as we look at the year, the only reason why I might anticipate that the first half could be a little stronger than the second half as it relates to construction disruption because we had more in the first half than we had in the second half. But based on the discussions we've been having so far, it feels like it's a fairly balanced year."

The wild card in group over the years has tended to be what I think you were directing your question at, which is what's happening on the corporate side. And what we saw this past year was fairly good, we saw some improvement on the -- in terms of Association. But as I say mentioned in my prepared comments, we saw some really good corporate rate improvement, as well as some improvement in corporate demand in the fourth quarter. And I think what we're looking at in terms of why we've seen an improvement in group pays this year is a combination of a slight -- probably a slightly better convention calendar which is -- well, reflect itself in a slight increase in Association business across all of our hotels. But more importantly, more activity coming out of the corporate side and companies recognizing that they are going to have events and they're now of a mind that they're convinced enough that they're going to have them, that they're making a decision to book those events in advance and not wait till the last minute because what they've realized is that they wait to the last minute, they're not going to end up with the time or the hotels that they want. So I suspect as we work our way through this year, while it's fair to assume that there'll be some pickup in Association business, I'm hopeful that we're going to see good strong corporate growth. That also tends to tie in with the fact that we're -- it could reflect itself in terms of better F&B growth, too. So I think, ultimately, because corporate -- the corporate group is the part that ebbs and flows from those, based upon the overall economy, the fact that we are seeing the strong growth is likely  primarily due to strong corporate growth. I'm sure that the oil industry, to your point about different business, I'm sure the oil industry with all the challenges that they have, is not necessarily booking as many make group events as they might have in the past. So it is sort of interesting to see, as Greg just referenced, how strong our group booking pays is in Houston. I suspect that has more to do with a smaller, overall group profile for the hotel. But I don't know that we've heard of any other industry besides the energy industry that's cutting back at this point. If anything, our numbers, which again as we suggested, not only strong for '16, they're strong for '17, that suggested there's a meaningful level of confidence in companies that are making commitments."

29574,322158320,934977,"Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 17, 2016",2016-02-17,"Earnings Calls","Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Gee. Good morning, everyone. Looking back on our performance in 2015, we had an active year and undertook a number of initiatives to capitalize on value enhancing opportunities to better position our company for continued growth and success. We so",2158,"Thanks, Gee. Good morning, everyone. Looking back on our performance in 2015, we had an active year and undertook a number of initiatives to capitalize on value enhancing opportunities to better position our company for continued growth and success. We sold more than $1 billion worth of hotels, including 5 of our 9 hotels in Asia as we made good progress on our plan to exit the Asia-Pacific market.
We returned $1.3 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. We invested more than $1 billion in new assets and capital improvements, including the acquisition of the iconic Phoenician Resort and the completion of the major redevelopment of 4 hotels.
And finally, we refinanced more than $1.4 billion of debt, reducing our average interest rate by 110 basis points to 3.7%, extending our maturity schedule and further solidifying our industry-leading balance sheet.
Looking ahead to 2016, we will continue to support a disciplined approach to actively managing our portfolio and efficiently allocating capital. We remain focused on continually improving operational and financial performance to better drive results for our shareholders.
Now let's review our results for the quarter and the year. Comparable hotel RevPAR for the quarter increased 3.6%, with rate growth of 1.7% and an increase in occupancy of 1.4 percentage points. For the full year, our portfolio achieved an average occupancy of more than 77%, allowing the hotels to drive average rate increase of 3.3%, resulting in an improvement in comparable hotel RevPAR of 3.8%, which equals 4% when adjusted for the impact of the USALI accounting changes.
Adjusted EBITDA was $344 million for the quarter, and $1.409 billion for the full year, exceeding consensus estimates and our prior forecast. Our adjusted FFO per diluted share was $0.39 for the fourth quarter and $1.54 for the full year, also exceeding consensus estimates and reflecting a 2.7% increase over 2014.
Even though we were below our RevPAR forecast for the year, adjusted EBITDA was positively affected by the higher-than-expected profits from food and beverage and from our Maui timeshare project, as well as $5 million associated with the write-off of deferred IMF relating to a hotel that converted to a franchise and a reduction in our restricted stock expense.
The quarterly results were driven by an increase in group room nights of more than 2.5%, as Association business grew by more than 6%. Group room rate improved by nearly 1.5% as corporate rate growth was up by 4%, which was significantly higher than our year-to-date results. In total, group revenues grew 4%.
Transient demand increased by 1.5%, although it was primarily in the discount segment as corporate demand was weaker than anticipated, which may reflect the weaker GDP growth the U.S. economy experienced in Q4.
While rate growth in the discount segment was fairly solid, the negative mix shift resulted in average rate increasing just 1% and transient revenue grew just 2.5%.
Some of the transient weakness was likely due to reduced international travel. While arrivals into the U.S. continued to grow at a healthy pace in the fourth quarter, spending declined slightly which suggest that our customers still made the trip, but stayed for fewer days and likely shopped less. Our sense is that international business declined by 5% to 10% in our hotels in the quarter.
The strong group performance translated into strong banquet and catering activity as banquet and catering revenues grew by 6.8% or 5.4% after adjusting for USALI. We experienced above expected catering activity in our Florida hotel and in our larger San Diego and San Francisco assets. Our outlets were also busy as revenues at our restaurants and lounges improved by more than 4.5%. 
Overall, SMB revenues increased 6.1%, or 4.7% after adjusting for USALI, which was one of our best quarters of the year. The higher revenues drove improved margins and our profits exceeded our expectations.
Total revenues for the quarter increased 3.6% and EBITDA margins improved by 55 basis points, as a 9% reduction in utility expense and a 15% reduction in insurance costs were partially offset by a 7% increase in property taxes and an increase in ground rent in one of our L.A. assets.
Transient demand represented 58% of our total room nights for the full year, and increased just slightly from last year. Transient rate increased 2.8% for the full year, as most segments experienced strong rate growth other than our OTA business. For the full year, transient revenues grew 2.9%.
Despite starting the year with no additional group room nights on the books, compared to 2014, bookings during the year were solid and group demand improved 1.1% for the year, led by a 3% increase in association business. Overall, group demand represented 37% of our sold rooms and group revenues grew 3.1%.
F&B revenues grew 5.2% for the full year or 2.5% after adjusting for USALI. The increase resulted from banquet revenue growth of 5.9% for the year and outlook revenue improvement of 3.8%. Reduced construction in our meeting space helped to spark a 4.2% USALI adjusted SMB growth in the second half of the year.
Total revenue growth for the year improved by 3.3%, and full year EBITDA margins improved 35 basis points after adjusting for USALI. In 2015, we continued to execute on our strategic plan of reallocating capital out of markets where we expect lower growth or higher capital expenditure requirements. This approach has also enabled us to benefit from the arbitrage between private and public market valuations in the current environment. We had a very active fourth quarter for dispositions with approximately $630 million in sales completed. These included the Sheraton Four Points in Perth, the 8 property European portfolio, the Novotel and ibis in Auckland, and the Novotel Queenstown.
In addition, as we announced this morning, we closed the sale of the San Diego Mission Valley Marriott, a suburban hotel with 350 rooms, and the Novotel Wellington, a 139-room hotel located in New Zealand, for a combined sales price of almost $100 million. The average RevPAR for these 2 hotels was approximately $116, which is consistent with our primary focus of selling the lower RevPAR hotels.
The disposition of non-core assets continues to be a priority. We have an additional $117 million in assets under binding contracts, with closings slated over the next 3 months. We are currently marketing an additional $800 million of assets, with more than 1/3 of those fairly far along the process. We have been pleased with the response to our marketing efforts and remain optimistic that we will continue to complete sales, although there can be no assurances that, that will occur.
As we mentioned last fall, the sales we are targeting to complete will generate a significant amount of taxable income, which will likely result in a special dividend paid at the end of the year. Last year, we suffered significant disruptions from a number of comprehensive renovations that closed parts of several hotels for significant portions of the year.
Each of the most impactful renovations: The Logan in Philadelphia, The Camby in Phoenix, the Axiom in San Francisco, and the Houston Airport Marriott, has been or is about to be completed. All the hotels are now open for business and the initial customer reaction has been quite positive. The new rooms product has been well received and the F&B outlets, especially the Urban Farmer at The Logan and the Artisan [ph] at The Camby have generated significant, favorable publicity.
Last year, these 4 hotels generated a loss of approximately $4 million. This year, we expect them to contribute between $28 million to $30 million in EBITDA, with additional above average growth expected in 2017.
This year, we are also completing major redevelopments of the Denver Tech Marriott, the Hyatt San Francisco Airport and the exhibit Hall of the San Diego Marriott Marquis. While we expect that there will be disruptive impact at the first 2 assets I referenced, we currently anticipate that the San Diego Exhibit Hall project will be completed in midyear and the additional income it will generate will offset the negative impact from the other 2 assets on a full-year basis when compared to 2015.
All 3 hotels should generate above trend improvement in 2017. This morning, based on our closing price from last night, we are trading at a value of 260,000 a key, compared to an estimated replacement cost that exceeds 500,000 a key. Based on the midpoint of our guidance range, which I will discuss shortly, we are trading at a 10.5 EBITDA multiple and an 8.5% cap rate. Both measures reflect valuations that are significantly lower than our historical averages, and we believe our stock represents an excellent value opportunity.
As we generate cash flow from operations and asset sales, we believe the best way to deliver the most value for shareholders is to repurchase our undervalued stock. In line with this approach, we purchased a total of $325 million of stock in the fourth quarter, bringing our total for the year to $675 million. When combined with almost $650 million in dividends, we paid over the last 12 months, we have returned approximately $1.3 billion in capital to our shareholders. Assuming 2016 plays out consistently with our expectations, we would continue to execute on our existing share repurchase program and revisit the size of the program later in the year.
The guidance we announced this morning reflects the following: Nationwide supply growth when netted for likely closures is now approaching the long-term average of 2% for the next couple of years. However, supply growth in the top 20 major markets has accelerated more quickly, and is now likely to exceed 3%. While upper upscale supply in these markets, which is most directly competitive with our portfolio should not exceed 1.5%, strong supply growth in the upscale and mid-scale segments is driving the overall supply levels higher, our portfolio will not be immune to impact from this new supply.
Over the last 3 years, demand growth has averaged more than 3% in the top 20 markets, but consensus forecasts suggest that may moderate slightly in 2016, given the weak economic growth in the fourth quarter and the general lowering of GDP forecast for 2016. We are also watching international travel carefully as it impacts the gateway markets. The combined effect of these 2 factors, which likely influenced the weaker-than-expected fourth quarter room revenue growth in the industry, suggest that demand may not match supply growth as 2016 progresses.
On the positive side, we had very strong group bookings in the fourth quarter, with the bookings up more than 4.5%. We are starting 2016 with group revenues up more than 6% compared to 2015, which positions us to maintain strong occupancies and drive higher rate of transient business.
In addition, our negotiated rates in most markets have increased more in 2016 than they did in 2015, providing support for transient rate growth. Finally, we have had a solid start in January, reversing the trend we experienced in the fourth quarter as our preliminary RevPAR growth estimate for the month is approximately 3.8%, and that is after the negative impact of about 1% of lost RevPAR driven by cancellations in Washington and New York due to the severe snowstorm.
As we indicated last year, we also expect to benefit from less construction disruption in 2016 as our maintenance capital spending should decline by more than 18%. And the hotels we invested in last year not only face an easier year-over-year comp, but also have an improved product to sell.
Given all of these factors, we project that in 2016 total comparable hotel RevPAR will increase by 3% to 4% in constant currency and EBITDA margins will increase 0 to 40 basis points. This will translate to adjusted EBITDA of $1.450 billion to $1.480 billion and adjusted FFO per share of $1.65 to $1.69.
It is worth noting that our EBITDA and FFO estimates have been reduced by $14 million to reflect the impact of the $215 million of 2016 asset sales we have identified. However, our balance sheet does not reflect the receipt of the proceeds that these sales will generate.
Overall, I'm pleased to say that we are still seeing positive indicators within our portfolio, with continued strong demand, especially in the group segment. The capital we have invested in our hotels ensures that our portfolio is in excellent condition and our industry-leading balance sheet remains strong. We are also remaining focused on generating cash from asset sales and operations that can be deployed at the stock repurchases and returning value to our shareholders. We are confident in the future of our business and our entire team is focused on delivering another positive year of growth.
Thank you, and now let me turn the call over to Greg Larson, our Chief Financial Officer, who will discuss our operating and financial performance in more detail."

Despite the fourth quarter headwinds Ed described, several of our important markets, including Florida, Los Angeles, Atlanta, San Diego and Boston, experienced excellent RevPAR growth and continue to give us confidence as we look ahead into",1954,"Thank you, Ed. Despite the fourth quarter headwinds Ed described, several of our important markets, including Florida, Los Angeles, Atlanta, San Diego and Boston, experienced excellent RevPAR growth and continue to give us confidence as we look ahead into 2016.
Let me provide some specific commentary on our major markets. Florida performed very well, and produced the best domestic market performance, with 11.7% RevPAR growth in the fourth quarter, 310 basis points above the STAR upper upscale market RevPAR. Strong group business at our Orlando World Center, Ritz-Carlton Naples, Harbor Beach Marriott and Tampa Airport Marriott, contributed to high average rate growth at these properties.
With a group revenue increase of almost 22%, our managers at our Florida hotels were able to institute more aggressive pricing strategies, which increased transient rate by approximately 7%. In addition, strong group business resulted in more than 23% growth in food and beverage revenues.
RevPAR at our hotels in Los Angeles grew 9.8% in the fourth quarter, as several of our properties benefited from renovations that occurred during the same time last year. Once again, strong RevPAR growth in Los Angeles was the result of robust average rate growth of more than 5% in both transient and group business.
On the back of group business strength at our hotels, our managers were able to drive food and beverage revenue growth of more than 17%. Looking forward, group booking pace in Los Angeles looks very strong as the market is expected to host 8 additional citywides in 2016. As a result, we expect continued solid performance from our Los Angeles properties.
In Atlanta, RevPAR increased 8.2% for the quarter, primarily as a result of average rate growth of 6.3%. Transient average rate increased 6.6% and 5.2%, respectively. Food and beverage revenues at our properties in the market grew by 8.7%, mainly due to healthy banquet and catering business at the JW Marriott Buckhead and Grand Hyatt Buckhead hotels. We expect our assets in Atlanta will continue to have a solid year in 2016, based on an excellent group booking pace for the year. Atlanta is expected to add more than 8,500 room nights related to 2 additional mega citywides. Our hotels in San Diego produced results that outperformed the average of our portfolio, with RevPAR increasing by 7.5% in the fourth quarter. The Manchester Grand Hyatt benefited from having all of its meeting space available for bookings after renovations last year.
In addition, our managers in San Diego strategically focused on group business at the expense of transient room nights to drive the hotel's overall average rate. In the quarter, group demand increased 7.3% and transient room nights fell 9.8%. As hotels filled with group business, it enabled our managers to become more aggressive with average rate, which resulted in group and transient average rate growth of 9.2% and 7.5%, respectively.
Overall, group revenues increased by more than 17%, contributing to a food and beverage revenue increase of nearly 18%, while transient revenues declined 3%. 
I should point out that nearly all of the increase in food and beverage came from the more profitable banquet and catering business. We expect the trend of our San Diego Hotel outperforming the portfolio to continue in 2016. Even though the city is expected to have fewer citywides this year, total room nights from the citywide is expected to increase by more than 20%. 
In Boston, our assets outperformed the portfolio average with a RevPAR increase of 6.9%, driven by an occupancy gain of 3.5%, coupled with an average rate increase of 1.9%. 
In October, group room nights for our properties in the market grew at 24.4%, with a 3.5% increase in average rates, again, this helps contribute to an 18% increase in food and beverage revenues this quarter. As we look forward to 2016, I would note that although the Boston market is expected to have an average number of citywides, the Hynes Convention Center is expected to host 5 additional events. This bodes well for both our Boston Marriott and Sheraton Boston Hotels, as we expect these hotels to benefit from these additional events and lead our Boston hotels to post solid results in 2016.
Moving to some of our markets that witnessed some weakness in the quarter. RevPAR at our hotels in D.C. increased 0.6%, with average rate growth of 1.6%, and an occupancy decline of 70 basis points. The main reason for our properties in the markets underperforming the STAR upper upscale market by 250 basis points was due to a combination of the lack of in-house groups and softer transient business.
In 2016, the number of citywide events was flat to 2015. However, the number of citywide room nights was up approximately 85,000 over last year. For 2016, the group booking pace for our D.C. hotels was very strong and many of these hotels are expected to benefit from substantial renovations that were completed in 2015.
Unfortunately, RevPAR at our assets in Houston declined 1.1%. However, the good news is that our properties outperformed the STAR upper upscale markets by 690 basis points. The decline in the market continues to be attributable to an overall slowdown in the Houston economy as a result of severely depressed oil prices, increasing market supply and specifically for Host, the renovation of the Houston Marriott Medical Center Hotel.
Our managers continue to focus on growing group room nights to offset the transient decline caused by weaker market fundamentals. We do not expect Houston's market conditions to improve in 2016, therefore, we expect these hotels to continue underperforming the portfolio. Bear in mind that the hotels in the Houston market represent only 2% of our total EBITDA.
Likewise, our New York hotels experienced a 2.4% RevPAR decline in the fourth quarter, slightly outperforming the STAR upper upscale market RevPAR decline of 2.5%. Much of the weakness was due to average rate, which decreased 2%, although occupancy declined 40 basis points. These results continue to indicate that the well-understood supply in the market and a decrease in demand from international travelers, due to the strength of the U.S. dollar, are impacting the overall marketability to raise rates. We expect RevPAR in New York to significantly lag the portfolio in 2016, and acknowledge that the dynamics that impacted the market in 2015 will likely persist this year.
Moving to our international assets. These hotels had an impressive constant dollar RevPAR growth of 15.5% in the quarter. Latin America drove much of the international growth, with a constant dollar RevPAR increase of 39%. This growth was spurred by the benefit of the renovated hotels at JW Marriott Mexico City. Despite economic turmoil related to weakness in the global oil markets and tourism issues related to Zika virus in Brazil, the JW Marriott Rio had an outstanding quarter.
As we continue to simplify the portfolio through non-core asset sales of both Latin America and Asia-Pacific, we expect the EBITDA impact from our international hotels to decline.
Shifting to our European joint venture. Despite the negative impact of the terrorist attacks in Paris and the subsequent lockdown in Brussels, our assets in the region performed relatively well with a constant Europe [ph] RevPAR increase of 1.7% for the quarter as the significant decline in RevPAR at the hotels in these 2 markets were more than offset by the robust growth of more than 10% at the hotels in our other European markets. RevPAR increase was due to an increase in average rate of over 6%, which was offset by a decline in occupancy of about 3 percentage points. As occupancies for both transient and group business declined, it is encouraging to see that our managers were able to increase transient and group rates in the quarter by 6% and 10%, respectively.
There was uncertainty surrounding 2016 in light of the 2015 Paris terrorist attacks and economic and political recovery that is ongoing in the European Union. However, many positive market fundamentals exist, including the fact that supply remains low in Europe at approximately 1%, the weak euro to the U.S. dollar will likely drive demand from the U.S. to Europe, and the economic environment in Europe is cautiously optimistic.
Now let's move to our forecast for 2016. With respect to the RevPAR guidance we gave today of 3% to 4% for the portfolio, it is worth noting that we expect 13 of our top 17 domestic markets to experience RevPAR growth that will exceed the high end of our portfolio RevPAR forecast. These markets are expected to perform well based on advanced group bookings, less capital disruption and lower supply. In fact, we expect some of our best-performing markets will be Los Angeles, San Diego, Phoenix, Atlanta and New Orleans. However, the challenges in New York and Houston will continue in 2016.
Other factors to keep in mind for 2016 are the calendar shifts as these will affect the overall quarterly results. Easter moves to the first quarter and the Jewish holidays move to the fourth quarter this year. This is reflected in our group bookings as they are strongest in the second and third quarters, but still positive in all 4 quarters. We expect approximately 22% to 22.5% of our total EBITDA for the year to be generated in the first quarter.
As disclosed in our press release, during the fourth quarter, we repurchased 19.6 million shares for our total purchase price of $325 million, bringing a total for 2015 to 38.3 million shares of common stock, for a total purchase price of approximately $675 million. We currently have $325 million of capacity under the repurchase program.
With respect to dividends, we paid a regular fourth quarter dividend of $0.20 per share, which represents a yield of 5.4% on the current stock price. Further, as stated in today's press release, the Board of Directors authorized a regular first quarter dividend of $0.20 per share on its common [ph] stock.
Given our strong operating outlook and significant free cash flow generation, we are committed to sustaining a meaningful dividend. In addition, based on the robust asset sale plan we've outlined and continue to execute on, we anticipate that asset sales will likely result in taxable gains, which could lead to special dividends. While these special dividends will vary and be one-time distribution, they should result in a meaningful return to our stockholders.
Moving to one of our key pillars of strength and competitive advantage, our balance sheet. In 2015, we repaid or refinanced more than $1.4 billion of debt with a weighted average interest rate of 5%, with proceeds from the issuance of $1.5 billion of debt with a weighted average rate of 3.1%. As a result of these transactions, we decreased our weighted average interest rate by 110 basis points to 3.7% and lowered our annualized interest expense by $24 million to $165 million, and extended our weighted average debt maturity by 0.8 years to 6 years. We have no significant maturities until 2019 and our operating position of financial strength and flexibility.
At year-end, we had approximately $239 million of cash, $702 million in available capacity under our revolving credit facility and $4 billion of debt, while maintaining a leverage within our stated goals of 2.5 to 3x.
In summary, we feel good about the results -- about our results and accomplishments in 2015 and look forward to a solid year of growth in 2016, as we believe the softness we witnessed in transient business in the fourth quarter will be offset by our aggressive asset management strategies and the tailwinds we received from our comprehensive capital program in 2015.
This concludes our prepared remarks. We are now interested in answering any questions you may have."

At this stage, I don't know that there's anything specifically on the books. So if I had to predict today what would happen in '17, I would expect to see that spending decline."

We have spent heavily on the portfolio over the course of the last several years. So when we measure the portfolio in terms of its effective age, that number is as attractive as it has ever been looking at how recently have the rooms is been done, how recently has the meeting space been done, how many lobbies or food and beverage outlets have been done. So I don't see that if I -- there's always going to be an asset or 2 where we've made a conscious decision not to do capital for a variety of reasons. And some of those are the ones that we're intending on selling, because we think that allowing the buyer to do that capital will ultimately enhance the total price that they would be able to pay for the asset taking into account the CapEx that might be required. But outside of some -- a handful of unique situations like that, our portfolio is in good shape. And the fact that we're spending less this year, and a little -- and most likely next year, is not an indication of shorting the portfolio of capital that it needs, it's more an indication of the fact that we're in good condition."

All of those hotels are, for our RevPAR purposes, are forecast non-comparable. So the incredible increase in revenues that we will see at those hotels is not included in our RevPAR forecast. And so that's one of the reasons why I think people are -- we are getting the lift from that and we're trying to describe the lift that we're getting from an EBITDA perspective, but the benefits of that are not showing up in our comparable RevPAR numbers, those numbers will not likely show up until most likely '17, when those projects have been in our portfolio operating on a stable -- not on a stabilized fashion, but operating as a completed hotel for a full year.

A lot of those renovations had started at the very end of the quarter. And frankly, with December being a low occupancy month, I don't know that we necessarily saw as much benefit in '15 as we might have anticipated.

So in the markets where we've seen -- such as in New York, there's no secret that New York has got a lot of supply, and we have consciously tried to improve the level of group activity that we do in that market as a way to offset some of the increased supply that we expect to see."

The way the third -- the fourth quarter played out, my guess is that the end of quarter, for the quarter bookings were not particularly strong, but the reason for that was the bulk of the group's strength was really in the first 5 to 6 weeks of the quarter. It was -- October was filled because you have had the movement in the holiday -- the Jewish holiday, from September -- from October to prior year into September. So October was a very busy month, but there wasn't really any capacity at the hotels to take a lot of additional group. And once we got beyond that period of time, you're really at a stage during the year when there's not a lot of group pickup in general.

And of course, this is one place where working with a lot of the major operators is probably helpful for us, to push towards pricing strategies that, in effect, create some frictional cost around changing reservations at the last minute. And we will continue to encourage that they look at either nonrefundable rooms or extending the time period for which you -- when you have to cancel in order to make it more difficult for people to reserve a room with us for a long period of time, and then change their mind at the last minute, and rebook elsewhere. But to your fundamental point, we do not see an acceleration of that activity in the fourth quarter. On the margin piece of it, I'd say that the some of the fact that the margins -- there is no real expense that we necessarily have highlighted that is -- would drive weaker margin performance.

As we -- because we sold so many rooms already to potential group customers, it wouldn't surprise us if as we work our way through the year that the actual increase in group revenues that we experienced by the end of the year would be a smaller number than that. In other words, it's not abnormal to see some follow-off in that area, especially with an extended booking cycle. So my guess is as that we report group revenues throughout the course of the year, the actual beat there will be a little bit less than that. So that probably addresses some of what you're looking at. I'd say more broadly, as we -- maybe as a more broad commentary on our guidance, in general, our properties are more optimistic than our guidance would necessarily reflect. And we do see some benefits whether it's in the Special Corporate rates that I talked about before, the fact that our government rates are up meaningfully year-over-year, while that's not a huge chunk of our business it's one more place for you to see some rate increases. We have a number of factors like that, that will help with transient pricing. We're not expecting a lot of transient occupancy increase, we think it will be primarily a rate gain this year. If we add -- but I think you're right in your sort of fundamental assumption is that if we hit our numbers, hit the projections that we've identified, we probably see it be slightly more weighted towards group and slightly less weighted towards transient in terms of revenue growth."

I don't -- I think that -- I don't know that a lot of these markets of supply necessarily accelerate through the second half of the year, but that's one of the things we'll need to see how that actually plays out. What we've been noticing in a number of markets over here is that the outlook for supply is less -- in each of the last few years what's expected to be delivered at the beginning of the year and what's actually delivered by the end of the year turns out to be a lower number, because the deliveries don't happen at the same pace that's originally forecasted, so that might help mitigate that. But I'd say, at this stage, as we look at the year, the only reason why I might anticipate that the first half could be a little stronger than the second half would relate to construction disruption because we had more in the first half than we had in the second half. But based on the discussions we've been having so far, it feels like it's a fairly balanced year."

The wild card in group over the years has tended to be what I think you were directing your question at, which is what's happening on the corporate side. And what we saw this past year was fairly good, we saw some improvement on the -- in terms of Association. But as I mentioned in my prepared comments, we saw some really good corporate rate improvement, as well as some improvement in corporate demand in the fourth quarter. And I think what we're looking at in terms of why we've seen an improvement in group pace this year is a combination of a slight -- probably a slightly better convention calendar which is -- will reflect itself in a slight increase in Association business across all of our hotels. But more importantly, more activity coming out of the corporate side and companies recognizing that they are going to have events and they're now of a mind that they're convinced enough that they're going to have them, that they're making a decision to book those events in advance and not wait till the last minute because what they've realized is if they wait to the last minute, they're not going to end up with the time or the hotel that they want. So I suspect as we work our way through this year, while it's fair to assume that there'll be some pickup in Association business, I'm hopeful that we're going to see good strong corporate growth. That also tends to tie in with the fact that we're -- it could reflect itself in terms of better F&B growth, too. So I think, ultimately, because corporate -- the corporate group is the part that ebbs and flows the most, based upon the overall economy, the fact that we are seeing the strong growth is likely  primarily due to strong corporate growth. I'm sure that the oil industry, to your point about different businesses, I'm sure the oil industry with all the challenges that they have, is not necessarily booking as many maybe group events as they might have in the past. So it is sort of interesting to see, as Greg just referenced, how strong our group booking pace is in Houston. I suspect that has more to do with a smaller, overall group profile for those hotels. But I don't know that we've heard of any other industry besides the energy industry that's cutting back at this point. If anything, our numbers, which again as we suggested, they're not only strong for '16, they're strong for '17. That suggests that there's a meaningful level of confidence and companies are making commitments."

And finally, we refinanced more than $1.4 billion of debt, reducing our average interest rate by 110 basis points to 3.7%, extending our maturity schedule and further solidifying our industry-leading balance sheet.
Looking ahead to 2016, we will continue to support a disciplined approach to actively managing our portfolio and efficiently allocating capital. We remain focused on continually improving operational and financial performance to better drive results for our shareholders.
Now let's review our results for the quarter and the year. Comparable hotel RevPAR for the quarter increased 3.6%, with rate growth of 1.7% and an increase in occupancy of 1.4 percentage points. For the full year, our portfolio achieved an average occupancy of more than 77%, allowing the hotels to drive average rate increase of 3.3%, resulting in an improvement in comparable hotel RevPAR of 3.8%, which equals 4% when adjusted for the impact of the USALI accounting changes.
Adjusted EBITDA was $344 million for the quarter, and $1.409 billion for the full year, exceeding consensus estimates and our prior forecast. Our adjusted FFO per diluted share was $0.39 for the fourth quarter and $1.54 for the full year, also exceeding consensus estimates and reflecting a 2.7% increase over 2014.
Even though we were below our RevPAR forecast for the year, adjusted EBITDA was positively affected by the higher-than-expected profits from food and beverage and from our Maui timeshare project as well as $5 million associated with the write-off of deferred IMF relating to a hotel that converted to a franchise and a reduction in our restricted stock expense.
The quarterly results were driven by an increase in group room nights of more than 2.5%, as Association business grew by more than 6%. Group room rate improved by nearly 1.5% as corporate rate growth was up by 4%, which was significantly higher than our year-to-date results. In total, group revenues grew 4%.
Transient demand increased by 1.5%, although it was primarily in the discount segment as corporate demand was weaker than anticipated, which may reflect the weaker GDP growth the U.S. economy experienced in Q4.
While rate growth in the discount segment was fairly solid, the negative mix shift resulted in average rate increasing just 1% and transient revenue grew just 2.5%.
Some of the transient weakness was likely due to reduced international travel. While arrivals into the U.S. continued to grow at a healthy pace in the fourth quarter, spending declined slightly which suggest that our customers still made the trip, but stayed for fewer days and likely shopped less. Our sense is that international business declined by 5% to 10% in our hotels in the quarter.
The strong group performance translated into strong banquet and catering activity as banquet and catering revenues grew by 6.8% or 5.4% after adjusting for USALI. We experienced above expected catering activity in our Florida hotel and in our larger San Diego and San Francisco assets. Our outlets were also busy as revenues at our restaurants and lounges improved by more than 4.5%. 
Overall, SMB revenues increased 6.1%, or 4.7% after adjusting for USALI, which was one of our best quarters of the year. The higher revenues drove improved margins and our profits exceeded our expectations.
Total revenues for the quarter increased 3.6% and EBITDA margins improved by 55 basis points, as a 9% reduction in utility expense and a 15% reduction in insurance costs were partially offset by a 7% increase in property taxes and an increase in ground rent in one of our L.A. assets.
Transient demand represented 58% of our total room nights for the full year, and increased just slightly from last year. Transient rate increased 2.8% for the full year, as most segments experienced strong rate growth other than our OTA business. For the full year, transient revenues grew 2.9%.
Despite starting the year with no additional group room nights on the books, compared to 2014, bookings during the year were solid and group demand improved 1.1% for the year, led by a 3% increase in association business. Overall, group demand represented 37% of our sold rooms and group revenues grew 3.1%.
F&B revenues grew 5.2% for the full year or 2.5% after adjusting for USALI. The increase resulted from banquet revenue growth of 5.9% for the year and outlook revenue improvement of 3.8%. Reduced construction in our meeting space helped to spark a 4.2% USALI adjusted SMB growth in the second half of the year.
Total revenue growth for the year improved by 3.3%, and full year EBITDA margins improved 35 basis points after adjusting for USALI. In 2015, we continued to execute on our strategic plan of reallocating capital out of markets where we expect lower growth or higher capital expenditure requirements. This approach has also enabled us to benefit from the arbitrage between private and public market valuations in the current environment. We had a very active fourth quarter for dispositions with approximately $630 million in sales completed. These included the Sheraton Four Points in Perth, the 8 property European portfolio, the Novotel and ibis in Auckland, and the Novotel Queenstown.
In addition, as we announced this morning, we closed the sale of the San Diego Mission Valley Marriott, a suburban hotel with 350 rooms, and the Novotel Wellington, a 139-room hotel located in New Zealand, for a combined sales price of almost $100 million. The average RevPAR for these 2 hotels was approximately $116, which is consistent with our primary focus of selling the lower RevPAR hotels.
The disposition of non-core assets continues to be a priority. We have an additional $117 million in assets under binding contracts, with closings slated over the next 3 months. We are currently marketing an additional $800 million of assets, with more than 1/3 of those fairly far along the process. We have been pleased with the response to our marketing efforts and remain optimistic that we will continue to complete sales, although there can be no assurances that, that will occur.
As we mentioned last fall, the sales we are targeting to complete will generate a significant amount of taxable income, which will likely result in a special dividend paid at the end of the year. Last year, we suffered significant disruptions from a number of comprehensive renovations that closed parts of several hotels for significant portions of the year.
Each of the most impactful renovations: The Logan in Philadelphia, The Camby in Phoenix, the Axiom in San Francisco, and the Houston Airport Marriott, has been or is about to be completed. All the hotels are now open for business and the initial customer reaction has been quite positive. The new rooms product has been well received and the F&B outlets, especially the Urban Farmer at The Logan and the Artisan [ph] at The Camby have generated significant, favorable publicity.
Last year, these 4 hotels generated a loss of approximately $4 million. This year, we expect them to contribute between $28 million to $30 million in EBITDA, with additional above average growth expected in 2017.
This year, we are also completing major redevelopments of the Denver Tech Marriott, the Hyatt San Francisco Airport and the exhibit Hall of the San Diego Marriott Marquis. While we expect that there will be disruptive impact at the first 2 assets I referenced, we currently anticipate that the San Diego Exhibit Hall project will be completed in midyear and the additional income it will generate will offset the negative impact from the other 2 assets on a full-year basis when compared to 2015.
All 3 hotels should generate above trend improvement in 2017. This morning, based on our closing price from last night, we are trading at a value of 260,000 a key, compared to an estimated replacement cost that exceeds 500,000 a key. Based on the midpoint of our guidance range, which I will discuss shortly, we are trading at a 10.5 EBITDA multiple and an 8.5% cap rate. Both measures reflect valuations that are significantly lower than our historical averages, and we believe our stock represents an excellent value opportunity.
As we generate cash flow from operations and asset sales, we believe the best way to deliver the most value for shareholders is to repurchase our undervalued stock. In line with this approach, we purchased a total of $325 million of stock in the fourth quarter, bringing our total for the year to $675 million. When combined with almost $650 million in dividends, we paid over the last 12 months, we have returned approximately $1.3 billion in capital to our shareholders. Assuming 2016 plays out consistently with our expectations, we would continue to execute on our existing share repurchase program and revisit the size of the program later in the year.
The guidance we announced this morning reflects the following: Nationwide supply growth when netted for likely closures is now approaching the long-term average of 2% for the next couple of years. However, supply growth in the top 20 major markets has accelerated more quickly, and is now likely to exceed 3%. While upper upscale supply in these markets, which is most directly competitive with our portfolio should not exceed 1.5%, strong supply growth in the upscale and mid-scale segments is driving the overall supply levels higher, our portfolio will not be immune to impact from this new supply.
Over the last 3 years, demand growth has averaged more than 3% in the top 20 markets, but consensus forecasts suggest that may moderate slightly in 2016, given the weak economic growth in the fourth quarter and the general lowering of GDP forecast for 2016. We are also watching international travel carefully as it impacts the gateway markets. The combined effect of these 2 factors, which likely influenced the weaker-than-expected fourth quarter room revenue growth in the industry, suggest that demand may not match supply growth as 2016 progresses.
On the positive side, we had very strong group bookings in the fourth quarter, with the bookings up more than 4.5%. We are starting 2016 with group revenues up more than 6% compared to 2015, which positions us to maintain strong occupancies and drive higher rate of transient business.
In addition, our negotiated rates in most markets have increased more in 2016 than they did in 2015, providing support for transient rate growth. Finally, we have had a solid start in January, reversing the trend we experienced in the fourth quarter as our preliminary RevPAR growth estimate for the month is approximately 3.8%, and that is after the negative impact of about 1% of lost RevPAR driven by cancellations in Washington and New York due to the severe snowstorm.
As we indicated last year, we also expect to benefit from less construction disruption in 2016 as our maintenance capital spending should decline by more than 18%. And the hotels we invested in last year not only face an easier year-over-year comp, but also have an improved product to sell.
Given all of these factors, we project that in 2016 total comparable hotel RevPAR will increase by 3% to 4% in constant currency and EBITDA margins will increase 0 to 40 basis points. This will translate to adjusted EBITDA of $1.450 billion to $1.480 billion and adjusted FFO per share of $1.65 to $1.69.
It is worth noting that our EBITDA and FFO estimates have been reduced by $14 million to reflect the impact of the $215 million of 2016 asset sales we have identified. However, our balance sheet does not reflect the receipt of the proceeds that these sales will generate.
Overall, I'm pleased to say that we are still seeing positive indicators within our portfolio, with continued strong demand, especially in the group segment. The capital we have invested in our hotels ensures that our portfolio is in excellent condition and our industry-leading balance sheet remains strong. We are also remaining focused on generating cash from asset sales and operations that can be deployed at the stock repurchases and returning value to our shareholders. We are confident in the future of our business and our entire team is focused on delivering another positive year of growth.
Thank you, and now let me turn the call over to Greg Larson, our Chief Financial Officer, who will discuss our operating and financial performance in more detail."
29574,322158320,936516,"Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 17, 2016",2016-02-17,"Earnings Calls","Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Ed. Despite the fourth quarter headwinds Ed described, several of our important markets, including Florida, Los Angeles, Atlanta, San Diego and Boston, experienced excellent RevPAR growth and continue to give us confidence as we look ahead into",1954,"Thank you, Ed. Despite the fourth quarter headwinds Ed described, several of our important markets, including Florida, Los Angeles, Atlanta, San Diego and Boston, experienced excellent RevPAR growth and continue to give us confidence as we look ahead into 2016.
Let me provide some specific commentary on our major markets. Florida performed very well, and produced the best domestic market performance, with 11.7% RevPAR growth in the fourth quarter, 310 basis points above the STAR upper upscale market RevPAR. Strong group business at our Orlando World Center, Ritz-Carlton Naples, Harbor Beach Marriott and Tampa Airport Marriott, contributed to high average rate growth at these properties.
With a group revenue increase of almost 22%, our managers at our Florida hotels were able to institute more aggressive pricing strategies, which increased transient rate by approximately 7%. In addition, strong group business resulted in more than 23% growth in food and beverage revenues.
RevPAR at our hotels in Los Angeles grew 9.8% in the fourth quarter, as several of our properties benefited from renovations that occurred during the same time last year. Once again, strong RevPAR growth in Los Angeles was the result of robust average rate growth of more than 5% in both transient and group business.
On the back of group business strength at our hotels, our managers were able to drive food and beverage revenue growth of more than 17%. Looking forward, group booking pace in Los Angeles looks very strong as the market is expected to host 8 additional citywides in 2016. As a result, we expect continued solid performance from our Los Angeles properties.
In Atlanta, RevPAR increased 8.2% for the quarter, primarily as a result of average rate growth of 6.3%. Transient average rate increased 6.6% and 5.2%, respectively. Food and beverage revenues at our properties in the market grew by 8.7%, mainly due to healthy banquet and catering business at the JW Marriott Buckhead and Grand Hyatt Buckhead hotels. We expect our assets in Atlanta will continue to have a solid year in 2016, based on an excellent group booking pace for the year. Atlanta is expected to add more than 8,500 room nights related to 2 additional mega citywides. Our hotels in San Diego produced results that outperformed the average of our portfolio, with RevPAR increasing by 7.5% in the fourth quarter. The Manchester Grand Hyatt benefited from having all of its meeting space available for bookings after renovations last year.
In addition, our managers in San Diego strategically focused on group business at the expense of transient room nights to drive the hotel's overall average rate. In the quarter, group demand increased 7.3% and transient room nights fell 9.8%. As hotels filled with group business, it enabled our managers to become more aggressive with average rate, which resulted in group and transient average rate growth of 9.2% and 7.5%, respectively.
Overall, group revenues increased by more than 17%, contributing to a food and beverage revenue increase of nearly 18%, while transient revenues declined 3%. 
I should point out that nearly all of the increase in food and beverage came from the more profitable banquet and catering business. We expect the trend of our San Diego Hotel outperforming the portfolio to continue in 2016. Even though the city is expected to have fewer citywides this year, total room nights from the citywide is expected to increase by more than 20%. 
In Boston, our assets outperformed the portfolio average with a RevPAR increase of 6.9%, driven by an occupancy gain of 3.5%, coupled with an average rate increase of 1.9%. 
In October, group room nights for our properties in the market grew at 24.4%, with a 3.5% increase in average rates, again, this helps contribute to an 18% increase in food and beverage revenues this quarter. As we look forward to 2016, I would note that although the Boston market is expected to have an average number of citywides, the Hynes Convention Center is expected to host 5 additional events. This bodes well for both our Boston Marriott and Sheraton Boston Hotels, as we expect these hotels to benefit from these additional events and lead our Boston hotels to post solid results in 2016.
Moving to some of our markets that witnessed some weakness in the quarter. RevPAR at our hotels in D.C. increased 0.6%, with average rate growth of 1.6%, and an occupancy decline of 70 basis points. The main reason for our properties in the markets underperforming the STAR upper upscale market by 250 basis points was due to a combination of the lack of in-house groups and softer transient business.
In 2016, the number of citywide events was flat to 2015. However, the number of citywide room nights was up approximately 85,000 over last year. For 2016, the group booking pace for our D.C. hotels was very strong and many of these hotels are expected to benefit from substantial renovations that were completed in 2015.
Unfortunately, RevPAR at our assets in Houston declined 1.1%. However, the good news is that our properties outperformed the STAR upper upscale markets by 690 basis points. The decline in the market continues to be attributable to an overall slowdown in the Houston economy as a result of severely depressed oil prices, increasing market supply and specifically for Host, the renovation of the Houston Marriott Medical Center Hotel.
Our managers continue to focus on growing group room nights to offset the transient decline caused by weaker market fundamentals. We do not expect Houston's market conditions to improve in 2016, therefore, we expect these hotels to continue underperforming the portfolio. Bear in mind that the hotels in the Houston market represent only 2% of our total EBITDA.
Likewise, our New York hotels experienced a 2.4% RevPAR decline in the fourth quarter, slightly outperforming the STAR upper upscale market RevPAR decline of 2.5%. Much of the weakness was due to average rate, which decreased 2%, although occupancy declined 40 basis points. These results continue to indicate that the well-understood supply in the market and a decrease in demand from international travelers, due to the strength of the U.S. dollar, are impacting the overall marketability to raise rates. We expect RevPAR in New York to significantly lag the portfolio in 2016, and acknowledge that the dynamics that impacted the market in 2015 will likely persist this year.
Moving to our international assets. These hotels had an impressive constant dollar RevPAR growth of 15.5% in the quarter. Latin America drove much of the international growth, with a constant dollar RevPAR increase of 39%. This growth was spurred by the benefit of the renovated hotels at JW Marriott Mexico City. Despite economic turmoil related to weakness in the global oil markets and tourism issues related to Zika virus in Brazil, the JW Marriott Rio had an outstanding quarter.
As we continue to simplify the portfolio through non-core asset sales of both Latin America and Asia-Pacific, we expect the EBITDA impact from our international hotels to decline.
Shifting to our European joint venture. Despite the negative impact of the terrorist attacks in Paris and the subsequent lockdown in Brussels, our assets in the region performed relatively well with a constant Europe [ph] RevPAR increase of 1.7% for the quarter as the significant decline in RevPAR at the hotels in these 2 markets were more than offset by the robust growth of more than 10% at the hotels in our other European markets. RevPAR increase was due to an increase in average rate of over 6%, which was offset by a decline in occupancy of about 3 percentage points. As occupancies for both transient and group business declined, it is encouraging to see that our managers were able to increase transient and group rates in the quarter by 6% and 10%, respectively.
There was uncertainty surrounding 2016 in light of the 2015 Paris terrorist attacks and economic and political recovery that is ongoing in the European Union. However, many positive market fundamentals exist, including the fact that supply remains low in Europe at approximately 1%, the weak euro to the U.S. dollar will likely drive demand from the U.S. to Europe, and the economic environment in Europe is cautiously optimistic.
Now let's move to our forecast for 2016. With respect to the RevPAR guidance we gave today of 3% to 4% for the portfolio, it is worth noting that we expect 13 of our top 17 domestic markets to experience RevPAR growth that will exceed the high end of our portfolio RevPAR forecast. These markets are expected to perform well based on advanced group bookings, less capital disruption and lower supply. In fact, we expect some of our best-performing markets will be Los Angeles, San Diego, Phoenix, Atlanta and New Orleans. However, the challenges in New York and Houston will continue in 2016.
Other factors to keep in mind for 2016 are the calendar shifts as these will affect the overall quarterly results. Easter moves to the first quarter and the Jewish holidays move to the fourth quarter this year. This is reflected in our group bookings as they are strongest in the second and third quarters, but still positive in all 4 quarters. We expect approximately 22% to 22.5% of our total EBITDA for the year to be generated in the first quarter.
As disclosed in our press release, during the fourth quarter, we repurchased 19.6 million shares for our total purchase price of $325 million, bringing a total for 2015 to 38.3 million shares of common stock, for a total purchase price of approximately $675 million. We currently have $325 million of capacity under the repurchase program.
With respect to dividends, we paid a regular fourth quarter dividend of $0.20 per share, which represents a yield of 5.4% on the current stock price. Further, as stated in today's press release, the Board of Directors authorized a regular first quarter dividend of $0.20 per share on its common [ph] stock.
Given our strong operating outlook and significant free cash flow generation, we are committed to sustaining a meaningful dividend. In addition, based on the robust asset sale plan we've outlined and continue to execute on, we anticipate that asset sales will likely result in taxable gains, which could lead to special dividends. While these special dividends will vary and be one-time distribution, they should result in a meaningful return to our stockholders.
Moving to one of our key pillars of strength and competitive advantage, our balance sheet. In 2015, we repaid or refinanced more than $1.4 billion of debt with a weighted average interest rate of 5%, with proceeds from the issuance of $1.5 billion of debt with a weighted average rate of 3.1%. As a result of these transactions, we decreased our weighted average interest rate by 110 basis points to 3.7% and lowered our annualized interest expense by $24 million to $165 million, and extended our weighted average debt maturity by 0.8 years to 6 years. We have no significant maturities until 2019 and our operating position of financial strength and flexibility.
At year-end, we had approximately $239 million of cash, $702 million in available capacity under our revolving credit facility and $4 billion of debt, while maintaining a leverage within our stated goals of 2.5 to 3x.
In summary, we feel good about the results -- about our results and accomplishments in 2015 and look forward to a solid year of growth in 2016, as we believe the softness we witnessed in transient business in the fourth quarter will be offset by our aggressive asset management strategies and the tailwinds we received from our comprehensive capital program in 2015.
This concludes our prepared remarks. We are now interested in answering any questions you may have."

We have spent heavily on the portfolio over the course of the last several years. So when we measure the portfolio in terms of its effective age, that number is as attractive as it has ever been looking at how recently have the rooms is been done, how recently has the meeting space been done, how many lobbies or food and beverage outlets have been done. So I don't see that if I -- there's always going to be an asset or 2 where we've made a conscious decision not to do capital for a variety of reasons. And some of those are the ones that we're intending on selling, because we think that allowing the buyer to do that capital will ultimately enhance the total price that they would be able to pay for the asset taking into account the CapEx that might be required. But outside of some -- a handful of unique situations like that, our portfolio is in good shape. And the fact that we're spending less this year, and a little -- and most likely next year, is not an indication of shorting the portfolio of capital that it needs, it's more an indication of the fact that we're in good condition."

All of those hotels are, for our RevPAR purposes, are forecast non-comparable. So the incredible increase in revenues that we will see at those hotels is not included in our RevPAR forecast. And so that's one of the reasons why I think people are -- we are getting the lift from that and we're trying to describe the lift that we're getting from an EBITDA perspective, but the benefits of that are not showing up in our comparable RevPAR numbers, those numbers will not likely show up until most likely '17, when those projects have been in our portfolio operating on a stable -- not on a stabilized fashion, but operating as a completed hotel for a full year.

A lot of those renovations had started at the very end of the quarter.

So in the markets where we've seen -- such as in New York, there's no secret that New York has got a lot of supply, and we have consciously tried to improve the level of group activity that we do in that market as a way to offset some of the increased supply that we expect to see."

The way the third -- the fourth quarter played out, my guess is that the end of quarter, for the quarter bookings were not particularly strong, but the reason for that was the bulk of the group's strength was really in the first 5 to 6 weeks of the quarter. It was -- October was filled because you have had the movement in the holiday -- the Jewish holiday, from September -- from October to prior year into September. So October was a very busy month, but there wasn't really any capacity at the hotels to take a lot of additional group. And once we got beyond that period of time, you're really at a stage during the year when there's not a lot of group pickup in general.

And of course, this is one place where working with a lot of the major operators is probably helpful for us, to push towards pricing strategies that, in effect, create some frictional cost around changing reservations at the last minute. And we will continue to encourage that they look at either nonrefundable rooms or extending the time period for which you -- when you have to cancel in order to make it more difficult for people to reserve a room with us for a long period of time, and then change their mind at the last minute, and rebook elsewhere. But to your fundamental point, we do not see an acceleration of that activity in the fourth quarter. On the margin piece of it, I'd say that the some of the fact that the margins -- there is no real expense that we necessarily have highlighted that is -- would drive weaker margin performance.

As we -- because we sold so many rooms already to potential group customers, it wouldn't surprise us if as we work our way through the year that the actual increase in group revenues that we experienced by the end of the year would be a smaller number than that. In other words, it's not abnormal to see some follow-off in that area, especially with an extended booking cycle. So my guess is as that we report group revenues throughout the course of the year, the actual beat there will be a little bit less than that. So that probably addresses some of what you're looking at. I'd say more broadly, as we -- maybe as a more broad commentary on our guidance, in general, our properties are more optimistic than our guidance would necessarily reflect. And we do see some benefits whether it's in the Special Corporate rates that I talked about before, the fact that our government rates are up meaningfully year-over-year, while that's not a huge chunk of our business it's one more place for you to see some rate increases. We have a number of factors like that, that will help with transient pricing. We're not expecting a lot of transient occupancy increase, we think it will be primarily a rate gain this year. If we add -- but I think you're right in your sort of fundamental assumption is that if we hit our numbers, hit the projections that we've identified, we probably see it be slightly more weighted towards group and slightly less weighted towards transient in terms of revenue growth."

What we've been noticing in a number of markets over here is that the outlook for supply is less -- in each of the last few years what's expected to be delivered at the beginning of the year and what's actually delivered by the end of the year turns out to be a lower number, because the deliveries don't happen at the same pace that's originally forecasted, so that might help mitigate that. But I'd say, at this stage, as we look at the year, the only reason why I might anticipate that the first half could be a little stronger than the second half would relate to construction disruption because we had more in the first half than we had in the second half.

The wild card in group over the years has tended to be what I think you were directing your question at, which is what's happening on the corporate side. And what we saw this past year was fairly good, we saw some improvement on the -- in terms of Association. But as I mentioned in my prepared comments, we saw some really good corporate rate improvement as well as some improvement in corporate demand in the fourth quarter. And I think what we're looking at in terms of why we've seen an improvement in group pace this year is a combination of a slight -- probably a slightly better convention calendar which is -- will reflect itself in a slight increase in Association business across all of our hotels. But more importantly, more activity coming out of the corporate side and companies recognizing that they are going to have events and they're now of a mind that they're convinced enough that they're going to have them, that they're making a decision to book those events in advance and not wait till the last minute because what they've realized is if they wait to the last minute, they're not going to end up with the time or the hotel that they want. So I suspect as we work our way through this year, while it's fair to assume that there'll be some pickup in Association business, I'm hopeful that we're going to see good strong corporate growth. That also tends to tie in with the fact that we're -- it could reflect itself in terms of better F&B growth, too. So I think, ultimately, because corporate -- the corporate group is the part that ebbs and flows the most, based upon the overall economy, the fact that we are seeing the strong growth is likely primarily due to strong corporate growth. I'm sure that the oil industry, to your point about different businesses, I'm sure the oil industry with all the challenges that they have, is not necessarily booking as many maybe group events as they might have in the past. So it is sort of interesting to see, as Greg just referenced, how strong our group booking pace is in Houston. I suspect that has more to do with a smaller, overall group profile for those hotels. But I don't know that we've heard of any other industry besides the energy industry that's cutting back at this point. If anything, our numbers, which again as we suggested, they're not only strong for '16, they're strong for '17. That suggests that there's a meaningful level of confidence and companies are making commitments."

Let's start with a review of our results. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $345 million, which is reflects an increase of 7.5% over last year and which exceeded both our expectations and consensus estimates. Our first quarter adjusted FFO per diluted share was $0.41, exceeding consensus estimates and reflecting 17% increase over last year. These results were driven by several factors. First, the demand growth in our portfolio was quite strong, as comparable hotel occupancy grew by 2.1 percentage points, allowing the portfolio to achieve 75.5% occupancy, which represents our highest Q1 occupancy rate since 2000. While we attribute roughly half of this occupancy growth to the reduced levels of construction disruption, overall still reflects solid demand growth for our hotels.
When combined with average rate growth of 0.7%, the comparable hotel portfolio achieved RevPAR growth of 3.6% in constant currency, which exceeded the industry luxury upper upscale average by 170 basis points. The strong demand growth we experienced was driven primarily by our transient segment. Our transient demand reduced for the effect of extra day related to leap year was up 5%, solid improvements across all segments other than Special Corporate. Transient demand growth was the highest in February and March, with the latter aided by the Easter holiday which accelerated Spring travel. Adversely, our group business experience the demand decrease of slightly more than 2% for the quarter, which was generally caused by a very weak March, driven by the shift in the Easter holiday. And what we do is a favorable sign, corporate group actually increased 2.7% during the quarter. However, that increase was offset by slide decline in association business, and a larger decline in other group, which was related in part to the changing value of the NBA All Star games in New York in 2015 to Toronto in 2016. Strong increases in corporate group rate helped drive an overall group ADR increase of 1.8%, which translated into a slight increase in total group revenue. We expected lower level of group activity contributed to a moderate comparable hotel SMB revenue growth of just 1%. As banquet growth slightly less than 1% and outlooks grew by 1.4%. We expect these growth levels to improve going forward, as group activity picks up again in subsequent quarters. With other revenue growth improving by 3.7%, overall revenues grew by 3.2%. As Greg will describe in more detail, lower utility cost and the implementation of new operating methods allowed us to increase comparable hotel EBITDA margin by 90 basis points, which exceeded our expectations and contributed to solid hotel EBITDA growth of 6.8%.
As we've discussed on prior calls, we are very focused on actively managing our portfolio and efficiently allocating capital. We continue to make good progress on our asset sale program with the asset sales completed during the first quarter, generating proceeds of over $120 million. We have 5 additional assets under contract, representing gross proceeds of $340 million. The closing is anticipated during second quarter. Given our general goal of operating the portfolio, as we complete these sales, it is worth noting that the average RevPAR of these sold or under contract hotels is $112, which falls far short of our first quarter portfolio average of $166. In addition to these expected dispositions, we are currently marketing roughly another $0.5 billion worth of assets. While the market is not as robust as last year, we are seeing some signs of improvement in the debt market and believe that we will be successful in selling additional hotels through the remainder of the year, assuming current market conditions continue.
As we previously discussed, these asset sales will generate tax gains, which will likely require special dividend at year end. Given that our current stock price is trading in a meaningful discount NAV, we believe that the primary use of sale proceeds an excess of dividends and debt repayment requirements is to buyback our stock. We repurchased an additional $81 million in stock this quarter, bringing our total in $758 million since the institution of our initial program in April of last year. In combination with our recent dividend payments, we have returned more than $230 million to shareholders in the last 60 days. 
Now let me spend a few minutes on our outlook for the remainder of 2016. As I mentioned, our results in Q1 exceeded our expectation and we continue to anticipate even stronger results in Q2 and Q3. Given that our group revenue pace in these 2 quarters were up more than 6.5% and generally higher occupancy we typically run during those months, usually in excess of 80%, should help drive better improvement in ADR. At this point, we anticipate that we will experience a more muted, but still positive fourth quarter, as the Jewish holiday shift and nationwide election will reduce demand and the traditionally lower occupancies in the fourth quarter could restrain rate growth.
Looking at comparable hotel RevPAR on a full year perspective, we remain very comfortable with our full year range of 3% to 4%. Given our strong first quarter comparable hotel EBITDA margin growth, we're increasing our range of full year improvement to 25 basis points to 65 basis points. This should translate to a fully adjusted EBITDA of $1,440,000,000 to $1,475,000,000 and FFO per share of $1.65 to $1.69. It is important to note that our EBITDA estimate for the year was previously reduced by $14 million for the sales that we had closed or under contract in February and has been reduced by an incremental $16 million today for the additional sales we have identified. Have we not place this letter assets on under contract, our EBITDA range would've increased by approximately $9 million at the midpoint from our prior guidance. That being said, we're confident that we are taking a disciplined approach to portfolio management and continuing to dispose off non-core assets to better position us for -- in the long run versus future growth and success.
In summary, we are very pleased with our strong first quarter results and remain confident about our outlook for the remainder of 2016. With that, we'll turn the call over to Greg Larson, our Chief Financial Officer, who will discuss our operating and financial performance in much greater detail."

Overall, we're pleased with our solid results this quarter. The domestic markets that outperformed the portfolio were San Francisco, Los Angeles, D.C. and Atlanta. While Latin America was the outperformer in our international markets. Sever",1920,"Thank you, Ed. Overall, we're pleased with our solid results this quarter. The domestic markets that outperformed the portfolio were San Francisco, Los Angeles, D.C. and Atlanta. While Latin America was the outperformer in our international markets. Several of our hotels in markets such as Denver, Boston, San Diego, Phoenix and Chicago had a slower start, but are expected to improve throughout the rest of the year. First, I'll provide some specific commentary on our major markets. Our hotels in San Francisco had an impressive quarter, with RevPAR growing 12.5% on a difficult comp of 15.4% growth last year.
San Francisco hosted the Superbowl this quarter and all of the RevPAR growth came from double-digit ADR gains or a total increase in ADR of 12.7%. In addition, occupancy remained stable at a very high 80%. However, we expect the expansion of the Moscone Convention Center will negatively impact the San Francisco hotels for the remainder of 2016. As a result, our San Francisco hotel may underperform portfolio in the remaining quarters. RevPAR at our properties in Los Angeles grew 12.8% in the first quarter, driven by an 8.7% increase in ADR and a 2.6 percentage point increase in occupancy 82.3%. A solid group a at our Marina Del Ray, Ritz-Carlton and Marriott Hotel, long transient demand at several of our other hotels and tailwinds from the new Beach debut Western South Coast Plaza renovations last year drove a RevPAR increase this quarter. 
Looking forward, group bookings in Los Angeles looks very strong, as the market is expected to host additional citywides this year. As a result, we expect good performance from our Los Angeles properties. Despite the negative impact of the major East Coast Nordstrom in Germany, RevPAR at our D.C. Hotels increased 7.3%, significantly outperforming the STAR upper upscale RevPAR increase of only 0.4%. This increase was primarily driven by 4.3 percentage point increase in occupancy as well as average rate growth of 0.7%.
Several of our D.C. hotels benefited from renovations completed last year. Based on strong bookings faced for these hotels, combined with our expectations that we will continue to see benefits from our completed renovation, we expect our properties in D.C. to achieve solid results in the second quarter. In Atlanta, RevPAR increased 5.2% for the quarter, as a result of average rate growth of 3.5% and occupancy increase of 1.2 percentage points. Our hotel operators successfully executed on their strategy to grow weekend and room night. The supply in the market well below the historical average. Strong group revenues in first and the second quarter, we expect our assets in Atlanta to continue to outperform the portfolio in the second quarter.
Shifting to markets that underperformed the portfolio this quarter. Denver was the worst performing market in the portfolio, with a RevPAR decline of 2.8%. We primarily attribute this to the renovations of the West and Denver Hotel and a supply increase in the downtown corridor, which is impacting the hotel to pull these drive rate and occupancies. Despite these factors, our Denver hotels outpaced the STAR upper upscale results by 90 basis points. We expect results to improve at our hotels in Denver in the second quarter. Our Boston hotels experienced a RevPAR decline of 1.9% in the first quarter, driven entirely by a rate decrease of 3%, while occupancy improved 80 basis points.
A decrease in citywide this quarter caused our hotel operators to shift from higher rated group business to lower rated transient business. The entire Boston market was challenged, as evidenced by the STAR upper upscale RevPAR decline of 30 basis points. We anticipate that with the additional citywide events, scheduled at the Heinz Convention Center for the remainder of year, resulted Boston hotels will strengthen going forward. 
RevPAR at our assets in San Diego declined 80 basis points this quarter, due to the renovation of the Coronado Marriott and a higher mix of lower rated group business to offset a shortage of citywide room night. Despite the slow start in San Diego, we expect the hotels in this market will strengthen through the rest of 2016, as the city is expected to benefit from an increase in citywide room nights for the remainder of the year, especially in the third quarter. 
Moving to Phoenix. Hotel RevPAR increased 10 basis points in the quarter due to the difficult comparison of a Super Bowl benefit last year. Despite that, we outperformed the STAR upper upscale RevPAR by 70 basis points.
Phoenix is another market with supply is still projected to be below the historical average. That, combined with a strong bookings phase in the second and fourth quarters, just translate to our properties outperforming our portfolio for the rest of the year. Our hotels in Florida underperformed the portfolio, with RevPAR increase of only 40 basis points. Milder weather in the midwest and northeast, but cold-weather in January and February in Florida, the media coverage of the Zica, decrease in international travel and continued new supply hampered growth in the first quarter. Based on the weakness experienced in the first quarter, we anticipate our hotels in Florida to underperform the portfolio in the second quarter. 
While RevPAR at our Chicago assets improved to 30 basis points, our properties outperformed the STAR upper scale marked by 860 basis points due to the benefits from room renovations at several of our hotels in 2015.
The Chicago market was negatively impacted by a 53% decline in citywide room nights this quarter. Citywide room nights continue to decline in the market. However, we expect to benefit from strong in-house groups, which will result in improved performance at our Chicago hotels going forward. Despite the negative impacts of the January snowstorm and abundant new supply, our New York hotels experienced a positive 0.6% increase in RevPAR in first quarter, outperforming the STAR upper upscale market RevPAR decline of 2.1%. Our hotel managers in New York changed the strategy and began to add hotel transient business 3 months out, which help grow occupancy by 4.2% in a challenging rate environment. In addition, the New York Airport Marriott benefited from last year's renovation. Going forward, New York market is expected to remain challenged, as it continues to absorb new supply. And as a result, our hotels will likely underperform the portfolio in the second quarter. 
Moving to our international asset. These hotels had an impressive cost $1 RevPAR growth of 9.6% in the quarter. Latin America drove much of the international growth, with a constant dollar RevPAR increase of 22%, primarily from pre-Olympics test business in Rio.
The group booking pace remains strong for our hotels in Rio, due to the upcoming Olympics this summer. Although demand in Brazil could be impacted by the potential presidential continued weakness in oil and concerns over Zica. 
Shifting to our European joint venture. Paris attacks in Paris have negatively impacted our results with a RevPAR decline of 3.1% in constant euro this quarter. Negative results in Paris, Brussels and London were somewhat mitigated by positive results in Amsterdam, Berlin, Barcelona and Madrid. We expect continued weakness in Paris, Brussels and London, as travel alerts and warnings continues to be an issue. However, positive market fundamentals will exist in Europe, including the fact that supply remains slow at approximately 1% and the weak euro to the U.S. dollar could drive demand from the U.S. to Europe. 
Moving to our margins. Our comparable EBITDA margin expansion of 90 basis points is very impressive, especially considering the majority of the river per increase this quarter, was attributable to occupancy growth. Out this notable EBITDA margin growth is a result of our cost-saving initiatives, such as time and motion studies to improve productivity at many of our hotels as well as energy ROI projects. The third-party time and motion studies, combined with our internal initiatives resulted in sustainable productivity improvements of 17 basis points this quarter. The utility cost declined with a result of the mild winter and favorable gas and electric prices in addition to our properties beginning to realize the benefit of our cost savings energy ROI initiatives. We have invested in numerous projects over the past year from small projects such as the conversion to LED lighting and replacement of showerheads and major projects such as solar panels and steam to guess conversions in New York. In the first quarter, hotels that have completed energy ROI project decreased their utility cost by approximately 16.5%, which is 7 percentage points better than those hotels that did not have energy ROI project.
Given the positive margin result in the first quarter, we now expect 2016 comparable EBITDA margins to increase 25 to 65 basis points. We also expect approximately 29% to 30% of our total EBITDA to be generated in the second quarter. As discussed in our press release, during the first quarter, we repurchased 5.1 million shares for a total purchase price of $81 million. Since the inception of this share repurchase program in April 2015, we had now bought back 43.4 million shares of common stock for a total purchase price of approximately $758 million. We currently have $242 million of capacity remaining under the repurchase program. In addition, we repaid a regular first quarter cash dividend of $0.20 per share, which represent a yield of 5.1% on a current stock price. Given our strong operating outlook and significant free cash flow generation, we are committed to sustaining a meaningful dividend. In addition, based on the disposition plans for non-core assets, we have outlined and continue to execute on, we anticipate that asset sales will likely result in taxable gain, which could lead to a special dividend. While special dividends will vary and be one-time distribution, it should result in a meaningful return of capital to our stockholders.
Moving to one of the key pillars of strength and competitive advantage, our balance sheet. We had approximately $234 million of cash and $4 billion of debt. We continue to maintain a leverage ratio as calculated under our credit facility of 2.8x, which is approximately half that of our lodging peers and 1/3 that of our REIT peers. Subsequent to quarter end, we do on the credit facility to repay $100 billion mortgage loan secured by Hyatt Regency Westin hotels, bringing our encumbered properties to just 3 consolidated assets in Asia. Upon exiting the Asia markets, we will no longer have any consolidated assets that are encumbered by mortgage debt. 
Finally, as we mentioned in today's press release, due to the adoption of the new accounting announcement regarding consolidation, we deconsolidated the partnership that owns the Harbor Beach Marriott and recaptured the prior period to reflect the new treatment. As a result of the adoption, the operations of those property are no longer presented in other revenues on our income statement and instead reported as a net amount in equity and earnings affiliate.
Therefore, revenues for the first quarter 2016 and 2015, excluding rental income of $15 million earned by the partnership. However, the adoption does not affect net income, adjusted EBITDA or adjusted FFO. In summary, we are pleased with our results this quarter, as our assets are benefiting from aggressive asset management strategies and the tailwinds from our comprehensive capital program in 2015. This concludes our prepared remarks. We are now interested in answering any questions you may have. To ensure we have time to address questions from as many of you as possible, please limit yourself to one question and 1 follow-up."

Overall, group revenues are trending well within 6%. I think we identified back in February that while we were running at roughly 6% of bookings in back in February, that we had assumed, because we had booked so many rooms in advance, that number would likely decline over the course of the year. And in fact, we continue to believe that we continue to expect that our group revenue will fall within the range of overall RevPAR grow that we suggested. But likely towards the higher end of that range. As it relates to the corporate demand, we see special corporate drop, not every month, but in general. So there has been some because on that side, but as that -- if you look at corporate activity and translate that into group activity, our corporate business was actually up in the first quarter, which we viewed as a good sign. So I'm assuming that given that we had a 0.5% GDP growth in the first quarter, we will likely see some choppiness over the course of the year from the corporate sector. That will depend a lot on particular industries with financing one that seems to be a bit weaker. We are not necessarily -- we're certainly not seeing a wholesale trend across all corporations that they are cutting back."

I think what I was saying in my prepared remarks and I'll elaborate a bit, is we have an exceptionally strong group booking in Q2 and Q3. And those are months, where we run at higher occupancy levels and it's what we have been seeing off late is in general when we were running at higher occupancy levels, that seems to be when we have the best opportunity to push rates. So that's why we feel very good about Q2 and Q3. And I would confirm what you said, which said today, what grew bookings for Q3 other strongest that we have throughout the entire year. Q4 is impacted by a number of things. I think what probably matters the most is the shift in the Jewish holiday, which are now impact October. And secondly, the fact that this year's election will probably most people want to pay attention to. And as the net of those 2 things we would expect less group business in the fourth quarter. And then finally, the other reason why we expect the fourth quarter to be a hair weaker is the fact that November and December -- second half of November and December tend to be lower occupancy months. And so what we experienced last year was it was more difficult to push rates in those months. We're expecting that same sort of a scenario will look like in this year."

I think what probably matters somewhere in the near term, assuming that they navigate and we expect they will, the challenges that exist around the integration. When we compare our cost structures, leaving out management fees between Starwood and Marriott. Right now Marriott -- if our Starwood hotels sat within the Marriott system, we would be able to save cost and improve margin. So we're hoping that they execute as we expect they will and that we ultimately get the benefit from that. I think that the challenge that the industry in general, has identified with the combination is that there will be a number of brands that will all sit beneath one-family, under 1 company and it will be important to be thoughtful about how to continue to distinguish those brands. We look forward to working with Marriott in order to make certain in cost-effective manner."

We do know that in an effort to drive more bookings directly to the less side, there were some -- there are some rate reductions. And I would say that we -- I think that probably contributed to the less growth in our transient rate than what we might have normally seen in the past. So maybe from that standpoint it's slight negative. The flip side is of course, when you look at when gets to the bottom line, the cost of booking reservation directly with an operator significantly cheaper than if it were to happen through one of the OTAs. So we're certainly supportive of the overall strategy and we look forward to working with them to fine tune that as we move forward. As it relates to asset sales, I think that market is clearly not as robust as it was last year. We do, as I indicated in our prepared remarks, in addition to the assets that are under contract at this point that we identified in the press release, we have another $0.5 billion of activity that we're working hard on. And I would think we're making good progress on. At this point, we would expect to attempt to sell additional assets in the second half of the year. But a lot of that we depend upon how we see the market evolves over the course of the summer and what the outlook seems to be for the second half of the year for transaction activity.
So I feel relatively good about where we stand right now. I think we were -- we certainly one of the first in the industry to begin to look to sell assets. We didn't just come up with this idea and last 6 to 8 months. And I think we made great progress overall on the sale program. I'm hopeful that we will be able to keep going, but at this stage we have pretty take a little bit of a wait-and-see from the second half of the year."

So no market represents more than 11% of our EBITDA. And we've got some exposure to some lower supply margins, whether it's Phoenix, or maybe New Orleans, where we're looking at very strong growth this year out of those markets. The fact that we have a significant chunk of our portfolio in some key resort asset, I think also helps. So far was the trend we have been seeing this year and very strong leisure demand and we hope that to continue. And lastly, going back to the group point the large number of big group that we have, which contribute meaningfully to our profitability, they're all in good physical condition.

If I think about this correctly, it sounds like you got $30 million of less EBITDA this quarter from $461 million in asset sales. A couple of those assets were sold in the first quarter, a few being sold later in this quarter. If we just assume roughly 4 months of ownership across the group, that would mean that you got 8 months left, so we chew up the $30 million to roughly $45 million in annual EBITDA at $461 million, that's about 10x EBITDA. Is that the right way to think about it? And then from buyer perspective, how much of these guys are paying significant CapEx that brings what they're paying even lower on an basis?"

Less disruption from renovation allow our hotels to outperform the industry on the top line in the quarter and contributed to better-than-ex",1141,"Thanks, Gee. Good morning, everyone. We're pleased to report that 2016 is off to a solid start on multiple fronts. Less disruption from renovation allow our hotels to outperform the industry on the top line in the quarter and contributed to better-than-expected improvements in margins and profitability. We also continue to make progress on the initiatives we commenced in 2015 to position Host Hotels for continued growth and value creation, including the disposition of noncore assets and returning capital to shareholders. 
Let's start with a review of our results. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $345 million, which reflects an increase of 7.5% over last year and which exceeded both our expectations and consensus estimates. Our first quarter adjusted FFO per diluted share was $0.41, exceeding consensus estimates and reflecting a 17% increase over last year. These results were driven by several factors. First, demand growth in our portfolio was quite strong as comparable hotel occupancy grew by 2.1 percentage points, allowing the portfolio to achieve 75.5% occupancy, which represents our highest Q1 occupancy rate since 2000. While we attribute roughly half of this occupancy growth to the reduced levels of construction disruption, overall, it still reflects solid demand growth for our hotels.
When combined with average rate growth of 0.7%, the comparable hotel portfolio achieved RevPAR growth of 3.6% in constant currency, which exceeded the industry luxury upper upscale average by 170 basis points. The strong demand growth we experienced was driven primarily by our transient segment. Our transient demand, reduced for the effect of the extra day related to leap year, was up 5%, with solid improvements across all segments other than Special Corporate. Transient demand growth was the highest in February and March, with the latter aided by the early Easter holiday which accelerated spring break travel. Conversely, our group business experienced the demand decrease of slightly more than 2% for the quarter, which was generally caused by a very weak March, driven by the shift in the Easter holiday. In what we viewed as a favorable sign, corporate group actually increased 2.7% during the quarter. However, that increase was offset by a slight decline in association business, and a larger decline in other group, which was related in part to the change in the venue of the NBA All-Star Game from New York in 2015 to Toronto in 2016. Strong increases in corporate group rates helped drive an overall group ADR increase of 1.8%, which translated into a slight increase in total group revenues. The expected lower level of group activity contributed to a moderate comparable hotel F&B revenue growth of just 1%,  as banquet growth increased slightly less than 1% and outlets grew by 1.4%. We expect these growth levels to improve going forward, as group activity picks up again in subsequent quarters. With other revenue growth improving by 3.7%, overall revenues grew by 3.2%. As Greg will describe in more detail, lower utility costs and the implementation of new operating methods allowed us to increase comparable hotel EBITDA margin by 90 basis points, which exceeded our expectations and contributed to solid hotel EBITDA growth of 6.8%.
As we've discussed on prior calls, we are very focused on actively managing our portfolio and efficiently allocating capital. We continue to make good progress on our asset sale program with 3 asset sales completed during the first quarter, generating proceeds of over $120 million. We have 5 additional assets under contract, representing gross proceeds of $340 million with closings anticipated during second quarter. Given our general goal of upgrading the portfolio as we complete these sales, it is worth noting that the average RevPAR of these sold or under contract hotels is $112, which falls far short of our first quarter portfolio average of $166. In addition to these expected dispositions, we are currently marketing roughly another $0.5 billion worth of assets. While the market is not as robust as last year, we are seeing some signs of improvement in the debt market and believe that we will be successful in selling additional hotels through the remainder of the year, assuming current market conditions continue.
As we previously discussed, these asset sales will generate tax gains which will likely require special dividend at year-end. Given that our current stock price is trading at a meaningful discount to NAV, we believe that the primary use of sale proceeds and excess of dividends and debt repayment requirements is to buy back our stock. We repurchased an additional $81 million in stock this quarter, bringing our total to $758 million since the institution of our initial program in April of last year. In combination with our recent dividend payment, we have returned more than $230 million to shareholders in the last 60 days. 
Now let me spend a few minutes on our outlook for the remainder of 2016. As I mentioned, our results in Q1 exceeded our expectations and we continue to anticipate even stronger results in Q2 and Q3. Given that our group revenue pace in these 2 quarters is up more than 6.5% and the generally high occupancies we typically run during those months, usually in excess of 80%, should help drive better improvement in ADR. At this point, we anticipate that we will experience a more muted, but still positive fourth quarter, as the Jewish holiday shift and nationwide election night will reduce group demand and the traditionally lower occupancies in the fourth quarter could restrain rate growth.
Looking at comparable hotel RevPAR on a full year perspective, we remain very comfortable with our full year range of 3% to 4%. Given our strong first quarter comparable hotel EBITDA margin growth, we are increasing our range of full year improvement to 25 basis points to 65 basis points. This would translate to a full year adjusted EBITDA of $1,440,000,000 to $1,475,000,000 and FFO per share of $1.65 to $1.69. It is important to note that our EBITDA estimate for the year was previously reduced by $14 million for the sales that we had closed or under contract in February and has been reduced by an incremental $16 million today for the additional sales we have identified. Had we not placed these latter assets under contract, our EBITDA range would've increased by approximately $9 million at the midpoint from our prior guidance. That being said, we're confident that we are taking a disciplined approach to portfolio management and continuing to dispose off noncore assets to better position us for -- in the long run for future growth and success.
In summary, we are very pleased with our strong first quarter results and remain confident about our outlook for the remainder of 2016. With that, I will turn the call over to Greg Larson, our Chief Financial Officer, who will discuss our operating and financial performance in much greater detail."
29574,329064274,967704,"Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2016",2016-04-29,"Earnings Calls","Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Ed. Overall, we are pleased with our solid results this quarter. The domestic markets that outperformed the portfolio were San Francisco, Los Angeles, D.C. and Atlanta, while Latin America was the outperformer in our international markets. Seve",1939,"Thank you, Ed. Overall, we are pleased with our solid results this quarter. The domestic markets that outperformed the portfolio were San Francisco, Los Angeles, D.C. and Atlanta, while Latin America was the outperformer in our international markets. Several of our hotels in markets such as Denver, Boston, San Diego, Phoenix and Chicago had a slower start, but are expected to improve throughout the rest of the year. First, I'll provide some specific commentary on our major markets. Our hotels in San Francisco had an impressive quarter, with RevPAR growing 12.5% on a difficult comp of 15.4% growth last year.
San Francisco hosted the Superbowl this quarter, and all of the RevPAR growth came from double-digit ADR gains or a total increase in ADR of 12.7%. In addition, occupancy remained stable at a very high 80%. However, we expect the expansion of the Moscone Convention Center will negatively impact the San Francisco hotels for the remainder of 2016. As a result, our San Francisco hotel may underperform our portfolio in the remaining quarters. RevPAR at our properties in Los Angeles grew 12.2% in the first quarter, driven by an 8.7% increase in ADR and a 2.6 percentage point increase in occupancy to 83.2%. A solid group pace at our Marina Del Ray, Ritz-Carlton and Marriott Hotels, strong transient demand at several of our other hotels and tailwinds from the Newport Beach Bayview and Westin South Coast Plaza renovations last year drove a RevPAR increase this quarter. 
Looking forward, group booking pace in Los Angeles looks very strong, as the market is expected to host additional citywides this year. As a result, we expect good performance from our Los Angeles properties. Despite the negative impact of the major East Coast snowstorm in January, RevPAR at our D.C. Hotels increased 7.3%, significantly outperforming the STAR upper upscale RevPAR increase of only 0.4%. This increase was primarily driven by a 4.3 percentage point increase in our occupancy as well as average rate growth of 0.7%.
Several of our D.C. hotels benefited from renovations completed last year. Based on strong group booking pace for these hotels, combined with our expectations that we will continue to see benefits from our completed renovation, we expect our properties in D.C. to achieve solid results in the second quarter. In Atlanta, RevPAR increased 5.2% for the quarter as a result of average rate growth of 3.5% and occupancy increase of 1.2 percentage points. Our hotel operators successfully executed on their strategy to grow weekend and [indiscernible] room night. With supply in the market well below the historical average, strong group revenues on the book for the second quarter, we expect our assets in Atlanta to continue to outperform the portfolio in the second quarter.
Shifting to markets that underperformed the portfolio this quarter. Denver was the worst performing market in the portfolio, with a RevPAR decline of 2.8%. We primarily attribute this to the renovations at the Westin Denver Hotel and a supply increase in the downtown corridor, which is impacting the hotel to build these drive rate and occupancy. Despite these factors, our Denver hotels outpaced the STAR upper upscale result by 90 basis points. We expect results to improve at our hotels in Denver in the second quarter. Our Boston hotels experienced a RevPAR decline of 1.9% in the first quarter, driven entirely by a rate decrease of 3%, while occupancy improved 80 basis points.
A decrease in citywide this quarter caused our hotel operators to shift from higher rated group business to lower rated transient business. The entire Boston market was challenged, as evidenced by the STAR upper upscale RevPAR decline of 30 basis points. We anticipate that with additional citywide events scheduled at the Heinz Convention Center for the remainder of year, results at our Boston hotels will strengthen going forward. 
RevPAR at our assets in San Diego declined 80 basis points this quarter, due to the renovation of the Coronado Marriott and a higher mix of lower-rated group business to offset a shortage of citywide room night. Despite the slow start in San Diego, we expect the hotels in this market will strengthen through the rest of 2016, as the city is expected to benefit from an increase in citywide room nights for the remainder of the year, especially in the third quarter. 
Moving to Phoenix. Hotel RevPAR increased 10 basis points in the quarter due to the difficult comparison of a Super Bowl benefit last year. Despite that, we outperformed the STAR upper upscale RevPAR by 70 basis points.
Phoenix is another market with supply still projected to be below the historical average. That, combined with a strong booking pace for the second and fourth quarters, did translate to our properties outperforming our portfolio for the rest of the year. Our hotels in Florida underperformed the portfolio, with a RevPAR increase of only 40 basis points. Milder weather in the midwest and northeast, but cold weather in January and February in Florida, the media coverage of the Zika virus, decrease in international travel and continued new supply hampered growth in the first quarter. Based on the weakness experienced in the first quarter, we anticipate our hotels in Florida to underperform the portfolio in the second quarter. 
While RevPAR at our Chicago assets improved just 30 basis points, our properties outperformed the STAR upper upscale market by 860 basis points due to the benefits from room renovations at several of our hotels in 2015.
The Chicago market was negatively impacted by a 53% decline in citywide room nights this quarter. Citywide room nights continue to decline in the market. However, we expect to benefit from strong in-house groups, which will result in improved performance at our Chicago hotels going forward. Despite the negative impacts of the January snowstorm, the abundant new supply, our New York hotels experienced a positive 0.6% increase in RevPAR in first quarter, outperforming the STAR upper upscale market RevPAR decline of 2.1%. Our hotel managers in New York changed their strategy and began to add wholesale transient business 3 months out, which helped boost occupancy by 4.2% in a challenging rate environment. In addition, the New York Airport Marriott benefited from last year's renovation. Going forward, the New York market is expected to remain challenged, as it continues to absorb new supply. And as a result, our hotels will likely underperform the portfolio in the second quarter. 
Moving to our international asset. These hotels had an impressive constant dollar RevPAR growth of 9.6% in the quarter. Latin America drove much of the international growth, with a constant dollar RevPAR increase of 22%, primarily from pre-Olympic test business in Rio.
The group booking pace remains strong for our hotels in Rio due to the upcoming Olympics this summer, although demand in Brazil could be impacted by the potential presidential impeachment, continued weakness in oil and concerns over Zika. 
Shifting to our European joint venture. Terrorist attacks in Paris and Brussels negatively impacted our results, with a RevPAR decline of 3.1% in constant euro this quarter. Negative results in Paris, Brussels and London were somewhat mitigated by positive results in Amsterdam, Berlin, Barcelona and Madrid. We expect continued weakness in Paris, Brussels and London, as travel alerts and warnings continue to be issued. However, positive market fundamentals still exist in Europe, including the fact that supply remains low at approximately 1% and the weak euro to the U.S. dollar could drive demand from the U.S. to Europe. 
Moving to our margins. Our comparable EBITDA margin expansion of 90 basis points is very impressive, especially considering the majority of the RevPAR increase this quarter was attributable to occupancy growth. Part of this notable EBITDA margin growth is the result of our cost-saving initiatives, such as time and motion studies to improve productivity at many of our hotels as well as energy ROI projects. The third-party time and motion studies, combined with our internal initiatives, resulted in sustainable productivity improvement of 17 basis points this quarter. The utility cost decline was the result of the mild winter and favorable gas and electric prices in addition to our properties beginning to realize the benefits of our cost-saving energy ROI initiatives. We have invested in numerous projects over the past year from small projects such as the conversion to LED lighting and replacement of showerhead and major projects such as solar panels in [indiscernible] and steam-to-gas conversions in New York. In the first quarter, hotels that had completed energy ROI project decreased their utility costs by approximately 16.5%, which is 7 percentage points better than the Host Hotels that did not have energy ROI projects.
Given the positive margin results in the first quarter, we now expect 2016 comparable EBITDA margin to increase 25 to 65 basis points. We also expect approximately 29% to 30% of our total EBITDA to be generated in the second quarter. As discussed in our press release, during the first quarter, we repurchased 5.1 million shares for a total purchase price of $81 million. Since the inception of this share repurchase program in April 2015, we have now bought back 43.4 million shares of common stock for a total purchase price of approximately $758 million. We currently have $242 million of capacity remaining under the repurchase program. In addition, we paid a regular first quarter cash dividend of $0.20 per share, which represents a yield of 5.1% on the current stock price. Given our strong operating outlook and significant free cash flow generation, we are committed to sustaining a meaningful dividend. In addition, based on the disposition plans for noncore assets we have outlined and continue to execute on, we anticipate that asset sales will likely result in taxable gain, which could lead to a special dividend. While special dividends will vary and be onetime distribution, it should result in a meaningful return of capital to our stockholders.
Moving to one of the key pillars of strength and competitive advantage, our balance sheet. We had approximately $234 million of cash and $4 billion net debt. We continue to maintain a leverage ratio as calculated under our credit facility at 2.8x, which is approximately half that of our lodging peers and 1/3 that of our REIT peers. Subsequent to quarter-end, we drew on the credit facility to repay the $100 billion mortgage loan secured by the Hyatt Regency Reston hotel, bringing our encumbered properties to just 3 consolidated assets in Asia. Upon exiting the Asia market, we will no longer have any consolidated assets that are encumbered by mortgage debt. 
Finally, we are -- as we mentioned in today's press release, due to the adoption of the new accounting pronouncement regarding consolidation, we deconsolidated the partnership that owns the Harbor Beach Marriott and recaptured the prior period to reflect the new treatment. As a result of the adoption, the operations of those property are no longer presented in other revenues on our income statement and are instead reported as a net amount in equity and earnings of affiliates.
Therefore, revenues for the first quarter 2016 and 2015, exclude rental income of $15 million earned by the partnership. However, the adoption does not affect net income, adjusted EBITDA or adjusted FFO. In summary, we are pleased with our results this quarter, as our assets are benefiting from aggressive asset management strategies and the tailwinds from our comprehensive capital program in 2015. This concludes our prepared remarks. We are now interested in answering any questions you may have. To ensure we have time to address questions from as many of you as possible, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up."

Overall group revenues are trending well within 6%. I think we identified back in February that while we were running at roughly 6% up in bookings back in February, that we had assumed, because we had booked so many rooms in advance, that that number would likely decline over the course of the year. And in fact, we continue to believe that and we continue to expect that our group revenues would fall within the range of overall RevPAR growth that we suggested, but likely towards the higher end of that range. As it relates to the corporate demand, we've seen special corporate drop, not every month, but in general. So there's been some weakness on that side, but as that -- if you look at corporate activity and translate that into group activity, our corporate business was actually up in the first quarter, which we viewed as a good sign. So I'm assuming that given that we had a 0.5% GDP growth in the first quarter, we will likely see some choppiness over the course of the year from the corporate sector because that will depend a lot on particular industries with financing one that seems to be a bit weaker. But we're not necessarily -- we're certainly not seeing a wholesale trend across all corporations that they are cutting back."

And that group does seem to be fairly sensitive to changes in debt availability. So I would say by -- just to provide a little clarification around my comment, we're not saying that the debt markets are anywhere near as strong as they were last year. But we were seeing a very severe trend in the end of last year, beginning of this year, a sort of weakening in terms of turns, and we're starting to hear some signs that availability has improved a little bit. In some cases, spreads have come in a little bit.

So as we look through the rest of the year, given the fact that we've got a very strong group base, we're expecting -- I don't know that we would necessarily expect to see occupancy growth at the same rate going forward as we have right now.

So that's why we feel very good about Q2 and Q3. And I would confirm what you said, which is that today, our group bookings for Q3 are the strongest that we have throughout the entire year. Q4 is impacted by a number of things. I think what probably matters most is the shift in the Jewish holiday, which will now impact October. And secondly, the fact that this year's election will probably be one that most people want to pay attention to. The net of those 2 things is we would expect less group business in the fourth quarter. And then finally, the other reason why we expect the fourth quarter to be a hair weaker is the fact that November and December tends -- the second half of November and December tend to be lower occupancy months. And so what we experienced last year was it was more difficult to push rate in those months. We're expecting that, that same sort of a scenario will apply again this year."

So we're hoping that they execute as we expect they will and that we ultimately get the benefit from that. I think that the challenge that the industry in general has identified with the combination is that there will be a number of brands that will offset beneath one family or under one company, and it'll be important to be thoughtful about how to continue to distinguish those brands. We look forward to working with Marriott in order to make certain that happens in a cost-effective manner."

We do know that in an effort to drive more bookings directly to the website, there were some -- there are some rate reductions. And I'd say we -- I think that's probably contributed to the less growth in our transient rate than what we might have normally seen in the past, so maybe, and from that standpoint, a slight negative. The flip side is, of course, is that when you look at what gets to the bottom line, the cost of booking a reservation directly with an operator is significantly cheaper than if it were to happen through one of the OTAs. So we're certainly supportive of the overall strategy, and we'll look forward to working with them to fine-tune that as they move forward. As it relates to the asset sales, I think that market is clearly not as robust as it was last year. We do, as I indicated in my prepared remarks, in addition to the assets that are under contract at this point that we identified in the press release, we have another $0.5 billion of activity that we're working hard on, and I would feel we're making good progress on. We would -- at this point, we would expect to attempt to sell additional assets in the second half of the year, but a lot of that will depend upon how we see the market evolve over the course of the summer and what the outlook seems to be for the second half of the year for transaction activity.  So I feel -- I'm feeling relatively good about where we stand right now. I think we were -- we certainly were one of the first in the industry to begin to look to sell assets. We didn't just come up with this idea in the last 6 to 8 months. And I think we've made great progress overall on the sale program. I'm hopeful that we'll be able to keep going, but at this stage, I think we'll have to take a little bit of a wait-and-see attitude for the second half of the year."

We're operating on a scaled-down basis when executing the program on some of our mid-sized hotels. The benefits there will not be as significant in a total-dollar context as they were on the larger hotels simply because the hotels are smaller. But as we work our way through getting the benefits from this, part of structure of this program is that there is a bit of a cost-sharing relationship with the company that's helping us with that, and so part of what we're -- the second year of the benefit, we don't really taper anything. Consequently, there is an opportunity for further pickup there. So I'd say we've certainly gotten meaningful benefits. We would expect to continue to get more going forward."

Our sense was that we were still down in the first quarter on international travel. Now I would say, we were fairly encouraged by some of the arrivals that we have been tracking which goes through February, which showed that Europe was up mid-single digits, that China was up nearly 20%. Japan actually -- arrivals from Japan actually trended up, which was a nice change compared to what we saw last year. The 2 major inbound markets that we saw were down from a standpoint of air arrivals were Canada and Brazil, which were both down about 5%. So those were 2 markets where, I think, in Brazil it's probably an economic situation. In Canada, I think that's really still being hit by the dollar. There was some discussion actually at our recent GM's meeting that there was a feeling that we may start to see international improve in the summer, both because of some better circumstances in some of those countries and also the fact that if the U.S. dollar doesn't continue to strengthen then the year-over-year change in the dollar is not as dramatic as what we saw in 2015.

And of course, as you know, it represents 37%, 38% of our overall business. So we've always been more significantly weighted to group than the industry. I'm comfortable that with that pace, to the extent that we saw sort of a reacceleration in corporate transient that we would -- that would not present a problem for us, because that would just be directly reflected in the form of higher rates that we'd be able to charge transient customers. And in fact that's one of the reasons why we like to have a very solid group base. I think if you look more broadly at why we are where we are and others may be where they are in terms of outlook, I think some of this is the fact that we do have a very diversified portfolio. So no market represents more than 11% of our EBITDA. And we've got some exposure to some lower supply markets, whether it's Phoenix, Atlanta or maybe New Orleans, where we're looking at very strong growth this year out of those markets. The fact that we have a significant chunk of our portfolio in some key resort assets, I think, also helps because so far what the trend we've been seeing this year is very strong leisure demand, and we hope that, that continues. And lastly, sort of back to the group point that the large number of big group hotels that we have, which contribute meaningfully to our profitability, they're all in good physical condition. We've invested significantly in them. And this is the part of the cycle where they have an opportunity to truly perform, both at the top and the bottom. So as I stated in response to a question before, we continue to be conservative in our approach to guidance.

We have no doubt based on our conversations with the folks at Marriott that they understand the importance of getting that right, not just for our own sake, but obviously for their own success. They are a talented group of people, and -- but one thing that Marriott's always been very good at execution. So I don't want to underestimate the challenges that they face, but I certainly think that they are aware of what they're heading into and doing the best they can to manage that process.
At the property -- some of this -- there obviously is activity that happens above the property on the marketing side, but I don't want to lead everybody with the sense that when you look at who is running the hotel on a day-to-day basis, those folks are on site at the property. And as we just -- again, we had a meeting with all of our GMs a week ago, and it was clear that in talking to both the Starwood and the Marriott GMs, that they are all very enthusiastic about this combination. It dramatically improved sort of their opportunity. It will facilitate cooperation in an appropriate manner in various markets, where we may have assets branded by -- under both companies. And I think in a lot of ways from -- at the property level, they're very fired up about what the future might bring. So we're very focused on making certain that they stay focused on what they're doing. But we're very much aligned with those property GMs in terms of their activity. So again, we are certainly paying attention to this and we'll be staying as close as we can to making certain that every effort is being made to complete the integration as quickly and speedily as they can get it done.

We're pleased to report that 2016 is off to a solid start on multiple fronts. Less disruption from renovation allowed our hotels to outperform the industry on the top line in the quarter and contributed to better-than-expected improvements in margins and profitability. We also continue to make progress on the initiatives we commenced in 2015 to position Host Hotels for continued growth and value creation, including the disposition of noncore assets and returning capital to shareholders. 
Let's start with a review of our results. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $345 million, which reflects an increase of 7.5% over last year and which exceeded both our expectations and consensus estimates. Our first quarter adjusted FFO per diluted share was $0.41, exceeding consensus estimates and reflecting a 17% increase over last year. These results were driven by several factors. First, demand growth in our portfolio was quite strong as comparable hotel occupancy grew by 2.1 percentage points, allowing the portfolio to achieve 75.5% occupancy, which represents our highest Q1 occupancy rate since 2000. While we attribute roughly half of this occupancy growth to the reduced levels of construction disruption, overall, it still reflects solid demand growth for our hotels.
When combined with average rate growth of 0.7%, the comparable hotel portfolio achieved RevPAR growth of 3.6% in constant currency, which exceeded the industry luxury upper upscale average by 170 basis points. The strong demand growth we experienced was driven primarily by our transient segment. Our transient demand, reduced for the effect of the extra day related to leap year, was up 5%, with solid improvements across all segments other than Special Corporate. Transient demand growth was the highest in February and March, with the latter aided by the early Easter holiday which accelerated spring break travel. Conversely, our group business experienced the demand decrease of slightly more than 2% for the quarter, which was generally caused by a very weak March, driven by the shift in the Easter holiday. In what we viewed as a favorable sign, corporate group actually increased 2.7% during the quarter. However, that increase was offset by a slight decline in association business, and a larger decline in other group, which was related in part to the change in the venue of the NBA All-Star Game from New York in 2015 to Toronto in 2016. Strong increases in corporate group rates helped drive an overall group ADR increase of 1.8%, which translated into a slight increase in total group revenues. The expected lower level of group activity contributed to a moderate comparable hotel F&B revenue growth of just 1%, as banquet growth increased slightly less than 1% and outlets grew by 1.4%. We expect these growth levels to improve going forward, as group activity picks up again in subsequent quarters. With other revenue growth improving by 3.7%, overall revenues grew by 3.2%. As Greg will describe in more detail, lower utility costs and the implementation of new operating methods allowed us to increase comparable hotel EBITDA margin by 90 basis points, which exceeded our expectations and contributed to solid hotel EBITDA growth of 6.8%.
As we've discussed on prior calls, we are very focused on actively managing our portfolio and efficiently allocating capital. We continue to make good progress on our asset sale program with 3 asset sales completed during the first quarter, generating proceeds of over $120 million. We have 5 additional assets under contract, representing gross proceeds of $340 million with closings anticipated during second quarter. Given our general goal of upgrading the portfolio as we complete these sales, it is worth noting that the average RevPAR of these sold or under contract hotels is $112, which falls far short of our first quarter portfolio average of $166. In addition to these expected dispositions, we are currently marketing roughly another $0.5 billion worth of assets. While the market is not as robust as last year, we are seeing some signs of improvement in the debt markets and believe that we will be successful in selling additional hotels through the remainder of the year, assuming current market conditions continue.
As we previously discussed, these asset sales will generate tax gains which will likely require special dividend at year-end. Given that our current stock price is trading at a meaningful discount to NAV, we believe that the primary use of sale proceeds and excess of dividends and debt repayment requirements is to buy back our stock. We repurchased an additional $81 million in stock this quarter, bringing our total to $758 million since the institution of our initial program in April of last year. In combination with our recent dividend payment, we have returned more than $230 million to shareholders in the last 60 days. 
Now let me spend a few minutes on our outlook for the remainder of 2016. As I mentioned, our results in Q1 exceeded our expectations and we continue to anticipate even stronger results in Q2 and Q3. Given that our group revenue pace in these 2 quarters is up more than 6.5% and the generally high occupancies we typically run during those months, usually in excess of 80%, should help drive better improvement in ADR. At this point, we anticipate that we will experience a more muted, but still positive fourth quarter, as the Jewish holiday shift and nationwide election night will reduce group demand and the traditionally lower occupancies in the fourth quarter could restrain rate growth.
Looking at comparable hotel RevPAR on a full year perspective, we remain very comfortable with our full year range of 3% to 4%. Given our strong first quarter comparable hotel EBITDA margin growth, we are increasing our range of full year improvement to 25 basis points to 65 basis points. This would translate to a full year adjusted EBITDA of $1,440,000,000 to $1,475,000,000 and FFO per share of $1.65 to $1.69. It is important to note that our EBITDA estimate for the year was previously reduced by $14 million for the sales that we had closed or under contract in February and has been reduced by an incremental $16 million today for the additional sales we have identified. Had we not placed these latter assets under contract, our EBITDA range would've increased by approximately $9 million at the midpoint from our prior guidance. That being said, we're confident that we are taking a disciplined approach to portfolio management and continuing to dispose off noncore assets to better position us for -- in the long run for future growth and success.
In summary, we are very pleased with our strong first quarter results and remain confident about our outlook for the remainder of 2016. With that, I will turn the call over to Greg Larson, our Chief Financial Officer, who will discuss our operating and financial performance in much greater detail."

Overall, we are pleased with our solid results this quarter. The domestic markets that outperformed the portfolio were San Francisco, Los Angeles, D.C. and Atlanta, while Latin America was the outperformer in our international markets. Seve",1942,"Thank you, Ed. Overall, we are pleased with our solid results this quarter. The domestic markets that outperformed the portfolio were San Francisco, Los Angeles, D.C. and Atlanta, while Latin America was the outperformer in our international markets. Several of our hotels in markets such as Denver, Boston, San Diego, Phoenix and Chicago had a slower start, but are expected to improve throughout the rest of the year. First, I'll provide some specific commentary on our major markets. Our hotels in San Francisco had an impressive quarter, with RevPAR growing 12.5% on a difficult comp of 15.4% growth last year.
San Francisco hosted the Superbowl this quarter, and all of the RevPAR growth came from double-digit ADR gains or a total increase in ADR of 12.7%. In addition, occupancy remained stable at a very high 80%. However, we expect the expansion of the Moscone Convention Center will negatively impact the San Francisco hotels for the remainder of 2016. As a result, our San Francisco hotel may underperform our portfolio in the remaining quarters. RevPAR at our properties in Los Angeles grew 12.2% in the first quarter, driven by an 8.7% increase in ADR and a 2.6 percentage point increase in occupancy to 83.2%. A solid group base at our Marina Del Ray, Ritz-Carlton and Marriott Hotels, strong transient demand at several of our other hotels and tailwinds from the Newport Beach Bayview and Westin South Coast Plaza renovations last year drove a RevPAR increase this quarter. 
Looking forward, group booking pace in Los Angeles looks very strong, as the market is expected to host additional citywides this year. As a result, we expect good performance from our Los Angeles properties. Despite the negative impact of the major East Coast snowstorm in January, RevPAR at our D.C. Hotels increased 7.3%, significantly outperforming the STAR upper upscale RevPAR increase of only 0.4%. This increase was primarily driven by a 4.3 percentage point increase in our occupancy as well as average rate growth of 0.7%.
Several of our D.C. hotels benefited from renovations completed last year. Based on strong group booking pace for these hotels, combined with our expectations that we will continue to see benefits from our completed renovation, we expect our properties in D.C. to achieve solid results in the second quarter. In Atlanta, RevPAR increased 5.2% for the quarter as a result of average rate growth of 3.5% and occupancy increase of 1.2 percentage points. Our hotel operators successfully executed on their strategy to grow weekend and show their [indiscernible] room night. With supply in the market well below the historical average, strong group revenues on the books for the second quarter, we expect our assets in Atlanta to continue to outperform the portfolio in the second quarter.
Shifting to markets that underperformed the portfolio this quarter. Denver was the worst performing market in the portfolio, with a RevPAR decline of 2.8%. We primarily attribute this to the renovations at the Westin Denver Hotel and a supply increase in the downtown corridor, which is impacting the hotel to build these drive rate and occupancy. Despite these factors, our Denver hotels outpaced the STAR upper upscale result by 90 basis points. We expect results to improve at our hotels in Denver in the second quarter. Our Boston hotels experienced a RevPAR decline of 1.9% in the first quarter, driven entirely by a rate decrease of 3%, while occupancy improved 80 basis points.
A decrease in citywide this quarter caused our hotel operators to shift from higher rated group business to lower rated transient business. The entire Boston market was challenged, as evidenced by the STAR upper upscale RevPAR decline of 30 basis points. We anticipate that with additional citywide events scheduled at the Heinz Convention Center for the remainder of year, results at our Boston hotels will strengthen going forward. 
RevPAR at our assets in San Diego declined 80 basis points this quarter, due to the renovation of the Coronado Marriott and a higher mix of lower-rated group business to offset a shortage of citywide room night. Despite the slow start in San Diego, we expect the hotels in this market will strengthen through the rest of 2016, as the city is expected to benefit from an increase in citywide room nights for the remainder of the year, especially in the third quarter. 
Moving to Phoenix. Hotel RevPAR increased 10 basis points in the quarter due to the difficult comparison of a Super Bowl benefit last year. Despite that, we outperformed the STAR upper upscale RevPAR by 70 basis points.
Phoenix is another market with supply still projected to be below the historical average. That, combined with a strong booking pace for the second and fourth quarters, did translate to our properties outperforming our portfolio for the rest of the year. Our hotels in Florida underperformed the portfolio, with a RevPAR increase of only 40 basis points. Milder weather in the midwest and northeast, but cold weather in January and February in Florida, the media coverage of the Zika virus, decrease in international travel and continued new supply hampered growth in the first quarter. Based on the weakness experienced in the first quarter, we anticipate our hotels in Florida to underperform the portfolio in the second quarter. 
While RevPAR at our Chicago assets improved just 30 basis points, our properties outperformed the STAR upper upscale market by 860 basis points due to the benefits from room renovations at several of our hotels in 2015.
The Chicago market was negatively impacted by a 53% decline in citywide room nights this quarter. Citywide room nights continue to decline in the market. However, we expect to benefit from strong in-house groups, which will result in improved performance at our Chicago hotels going forward. Despite the negative impacts of the January snowstorm, the abundant new supply, our New York hotels experienced a positive 0.6% increase in RevPAR in the first quarter, outperforming the STAR upper upscale market RevPAR decline of 2.1%. Our hotel managers in New York changed their strategy and began to add wholesale transient business 3 months out, which helped boost occupancy by 4.2% in a challenging rate environment. In addition, the New York Airport Marriott benefited from last year's renovation. Going forward, the New York market is expected to remain challenged, as it continues to absorb new supply. And as a result, our hotels will likely underperform the portfolio in the second quarter. 
Moving to our international asset. These hotels had an impressive constant dollar RevPAR growth of 9.6% in the quarter. Latin America drove much of the international growth, with a constant dollar RevPAR increase of 22%, primarily from pre-Olympic test business in Rio.
The group booking pace remains strong for our hotels in Rio due to the upcoming Olympics this summer, although demand in Brazil could be impacted by the potential presidential impeachment, continued weakness in oil and concerns over Zika. 
Shifting to our European joint venture. Terrorist attacks in Paris and Brussels negatively impacted our results, with a RevPAR decline of 3.1% in constant euro this quarter. Negative results in Paris, Brussels and London were somewhat mitigated by positive results in Amsterdam, Berlin, Barcelona and Madrid. We expect continued weakness in Paris, Brussels and London, as travel alerts and warnings continue to be issued. However, positive market fundamentals still exist in Europe, including the fact that supply remains low at approximately 1% and the weak euro to the U.S. dollar could drive demand from the U.S. to Europe. 
Moving to our margins. Our comparable EBITDA margin expansion of 90 basis points is very impressive, especially considering the majority of the RevPAR increase this quarter was attributable to occupancy growth. Part of this notable EBITDA margin growth is the result of our cost-saving initiatives, such as time and motion studies to improve productivity at many of our hotels as well as energy ROI projects. The third-party time and motion studies, combined with our internal initiatives, resulted in sustainable productivity improvement of 17 basis points this quarter. The utility cost decline was the result of the mild winter and favorable gas and electric prices in addition to our properties beginning to realize the benefits of our cost-saving energy ROI initiatives. We have invested in numerous projects over the past year from small projects such as the conversion to LED lighting and replacement of showerhead and major projects such as solar panels in Maui and steam-to-gas conversions in New York. In the first quarter, hotels that had completed energy ROI projects decreased their utility costs by approximately 16.5%, which is 7 percentage points better than the Host Hotels that did not have energy ROI projects.
Given the positive margin results in the first quarter, we now expect 2016 comparable EBITDA margin to increase 25 to 65 basis points. We also expect approximately 29% to 30% of our total EBITDA to be generated in the second quarter. As discussed in our press release, during the first quarter, we repurchased 5.1 million shares for a total purchase price of $81 million. Since the inception of this share repurchase program in April 2015, we have now bought back 43.4 million shares of common stock for a total purchase price of approximately $758 million. We currently have $242 million of capacity remaining under the repurchase program. In addition, we paid a regular first quarter cash dividend of $0.20 per share, which represents a yield of 5.1% on the current stock price. Given our strong operating outlook and significant free cash flow generation, we are committed to sustaining a meaningful dividend. In addition, based on the disposition plans for noncore assets we have outlined and continued to execute on, we anticipate that asset sales will likely result in taxable gain, which could lead to a special dividend. While special dividends will vary and be onetime distribution, it should result in a meaningful return of capital to our stockholders.
Moving to one of the key pillars of strength and competitive advantage, our balance sheet. We had approximately $234 million of cash and $4 billion net debt. We continue to maintain a leverage ratio as calculated under our credit facility at 2.8x, which is approximately half that of our lodging peers and 1/3 that of our REIT peers. Subsequent to quarter-end, we drew on the credit facility to repay the $100 billion mortgage loan secured by the Hyatt Regency Reston hotel, bringing our encumbered properties to just 3 consolidated assets in Asia. Upon exiting the Asia market, we will no longer have any consolidated assets that are encumbered by mortgage debt. 
Finally, we are -- as we mentioned in today's press release, due to the adoption of the new accounting pronouncement regarding consolidation, we deconsolidated the partnership that owns the Harbor Beach Marriott and recaptured the prior period to reflect the new treatment. As a result of the adoption, the operations of those property are no longer presented in other revenues on our income statement and are instead reported as a net amount in equity and earnings of affiliates.
Therefore, revenues for the first quarter 2016 and 2015, exclude rental income of $15 million earned by the partnership. However, the adoption does not affect net income, adjusted EBITDA or adjusted FFO. In summary, we are pleased with our results this quarter, as our assets are benefiting from aggressive asset management strategies and the tailwinds from our comprehensive capital program in 2015. This concludes our prepared remarks. We are now interested in answering any questions you may have. To ensure we have time to address questions from as many of you as possible, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up."

And in fact, we continue to believe that and we continue to expect that our group revenues would fall within the range of overall RevPAR growth that we suggested, but likely towards the higher end of that range. As it relates to the corporate demand, we've seen special corporate drop, not every month, but in general. So there's been some weakness on that side, but as that -- if you look at corporate activity and translate that into group activity, our corporate business was actually up in the first quarter, which we viewed as a good sign. So I'm assuming that given that we had a 0.5% GDP growth in the first quarter, we will likely see some choppiness over the course of the year from the corporate sector because that will depend a lot on particular industries with financing one that seems to be a bit weaker. But we're not necessarily -- we're certainly not seeing a wholesale trend across all corporations that they are cutting back."

I would say right now, given that the rates are generally, with maybe an exception or 2 out of the acquisition market, that the 2 broadly defined groups of buyers would be international capital, which seems to generally be less leverage sensitive. And then domestic capital, which I think tends to be real estate opportunity funds or operators aligned with financial partners. And that group does seem to be fairly sensitive to changes in debt availability. So I would say by -- just to provide a little clarification around my comment, we're not saying that the debt markets are anywhere near as strong as they were last year. But we were seeing a very severe trend in the end of last year, beginning of this year, a sort of weakening in terms of turns, and we're starting to hear some signs that availability has improved a little bit. In some cases, spreads have come in a little bit. But again, not back to where it was in the past, but at least a better trend than what we were feeling at the end of last year and the first month of June this year."

I would agree with you that we certainly -- as we look at our results and compare them to what we saw in the industry, we were very pleased to see the occupancy growth that we had. Now some chunk of that was due to the fact that there were rooms out of service. But I think largely we attributed to the fact that we had very good leisure demand, perhaps not in Florida, but in pretty much all of our other markets. And on a relative basis to the industry, I suspect our group demand was fairly strong too. So as we look through the rest of the year, given the fact that we've got a very strong group base, we're expecting -- I don't know that we would necessarily expect to see occupancy growth at the same rate going forward as we have right now. We probably would expect to see our RevPAR growth lean a little bit more towards rate growth going forward, just because these next couple of quarters are months where we start off with a really strong occupancy base.

So that's why we feel very good about Q2 and Q3. And I would confirm what you said, which is that today, our group bookings for Q3 are the strongest that we have throughout the entire year. Q4 is impacted by a number of things. I think what probably matters most is the shift in the Jewish holiday, which will now impact October. And secondly, the fact that this year's election will probably be one that most people want to pay attention to. The net of those 2 things is we would expect less group business in the fourth quarter. And then finally, the other reason why we expect the fourth quarter to be a hair weaker is the fact that November and December tends -- the second half of November and December tend to be lower occupancy months. And so what we experienced last year was it was more difficult to push rate in those months. We're expecting that, that same sort of a scenario will apply again this year."

So we're hoping that they execute as we expect they will and that we ultimately get the benefit from that. I think that the challenge that the industry in general has identified with the combination is that there will be a number of brands that will offset beneath one family or under one company, and it'll be important to be thoughtful about how to continue to distinguish those brands. We look forward to working with Marriott in order to make certain that happens in a cost-effective manner."

We do know that in an effort to drive more bookings directly to the website, there were some -- there are some rate reductions. And I'd say we -- I think that's probably contributed to the less growth in our transient rate than what we might have normally seen in the past, so maybe, and from that standpoint, a slight negative. The flip side is, of course, is that when you look at what gets to the bottom line, the cost of booking a reservation directly with an operator is significantly cheaper than if it were to happen through one of the OTAs. So we're certainly supportive of the overall strategy, and we'll look forward to working with them to fine-tune that as they move forward. As it relates to the asset sales, I think that market is clearly not as robust as it was last year. We do, as I indicated in my prepared remarks, in addition to the assets that are under contract at this point that we identified in the press release, we have another $0.5 billion of activity that we're working hard on, and I would feel we're making good progress on. We would -- at this point, we would expect to attempt to sell additional assets in the second half of the year, but a lot of that will depend upon how we see the market evolve over the course of the summer and what the outlook seems to be for the second half of the year for transaction activity.  So I feel -- I'm feeling relatively good about where we stand right now. I think we were -- we certainly were one of the first in the industry to begin to look to sell assets. We didn't just come up with this idea in the last 6 to 8 months. And I think we've made great progress overall on the sale program. I'm hopeful that we'll be able to keep going, but at this stage, I think we'll have to take a little bit of a wait-and-see attitude for the second half of the year."

The benefits there will not be as significant in a total-dollar context as they were on the larger hotels simply because the hotels are smaller. But as we work our way through getting the benefits from this, part of structure of this program is that there is a bit of a cost-sharing relationship with the company that's helping us with that, and so part of what we're -- the second year of the benefit, we don't really taper anything. Consequently, there is an opportunity for further pickup there. So I'd say we've certainly gotten meaningful benefits. We would expect to continue to get more going forward."

The 2 major inbound markets that we saw were down from a standpoint of air arrivals were Canada and Brazil, which were both down about 5%.

And in fact that's one of the reasons why we like to have a very solid group base. I think if you look more broadly at why we are where we are and others may be where they are in terms of outlook, I think some of this is the fact that we do have a very diversified portfolio. So no market represents more than 11% of our EBITDA. And we've got some exposure to some lower supply markets, whether it's Phoenix, Atlanta or maybe New Orleans, where we're looking at very strong growth this year out of those markets. The fact that we have a significant chunk of our portfolio in some key resort assets, I think, also helps because so far what the trend we've been seeing this year is very strong leisure demand, and we hope that, that continues. And lastly, sort of back to the group point that the large number of big group hotels that we have, which contribute meaningfully to our profitability, they're all in good physical condition. We've invested significantly in them. And this is the part of the cycle where they have an opportunity to truly perform, both at the top and the bottom.

You guys, as you look out, whether it's second half or maybe even next year, is there -- do you -- is there any concern that there is any near-term slippage that maybe some of the larger competing brands try to take some of that business away temporarily, as Marriott and Starwood kind of sort some things out at the property levels?"

We have no doubt based on our conversations with the folks at Marriott that they understand the importance of getting that right, not just for our own sake, but obviously for their own success. They are a talented group of people, and -- but one thing that Marriott's always been very good at execution. So I don't want to underestimate the challenges that they face, but I certainly think that they are aware of what they're heading into and doing the best they can to manage that process.
At the property -- some of this -- there obviously is activity that happens above the property on the marketing side, but I don't want to lead everybody with the sense that when you look at who is running the hotel on a day-to-day basis, those folks are on site at the property. And as we just -- again, we had a meeting with all of our GMs a week ago, and it was clear that in talking to both the Starwood and the Marriott GMs, that they are all very enthusiastic about this combination. It dramatically improved sort of their opportunity. It will facilitate cooperation in an appropriate manner in various markets, where we may have assets branded by -- under both companies. And I think in a lot of ways from -- at the property level, they're very fired up about what the future might bring. So we're very focused on making certain that they stay focused on what they're doing. But we're very much aligned with those property GMs in terms of their activity. So again, we are certainly paying attention to this and we'll be staying as close as we can to making certain that every effort is being made to complete the integration as quickly and speedily as they can get it done. But I suspect it will be okay."

We're pleased to report that 2016 is off to a solid start on multiple fronts.

We're pleased to report that 2016 is off to a solid start on multiple fronts. Less disruption from renovation allowed our hotels to outperform the industry on the top line in the quarter and contributed to better-than-expected improvements in margins and profitability. We also continue to make progress on the initiatives we commenced in 2015 to position Host Hotels for continued growth and value creation, including the disposition of noncore assets and returning capital to shareholders. 
Let's start with a review of our results. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $345 million, which reflects an increase of 7.5% over last year and which exceeded both our expectations and consensus estimates. Our first quarter adjusted FFO per diluted share was $0.41, exceeding consensus estimates and reflecting a 17% increase over last year. These results were driven by several factors. First, demand growth in our portfolio was quite strong as comparable hotel occupancy grew by 2.1 percentage points, allowing the portfolio to achieve 75.5% occupancy, which represents our highest Q1 occupancy rate since 2000. While we attribute roughly half of this occupancy growth to the reduced levels of construction disruption, overall, it still reflects solid demand growth for our hotels.
When combined with average rate growth of 0.7%, the comparable hotel portfolio achieved RevPAR growth of 3.6% in constant currency, which exceeded the industry luxury upper upscale average by 170 basis points. The strong demand growth we experienced was driven primarily by our transient segment. Our transient demand, reduced for the effect of the extra day related to leap year, was up 5%, with solid improvements across all segments other than Special Corporate. Transient demand growth was the highest in February and March, with the latter aided by the early Easter holiday which accelerated spring break travel. Conversely, our group business experienced the demand decrease of slightly more than 2% for the quarter, which was generally caused by a very weak March, driven by the shift in the Easter holiday. In what we viewed as a favorable sign, corporate group actually increased 2.7% during the quarter. However, that increase was offset by a slight decline in association business, and a larger decline in other group, which was related in part to the change in the venue of the NBA All-Star Game from New York in 2015 to Toronto in 2016. Strong increases in corporate group rates helped drive an overall group ADR increase of 1.8%, which translated into a slight increase in total group revenues. The expected lower level of group activity contributed to a moderate comparable hotel F&B revenue growth of just 1%, as banquet growth increased slightly less than 1% and outlets grew by 1.4%. We expect these growth levels to improve going forward, as group activity picks up again in subsequent quarters. With other revenue growth improving by 3.7%, overall revenues grew by 3.2%. As Greg will describe in more detail, lower utility costs and the implementation of new operating methods allowed us to increase comparable hotel EBITDA margin by 90 basis points, which exceeded our expectations and contributed to solid hotel EBITDA growth of 6.8%.
As we've discussed on prior calls, we are very focused on actively managing our portfolio and efficiently allocating capital. We continue to make good progress on our asset sale program with 3 asset sales completed during the first quarter, generating proceeds of over $120 million. We have 5 additional assets under contract, representing gross proceeds of $340 million with closings anticipated during second quarter. Given our general goal of upgrading the portfolio as we complete these sales, it is worth noting that the average RevPAR of these sold or under contract hotels is $112, which falls far short of our first quarter portfolio average of $166. In addition to these expected dispositions, we are currently marketing roughly another $0.5 billion worth of assets. While the market is not as robust as last year, we are seeing some signs of improvement in the debt markets and believe that we will be successful in selling additional hotels through the remainder of the year, assuming current market conditions continue.
As we previously discussed, these asset sales will generate tax gains which will likely require special dividend at year-end. Given that our current stock price is trading at a meaningful discount to NAV, we believe that the primary use of sale proceeds and excess of dividends and debt repayment requirements is to buy back our stock. We repurchased an additional $81 million in stock this quarter, bringing our total to $758 million since the institution of our initial program in April of last year. In combination with our recent dividend payment, we have returned more than $230 million to shareholders in the last 60 days. 
Now let me spend a few minutes on our outlook for the remainder of 2016. As I mentioned, our results in Q1 exceeded our expectations and we continue to anticipate even stronger results in Q2 and Q3. Given that our group revenue pace in these 2 quarters is up more than 6.5% and the generally high occupancies we typically run during those months, usually in excess of 80%, should help drive better improvement in ADR. At this point, we anticipate that we will experience a more muted, but still positive fourth quarter, as the Jewish holiday shift and nationwide election night will reduce group demand and the traditionally lower occupancies in the fourth quarter could restrain rate growth.
Looking at comparable hotel RevPAR on a full year perspective, we remain very comfortable with our full year range of 3% to 4%. Given our strong first quarter comparable hotel EBITDA margin growth, we are increasing our range of full year improvement to 25 basis points to 65 basis points. This would translate to a full year adjusted EBITDA of $1,440,000,000 to $1,475,000,000 and FFO per share of $1.65 to $1.69. It is important to note that our EBITDA estimate for the year was previously reduced by $14 million for the sales that we had closed or under contract in February and has been reduced by an incremental $16 million today for the additional sales we have identified. Had we not placed these latter assets under contract, our EBITDA range would've increased by approximately $9 million at the midpoint from our prior guidance. That being said, we're confident that we are taking a disciplined approach to portfolio management and continuing to dispose off noncore assets to better position us for -- in the long run for future growth and success.
In summary, we are very pleased with our strong first quarter results and remain confident about our outlook for the remainder of 2016. With that, I will turn the call over to Greg Larson, our Chief Financial Officer, who will discuss our operating and financial performance in much greater detail."

Overall, we are pleased with our solid results this quarter. The domestic markets that outperformed the portfolio were San Francisco, Los Angeles, D.C. and Atlanta, while Latin America was the outperformer in our international markets. Seve",1942,"Thank you, Ed. Overall, we are pleased with our solid results this quarter. The domestic markets that outperformed the portfolio were San Francisco, Los Angeles, D.C. and Atlanta, while Latin America was the outperformer in our international markets. Several of our hotels in markets such as Denver, Boston, San Diego, Phoenix and Chicago had a slower start, but are expected to improve throughout the rest of the year. First, I'll provide some specific commentary on our major markets. Our hotels in San Francisco had an impressive quarter, with RevPAR growing 12.5% on a difficult comp of 15.4% growth last year.
San Francisco hosted the Superbowl this quarter, and all of the RevPAR growth came from double-digit ADR gains or a total increase in ADR of 12.7%. In addition, occupancy remained stable at a very high 80%. However, we expect the expansion of the Moscone Convention Center will negatively impact the San Francisco hotels for the remainder of 2016. As a result, our San Francisco hotel may underperform our portfolio in the remaining quarters. RevPAR at our properties in Los Angeles grew 12.2% in the first quarter, driven by an 8.7% increase in ADR and a 2.6 percentage point increase in occupancy to 83.2%. A solid group base at our Marina Del Ray, Ritz-Carlton and Marriott Hotels, strong transient demand at several of our other hotels and tailwinds from the Newport Beach Bayview and Westin South Coast Plaza renovations last year drove a RevPAR increase this quarter. 
Looking forward, group booking pace in Los Angeles looks very strong, as the market is expected to host additional citywides this year. As a result, we expect good performance from our Los Angeles properties. Despite the negative impact of the major East Coast snowstorm in January, RevPAR at our D.C. Hotels increased 7.3%, significantly outperforming the STAR upper upscale RevPAR increase of only 0.4%. This increase was primarily driven by a 4.3 percentage point increase in our occupancy as well as average rate growth of 0.7%.
Several of our D.C. hotels benefited from renovations completed last year. Based on strong group booking pace for these hotels, combined with our expectations that we will continue to see benefits from our completed renovation, we expect our properties in D.C. to achieve solid results in the second quarter. In Atlanta, RevPAR increased 5.2% for the quarter as a result of average rate growth of 3.5% and occupancy increase of 1.2 percentage points. Our hotel operators successfully executed on their strategy to grow weekend and show their [indiscernible] room night. With supply in the market well below the historical average, strong group revenues on the books for the second quarter, we expect our assets in Atlanta to continue to outperform the portfolio in the second quarter.
Shifting to markets that underperformed the portfolio this quarter. Denver was the worst performing market in the portfolio, with a RevPAR decline of 2.8%. We primarily attribute this to the renovations at the Westin Denver Hotel and a supply increase in the downtown corridor, which is impacting the hotel to build these drive rate and occupancy. Despite these factors, our Denver hotels outpaced the STAR upper upscale result by 90 basis points. We expect results to improve at our hotels in Denver in the second quarter. Our Boston hotels experienced a RevPAR decline of 1.9% in the first quarter, driven entirely by a rate decrease of 3%, while occupancy improved 80 basis points.
A decrease in citywide this quarter caused our hotel operators to shift from higher rated group business to lower rated transient business. The entire Boston market was challenged, as evidenced by the STAR upper upscale RevPAR decline of 30 basis points. We anticipate that with additional citywide events scheduled at the Heinz Convention Center for the remainder of year, results at our Boston hotels will strengthen going forward. 
RevPAR at our assets in San Diego declined 80 basis points this quarter, due to the renovation of the Coronado Marriott and a higher mix of lower-rated group business to offset a shortage of citywide room night. Despite the slow start in San Diego, we expect the hotels in this market will strengthen through the rest of 2016, as the city is expected to benefit from an increase in citywide room nights for the remainder of the year, especially in the third quarter. 
Moving to Phoenix. Hotel RevPAR increased 10 basis points in the quarter due to the difficult comparison of a Super Bowl benefit last year. Despite that, we outperformed the STAR upper upscale RevPAR by 70 basis points.
Phoenix is another market with supply still projected to be below the historical average. That, combined with a strong booking pace for the second and fourth quarters, did translate to our properties outperforming our portfolio for the rest of the year. Our hotels in Florida underperformed the portfolio, with a RevPAR increase of only 40 basis points. Milder weather in the midwest and northeast, but cold weather in January and February in Florida, the media coverage of the Zika virus, decrease in international travel and continued new supply hampered growth in the first quarter. Based on the weakness experienced in the first quarter, we anticipate our hotels in Florida to underperform the portfolio in the second quarter. 
While RevPAR at our Chicago assets improved just 30 basis points, our properties outperformed the STAR upper upscale market by 860 basis points due to the benefits from room renovations at several of our hotels in 2015.
The Chicago market was negatively impacted by a 53% decline in citywide room nights this quarter. Citywide room nights continue to decline in the market. However, we expect to benefit from strong in-house groups, which will result in improved performance at our Chicago hotels going forward. Despite the negative impacts of the January snowstorm, the abundant new supply, our New York hotels experienced a positive 0.6% increase in RevPAR in the first quarter, outperforming the STAR upper upscale market RevPAR decline of 2.1%. Our hotel managers in New York changed their strategy and began to add wholesale transient business 3 months out, which helped boost occupancy by 4.2% in a challenging rate environment. In addition, the New York Airport Marriott benefited from last year's renovation. Going forward, the New York market is expected to remain challenged, as it continues to absorb new supply. And as a result, our hotels will likely underperform the portfolio in the second quarter. 
Moving to our international asset. These hotels had an impressive constant dollar RevPAR growth of 9.6% in the quarter. Latin America drove much of the international growth, with a constant dollar RevPAR increase of 22%, primarily from pre-Olympic test business in Rio.
The group booking pace remains strong for our hotels in Rio due to the upcoming Olympics this summer, although demand in Brazil could be impacted by the potential presidential impeachment, continued weakness in oil and concerns over Zika. 
Shifting to our European joint venture. Terrorist attacks in Paris and Brussels negatively impacted our results, with a RevPAR decline of 3.1% in constant euro this quarter. Negative results in Paris, Brussels and London were somewhat mitigated by positive results in Amsterdam, Berlin, Barcelona and Madrid. We expect continued weakness in Paris, Brussels and London, as travel alerts and warnings continue to be issued. However, positive market fundamentals still exist in Europe, including the fact that supply remains low at approximately 1% and the weak euro to the U.S. dollar could drive demand from the U.S. to Europe. 
Moving to our margins. Our comparable EBITDA margin expansion of 90 basis points is very impressive, especially considering the majority of the RevPAR increase this quarter was attributable to occupancy growth. Part of this notable EBITDA margin growth is the result of our cost-saving initiatives, such as time and motion studies to improve productivity at many of our hotels as well as energy ROI projects. The third-party time and motion studies, combined with our internal initiatives, resulted in sustainable productivity improvement of 17 basis points this quarter. The utility cost decline was the result of the mild winter and favorable gas and electric prices in addition to our properties beginning to realize the benefits of our cost-saving energy ROI initiatives. We have invested in numerous projects over the past year from small projects such as the conversion to LED lighting and replacement of showerhead and major projects such as solar panels in Maui and steam-to-gas conversions in New York. In the first quarter, hotels that had completed energy ROI projects decreased their utility costs by approximately 16.5%, which is 7 percentage points better than the Host Hotels that did not have energy ROI projects.
Given the positive margin results in the first quarter, we now expect 2016 comparable EBITDA margin to increase 25 to 65 basis points. We also expect approximately 29% to 30% of our total EBITDA to be generated in the second quarter. As discussed in our press release, during the first quarter, we repurchased 5.1 million shares for a total purchase price of $81 million. Since the inception of this share repurchase program in April 2015, we have now bought back 43.4 million shares of common stock for a total purchase price of approximately $758 million. We currently have $242 million of capacity remaining under the repurchase program. In addition, we paid a regular first quarter cash dividend of $0.20 per share, which represents a yield of 5.1% on the current stock price. Given our strong operating outlook and significant free cash flow generation, we are committed to sustaining a meaningful dividend. In addition, based on the disposition plans for noncore assets we have outlined and continued to execute on, we anticipate that asset sales will likely result in taxable gain, which could lead to a special dividend. While special dividends will vary and be onetime distribution, it should result in a meaningful return of capital to our stockholders.
Moving to one of the key pillars of strength and competitive advantage, our balance sheet. We had approximately $234 million of cash and $4 billion net debt. We continue to maintain a leverage ratio as calculated under our credit facility at 2.8x, which is approximately half that of our lodging peers and 1/3 that of our REIT peers. Subsequent to quarter-end, we drew on the credit facility to repay the $100 billion mortgage loan secured by the Hyatt Regency Reston hotel, bringing our encumbered properties to just 3 consolidated assets in Asia. Upon exiting the Asia market, we will no longer have any consolidated assets that are encumbered by mortgage debt. 
Finally, we are -- as we mentioned in today's press release, due to the adoption of the new accounting pronouncement regarding consolidation, we deconsolidated the partnership that owns the Harbor Beach Marriott and recaptured the prior period to reflect the new treatment. As a result of the adoption, the operations of those property are no longer presented in other revenues on our income statement and are instead reported as a net amount in equity and earnings of affiliates.
Therefore, revenues for the first quarter 2016 and 2015, exclude rental income of $15 million earned by the partnership. However, the adoption does not affect net income, adjusted EBITDA or adjusted FFO. In summary, we are pleased with our results this quarter, as our assets are benefiting from aggressive asset management strategies and the tailwinds from our comprehensive capital program in 2015. This concludes our prepared remarks. We are now interested in answering any questions you may have. To ensure we have time to address questions from as many of you as possible, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up."

Overall group revenues are trending well within 6%. I think we identified back in February that while we were running at roughly 6% up in bookings back in February, that we had assumed, because we had booked so many rooms in advance, that that number would likely decline over the course of the year. And in fact, we continue to believe that and we continue to expect that our group revenues would fall within the range of overall RevPAR growth that we suggested, but likely towards the higher end of that range. As it relates to the corporate demand, we've seen special corporate drop, not every month, but in general. So there's been some weakness on that side, but as that -- if you look at corporate activity and translate that into group activity, our corporate business was actually up in the first quarter, which we viewed as a good sign. So I'm assuming that given that we had a 0.5% GDP growth in the first quarter, we will likely see some choppiness over the course of the year from the corporate sector because that will depend a lot on particular industries with financing one that seems to be a bit weaker. But we're not necessarily -- we're certainly not seeing a wholesale trend across all corporations that they are cutting back."

And that group does seem to be fairly sensitive to changes in debt availability. So I would say by -- just to provide a little clarification around my comment, we're not saying that the debt markets are anywhere near as strong as they were last year. But we were seeing a very severe trend in the end of last year, beginning of this year, a sort of weakening in terms of turns, and we're starting to hear some signs that availability has improved a little bit. In some cases, spreads have come in a little bit. But again, not back to where it was in the past, but at least a better trend than what we were feeling at the end of last year and the first month of June this year."

We probably would expect to see our RevPAR growth lean a little bit more towards rate growth going forward, just because these next couple of quarters are months where we start off with a really strong occupancy base.

So that's why we feel very good about Q2 and Q3. And I would confirm what you said, which is that today, our group bookings for Q3 are the strongest that we have throughout the entire year. Q4 is impacted by a number of things. I think what probably matters most is the shift in the Jewish holiday, which will now impact October. And secondly, the fact that this year's election will probably be one that most people want to pay attention to. The net of those 2 things is we would expect less group business in the fourth quarter. And then finally, the other reason why we expect the fourth quarter to be a hair weaker is the fact that November and December tends -- the second half of November and December tend to be lower occupancy months. And so what we experienced last year was it was more difficult to push rate in those months. We're expecting that, that same sort of a scenario will apply again this year."

I think what would probably matter in someways in the near term, assuming that they navigate, and we expect that they will, the challenges that exist around the integration. When we compare our cost structures, leaving out management fees between Starwood and Marriott, right now Marriott -- if our Starwood hotels sat within the Marriott system, we would be able to save costs and improve margins. So we're hoping that they execute as we expect they will and that we ultimately get the benefit from that. I think that the challenge that the industry in general has identified with the combination is that there will be a number of brands that will offset beneath one family or under one company, and it'll be important to be thoughtful about how to continue to distinguish those brands. We look forward to working with Marriott in order to make certain that happens in a cost-effective manner."

We do know that in an effort to drive more bookings directly to the website, there were some -- there are some rate reductions. And I'd say we -- I think that's probably contributed to the less growth in our transient rate than what we might have normally seen in the past, so maybe, and from that standpoint, a slight negative. The flip side is, of course, is that when you look at what gets to the bottom line, the cost of booking a reservation directly with an operator is significantly cheaper than if it were to happen through one of the OTAs. So we're certainly supportive of the overall strategy, and we'll look forward to working with them to fine-tune that as they move forward. As it relates to the asset sales, I think that market is clearly not as robust as it was last year. We do, as I indicated in my prepared remarks, in addition to the assets that are under contract at this point that we identified in the press release, we have another $0.5 billion of activity that we're working hard on, and I would feel we're making good progress on. We would -- at this point, we would expect to attempt to sell additional assets in the second half of the year, but a lot of that will depend upon how we see the market evolve over the course of the summer and what the outlook seems to be for the second half of the year for transaction activity.  So I feel -- I'm feeling relatively good about where we stand right now. I think we were -- we certainly were one of the first in the industry to begin to look to sell assets. We didn't just come up with this idea in the last 6 to 8 months. And I think we've made great progress overall on the sale program. I'm hopeful that we'll be able to keep going, but at this stage, I think we'll have to take a little bit of a wait-and-see attitude for the second half of the year."

We're operating on a scaled-down basis when executing the program on some of our mid-sized hotels. The benefits there will not be as significant in a total-dollar context as they were on the larger hotels simply because the hotels are smaller. But as we work our way through getting the benefits from this, part of structure of this program is that there is a bit of a cost-sharing relationship with the company that's helping us with that, and so part of what we're -- the second year of the benefit, we don't really taper anything. Consequently, there is an opportunity for further pickup there. So I'd say we've certainly gotten meaningful benefits. We would expect to continue to get more going forward."

Our sense was that we were still down in the first quarter on international travel.

The 2 major inbound markets that we saw were down from a standpoint of air arrivals were Canada and Brazil, which were both down about 5%. So those were 2 markets where, I think, in Brazil it's probably an economic situation. In Canada, I think that's really still being hit by the dollar. There was some discussion actually at our recent GM's meeting that there was a feeling that we may start to see international improve in the summer, both because of some better circumstances in some of those countries and also the fact that if the U.S. dollar doesn't continue to strengthen then the year-over-year change in the dollar is not as dramatic as what we saw in 2015.

And of course, as you know, it represents 37%, 38% of our overall business. So we've always been more significantly weighted to group than the industry. I'm comfortable that with that pace, to the extent that we saw sort of a reacceleration in corporate transient that we would -- that would not present a problem for us, because that would just be directly reflected in the form of higher rates that we'd be able to charge transient customers. And in fact that's one of the reasons why we like to have a very solid group base. I think if you look more broadly at why we are where we are and others may be where they are in terms of outlook, I think some of this is the fact that we do have a very diversified portfolio. So no market represents more than 11% of our EBITDA. And we've got some exposure to some lower supply markets, whether it's Phoenix, Atlanta or maybe New Orleans, where we're looking at very strong growth this year out of those markets. The fact that we have a significant chunk of our portfolio in some key resort assets, I think, also helps because so far what the trend we've been seeing this year is very strong leisure demand, and we hope that, that continues. And lastly, sort of back to the group point that the large number of big group hotels that we have, which contribute meaningfully to our profitability, they're all in good physical condition. We've invested significantly in them. And this is the part of the cycle where they have an opportunity to truly perform, both at the top and the bottom.

We have no doubt based on our conversations with the folks at Marriott that they understand the importance of getting that right, not just for our own sake, but obviously for their own success. They are a talented group of people, and -- but one thing that Marriott's always been very good at execution. So I don't want to underestimate the challenges that they face, but I certainly think that they are aware of what they're heading into and doing the best they can to manage that process.
At the property -- some of this -- there obviously is activity that happens above the property on the marketing side, but I don't want to lead everybody with the sense that when you look at who is running the hotel on a day-to-day basis, those folks are on site at the property. And as we just -- again, we had a meeting with all of our GMs a week ago, and it was clear that in talking to both the Starwood and the Marriott GMs, that they are all very enthusiastic about this combination. It dramatically improved sort of their opportunity. It will facilitate cooperation in an appropriate manner in various markets, where we may have assets branded by -- under both companies. And I think in a lot of ways from -- at the property level, they're very fired up about what the future might bring. So we're very focused on making certain that they stay focused on what they're doing. But we're very much aligned with those property GMs in terms of their activity.

As you may summarize from our results, it was an interesting quarter. While the operating environment across our industry was a bit choppy, we executed its plan on dispositions we has previously referenced and added 2 more plans sales.
On the investment side, we acquired an irreplaceable ground lease, completed several major ROI investments and continued to repurchase our stock, all while the focus on creating value for our shareholders.
Let's start with the review of our results for the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $436 million for the quarter, which represents an increase of 3.3% over 2015 and was $782 million for the first half of the year, up 5.2%. Our adjusted FFO was $0.49 per share, an increase of 6.5% for the quarter, and $0.90 per share year-to-date, an increase of 11%. 
Overall, we are pleased with our bottom line EBITDA and FFO growth, which generally met or exceeded both our expectations in! consensus, but we were disappointed that our room revenue growth was not stronger.
Our portfolio occupancy rate were 82.4%, an increase of 120 basis points compared to 2015. Constant currency RevPAR increased 2% for the quarter, as rate growth was difficult to generate. This RevPAR result was well below what we had anticipated in April.
We expect that we would benefit from strong group bookings, and that generally proves to be correct as group room nights increased 3% to the than a 6.5% growth in our association segment and a very solid increase in corporate group. Our average group rate was up more than 2%, leading to a revenue improvement in group of more than 5%. While this certainly qualifies as a strong group quarter core, it is worth noting that short-term group bookings declined to the 3-year average level, falling short of last year's accelerated pace. And we did experience a slight increase in cancellation. 
However, our transient segment fell meaningfully short of our expectation. Overall, transient room nights declined by 1% as corporate demands proved soft. This resulted in the hotels being forced to target price-sensitive leisure business and government business, with the latter segment up nearly 7%. The net result of this mixed shift was our average transient rate fell slightly and transient revenues declined by slightly more than 1%. To help offset this transient softness, we increased our contract room nights by more than 20%. 
Declining international demand was also a drag on our transient demand. While difficult to precisely calculate, our international business would represented slightly more than 10% of our total room nights, decreased approximately 7% in the quarter, further undermining our manager's efforts to drive transient rates.
Fortunately, a combination of strong group business and catering activity led to a 6.6% increase in banquet and AV revenue, which enabled the portfolio to achieve food and beverage revenue growth of 4.5%. 
Sales per group room night jumped more than 4%, which is one of our stronger quarters during this cycle and a good indication that groups are still prepared to spend freely on events.
Since nearly all of the SMB revenue growth came from the profitable catering business, the flow-through was quite strong at north of 70%. Other revenues at our comparable hotels grew 4.6%, and STAR revenues improved, and we experienced an increase in attrition and cancellation fees, which are now running slightly ahead of what we experienced in the last 2 years. The flow-through in this area was off quite strong.
The solid flow-through in all segments of our business, combined with the benefits of various asset management initiatives and property investments, which Greg will detail -- discuss in more detail, led to comparable hotel EBITDA margin improvement of 65 basis points and EBITDA flow-through of more than 50%. As a result, comparable hotel EBITDA improved by roughly 5%. 
Year-to-date, our transient contract revenues have increased 3.3% and our group revenues have improved by 3.1%. Comparable SMB revenues have increased 2.8%, driven by banquet and AV increase of 3.7%. Total comparable revenues have increased 2.9% and comparable EBITDA margins have increased 75 basis points, leading to EBITDA improvement year-to-date of 5.7%. 
Turning to asset sales. As I referenced at the outset, we continued to make solid progress in our non-core asset disposition program. Closing the sales of the Atlanta perimeter, Seattle [indiscernible] and Manhattan Beach Marriott, as well as our 2 hotels located in Chile. The 3 U.S. assets represented older hotels located in airport or suburban locations that we felt was likely not grow cash flows over the long-term at the rate of our overall portfolio. These sales, plus the 2 Christchurch, New Zealand hotels, as we noted are under binding contract, bring our total sales for the year to roughly $500 million.
It is worth noting that the EBITDA we are receiving in 2016 from these assets totaled $13 million, which should not be included in any of your 2017 estimates. While we continue to market several hotels, the buyer pool has declined in size and pricing is not as attractive as when we commenced our sales program we few years ago.
While we do expect to complete additional sales, we are only a seller if we can achieve acceptable pricing. During the last 3.5 years, we have sold more than $2.6 billion worth of hotels, or nearly 15% of our consolidated and joint venture portfolio, which has enabled us to further refine our asset base and improved shareholder value. We are very comfortable with our overall progress on this front. 
Looking in investments. We are very pleased to acquired the ground leases with Tiffany [indiscernible] Marriott. The second Marriott hotel to be constructed, this property situated in Arlington, Virginia, at the end of the key bridge, which provides direct access to Georgetown and has spectacular views of Washington and all of the national monument. We are in the midst of evaluating the various options for this site and hotel, which will clearly include alternate uses, and we look forward to providing updates on this exciting project in the future.
We have also completed the redevelopment of the Hyatt San Francisco Airport and the new 152,000-square-foot ballroom and exhibit hall complex at the San Diego Marquis. Both of these projects were completed on time and underbudget. In addition to renovating all the rooms and meeting spaces at the Hyatt, we also completed 9,000 square feet of new meeting space and totally transformed the Atrium and SMB platform.
Our group bookings for this hotel for the next 2 years are 35% ahead of the preconstruction levels. We also expect to have a very strong ball operating season.
At the San Diego Marquis, we have created the best combination of ballroom and exhibit space in the market, and customers are responding favorably as bookings for the next 2 years have increased 40% compared to preconstruction level.
As the second quarter proved that it's challenging to develop guidance during interesting times for the industry, the following factors provide some insight into our thinking about the second half of 2016. 
Based on consensus, economic forecast and general uncertainty around the U.S. election and international events, we expect that business profit growth and investment levels will not improve would suggest the business transient demand will remain soft. Alternatively, continued strong employment and consumer confidence numbers suggest that leisure demand will remain solid. We expect international travel patterns will remain challenged as demand from our -- from two of our largest international markets, Canada and Latin America, are impacted by the both the strong U.S. dollar and weaker domestic economic growth.
Our group revenue pays for the remainder of the year is up more than 4%, with the majority of the increase occurring in the third quarter. While we would expect some moderation in the overall increase in our group segment, this compares favorably to the actual improvement we experienced in the first half of the year.
Q3 will benefit from the calendar shift to the Jewish holidays into October, while the fourth quarter will be hurt by both the shift and less travel expected during the week, that includes Election Day.
The combination of all these factors suggest that RevPAR growth in the second half of the year will generally match what we experienced in Q2, with the third quarter considerably stronger and the fourth quarter somewhat weaker. As a result, we anticipate full year RevPAR will range from 2% to 3%. We expect F&B and other revenue growth will moderate slightly from the first half growth of 2.8%, but still generate increased profits over 2015.
The combination of solid flow-through from all revenue generating activities, continued benefit from our asset management efforts and the strong start to the year is expected to lead to comparable hotel EBITDA margin improvement from 40 to 70 basis points.
The net result of these factors is an estimated range for adjusted EBITDA of $1,435,000,000 to $1,465,000,000, which reflects a reduction at the midpoint of $7.5 million from our prior range. $1.5 million of this adjustment is tied to the sale of the 2 Christchurch hotels I referenced earlier, and the remainder is due to the reduction in our estimated top line growth, partially offset by improving margins. Our forecasted adjusted FFO range is $1.63 to $1.67.
With that, let me turn the call over to Greg Larson, our Chief Financial Officer, who will discuss our operating and financial performance in more detail."

I'll start with specific commentary performance within some of our major markets. RevPAR at our properties in Los Angeles continued to outperform the portfolio, with an impressive 9.1% increase in the second quarter. The results were driven",1650,"Thank you, Ed. I'll start with specific commentary performance within some of our major markets. RevPAR at our properties in Los Angeles continued to outperform the portfolio, with an impressive 9.1% increase in the second quarter. The results were driven by a 5% increase in ADR and a 3-percentage-point increase in occupancy to 84.2%. 
A strong group base, combined with solid transient demand at several of our hotels, drove the RevPAR increase, which exceeded the STAR opera upper scale results by 140 basis points.
Looking forward, group booking pays in Los Angeles remains very strong, as the market is expected to host additional citywide during the remainder of this year as a result, we expect continued outperformance from Los Angeles properties.
Our two comparable hotels in Denver grew RevPAR 7.3% this quarter and outpaced the STAR opera result by 260 basis points. Strong group and transient demand at the West End primary droved this outperformance. However, based on the softening of the citywide pays and decreasing size of events, we expect our hotels in Denver to underperform the portfolio in the third quarter.
In Atlanta, RevPAR increased 6.6% for the quarter, as the result of average rate growth of 3.2% and occupancy increase of 2.6 percentage points. Once again, a number of citywide events in the second quarter contributed to the outperformance.
Based on group revenues on the books for the remainder of the year, we expect third quarter results to be better than the fourth quarter. RevPAR growth of 5.5% of D.C. hotels significantly outperformed the STAR opera upscale RevPAR increase by 230 basis points, this was driven by both occupancy and rate quarter as occupancy increased 2.2 percentage points and average rate grew 2.9%. 
Several of our DC hotels benefited the from planned renovation that we competed last year. Based on group booking pays for these hotels, we expect our properties in D.C. to achieve solid results in the third quarter.
Our Boston hotels RevPAR growth of 5% in the second quarter was driven by a rate increase of 2.2% and an occupancy improvement of 2.3 percentage points. Our manager's aggressive strategies to offer promotion and add high-end airline crews bolstered the RevPAR increase this quarter.
These hotels also had an impressive increase in food and beverage revenues of 15.8%, entirely from the increase in the more profitable banquet and catering sales. Overall, our Boston properties are experiencing softer special corporate demand from the financial and consulting segment. As a result, we expect RevPAR to underperform the rest of our portfolio in the third quarter.
RevPAR at San Francisco hotels grew 2.8%, primarily driven by a rate increase of 2.9%. Overall, transient demand softness and group room night declines, due to the Moscone Center Convention construction, led to demand weakness this quarter. 
However, catering business at several San Francisco hotels drove the outstanding banquet and catering revenue growth of over 33% this quarter. The expansion of the Moscone Convention Center will continue to negatively impact the San Francisco market for the remainder of 2016 and through 2017.  Our San Francisco hotels will likely underperform our portfolio in the remaining quarters.
Moving to some challenged markets. New York RevPAR decreased 4.9%, with outperformance to STAR opera upscale market RevPAR decline of 6%. Occupancy dropped slightly to 89.8% and rate declined 4.8% in the second quarter.
Supply continues to outpace demand, which is impacting our ability to drive rate. We have also witnessed the European travel and tour business declining, due to the strong U.S. dollar. Based on our outlook for the market, we expect our hotels in New York to continue to have negative RevPAR for the remainder of the year.
As anticipated, our hotels in Florida underperformed the portfolio, with a RevPAR decrease of 2.2% in the second quarter. Occupancy declined 2 percentage points and rate increased 0.4%. The decline in RevPAR was due to softer leisure transient demand as well as increased group attrition and cancellations. 
On a positive note, group customers increased the food and beverage spend in the more profitable banquet and catering business by 15.8%. In addition, based on a strong group revenue pays for the third quarter, we expect RevPAR in Florida to outperform the portfolio in the third quarter.
RevPAR and assets in San Diego grew slightly this quarter. Occupancy declined 2.9 percentage points and rate increased 3.6%. Our hotels were negatively impacted by an 8.6% decline in transient revenues, resulting from fewer citywide compression nights from downtown.
Despite the slow start in San Diego, we expect the hotels in this market to improve in the second half of 2016 as the city should benefit from an increase in citywide room nights for the remainder of the year, especially in the third quarter.
In addition, the new 152,000-square-foot Marriott Hall opened in June 2016 at the San Diego Marquis. Moving to our international assets. These hotels had a constant dollar RevPAR growth of 2.3% in the quarter. Latin America drove much of the international growth, with a constant dollar RevPAR increase of 5%, primarily from continued pre-Olympics business in Rio. Due to the upcoming Olympics this summer, we expect Latin America to have a spectacular third quarter.
Shifting to our European joint venture. The portfolio was negatively impacted by a number of macro factors, including: the lingering effects of the Paris attacks in Paris and Brussels; and the political and economic uncertainty pre and post Brexit. All these led to a RevPAR decline of 1.3% in constant Europe this quarter. As expected, our hotels in Paris, London and Brussels significantly underperformed the portfolio, while our hotels in Spain, [indiscernible] and Amsterdam outperformed. We expect the challenges that I described for our hotels in Paris, London and Brussels will continue into the third quarter.
Moving to our profitability. Our comparable EBITDA margin expansion of 65 basis points, in an environment with 2% RevPAR growth, is very impressive. This notable EBITDA margin growth is the result of decreases in our utility and insurance expenses as well as our continued cost saving initiatives. Utility cost decreased almost 6% and insurance expense decreased 5.5% in the quarter. Utility costs continued to decline in the second quarter due to favorable gas and electric prices as well as the benefits from our cost saving, energy ROI initiatives.
As we have said previously, we have invested in numerous energy projects over the last year, ranging from small to major projects, which are favorably impacting our utility cost. Further, in June, we completed our annual negotiation of our insurance contracts and lowered rates for another year. Therefore, we expect our insurance expense to continue to decrease for the remainder of the year and through the first half of 2017.
Over the last 2 years, we have focused on improving productivity at our hotels by initiating time emotion studies at our largest hotels. These studies resulted in hotel managers establishing tighter labor model standards and the years of improved and expanded forecasting tools, allowing managers to effectively schedule to demand and minimize excess staffing.
For example, many of our housekeeping departments are now using an automated system, integrated with a property management system to prioritize housekeeping room assignments using a Wi-Fi-enabled device.
The system saves some time and labor expense on getting guests the rooms faster. Hourly productivity at our hotels that have implemented the recommendations improved over 400 basis points more than those hotels that have not yet conducted a time motion study.
While all the discussion of technology as a disruptor in the lodging space, we are seeing real cost savings benefits of technology in our industry and our properties. In addition, sustainability initiatives that provide guests with the options to forgo housekeeping services, in exchange for reward points, like Marriott's Your Room, Your Choice and Starwood's Make A Green Choice Program, are also positively impacting expenses.
Given the positive margin results in the first half of 2016, we now expect full year comparable EBITDA margins to increase 40 to 70 basis points. We also expect approximately 22.5% to 23% of our total and adjusted EBITDA to be generated in the third quarter.
As disclosed in our press release, during the second quarter, we repurchased 5.2 million shares, at an average price of $15.39, for a total purchase price of $81 million. Since the inception of our share repurchase program in April 2015, we have bought back 48.6 million shares of common stock, for a total purchase price of approximately $838 million. We currently have $162 million of capacity remaining under the repurchase program.
In addition, we paid a regular second quarter cash dividend at $0.20 per share, which represents a yield over 4.5% on the current stock price. We continued to operate, from a position of financial strength and flexibility, and believe we have one of the best balance sheets in the lodging REIT and overall REIT space. Importantly, we view this as a key competitive and strategic advantage and expect to continue benefiting from it going forward.
We ended the second quarter with approximately $266 million of cash, 739 million of available capacity under our revolving credit facility and $3.7 billion of debt. We improved our leverage ratio, as calculated, under our credit facility to 2.6x.
During the quarter, we repaid the $100 million mortgage loan secured by the Hyatt Regency Reston hotel. We also think it is important to note that 95 of our hotels, which represents 99% of our revenues, are unencumbered by mortgage debt.
In summary, we are pleased with our results this quarter, as the profitability of our assets continues to improve, as a result of our aggressive asset management strategies and what continues to be a competitive market environment.
This concludes our prepared remarks, we are now interested in answering any questions you may have. To ensure we have time to address questions from as many of you as possible. [Operator Instructions]"

As best as we can tell, it seems like most of the cancellations were, what I would describe as situational, so they were, some cases, there might have been a change around a product, and so there was around the timing of the product launch. But, in other cases, it sounded as if certain companies were just trying to be thoughtful about the level of expense that they were incurring in 2016, and I attribute that in part to some of the weaker corporate profit numbers that we've seen. So it did feel as if it was [indiscernible] it seems like it was specific to the individual companies that had cancellations. So I took some comfort from, was the fact that the cancellations that seeing were generally focused on 2016, we're not necessarily seeing any increase in cancellations related to 2017.

It really is a great location on the edge of Georgetown and the views of from the rooms are spectacular because you're looking right down the mall and all the monuments. This was a land lease situation from the time the hotel was built. We had to spend off and on the last 10 years negotiating with the owners of the --  the foundation that owned the property, in an effort to try to get complete control of the property. So I guess, I would say, it was opportunistic in the sense that we finally had -- and they were finally motivated to sell. And we, finally, had the opportunity to buy. We had the Right of First Refusal, which is essentially what we exercised on. So it was sort of -- we had -- if we were going to buy it, we needed to do it now. And I think as it relates to the opportunities for the property, there's -- we believe we haven't had extensive conversations with local officials yet, but we are fairly comfortable in believing that there is excess density associated with the site. So we're in the process now that we know we have control in the property. We're looking at a range of options that would include the complete scraping of the asset and a complete redevelopment of the entire parcel, which should involve for us probably selling off a number of those parcels to other parties. So essentially redeveloping a part of the hotel, and then selling off portions of the hotel to third parties to develop either residential or office. So we're really in the midst of the upper right now to understand how to maximize the value. There is a lot of local interest in the site, local and national interest for that matter because of just the superb positioning of the property. So we'll provide more than update going forward as we have a clear idea about how to maximize value from this property."

And then, I think we feel fairly confident about outlasting the play out for this year. And then we also expect that there'll be an opportunity for incremental lift in 2017, simply because in each instance, 3 of the 4 properties, 1 in San Francisco, Camby, Phoenix and Logan in Philadelphia, all of those because, they were closed, were essentially new hotels opening up in the beginning of this year.

But I have a feeling, at this point, that, that sale is likely to be dragged into 2017 as opposed to be completed this year. And I think, as I said in our prepared remarks, we're very happy with the overall sales program that we've implemented over the last 3.5 years. We would like to continue to sell assets in part because we'd love to use the proceeds and contracts of our stock buyback program, but we do want to make certain that we're getting pricing that we think makes sense. Now if you look at the sales that we've announced so far this year, without even taking into account the capital spending that might have been required as part of the transition of that property, say to a franchise status, we were in the mid-7s in terms of a cap rate on those sales, which frankly compares very favorably to where we've trading as a company.

So there are a couple more that I think we would like to sell, where we would view them, is perhaps, detractors in the long run for likely performance. But not that many. I mean I'm really talking about small handful of hotels. So I'd say that it ultimately moving past, perhaps, selling that handful of hotels, it really just comes down to a bunch of pricing. And in a market that seems to be a little less robust than where it has been, I'd probably say, at this moment, I'm not as optimistic than we're necessarily going to be selling a lot of additional hotels, unless we see pricing start to improve."

Did make I think it's a little bit dependent on the type of buyers that you're dealing with. So the international buyers tend to be looking more at long-term storage as value. And attended -- what we have found in our conversations with them, trends towards the higher quality assets. But financial buyers that are probably are using more leverage than what we might necessarily use, it seems to me that they're primarily focused on a cash flow stream that will generate a fairly attractive rate of return and provide some cushioning again what might happen later in this cycle, and trying to rely less on a growth in the value with the asset in terms of certainly cap rate compression or just a significant increase in value down the road. So it seems to be a much more around current cash flow in terms of a driver for that."

So I think  what  we indicated earlier in the year was that we were certainly had a very strong group bookings. And I think at the end the first quarter, as we look through the rest of the year, we thought we were up, I think, it was around 5% to 6%. And what we said at the time was because we were running so far ahead in terms of the prior year, in terms of group bookings, that, to some degree, there was just not as many nights and rooms that were still capable sold to a lot of those hotels to growth. And so we were expecting that what would happen over the course of the year is the group would still be very strong, but that it will generally fall to a level of production on from a revenue perspective. That was consistent with the overall range of RevPAR guidance that we were providing at that point in time. So we were just suggesting that, yes, we might be up 5% to 6% right now, but given, at that point in time, we were talking 3% to 4% of RevPAR. We will expect group revenues to be moderate and be in line with that level. If I were to look out today, looking out for the rest of the year, I would say that what we generally were expecting is going to happen with the group, which was at that leader that we had over the prior year with probably condensed affect. That has happened. I think they're still pretty found this pretty confident about group through the second half of the year. It -- I might on the margins and because we've seen a little bit of incremental weakness in short-term group bookings that we're a hair less confident in terms of how group compares to what we thought in April. So, by and large, when we look at our booking page for to remainder of the year, the expectations to what we actually expect to generate. We still feel pretty good about the groups -- our group business.
So when we look into next year, I would say that we're probably -- we are running a little bit behind, our growth for '17 is not as strong as our growth for '16. Our growth for '16 is taking back to calendar '15, which is sort of mid-single digit for most of 2015. So we are behind in terms of a rate of growth, but, of course, remember, we've been saying for a while, including a lot of last year, that the group bookings for 2016 were quite strong.

I would say that what we have found over the years was the best indicator of what was going to happen to corporate transient, is generally tied to what's happening in terms of business investments. The investment Activity is higher, travel seems to be business, transient seems to be stronger. And while I was didn't much time, to absorb the GDP report that came out earlier this morning, I did notice the business investment was off in the second quarter. And I think it might be even off more than 2%. 
So I won't say that our approach to this is so scientific that we calibrated what our expectation for business investment would be for the second half of the year. I think I presumed too much, but we did assume, based on the data that we've been seeing and the outlook that we would see from people that spend on time forecasting that, is generally what was expected to be weaker. So -- until that changes, we assume that corporate travel will probably still be there, but the growth in them the meds for that will not be as a strong as they may have been in the past and that's one of the reasons why as we look at the transient the side of our business and I don't think my comments is that, that's the part of our business. And just to point it out, in Q2, that's the part of our business that we think is weaker in the second half of the year. We're assuming that we will see weakness in corporate demand consequently more towards some of the more price-sensitive segments in leisure discount business. And that's what underlies the fact that we're adjusting our RevPAR guidance down for the second half of the year and obviously for the full year."

The last -- certainly the last 2 downturns, my guess is it that your general assumption is that once it roll over, it continued to head down. Now what's different though is that in both of those last 2 cycles in 2001, it has started to go negative in the beginning of the year and then, obviously, we had the attack on 9/11, followed by SARS, followed by the war. So we sort of had, once things went a little south, I don't know that we necessarily got a chance to see how the economic environment was going to play out in kind of -- in this context. There was a lot of other events that intervene to create a problem. And of course the financial recession had somewhat a similar tempo to it. So coming back to what we might expect this time, I do think that, if you look at what the Fed just said, when they came out earlier this week, I don't know that they're necessarily acting or speaking in the context of thinking that the economy is about to roll over. I have a feeling, just to sort of looking at this through my own lens, is that part of what corporate America is trying to figure out is what Brexit mean? What is this unsettled police attacks that have happened across the world? Who in the world is going to be the next President of the United States? And what exactly -- what policies are they going to pursue? So I can't, the last thing I try to do is predict the future in terms of economics. But I could look at this and say that if the Fed is right that the underlying economy is actually fairly healthy, then if companies had a different perspective about some of these issues, that I think do effect people's willingness to invest, I think there is an opportunity to see corporate investment improve. I believe the consensus forecast for next year thus call for some slight improvement in business investment, not robust, but some slight improvement. And so, not so say necessarily be right at all through the cycle, but if they were right, I think that might offer an opportunity to keep some improvements."

I mean the 2 trends that we've seen is that, in terms the market like Washington, will end up with a little bit softer business in the fourth quarter because there some -- when you're having a nationwide election, most of the elected officials can be out of the city. And in fact, they drove for business in Washington, sometimes seen some softening of business in D.C. related to that. We have generally seen that the election week ends up being relatively slow on the group side because these larger groups are reluctant to schedule an event that would overlap Election Day. And so that's one of the reasons why we've indicated, really the last couple of quarters now, we highlighted the fact that we were overly confident about the fourth quarter. One reason is the holiday shift, but the other was the fact that, we felt that this Election Day would be one that groups would be reluctant to book in.

I think, in general, what we're -- the pattern that we've seen in the last few years is that, there's estimates from the experts in terms of what's going to happen with supply growth for the beginning of the year. And then, normally what seems to happen, by the time we get to this point in the year a little bit later, we begin to realize that the supply growth is actually going to materialize slightly less, it's because projects have a tendency to be delayed. This year, I think we started off the year thinking that nationwide supply was probably going to be just under 2, and now it feels like it might be more in that 1 6, 1 7 range, which is not a huge difference, but still on the margin a little bit better. that sort of 16. We're expecting that supply next year will increase somewhat. I think we see that both in across of the industry and we also see that in the upper price points in the top 20 markets. So again I'd say we're probably expecting the industries are little bit over 2, and probably expect that the supply in the top 20 markets is a little bit higher than that. I would also guess though that, at some point, we're going to see  we'll see the same sort of lengthening of the deliveries and delivery time for that supply, which would hopefully may be pull that down a little bit. New York continues -- New York and Houston and Miami tend to be the markets that continues to see the strongest supply. Seattle might be one more that falls into that category. We are seeing -- while supply for New York will continue to be robust and a lot of it is under construction. My sense in looking at the data was what we're seeing fewer projects that were projected to start in the next 12 months and fewer projects in planning. And so we're hoping that, that may signal a return to some level of rationality around New York supply. But we're not going to see the benefits of that in 2017."

As you may surmise from our results, it was an interesting quarter.

As you may surmise from our results, it was an interesting quarter. While the operating environment across our industry was a bit choppy, we executed its plan on the dispositions we have previously referenced and added 2 more planned sales.
On the investment side, we acquired an irreplaceable ground lease, completed several major ROI investments and continued to repurchase our stock, all with a focus on creating value for our shareholders.
Let's start with the review of our results for the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $436 million for the quarter, which represents an increase of 3.3% over 2015 and was $782 million for the first half of the year, up 5.2%. Our adjusted FFO was $0.49 per share, an increase of 6.5% for the quarter, and $0.90 per share year-to-date, an increase of 11%. Overall, we are pleased with our bottom line EBITDA and FFO growth, which generally met or exceeded both our expectations in consensus, but we were disappointed that our room revenue growth was not stronger.
Our portfolio occupancy rate was 82.4%, an increase of 120 basis points compared to 2015. Constant currency RevPAR increased 2% for the quarter, as rate growth was difficult to generate. This RevPAR result was well below what we had anticipated in April.
We expected that we would benefit from strong group bookings, and that generally proved to be correct as group room nights increased 3% due to more than a 6.5% growth in our association segment and a very solid increase in corporate group. Our average group rate was up more than 2%, leading to a revenue improvement in group of more than 5%. While this certainly qualifies as a strong group quarter, it is worth noting that short-term group bookings declined to the 3-year average level, falling short of last year's accelerated pace, and we did experience a slight increase in cancellation. 
However, our transient segment fell meaningfully short of our expectation. Overall, transient room nights declined by 1% as corporate demand proved soft. This resulted in the hotels being forced to target price-sensitive leisure business and government business, with the latter segment up nearly 7%. The net result of this mix shift was our average transient rate fell slightly and transient revenues declined by slightly more than 1%. To help offset this transient softness, we increased our contract room nights by more than 20%. 
Declining international demand was also a drag on our transient demand. While difficult to precisely calculate, our international business, which represents slightly more than 10% of our total room nights, decreased approximately 7% in the quarter, further undermining our managers' efforts to drive transient rate.
Fortunately, a combination of strong group business and catering activity led to a 6.6% increase in banquet and AV revenue, which enabled the portfolio to achieve food and beverage revenue growth of 4.5%. 
Sales per group room night jumped more than 4%, which is one of our stronger quarters during this cycle and a good indication that groups are still prepared to spend freely on events.
Since nearly all of the F&B revenue growth came from the profitable catering business, the flow-through was quite strong at north of 70%. Other revenues at our comparable hotels grew 4.6%, as STAR revenues improved and we experienced an increase in attrition and cancellation fees, which are now running slightly ahead of what we experienced in the last 2 years. The flow-through in this area was also quite strong.
The solid flow-through in all segments of our business, combined with the benefits of various asset management initiatives and property investments, which Greg will detail -- discuss in more detail, led to comparable hotel EBITDA margin improvement of 65 basis points and EBITDA flow-through of more than 50%. As a result, comparable hotel EBITDA improved by roughly 5%. 
Year-to-date, our transient contract revenues have increased 3.3%, and our group revenues have improved by 3.1%. Comparable F&B revenues have increased 2.8%, driven by banquet and AV increase of 3.7%. Total comparable revenues have increased 2.9%, and comparable EBITDA margins have increased 75 basis points, leading to EBITDA improvement year-to-date of 5.7%. 
Turning to asset sales. As I referenced at the outset, we continue to make solid progress in our non-core asset disposition program. Closing the sales of the Atlanta Perimeter, Seattle Sea-Tac and Manhattan Beach Marriott as well as our 2 hotels located in Chile. The 3 U.S. assets represented older hotels located in airport or suburban locations that we felt would likely not grow cash flows over the long term at the rate of our overall portfolio. These sales, plus the 2 Christchurch, New Zealand hotels that we noted are under binding contract, bring our total sales for the year to roughly $500 million. It is worth noting that the EBITDA we are receiving in 2016 from these assets totaled $13 million, which should not be included in any of your 2017 estimates. 
While we continue to market several hotels, the buyer pool has declined in size, and pricing is not as attractive as when we commenced our sale program a few years ago. While we do expect to complete additional sales, we are only a seller if we can achieve acceptable pricing. During the last 3.5 years, we have sold more than $2.6 billion worth of hotels or nearly 15% of our consolidated and joint venture portfolio, which has enabled us to further refine our asset base and improve shareholder value. We are very comfortable with our overall progress on this front. 
Looking in investments. We are very pleased to have acquired the ground leases that sit beneath the Key Bridge Marriott. The second Marriott hotel to be constructed, this property is situated in Arlington, Virginia, at the end of the key bridge, which provides direct access to Georgetown and has spectacular views of Washington and all of the national monuments. We are in the midst of evaluating the various options for this site and hotel, which will clearly include alternate uses, and we look forward to providing updates on this exciting project in the future.
We have also completed the redevelopment of the Hyatt San Francisco Airport and the new 152,000-square-foot ballroom and exhibit hall complex at the San Diego Marquis. Both of these projects were completed on time and under budget. In addition to renovating all of the rooms and meeting space at the Hyatt, we also completed 9,000 square feet of new meeting space and totally transformed the atrium and F&B platform. Our group bookings for this hotel for the next 2 years are 35% ahead of the preconstruction levels. We also expect to have a very strong fall operating season.
At the San Diego Marquis, we have created the best combination of ballroom and exhibit space in the market, and customers are responding favorably, as bookings for the next 2 years have increased 40% compared to preconstruction levels.
As the second quarter proved that it's challenging to develop guidance during interesting times for the industry, the following factors provide some insight into our thinking about the second half of 2016. Based on consensus economic forecasts and general uncertainty around the U.S. election and international events, we expect that business profit growth and investment levels will not improve, which suggest the business transient demand will remain soft. Alternatively, continued strong employment and consumer confidence numbers suggest that leisure demand will remain solid. We expect international travel patterns will remain challenged, as demand from our -- from two of our largest international markets, Canada and Latin America, are impacted by both the strong U.S. dollar and weaker domestic economic growth.
Our group revenue pace for the remainder of the year is up more than 4%, with the majority of the increase occurring in the third quarter. While we would expect some moderation in the overall increase in our group segment, this compares favorably to the actual improvement we experienced in the first half of the year.
Q3 will benefit from the calendar shift of the Jewish holidays into October, while the fourth quarter will be hurt by both that shift and less travel expected during the week that includes Election Day.
The combination of all these factors suggests that RevPAR growth in the second half of the year will generally match what we experienced in Q2, with the third quarter considerably stronger and the fourth quarter somewhat weaker. As a result, we anticipate full year RevPAR will range from 2% to 3%. We expect F&B and other revenue growth will moderate slightly from the first half growth of 2.8% but still generate increased profits over 2015.
Combination of solid flow-through from all revenue-generating activities, continued benefit from our asset management efforts and the strong start to the year is expected to lead to comparable hotel EBITDA margin improvement from 40 to 70 basis points.
The net result of these factors is an estimated range for adjusted EBITDA of $1,435,000,000 to $1,465,000,000, which reflects a reduction at the midpoint of $7.5 million from our prior range. $1.5 million of this adjustment is tied to the sale of the 2 Christchurch hotels I referenced earlier, and the remainder is due to the reduction in our estimated top line growth, partially offset by improving margins. Our forecasted adjusted FFO range is $1.63 to $1.67.
With that, let me turn the call over to Greg Larson, our Chief Financial Officer, who will discuss our operating and financial performance in more detail."

I'll start with specific commentary on performance within some of our major markets. 
RevPAR at our properties in Los Angeles continued to outperform the portfolio, with an impressive 9.1% increase in the second quarter. The results were driven by a 5% increase in ADR and a 3-percentage-point increase in occupancy to 84.2%. A strong group base, combined with solid transient demand at several of our hotels, drove the RevPAR increase, which exceeded the STAR upper upscale results by 140 basis points.
Looking forward, group booking pace in Los Angeles remains very strong, as the market is expected to host additional citywide during the remainder of this year. As a result, we expect continued outperformance from our Los Angeles properties.
Our 2 comparable hotels in Denver grew RevPAR 7.3% this quarter and outpaced the STAR upper upscale result by 260 basis points. Strong group and transient demand at the Westin primarily drove this outperformance. However, based on the softening of citywide pace and decreasing size of events, we expect our hotels in Denver to underperform the portfolio in the third quarter.
In Atlanta, RevPAR increased 6.6% for the quarter as a result of average rate growth of 3.2% and occupancy increase of 2.6 percentage points. Once again, a number of citywide events in the second quarter contributed to the outperformance. Based on group revenues on the books for the remainder of the year, we expect third quarter results to be better than the fourth quarter. 
RevPAR growth of 5.5% of our D.C. hotels significantly outperformed the STAR upper upscale RevPAR increase by 230 basis points. This was driven by both occupancy and rate this quarter, as occupancy increased 2.2 percentage points and average rate grew 2.9%. Several of our D.C. hotels benefited from planned renovations that we competed last year. Based on group booking pace for these hotels, we expect our properties in D.C. to achieve solid results in the third quarter.
Our Boston hotels RevPAR growth of 5% in the second quarter was driven by a rate increase of 2.2% and an occupancy improvement of 2.3 percentage points. Our managers' aggressive strategies to offer promotion and add high-end airline crews bolstered the RevPAR increase this quarter. These hotels also had an impressive increase in food and beverage revenues of 15.8%, entirely from the increase in the more profitable banquet and catering sales. Overall, our Boston properties are experiencing softer special corporate demand from the financial and consulting segment. As a result, we expect RevPAR to underperform the rest of our portfolio in the third quarter.
RevPAR at San Francisco hotels grew 2.8%, primarily driven by a rate increase of 2.9%. Overall transient demand softness and group room night declines due to the Moscone Center Convention construction led to demand weakness this quarter. However, strong catering business at several San Francisco hotels drove the outstanding banquet and catering revenue growth of over 33% this quarter. The expansion of the Moscone Convention Center will continue to negatively impact the San Francisco market for the remainder of 2016 and through 2017. Our San Francisco hotels will likely underperform our portfolio in the remaining quarters.
Moving to some challenged markets. New York RevPAR decreased 4.9% but outperformed the STAR upper upscale market RevPAR decline of 6%. Occupancy dropped slightly to 89.8%, and rate declined 4.8% in the second quarter. Supply continues to outpace demand, which is impacting our ability to drive rate. We have also witnessed the European travel and tour business declining due to the strong U.S. dollar. Based on our outlook for the market, we expect our hotels in New York to continue to have negative RevPAR for the remainder of the year.
As anticipated, our hotels in Florida underperformed the portfolio with a RevPAR decrease of 2.2% in the second quarter. Occupancy declined 2 percentage points, and rate increased 0.4%. The decline in RevPAR was due to softer leisure transient demand as well as increased group attrition and cancellations. 
On a positive note, group customers increased their food and beverage spend in the more profitable banquet and catering business by 15.8%. In addition, based on a strong group revenue pace for the third quarter, we expect RevPAR in Florida to outperform the portfolio in the third quarter.
RevPAR at our assets in San Diego grew slightly this quarter. Occupancy declined 2.9 percentage points, and rate increased 3.6%. Our hotels were negatively impacted by an 8.6% decline in transient revenues, resulting from fewer citywide compression nights from downtown. Despite the slow start in San Diego, we expect the hotels in this market to improve in the second half of 2016, as the city should benefit from an increase in citywide room nights for the remainder of the year, especially in the third quarter.
In addition, the new 152,000-square-foot Marriott Hall opened in June 2016 at the San Diego Marquis. 
Moving to our international assets. These hotels had a constant dollar RevPAR growth of 2.3% in the quarter. Latin America drove much of the international growth with a constant dollar RevPAR increase of 5%, primarily from continued pre-Olympics business in Rio. Due to the upcoming Olympics this summer, we expect Latin America to have a spectacular third quarter.
Shifting to our European joint venture. The portfolio was negatively impacted by a number of macro factors, including the lingering effects of the Paris attacks in Paris and Brussels and the political and economic uncertainty pre- and post-Brexit. All these led to a RevPAR decline of 1.3% in constant euro [ph] this quarter. As expected, our hotels in Paris, London and Brussels significantly underperformed the portfolio, while our hotels in Spain, Stockholm and Amsterdam outperformed. We expect the challenges that I described for our hotels in Paris, London and Brussels will continue into the third quarter.
Moving to our profitability. Our comparable EBITDA margin expansion of 65 basis points in an environment with 2% RevPAR growth is very impressive. This notable EBITDA margin growth is the result of decreases in our utility and insurance expenses as well as our continued cost saving initiatives. Utility costs decreased almost 6%, and insurance expense decreased 5.5% in the quarter. Utility costs continued to decline in the second quarter due to favorable gas and electric prices as well as the benefits from our cost saving energy ROI initiatives.
As we have said previously, we have invested in numerous energy projects over the last year, ranging from small to major projects, which are favorably impacting our utility cost. Further, in June, we completed our annual negotiation of our insurance contracts and lowered rates for another year. Therefore, we expect our insurance expense to continue to decrease for the remainder of the year and through the first half of 2017.
Over the last 2 years, we have focused on improving productivity at our hotels by initiating time and motion studies at our largest hotels. These studies resulted in hotel managers establishing tighter labor model standards and the use of improved and expanded forecasting tools, allowing managers to effectively schedule to demand and minimize excess staffing.
For example, many of our housekeeping departments are now using an automated system integrated with a property management system to prioritize housekeeping room assignments using a WiFi-enabled device. The system saves on time and labor expense while getting guests in the rooms faster. Total hourly productivity at our hotels that have implemented the recommendations improved over 400 basis points more than those hotels that have not yet conducted a time and motion study. 
For all the discussion of technology as a disruptor in the lodging space, we are seeing real cost saving benefits of technology in our industry and our properties. In addition, sustainability initiatives that provide guests with the option to forgo housekeeping services in exchange for reward points, like Marriott's Your Room. Your Choice and Starwood's Make A Green Choice program, are also positively impacting expenses.
Given the positive margin results in the first half of 2016, we now expect full year comparable EBITDA margins to increase 40 to 70 basis points. We also expect approximately 22.5% to 23% of our total and adjusted EBITDA to be generated in the third quarter.
As disclosed in our press release, during the second quarter, we repurchased 5.2 million shares at an average price of $15.39, for a total purchase price of $81 million. Since the inception of our share repurchase program in April 2015, we have bought back 48.6 million shares of common stock for a total purchase price of approximately $838 million. We currently have $162 million of capacity remaining under the repurchase program.
In addition, we paid a regular second quarter cash dividend at $0.20 per share, which represents a yield over 4.5% on the current stock price. We continue to operate from a position of financial strength and flexibility and believe we have one of the best balance sheets in the lodging REIT and overall REIT space. Importantly, we view this as a key competitive and strategic advantage and expect to continue benefiting from it going forward.
We ended the second quarter with approximately $266 million of cash, $739 million of available capacity under our revolving credit facility and $3.7 billion of debt. We improved our leverage ratio as calculated under our credit facility to 2.6x.
During the quarter, we repaid the $100 million mortgage loan secured by the Hyatt Regency Reston hotel. We also think it is important to note that 95 of our hotels, which represent 99% of our revenues, are unencumbered by mortgage debt.
In summary, we are pleased with our results this quarter, as the profitability of our assets continues to improve as a result of our aggressive asset management strategies in what continues to be a competitive market environment.
This concludes our prepared remarks. We are now interested in answering any questions you may have. [Operator Instructions]"

So they were -- in some cases, there might have been a change around a product, and so there was -- around the timing of a product launch. But in other cases, it sounded as if certain companies were just trying to be thoughtful about the level of expense that they were incurring in 2016, and I attribute that in part to some of the weaker corporate profit numbers that we've seen. So it did feel as if it was thematic. It seemed like it was specific to the individual companies that had cancellations. But I took some comfort from -- was the fact that the cancellations that we're seeing were generally focused on 2016. We're not necessarily seeing any increase in cancellations related to 2017. So that tells me that it's a little bit more of a short-term orientation, and people were not necessarily backing away from their plans to have events down the road."

The -- I guess, obviously, this is a hotel that's been in our company for a long period of time. For those of you that know Washington, D.C., you probably know the hotel because you've driven by it a number of times on the G.W. Parkway. It really is a great location on the edge of Georgetown, and the views from the rooms are spectacular because you're looking right down the mall at all the monuments. This was a land lease situation from the time the hotel was built. We have spent off and on the last 10 years negotiating with the owners of the  foundation that owned the property in an effort to try to get complete control of the property. So, I guess, I would say it was opportunistic in the sense that we finally had -- they were finally motivated to sell, and we finally had the opportunity to buy. We had the right of first refusal, which is essentially what we exercised on. So it was sort of -- we had -- if we were going to buy it, we needed to do it now. And I think as it relates to the opportunities for the property, there's -- we believe -- we haven't had extensive conversations with local officials yet, but we are fairly comfortable in believing that there is excess density associated with the site. So we're in a process now that we know we have control of the property. We're looking at a range of options that would include the complete scraping of the asset and a complete redevelopment of the entire parcel, which would involve for us probably selling off a number of those parcels to other parties. We are also potentially redeveloping a part of the hotel and then selling off portions of the hotel to third parties to develop either residential or office. So it wasn't -- we're really in the midst of the effort right now to understand how to maximize the value. There is a lot of local interest in the site, local and national interest, for that matter, because of just the superb positioning of the property. So we'll provide more of an update going forward as we have a clear idea about how to maximize value for this property."

And then I think we feel fairly confident about how that's going to the play out for this year. And then we also expect that there'll be an opportunity for incremental lift in 2017, simply because in each instance, 3 of the 4 properties, 1 in San Francisco, Camby in Phoenix and The Logan in Philadelphia, all of those, because they were closed, were essentially new hotels opening up in the beginning of this year.

But I have a feeling at this point that, that sale is likely to be dragged into 2017 as opposed to be completed this year. I think as I said in our prepared remarks, we're very happy with the overall sale program that we've implemented over the last 3.5 years. We would like to continue to sell assets in part because we'd love to use the proceeds and contracts of our stock buyback program, but we do want to make certain that we're getting pricing that we think makes sense. Now if you look at the sales that we've announced so far this year, without even taking into account the capital spending that might have been required as part of the transition of that property, say, to a franchise status, we were in the mid-7s in terms of a cap rate on those sales, which frankly compares very favorably to where we're trading as a company.

So I think what  we indicated earlier in the year was that we were -- certainly had very strong group bookings. And I think at the end of the first quarter, as we look through the rest of the year, we thought we were up I think it was around 5% to 6%. And what we said at the time was because we were running so far ahead in terms of the prior year in terms of group bookings, that, to some degree, there was just not as many nights and rooms that were still capable being sold in a lot of those hotels for group. And so we were expecting that what would happen over the course of the year is that group would still be very strong, but that it would generally fall to a level of production on from a revenue perspective that was consistent with the overall range of RevPAR guidance that we were providing at that point in time. So we were suggesting that, yes, we might be up 5% to 6% right now, but given at that point in time we were talking 3% to 4% in terms of RevPAR, we expected that group revenues would ultimately moderate and be more in line with that level. If I were to look out today, looking out for the rest of the year, I would say that what we generally were expecting was going to happen with group, which was that the lead that we had over the prior year would probably condense a bit, and that has happened. I think we're still pretty confident about group for the second half of the year. It -- I might on the margin say, because we've seen a little bit of incremental weakness in short-term group bookings, that we're a hair less confident in terms of how group compares to what we thought in April. So, by and large, when we look at our booking pace for the remainder of the year and calibrate them with expectations of what we actually expect to generate, we still feel pretty good about the group -- our group business. When we look into next year, I would say that we're probably -- we are running a little bit behind -- our growth for '17 is not as strong as our growth for '16. Our growth for '16, thinking back to calendar '15, was sort of mid-single digit for most of 2015. So we are behind in terms of a rate of growth, but, of course, remember, we've been saying for a while, including a lot of last year, that the group bookings for 2016 were quite strong. We're still saying that our group bookings for 2017 are better than our group bookings for 2016. So we're having -- we're slated to have a better year for group in terms of absolute amount of group nights and absolute group revenues in 2017, but that rate of improvement right now would be slightly lower than what we were forecasting 1 year ago for 2016."

I would say that what we have found over the years was the best indicator for what was going to happen to corporate transient is generally tied to what's happening in terms of business investment. The investment activity is higher. Travel seems to be -- business transient seems to be stronger. And while I was -- didn't have much time to absorb the GDP report that came out earlier this morning, I did note that business investment was off in the second quarter, and I think it might have even been off more than 2%. So I wouldn't say that our approach to this is so scientific that we calibrated what our expectation for business investment would be for the second half of the year. I think that would presume too much. But we did assume, based on the data that we've been seeing and the outlook that we would see from people that spend their time forecasting that, is it generally was expected to be weaker. So until that changes, we assume that corporate travel will probably still -- it will still be there, but the growth in the demand from that side will not be as strong as it might have been in the past. And that's one of the reasons why as we look at the transient side of our business -- and I think it's clear from my comments, is that, that's the part of our business that disappointed us in Q2. That's the part of our business that we think is weaker in the second half of the year. We're assuming that we will see weakness in corporate demand, consequently push us more towards some of the more price-sensitive segments in leisure discount business. And that's what underlies the fact that we're adjusting our RevPAR guidance down for the second half of the year and obviously for the full year."

So I would tell you, at the end of the day, it's a combination of both. The good news is, is the segment we did more, we had growth and also had higher rates. So that's positive.

The last -- certainly, the last 2 downturns, my guess is that your general assumption is that once it rolled over, it continued to head down. Now what's different though is that in both of those last 2 cycles in 2001, it has started to go negative in the beginning of the year, and then, obviously, we had the attack on 9/11, followed by SARS, followed by the war. So we sort of had -- once things went a little south, I don't know that we necessarily got a chance to see how the economic environment was going to play out in kind of -- in this context. There was a lot of other events that intervened to create a problem. And, of course, the financial recession had somewhat of a similar tempo to it. So coming back to what we might expect this time, I do think that -- if you look at what the Fed just said in what they came out with earlier this week, I don't know that they're necessarily acting or speaking in the context of thinking that the economy is about to roll over. I have a feeling, just sort of looking at this through my own lens, is that part of what corporate America is trying to figure out is, what does Brexit mean? What does this unsettled -- these attacks that have happened across the world. Who in the world is going to be the next President of the United States? And what exactly -- what are they -- what policies are they going to pursue? So I can't -- sort of the last thing I'm going to try to do is predict the future in terms of economics. But I could look at this and say that if the Fed is right that the underlying economy is actually fairly healthy, then if companies had a different perspective about some of these issues that I think do affect people's willingness to invest, I think there is an opportunity to see corporate investment improve. I believe that the consensus forecast for next year does call for some slight improvement in business investment, not robust but some slight improvement. So not that they've necessarily been right at all through this cycle, but if they were right, then that might offer an opportunity to see some improvements. Checking my data on that. The most recent blue chip consensus talks about the corporate investment next year at 3.1%. So that was down a little bit from where it had been the prior quarter but still pretty positive. So I think that will be the -- in our mind, based on -- given that we see that being a fairly influential indicator for us, we'll have to see how that plays out."

I mean, the 2 trends that we've seen is that sometimes a market like Washington will end up with a little bit softer business in the fourth quarter because when you're having a nationwide election, most of the elected officials tend to out of the city. And since that they draw for business in Washington, we've sometimes seen some softening of business in D.C. related to that. We have generally seen that the election week ends up being relatively slow on the group side because these larger groups are reluctant to schedule an event that would overlap Election Day. And so that's one of the reasons why we've indicated really for the last couple of quarters now, we've highlighted the fact that we were not overly confident about the fourth quarter. One reason is the holiday shift, but the other was the fact that we felt that this Election Day would be one that groups would be reluctant to book in. So I think what we're going to find when we get to the fourth quarter, not to get too far ahead of ourselves here, is that you're going to see some incredibly strong weeks because group is going to be very compacted into the sort of the open weeks of that quarter.

And then normally, what seems",368,"Yes. I think in general, what we're -- the pattern that we've seen the last few years is that there's, of course, estimates from the experts in terms of what's going to happen with supply growth for the beginning of the year. And then normally, what seems to happen is by the time we get to this point in the year a little bit later, we begin to realize that the supply growth that's actually going to materialize is slightly less. It's because projects have a tendency to be delayed. And so this year, I think we started off the year thinking that nationwide supply was probably going to be just under 2, and now it feels like it might be more in that 1.6, 1.7 range, which is not a huge difference but still on the margin a little bit better. So that's sort of 16. We're expecting that supply next year will increase somewhat. I think we see that both in -- across the industry, and we also see that in the upper price points in the top 20 markets. So again, I'd say we're probably expecting the industry supply to be a little bit over 2 and probably expect that the supply in the top 20 markets is a little bit higher than that. I would also guess though that at some point, we're going to see -- we'll see the same sort of lengthening of the delivery time for that supply, which will hopefully maybe pull that down a little bit. New York continues -- New York and Houston and Miami tend to be the markets that continues to see the strongest supply. Seattle might be one more that falls into that category. We are seeing -- while supply for New York will continue to be robust and a lot of it is under construction, my sense in looking at the data was we were seeing fewer projects that were projected to start in the next 12 months and fewer projects in planning. And so we're hoping that, that may signal a return to some level of rationality around New York supply. But we're not going to see the benefits of that in 2017."

As you may surmise from our results, it was an interesting quarter. While the operating environment across our industry was a bit choppy, we executed as planned on the dispositions we have previously referenced and added 2 more planned sales.
On the investment side, we acquired an irreplaceable ground lease, completed several major ROI investments and continued to repurchase our stock, all with a focus on creating value for our shareholders.
Let's start with a review of our results for the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $436 million for the quarter, which represents an increase of 3.3% over 2015 and was $782 million for the first half of the year, up 5.2%. Our adjusted FFO was $0.49 per share, an increase of 6.5% for the quarter, and $0.90 per share year-to-date, an increase of 11%. Overall, we are pleased with our bottom line EBITDA and FFO growth, which generally met or exceeded both our expectations and consensus, but we were disappointed that our room revenue growth was not stronger.
Our portfolio occupancy rate was 82.4%, an increase of 120 basis points compared to 2015. Constant currency RevPAR increased 2% for the quarter, as rate growth was difficult to generate. This RevPAR result was well below what we had anticipated in April.
We expected that we would benefit from strong group bookings, and that generally proved to be correct as group room nights increased 3% due to more than a 6.5% growth in our association segment and a very solid increase in corporate group. Our average group rate was up more than 2%, leading to a revenue improvement in group of more than 5%. While this certainly qualifies as a strong group quarter, it is worth noting that short-term group bookings declined to the 3-year average level, falling short of last year's accelerated pace, and we did experience a slight increase in cancellations. 
However, our transient segment fell meaningfully short of our expectation. Overall, transient room nights declined by 1% as corporate demand proved soft. This resulted in the hotels being forced to target price-sensitive leisure business and government business, with the latter segment up nearly 7%. The net result of this mix shift was our average transient rate fell slightly and transient revenues declined by slightly more than 1%. To help offset this transient softness, we increased our contract room nights by more than 20%. 
Declining international demand was also a drag on our transient demand. While difficult to precisely calculate, our international business, which represents slightly more than 10% of our total room nights, decreased approximately 7% in the quarter, further undermining our managers' efforts to drive transient rate.
Fortunately, a combination of strong group business and catering activity led to a 6.6% increase in banquet and AV revenue, which enabled the portfolio to achieve food and beverage revenue growth of 4.5%. 
Sales per group room night jumped more than 4%, which is one of our stronger quarters during this cycle and a good indication that groups are still prepared to spend freely on events.
Since nearly all of the F&B revenue growth came from the profitable catering business, the flow-through was quite strong at north of 70%. Other revenues at our comparable hotels grew 4.6%, as STAR revenues improved and we experienced an increase in attrition and cancellation fees, which are now running slightly ahead of what we experienced in the last 2 years. The flow-through in this area was also quite strong.
The solid flow-through in all segments of our business, combined with the benefits of various asset management initiatives and property investments, which Greg will detail -- discuss in more detail, led to comparable hotel EBITDA margin improvement of 65 basis points and EBITDA flow-through of more than 50%. As a result, comparable hotel EBITDA improved by roughly 5%. 
Year-to-date, our transient contract revenues have increased 3.3%, and our group revenues have improved by 3.1%. Comparable F&B revenues have increased 2.8%, driven by banquet and AV increase of 3.7%. Total comparable revenues have increased 2.9%, and comparable EBITDA margins have increased 75 basis points, leading to EBITDA improvement year-to-date of 5.7%. 
Turning to asset sales. As I referenced at the outset, we continue to make solid progress in our non-core asset disposition program. Closing the sales of the Atlanta Perimeter, Seattle Sea-Tac and Manhattan Beach Marriott as well as our 2 hotels located in Chile. The 3 U.S. assets represented older hotels located in airport or suburban locations that we felt would likely not grow cash flows over the long term at the rate of our overall portfolio. These sales, plus the 2 Christchurch, New Zealand hotels that we noted are under binding contract, bring our total sales for the year to roughly $500 million. It is worth noting that the EBITDA we are receiving in 2016 from these assets totalsd $13 million, which should not be included in any of your 2017 estimates. 
While we continue to market several hotels, the buyer pool has declined in size, and pricing is not as attractive as when we commenced our sale program a few years ago. While we do expect to complete additional sales, we are only a seller if we can achieve acceptable pricing. During the last 3.5 years, we have sold more than $2.6 billion worth of hotels or nearly 15% of our consolidated and joint venture portfolio, which has enabled us to further refine our asset base and improve shareholder value. We are very comfortable with our overall progress on this front. 
Looking at investments. We are very pleased to have acquired the ground leases that sit beneath the Key Bridge Marriott. The second Marriott hotel to be constructed, this property is situated in Arlington, Virginia, at the end of the Key Bridge, which provides direct access to Georgetown and has spectacular views of Washington and all of the national monuments. We are in the midst of evaluating the various options for this site and hotel, which will clearly include alternate uses, and we look forward to providing updates on this exciting project in the future.
We have also completed the redevelopment of the Hyatt San Francisco Airport and the new 152,000-square-foot ballroom and exhibit hall complex at the San Diego Marquis. Both of these projects were completed on time and under budget. In addition to renovating all of the rooms and meeting space at the Hyatt, we also completed 9,000 square feet of new meeting space and totally transformed the atrium and F&B platform. Our group bookings for this hotel for the next 2 years are 35% ahead of the preconstruction levels. We also expect to have a very strong fall operating season.
At the San Diego Marquis, we have created the best combination of ballroom and exhibit space in the market, and customers are responding favorably, as bookings for the next 2 years have increased 40% compared to preconstruction levels.
As the second quarter proved that it's challenging to develop guidance during interesting times for the industry, the following factors provide some insight into our thinking about the second half of 2016. Based on consensus economic forecasts and general uncertainty around the U.S. election and international events, we expect that business profit growth and investment levels will not improve, which suggest the business transient demand will remain soft. Alternatively, continued strong employment and consumer confidence numbers suggest that leisure demand will remain solid. We expect international travel patterns will remain challenged, as demand from our -- from two of our largest international markets, Canada and Latin America, are impacted by both the strong U.S. dollar and weaker domestic economic growth.
Our group revenue pace for the remainder of the year is up more than 4%, with the majority of the increase occurring in the third quarter. While we would expect some moderation in the overall increase in our group segment, this compares favorably to the actual improvement we experienced in the first half of the year.
Q3 will benefit from the calendar shift of the Jewish holidays into October, while the fourth quarter will be hurt by both that shift and less travel expected during the week that includes Election Day.
The combination of all these factors suggests that RevPAR growth in the second half of the year will generally match what we experienced in Q2, with the third quarter considerably stronger and the fourth quarter somewhat weaker. As a result, we anticipate full year RevPAR will range from 2% to 3%. We expect F&B and other revenue growth will moderate slightly from the first half growth of 2.8% but still generate increased profits over 2015.
The combination of solid flow-through from all revenue-generating activities, continued benefit from our asset management efforts and the strong start to the year is expected to lead to comparable hotel EBITDA margin improvement from 40 to 70 basis points.
The net result of these factors is an estimated range for adjusted EBITDA of $1,435,000,000 to $1,465,000,000, which reflects a reduction at the midpoint of $7.5 million from our prior range. $1.5 million of this adjustment is tied to the sale of the 2 Christchurch hotels I referenced earlier, and the remainder is due to the reduction in our estimated top line growth, partially offset by improving margins. Our forecasted adjusted FFO range is $1.63 to $1.67.
With that, let me turn the call over to Greg Larson, our Chief Financial Officer, who will discuss our operating and financial performance in more detail."

I'll start with specific commentary on performance within some of our major markets. 
RevPAR at our properties in Los Angeles continued to outperform the portfolio, with an impressive 9.1% increase in the second quarter. The results were driven by a 5% increase in ADR and a 3-percentage-point increase in occupancy to 84.2%. A strong group base, combined with solid transient demand at several of our hotels, drove the RevPAR increase, which exceeded the STAR upper upscale results by 140 basis points.
Looking forward, group booking pace in Los Angeles remains very strong, as the market is expected to host additional citywide during the remainder of this year. As a result, we expect continued outperformance from our Los Angeles properties.
Our 2 comparable hotels in Denver grew RevPAR 7.3% this quarter and outpaced the STAR upper upscale result by 260 basis points. Strong group and transient demand at the Westin primarily drove this outperformance. However, based on the softening of citywide pace and decreasing size of events, we expect our hotels in Denver to underperform the portfolio in the third quarter.
In Atlanta, RevPAR increased 6.6% for the quarter as a result of average rate growth of 3.2% and occupancy increase of 2.6 percentage points. Once again, a number of citywide events in the second quarter contributed to the outperformance. Based on group revenues on the books for the remainder of the year, we expect third quarter results to be better than the fourth quarter. 
RevPAR growth of 5.5% of our D.C. hotels significantly outperformed the STAR upper upscale RevPAR increase by 230 basis points. This was driven by both occupancy and rate this quarter, as occupancy increased 2.2 percentage points and average rate grew 2.9%. Several of our D.C. hotels benefited from planned renovations that we competed last year. Based on group booking pace for these hotels, we expect our properties in D.C. to achieve solid results in the third quarter.
Our Boston hotels RevPAR growth of 5% in the second quarter was driven by a rate increase of 2.2% and an occupancy improvement of 2.3 percentage points. Our managers' aggressive strategies to offer promotion and add high-end airline crews bolstered the RevPAR increase this quarter. These hotels also had an impressive increase in food and beverage revenues of 15.8%, entirely from the increase in the more profitable banquet and catering sales. Overall, our Boston properties are experiencing softer special corporate demand from the financial and consulting segment. As a result, we expect RevPAR to underperform the rest of our portfolio in the third quarter.
RevPAR at San Francisco hotels grew 2.8%, primarily driven by a rate increase of 2.9%. Overall transient demand softness and group room night declines due to the Moscone Center Convention construction led to demand weakness this quarter. However, strong catering business at several San Francisco hotels drove the outstanding banquet and catering revenue growth of over 33% this quarter. The expansion of the Moscone Convention Center will continue to negatively impact the San Francisco market for the remainder of 2016 and through 2017. Our San Francisco hotels will likely underperform our portfolio in the remaining quarters.
Moving to some challenged markets. New York RevPAR decreased 4.9% but outperformed the STAR upper upscale market RevPAR decline of 6%. Occupancy dropped slightly to 89.8%, and rate declined 4.8% in the second quarter. Supply continues to outpace demand, which is impacting our ability to drive rate. We have also witnessed the European travel and tour business declining due to the strong U.S. dollar. Based on our outlook for the market, we expect our hotels in New York to continue to have negative RevPAR for the remainder of the year.
As anticipated, our hotels in Florida underperformed the portfolio with a RevPAR decrease of 2.2% in the second quarter. Occupancy declined 2 percentage points, and rate increased 0.4%. The decline in RevPAR was due to softer leisure transient demand as well as increased group attrition and cancellations. 
On a positive note, group customers increased their food and beverage spend in the more profitable banquet and catering business by 15.8%. In addition, based on a strong group revenue pace for the third quarter, we expect RevPAR in Florida to outperform the portfolio in the third quarter.
RevPAR at our assets in San Diego grew slightly this quarter. Occupancy declined 2.9 percentage points, and rate increased 3.6%. Our hotels were negatively impacted by an 8.6% decline in transient revenues, resulting from fewer citywide compression nights from downtown. Despite the slow start in San Diego, we expect the hotels in this market to improve in the second half of 2016, as the city should benefit from an increase in citywide room nights for the remainder of the year, especially in the third quarter.
In addition, the new 152,000-square-foot Marriott Hall opened in June 2016 at the San Diego Marquis. 
Moving to our international assets. These hotels had a constant dollar RevPAR growth of 2.3% in the quarter. Latin America drove much of the international growth with a constant dollar RevPAR increase of 5%, primarily from continued pre-Olympics business in Rio. Due to the upcoming Olympics this summer, we expect Latin America to have a spectacular third quarter.
Shifting to our European joint venture. The portfolio was negatively impacted by a number of macro factors, including the lingering effects of the Paris attacks in Paris and Brussels and the political and economic uncertainty pre- and post-Brexit. All these led to a RevPAR decline of 1.3% in constant euros this quarter. As expected, our hotels in Paris, London and Brussels significantly underperformed the portfolio, while our hotels in Spain, Stockholm and Amsterdam outperformed. We expect the challenges that I described for our hotels in Paris, London and Brussels will continue into the third quarter.
Moving to our profitability. Our comparable EBITDA margin expansion of 65 basis points in an environment with 2% RevPAR growth is very impressive. This notable EBITDA margin growth is the result of decreases in our utility and insurance expenses as well as our continued cost saving initiatives. Utility costs decreased almost 6%, and insurance expense decreased 5.5% in the quarter. Utility costs continued to decline in the second quarter due to favorable gas and electric prices as well as the benefit from our cost saving energy ROI initiatives.
As we have said previously, we have invested in numerous energy projects over the last year, ranging from small to major projects, which are favorably impacting our utility cost. Further, in June, we completed our annual negotiation of our insurance contracts and lowered rates for another year. Therefore, we expect our insurance expense to continue to decrease for the remainder of the year and through the first half of 2017.
Over the last 2 years, we have focused on improving productivity at our hotels by initiating time and motion studies at our largest hotels. These studies resulted in hotel managers establishing tighter labor model standards and the use of improved and expanded forecasting tools, allowing managers to effectively schedule to demand and minimize excess staffing.
For example, many of our housekeeping departments are now using an automated system integrated with a property management system to prioritize housekeeping room assignments using a WiFi-enabled device. The system saves on time and labor expense while getting guests into rooms faster. Total hourly productivity at our hotels that have implemented the recommendations improved over 400 basis points more than those hotels that have not yet conducted a time and motion study. 
For all the discussion of technology as a disruptor in the lodging space, we are seeing real cost saving benefits of technology in our industry and our properties. In addition, sustainability initiatives that provide guests with the option to forgo housekeeping services in exchange for reward points, like Marriott's Your Room. Your Choice. and Starwood's Make A Green Choice program, are also positively impacting expenses.
Given the positive margin results in the first half of 2016, we now expect full year comparable EBITDA margins to increase 40 to 70 basis points. We also expect approximately 22.5% to 23% of our total and adjusted EBITDA to be generated in the third quarter.
As disclosed in our press release, during the second quarter, we repurchased 5.2 million shares at an average price of $15.39, for a total purchase price of $81 million. Since the inception of our share repurchase program in April 2015, we have bought back 48.6 million shares of common stock for a total purchase price of approximately $838 million. We currently have $162 million of capacity remaining under the repurchase program.
In addition, we paid a regular second quarter cash dividend at $0.20 per share, which represents a yield over 4.5% on the current stock price. We continue to operate from a position of financial strength and flexibility and believe we have one of the best balance sheets in the lodging REIT and overall REIT space. Importantly, we view this as a key competitive and strategic advantage and expect to continue benefiting from it going forward.
We ended the second quarter with approximately $266 million of cash, $739 million of available capacity under our revolving credit facility and $3.7 billion of debt. We improved our leverage ratio as calculated under our credit facility to 2.6x.
During the quarter, we repaid the $100 million mortgage loan secured by the Hyatt Regency Reston hotel. We also think it is important to note that 95 of our hotels, which represent 99% of our revenues, are unencumbered by mortgage debt.
In summary, we are pleased with our results this quarter, as the profitability of our assets continues to improve as a result of our aggressive asset management strategies in what continues to be a competitive market environment.

So they were -- in some cases, there might have been a change around a product, and so there was -- around the timing of a product launch. But in other cases, it sounded as if certain companies were just trying to be thoughtful about the level of expenses that they were incurring in 2016, and I attribute that in part to some of the weaker corporate profit numbers that we've seen. So it did feel as if it was thematic. It seemed like it was specific to the individual companies that had cancellations. But I took some comfort from -- was the fact that the cancellations that we're seeing were generally focused on 2016. We're not necessarily seeing any increase in cancellations related to 2017. So that tells me that it's a little bit more of a short-term orientation, and people were not necessarily backing away from their plans to have events down the road."

The -- I guess, obviously, this is a hotel that's been in our company for a long period of time. For those of you that know Washington, D.C., you probably know the hotel because you've driven by it a number of times on the G.W. Parkway. It really is a great location on the edge of Georgetown, and the views from the rooms are spectacular because you're looking right down the mall at all the monuments. This was a land lease situation from the time the hotel was built. We have spent off and on the last 10 years negotiating with the owners of the  foundation that owned the property in an effort to try to get complete control of the property. So, I guess, I would say it was opportunistic in the sense that we finally had -- they were finally motivated to sell, and we finally had the opportunity to buy. We had the right of first refusal, which is essentially what we exercised on. So it was sort of -- we had -- if we were going to buy it, we needed to do it now. And I think as it relates to the opportunities for the property, there's -- we believe -- we haven't had extensive conversations with local officials yet, but we are fairly comfortable in believing that there is excess density associated with the site. So we're in a process now that we know we have control of the property. We're looking at a range of options that would include the complete scraping of the asset and a complete redevelopment of the entire parcel, which would involve for us probably selling off a number of those parcels to other parties. We are also potentially redeveloping a part of the hotel and then selling off portions of the hotel to third parties to develop either residential or office. So it wasn't -- we're really in the midst of the effort right now to understand how to maximize the value. There is a lot of local interest in the site, local and national interest, for that matter, because of just the superb positioning of the property. So we'll provide more of an update going forward as we have a clear idea about how to maximize value for this property."

And then I think we feel fairly confident about how that's going to the play out for this year. And then we also expect that there'll be an opportunity for incremental lift in 2017, simply because in each instance, 3 of the 4 properties, the 1 in San Francisco, Camby in Phoenix and The Logan in Philadelphia, all of those, because they were closed, were essentially new hotels opening up in the beginning of this year.

But I have a feeling at this point that, that sale is likely to be dragged into 2017 as opposed to being completed this year. I think as I said in our prepared remarks, we're very happy with the overall sale program that we've implemented over the last 3.5 years. We would like to continue to sell assets in part because we'd love to use the proceeds in the context of our stock buyback program, but we do want to make certain that we're getting pricing that we think makes sense. Now if you look at the sales that we've announced so far this year, without even taking into account the capital spending that might have been required as part of the transition of that property, say, to a franchise status, we were in the mid-7s in terms of a cap rate on those sales, which frankly compares very favorably to where we're trading as a company.

So I think what  we indicated earlier in the year was that we were -- we certainly had very strong group bookings. And I think at the end of the first quarter, as we look through the rest of the year, we thought we were up I think it was around 5% to 6%. And what we said at the time was because we were running so far ahead in terms of the prior year in terms of group bookings, that, to some degree, there was just not as many nights and rooms that were still capable being sold in a lot of those hotels for group. And so we were expecting that what would happen over the course of the year is that group would still be very strong, but that it would generally fall to a level of production on -- from a revenue perspective that was consistent with the overall range of RevPAR guidance that we were providing at that point in time. So we were suggesting that, yes, we might be up 5% to 6% right now, but given at that point in time we were talking 3% to 4% in terms of RevPAR, we expected that group revenues would ultimately moderate and be more in line with that level. If I were to look out today, looking out for the rest of the year, I would say that what we generally were expecting was going to happen with group, which was that the lead that we had over the prior year would probably condense a bit, and that has happened. I think we're still -- feel pretty confident about group for the second half of the year. It -- I might on the margin say, because we've seen a little bit of incremental weakness in short-term group bookings, that we're a hair less confident in terms of how group compares to what we thought in April. So, by and large, when we look at our booking pace for the remainder of the year and calibrate them with expectations of what we actually expect to generate, we still feel pretty good about the group -- our group business. When we look into next year, I would say that we're probably -- we are running a little bit behind -- our growth for '17 is not as strong as our growth for '16. Our growth for '16, thinking back to calendar '15, was sort of mid-single digit for most of 2015. So we are behind in terms of a rate of growth, but, of course, remember, we've been saying for a while, including a lot of last year, that the group bookings for 2016 were quite strong. We're still saying that our group bookings for 2017 are better than our group bookings for 2016. So we're having -- we're slated to have a better year for group in terms of absolute amount of group nights and absolute group revenues in 2017, but that rate of improvement right now would be slightly lower than what we were forecasting 1 year ago for 2016."

But we did assume, based on the data that we've been seeing and the outlook that we would see from people that spend their time forecasting that, is it generally was expected to be weaker. So until that changes, we assume that corporate travel will probably still -- it will still be there, but the growth in the demand from that side will not be as strong as it might have been in the past. And that's one of the reasons why as we look at the transient side of our business -- and I think it's clear from my comments, is that, that's the part of our business that disappointed us in Q2. That's the part of our business that we think is weaker in the second half of the year. We're assuming that we will see weakness in corporate demand, consequently push us more towards some of the more price-sensitive segments in leisure discount business. And that's what underlies the fact that we're adjusting our RevPAR guidance down for the second half of the year and obviously for the full year."

So I would tell you, at the end of the day, it's a combination of both. The good news is, the segment we did more-- we had growth  also had higher rates. So that's positive.

The last -- certainly, the last 2 downturns, my guess is that your general assumption is that once it rolled over, it continued to head down. Now what's different though is that in both of those last 2 cycles in 2001, it has started to go negative in the beginning of the year, and then, obviously, we had the attack on 9/11, followed by SARS, followed by the war. So we sort of had -- once things went a little south, I don't know that we necessarily got a chance to see how the economic environment was going to play out in kind of -- in this context. There was a lot of other events that intervened to create a problem. And, of course, the financial recession had somewhat of a similar tempo to it. So coming back to what we might expect this time, I do think that -- if you look at what the Fed just said in what they came out with earlier this week, I don't know that they're necessarily acting or speaking in the context of thinking that the economy is about to roll over. I have a feeling, just sort of looking at this through my own lens, is that part of what corporate America is trying to figure out is, what does Brexit mean? What does this unsettled -- these attacks that have happened across the world. Who in the world is going to be the next President of the United States? And what exactly -- what are they -- what policies are they going to pursue? So I can't -- sort of the last thing I'm going to try to do is predict the future in terms of economics. But I could look at this and say that if the Fed is right that the underlying economy is actually fairly healthy, then if companies had a different perspective about some of these issues that I think do affect people's willingness to invest, I think there is an opportunity to see corporate investment improve. I believe that the consensus forecast for next year does call for some slight improvement in business investment, not robust but some slight improvement. So it's not that they've necessarily been right at all through this cycle, but if they were right, then that might offer an opportunity to see some improvements. Checking my data on that. The most recent blue chip consensus talks about the corporate investment next year at 3.1%. So that was down a little bit from where it had been the prior quarter but still pretty positive. So I think that will be the -- in our mind, based on -- given that we see that being a fairly influential indicator for us, we'll have to see how that plays out."

I mean, the 2 trends that we've seen is that sometimes a market like Washington will end up with a little bit softer business in the fourth quarter because when you're having a nationwide election, most of the elected officials tend to out of the city. And since that's a draw for business in Washington, we've sometimes seen some softening of business in D.C. related to that. We have generally seen that the election week ends up being relatively slow on the group side because these larger groups are reluctant to schedule an event that would overlap Election Day. And so that's one of the reasons why we've indicated really for the last couple of quarters now, we've highlighted the fact that we were not overly confident about the fourth quarter. One reason is the holiday shift, but the other was the fact that we felt that this Election Day would be one that groups would be reluctant to book in. So I think what we're going to find when we get to the fourth quarter, not to get too far ahead of ourselves here, is that you're going to see some incredibly strong weeks because group is going to be very compacted into the sort of the open weeks of that quarter.

I think in general, what we're -- the pattern that we've seen the last few years is that there's, of course, estimates from the experts in terms of what's going to happen with supply growth for the beginning of the year. And then normally, what seems to happen is by the time we get to this point in the year a little bit later, we begin to realize that the supply growth that's actually going to materialize is slightly less. It's because projects have a tendency to be delayed. And so this year, I think we started off the year thinking that nationwide supply was probably going to be just under 2, and now it feels like it might be more in that 1.6, 1.7 range, which is not a huge difference but still on the margin a little bit better. So that's sort of 16. We're expecting that supply next year will increase somewhat. I think we see that both in -- across the industry, and we also see that in the upper price points in the top 20 markets. So again, I'd say we're probably expecting the industry supply to be a little bit over 2 and probably expect that the supply in the top 20 markets is a little bit higher than that. I would also guess though that at some point, we're going to see -- we'll see the same sort of lengthening of the delivery time for that supply, which will hopefully maybe pull that down a little bit. New York continues -- New York and Houston and Miami tend to be the markets that continues to see the strongest supply. Seattle might be one more that falls into that category. We are seeing -- while supply for New York will continue to be robust and a lot of it is under construction, my sense in looking at the data was we were seeing fewer projects that were projected to start in the next 12 months and fewer projects in planning. And so we're hoping that, that may signal a return to some level of rationality around New York supply. But we're not going to see the benefits of that in 2017."

As you may surmise from our results, it was an interesting quarter. While the operating environment across our industry was a bit choppy, we executed as planned on the dispositions we have previously referenced and added 2 more planned sales.
On the investment side, we acquired an irreplaceable ground lease, completed several major ROI investments and continued to repurchase our stock, all with a focus on creating value for our shareholders.
Let's start with a review of our results for the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $436 million for the quarter, which represents an increase of 3.3% over 2015 and was $782 million for the first half of the year, up 5.2%. Our adjusted FFO was $0.49 per share, an increase of 6.5% for the quarter, and $0.90 per share year-to-date, an increase of 11%. Overall, we are pleased with our bottom line EBITDA and FFO growth, which generally met or exceeded both our expectations and consensus, but we were disappointed that our room revenue growth was not stronger.
Our portfolio occupancy rate was 82.4%, an increase of 120 basis points compared to 2015. Constant currency RevPAR increased 2% for the quarter, as rate growth was difficult to generate. This RevPAR result was well below what we had anticipated in April.
We expected that we would benefit from strong group bookings, and that generally proved to be correct as group room nights increased 3% due to more than a 6.5% growth in our association segment and a very solid increase in corporate group. Our average group rate was up more than 2%, leading to a revenue improvement in group of more than 5%. While this certainly qualifies as a strong group quarter, it is worth noting that short-term group bookings declined to the 3-year average level, falling short of last year's accelerated pace, and we did experience a slight increase in cancellations. 
However, our transient segment fell meaningfully short of our expectation. Overall, transient room nights declined by 1% as corporate demand proved soft. This resulted in the hotels being forced to target price-sensitive leisure business and government business, with the latter segment up nearly 7%. The net result of this mix shift was our average transient rate fell slightly and transient revenues declined by slightly more than 1%. To help offset this transient softness, we increased our contract room nights by more than 20%. 
Declining international demand was also a drag on our transient demand. While difficult to precisely calculate, our international business, which represents slightly more than 10% of our total room nights, decreased approximately 7% in the quarter, further undermining our managers' efforts to drive transient rate.
Fortunately, a combination of strong group business and catering activity led to a 6.6% increase in banquet and AV revenue, which enabled the portfolio to achieve food and beverage revenue growth of 4.5%. 
Sales per group room night jumped more than 4%, which is one of our stronger quarters during this cycle and a good indication that groups are still prepared to spend freely on events.
Since nearly all of the F&B revenue growth came from the profitable catering business, the flow-through was quite strong at north of 70%. Other revenues at our comparable hotels grew 4.6%, as STAR revenues improved and we experienced an increase in attrition and cancellation fees, which are now running slightly ahead of what we experienced in the last 2 years. The flow-through in this area was also quite strong.
The solid flow-through in all segments of our business, combined with the benefits of various asset management initiatives and property investments, which Greg will detail -- discuss in more detail, led to comparable hotel EBITDA margin improvement of 65 basis points and EBITDA flow-through of more than 50%. As a result, comparable hotel EBITDA improved by roughly 5%. 
Year-to-date, our transient contract revenues have increased 3.3%, and our group revenues have improved by 3.1%. Comparable F&B revenues have increased 2.8%, driven by banquet and AV increase of 3.7%. Total comparable revenues have increased 2.9%, and comparable EBITDA margins have increased 75 basis points, leading to EBITDA improvement year-to-date of 5.7%. 
Turning to asset sales. As I referenced at the outset, we continue to make solid progress in our non-core asset disposition program. Closing the sales of the Atlanta Perimeter, Seattle Sea-Tac and Manhattan Beach Marriott as well as our 2 hotels located in Chile. The 3 U.S. assets represented older hotels located in airport or suburban locations that we felt would likely not grow cash flows over the long term at the rate of our overall portfolio. These sales, plus the 2 Christchurch, New Zealand hotels that we noted are under binding contract, bring our total sales for the year to roughly $500 million. It is worth noting that the EBITDA we are receiving in 2016 from these assets totals $13 million, which should not be included in any of your 2017 estimates. 
While we continue to market several hotels, the buyer pool has declined in size, and pricing is not as attractive as when we commenced our sale program a few years ago. While we do expect to complete additional sales, we are only a seller if we can achieve acceptable pricing. During the last 3.5 years, we have sold more than $2.6 billion worth of hotels or nearly 15% of our consolidated and joint venture portfolio, which has enabled us to further refine our asset base and improve shareholder value. We are very comfortable with our overall progress on this front. 
Looking at investments. We are very pleased to have acquired the ground leases that sit beneath the Key Bridge Marriott. The second Marriott hotel to be constructed, this property is situated in Arlington, Virginia, at the end of the Key Bridge, which provides direct access to Georgetown and has spectacular views of Washington and all of the national monuments. We are in the midst of evaluating the various options for this site and hotel, which will clearly include alternate uses, and we look forward to providing updates on this exciting project in the future.
We have also completed the redevelopment of the Hyatt San Francisco Airport and the new 152,000-square-foot ballroom and exhibit hall complex at the San Diego Marquis. Both of these projects were completed on time and under budget. In addition to renovating all of the rooms and meeting space at the Hyatt, we also completed 9,000 square feet of new meeting space and totally transformed the atrium and F&B platform. Our group bookings for this hotel for the next 2 years are 35% ahead of the preconstruction levels. We also expect to have a very strong fall operating season.
At the San Diego Marquis, we have created the best combination of ballroom and exhibit space in the market, and customers are responding favorably, as bookings for the next 2 years have increased 40% compared to preconstruction levels.
As the second quarter proved that it's challenging to develop guidance during interesting times for the industry, the following factors provide some insight into our thinking about the second half of 2016. Based on consensus economic forecasts and general uncertainty around the U.S. election and international events, we expect that business profit growth and investment levels will not improve, which suggest the business transient demand will remain soft. Alternatively, continued strong employment and consumer confidence numbers suggest that leisure demand will remain solid. We expect international travel patterns will remain challenged, as demand from our -- from two of our largest international markets, Canada and Latin America, are impacted by both the strong U.S. dollar and weaker domestic economic growth.
Our group revenue pace for the remainder of the year is up more than 4%, with the majority of the increase occurring in the third quarter. While we would expect some moderation in the overall increase in our group segment, this compares favorably to the actual improvement we experienced in the first half of the year.
Q3 will benefit from the calendar shift of the Jewish holidays into October, while the fourth quarter will be hurt by both that shift and less travel expected during the week that includes Election Day.
The combination of all these factors suggests that RevPAR growth in the second half of the year will generally match what we experienced in Q2, with the third quarter considerably stronger and the fourth quarter somewhat weaker. As a result, we anticipate full year RevPAR will range from 2% to 3%. We expect F&B and other revenue growth will moderate slightly from the first half growth of 2.8% but still generate increased profits over 2015.
The combination of solid flow-through from all revenue-generating activities, continued benefit from our asset management efforts and the strong start to the year is expected to lead to comparable hotel EBITDA margin improvement from 40 to 70 basis points.
The net result of these factors is an estimated range for adjusted EBITDA of $1,435,000,000 to $1,465,000,000, which reflects a reduction at the midpoint of $7.5 million from our prior range. $1.5 million of this adjustment is tied to the sale of the 2 Christchurch hotels I referenced earlier, and the remainder is due to the reduction in our estimated top line growth, partially offset by improving margins. Our forecasted adjusted FFO range is $1.63 to $1.67.
With that, let me turn the call over to Greg Larson, our Chief Financial Officer, who will discuss our operating and financial performance in more detail."

I'll start with specific commentary on performance within some of our major markets. 
RevPAR at our properties in Los Angeles continued to outperform the portfolio, with an impressive 9.1% increase in the second quarter. The results were driven by a 5% increase in ADR and a 3-percentage-point increase in occupancy to 84.2%. A strong group base, combined with solid transient demand at several of our hotels, drove the RevPAR increase, which exceeded the STAR upper upscale results by 140 basis points.
Looking forward, group booking pace in Los Angeles remains very strong, as the market is expected to host additional citywide during the remainder of this year. As a result, we expect continued outperformance from our Los Angeles properties.
Our 2 comparable hotels in Denver grew RevPAR 7.3% this quarter and outpaced the STAR upper upscale result by 260 basis points. Strong group and transient demand at the Westin primarily drove this outperformance. However, based on the softening of citywide pace and decreasing size of events, we expect our hotels in Denver to underperform the portfolio in the third quarter.
In Atlanta, RevPAR increased 6.6% for the quarter as a result of average rate growth of 3.2% and occupancy increase of 2.6 percentage points. Once again, a number of citywide events in the second quarter contributed to the outperformance. Based on group revenues on the books for the remainder of the year, we expect third quarter results to be better than the fourth quarter. 
RevPAR growth of 5.5% of our D.C. hotels significantly outperformed the STAR upper upscale RevPAR increase by 230 basis points. This was driven by both occupancy and rate this quarter, as occupancy increased 2.2 percentage points and average rate grew 2.9%. Several of our D.C. hotels benefited from planned renovations that we competed last year. Based on group booking pace for these hotels, we expect our properties in D.C. to achieve solid results in the third quarter.
Our Boston hotels RevPAR growth of 5% in the second quarter was driven by a rate increase of 2.2% and an occupancy improvement of 2.3 percentage points. Our managers' aggressive strategies to offer promotion and add high-end airline crews bolstered the RevPAR increase this quarter. These hotels also had an impressive increase in food and beverage revenues of 15.8%, entirely from the increase in the more profitable banquet and catering sales. Overall, our Boston properties are experiencing softer special corporate demand from the financial and consulting segment. As a result, we expect RevPAR to underperform the rest of our portfolio in the third quarter.
RevPAR at San Francisco hotels grew 2.8%, primarily driven by a rate increase of 2.9%. Overall transient demand softness and group room night declines due to the Moscone Center Convention construction led to demand weakness this quarter. However, strong catering business at several San Francisco hotels drove the outstanding banquet and catering revenue growth of over 33% this quarter. The expansion of the Moscone Convention Center will continue to negatively impact the San Francisco market for the remainder of 2016 and through 2017. Our San Francisco hotels will likely underperform our portfolio in the remaining quarters.
Moving to some challenged markets. New York RevPAR decreased 4.9% but outperformed the STAR upper upscale market RevPAR decline of 6%. Occupancy dropped slightly to 89.8%, and rate declined 4.8% in the second quarter. Supply continues to outpace demand, which is impacting our ability to drive rate. We have also witnessed the European travel and tour business declining due to the strong U.S. dollar. Based on our outlook for the market, we expect our hotels in New York to continue to have negative RevPAR for the remainder of the year.
As anticipated, our hotels in Florida underperformed the portfolio with a RevPAR decrease of 2.2% in the second quarter. Occupancy declined 2 percentage points, and rate increased 0.4%. The decline in RevPAR was due to softer leisure transient demand as well as increased group attrition and cancellations. 
On a positive note, group customers increased their food and beverage spend in the more profitable banquet and catering business by 15.8%. In addition, based on a strong group revenue pace for the third quarter, we expect RevPAR in Florida to outperform the portfolio in the third quarter.
RevPAR at our assets in San Diego grew slightly this quarter. Occupancy declined 2.9 percentage points, and rate increased 3.6%. Our hotels were negatively impacted by an 8.6% decline in transient revenues, resulting from fewer citywide compression nights from downtown. Despite the slow start in San Diego, we expect the hotels in this market to improve in the second half of 2016, as the city should benefit from an increase in citywide room nights for the remainder of the year, especially in the third quarter.
In addition, the new 152,000-square-foot Marriott Hall opened in June 2016 at the San Diego Marquis. 
Moving to our international assets. These hotels had a constant dollar RevPAR growth of 2.3% in the quarter. Latin America drove much of the international growth with a constant dollar RevPAR increase of 5%, primarily from continued pre-Olympics business in Rio. Due to the upcoming Olympics this summer, we expect Latin America to have a spectacular third quarter.
Shifting to our European joint venture. The portfolio was negatively impacted by a number of macro factors, including the lingering effects of the Paris attacks in Paris and Brussels and the political and economic uncertainty pre- and post-Brexit. All these led to a RevPAR decline of 1.3% in constant euros this quarter. As expected, our hotels in Paris, London and Brussels significantly underperformed the portfolio, while our hotels in Spain, Stockholm and Amsterdam outperformed. We expect the challenges that I described for our hotels in Paris, London and Brussels will continue into the third quarter.
Moving to our profitability. Our comparable EBITDA margin expansion of 65 basis points in an environment with 2% RevPAR growth is very impressive. This notable EBITDA margin growth is the result of decreases in our utility and insurance expenses as well as our continued cost saving initiatives. Utility costs decreased almost 6%, and insurance expense decreased 5.5% in the quarter. Utility costs continued to decline in the second quarter due to favorable gas and electric prices as well as the benefit from our cost saving energy ROI initiatives.
As we have said previously, we have invested in numerous energy projects over the last year, ranging from small to major projects, which are favorably impacting our utility cost. Further, in June, we completed our annual negotiation of our insurance contracts and lowered rates for another year. Therefore, we expect our insurance expense to continue to decrease for the remainder of the year and through the first half of 2017.
Over the last 2 years, we have focused on improving productivity at our hotels by initiating time and motion studies at our largest hotels. These studies resulted in hotel managers establishing tighter labor model standards and the use of improved and expanded forecasting tools, allowing managers to effectively schedule to demand and minimize excess staffing.
For example, many of our housekeeping departments are now using an automated system integrated with a property management system to prioritize housekeeping room assignments using a WiFi-enabled device. The system saves on time and labor expense while getting guests into rooms faster. Total hourly productivity at our hotels that have implemented the recommendations improved over 400 basis points more than those hotels that have not yet conducted a time and motion study. 
For all the discussion of technology as a disruptor in the lodging space, we are seeing real cost saving benefits of technology in our industry and our properties. In addition, sustainability initiatives that provide guests with the option to forgo housekeeping services in exchange for reward points, like Marriott's Your Room. Your Choice. and Starwood's Make A Green Choice program, are also positively impacting expenses.
Given the positive margin results in the first half of 2016, we now expect full year comparable EBITDA margins to increase 40 to 70 basis points. We also expect approximately 22.5% to 23% of our total and adjusted EBITDA to be generated in the third quarter.
As disclosed in our press release, during the second quarter, we repurchased 5.2 million shares at an average price of $15.39, for a total purchase price of $81 million. Since the inception of our share repurchase program in April 2015, we have bought back 48.6 million shares of common stock for a total purchase price of approximately $838 million. We currently have $162 million of capacity remaining under the repurchase program.
In addition, we paid a regular second quarter cash dividend at $0.20 per share, which represents a yield over 4.5% on the current stock price. We continue to operate from a position of financial strength and flexibility and believe we have one of the best balance sheets in the lodging REIT and overall REIT space. Importantly, we view this as a key competitive and strategic advantage and expect to continue benefiting from it going forward.
We ended the second quarter with approximately $266 million of cash, $739 million of available capacity under our revolving credit facility and $3.7 billion of debt. We improved our leverage ratio as calculated under our credit facility to 2.6x.
During the quarter, we repaid the $100 million mortgage loan secured by the Hyatt Regency Reston hotel. We also think it is important to note that 95 of our hotels, which represent 99% of our revenues, are unencumbered by mortgage debt.
In summary, we are pleased with our results this quarter, as the profitability of our assets continues to improve as a result of our aggressive asset management strategies in what continues to be a competitive market environment.

So they were -- in some cases, there might have been a change around a product, and so there was -- around the timing of a product launch. But in other cases, it sounded as if certain companies were just trying to be thoughtful about the level of expenses that they were incurring in 2016, and I attribute that in part to some of the weaker corporate profit numbers that we've seen. So it did feel as if it was thematic. It seemed like it was specific to the individual companies that had cancellations. But I took some comfort from -- was the fact that the cancellations that we're seeing were generally focused on 2016. We're not necessarily seeing any increase in cancellations related to 2017. So that tells me that it's a little bit more of a short-term orientation, and people were not necessarily backing away from their plans to have events down the road."

The -- I guess, obviously, this is a hotel that's been in our company for a long period of time. For those of you that know Washington, D.C., you probably know the hotel because you've driven by it a number of times on the G.W. Parkway. It really is a great location on the edge of Georgetown, and the views from the rooms are spectacular because you're looking right down the mall at all the monuments. This was a land lease situation from the time the hotel was built. We have spent off and on the last 10 years negotiating with the owners of the  foundation that owned the property in an effort to try to get complete control of the property. So I guess, I would say it was opportunistic in the sense that we finally had -- they were finally motivated to sell, and we finally had the opportunity to buy. We had the right of first refusal, which is essentially what we exercised on. So it was sort of -- we had -- if we were going to buy it, we needed to do it now. And I think as it relates to the opportunities for the property, there's -- we believe -- we haven't had extensive conversations with local officials yet, but we are fairly comfortable in believing that there is excess density associated with the site. So we're in a process now that we know we have control of the property. We're looking at a range of options that would include the complete scraping of the asset and a complete redevelopment of the entire parcel, which would involve for us probably selling off a number of those parcels to other parties. We are also potentially redeveloping a part of the hotel and then selling off portions of the hotel to third parties to develop either residential or office. So it wasn't -- we're really in the midst of the effort right now to understand how to maximize the value. There is a lot of local interest in the site, local and national interest, for that matter, because of just the superb positioning of the property. So we'll provide more of an update going forward as we have a clear idea about how to maximize value for this property."

And then I think we feel fairly confident about how that's going to the play out for this year. And then we also expect that there'll be an opportunity for incremental lift in 2017, simply because in each instance, 3 of the 4 properties, the 1 in San Francisco, Camby in Phoenix and The Logan in Philadelphia, all of those, because they were closed, were essentially new hotels opening up in the beginning of this year.

But I have a feeling at this point that, that sale is likely to be dragged into 2017 as opposed to being completed this year. I think as I said in our prepared remarks, we're very happy with the overall sale program that we've implemented over the last 3.5 years. We would like to continue to sell assets in part because we'd love to use the proceeds in the context of our stock buyback program, but we do want to make certain that we're getting pricing that we think makes sense. Now if you look at the sales that we've announced so far this year, without even taking into account the capital spending that might have been required as part of the transition of that property, say, to a franchise status, we were in the mid-7s in terms of a cap rate on those sales, which frankly compares very favorably to where we're trading as a company.

So I think what we indicated earlier in the year was that we were -- we certainly had very strong group bookings. And I think at the end of the first quarter, as we look through the rest of the year, we thought we were up I think it was around 5% to 6%. And what we said at the time was because we were running so far ahead in terms of the prior year in terms of group bookings, that, to some degree, there was just not as many nights and rooms that were still capable being sold in a lot of those hotels for group. And so we were expecting that what would happen over the course of the year is that group would still be very strong, but that it would generally fall to a level of production on -- from a revenue perspective that was consistent with the overall range of RevPAR guidance that we were providing at that point in time. So we were suggesting that, yes, we might be up 5% to 6% right now, but given at that point in time we were talking 3% to 4% in terms of RevPAR, we expected that group revenues would ultimately moderate and be more in line with that level. If I were to look out today, looking out for the rest of the year, I would say that what we generally were expecting was going to happen with group, which was that the lead that we had over the prior year would probably condense a bit, and that has happened. I think we're still -- feel pretty confident about group for the second half of the year. It -- I might on the margin say, because we've seen a little bit of incremental weakness in short-term group bookings, that we're a hair less confident in terms of how group compares to what we thought in April. So by and large, when we look at our booking pace for the remainder of the year and calibrate them with expectations of what we actually expect to generate, we still feel pretty good about the group -- our group business. When we look into next year, I would say that we're probably -- we are running a little bit behind -- our growth for '17 is not as strong as our growth for '16. Our growth for '16, thinking back to calendar '15, was sort of mid-single digit for most of 2015. So we are behind in terms of a rate of growth, but, of course, remember, we've been saying for a while, including a lot of last year, that the group bookings for 2016 were quite strong. We're still saying that our group bookings for 2017 are better than our group bookings for 2016. So we're having -- we're slated to have a better year for group in terms of absolute amount of group nights and absolute group revenues in 2017, but that rate of improvement right now would be slightly lower than what we were forecasting 1 year ago for 2016."

I would say that what we have found over the years is the best indicator for what was going to happen to corporate transient is generally tied to what's happening in terms of business investment. When the investment activity is higher, travel seems to be -- business transient seems to be stronger. And while I was -- didn't have much time to absorb the GDP report that came out earlier this morning, I did note that business investment was off in the second quarter, and I think it might have even been off more than 2%. So I wouldn't say that our approach to this is so scientific that we calibrated what our expectation for business investment would be for the second half of the year. I think that would presume too much. But we did assume, based on the data that we've been seeing and the outlook that we would see from people that spend their time forecasting that, is it generally was expected to be weaker. So until that changes, we assume that corporate travel will probably still -- it will still be there, but the growth in the demand from that side will not be as strong as it might have been in the past. And that's one of the reasons why as we look at the transient side of our business -- and I think it's clear from my comments, is that, that's the part of our business that disappointed us in Q2. That's the part of our business that we think is weaker in the second half of the year. We're assuming that we will see weakness in corporate demand, consequently push us more towards some of the more price-sensitive segments in leisure discount business.

The last -- certainly, the last 2 downturns, my guess is that your general assumption is that once it rolled over, it continued to head down. Now what's different though is that in both of those last 2 cycles in 2001, it has started to go negative in the beginning of the year, and then, obviously, we had the attack on 9/11, followed by SARS, followed by the war. So we sort of had -- once things went a little south, I don't know that we necessarily got a chance to see how the economic environment was going to play out in kind of -- in this context. There was a lot of other events that intervened to create a problem. And of course, the financial recession had somewhat of a similar tempo to it. So coming back to what we might expect this time, I do think that -- if you look at what the Fed just said in what they came out with earlier this week, I don't know that they're necessarily acting or speaking in the context of thinking that the economy is about to roll over. I have a feeling, just sort of looking at this through my own lens, is that part of what corporate America is trying to figure out is, what does Brexit mean? What does this unsettled -- these attacks that have happened across the world. Who in the world is going to be the next President of the United States? And what exactly -- what are they -- what policies are they going to pursue? So I can't -- sort of the last thing I'm going to try to do is predict the future in terms of economics. But I could look at this and say that if the Fed is right that the underlying economy is actually fairly healthy, then if companies had a different perspective about some of these issues that I think do affect people's willingness to invest, I think there is an opportunity to see corporate investment improve. I believe that the consensus forecast for next year does call for some slight improvement in business investment, not robust but some slight improvement. So it's not that they've necessarily been right at all through this cycle, but if they were right, then that might offer an opportunity to see some improvements. Checking my data on that. The most recent blue chip consensus talks about the corporate investment next year at 3.1%. So that was down a little bit from where it had been the prior quarter but still pretty positive. So I think that will be the -- in our mind, based on -- given that we see that being a fairly influential indicator for us, we'll have to see how that plays out."

I mean, the 2 trends that we've seen is that sometimes a market like Washington will end up with a little bit softer business in the fourth quarter because when you're having a nationwide election, most of the elected officials tend to out of the city. And since that's a draw for business in Washington, we've sometimes seen some softening of business in D.C. related to that. We have generally seen that the election week ends up being relatively slow on the group side because these larger groups are reluctant to schedule an event that would overlap Election Day. And so that's one of the reasons why we've indicated really for the last couple of quarters now, we've highlighted the fact that we were not overly confident about the fourth quarter. One reason is the holiday shift, but the other was the fact that we felt that this Election Day would be one that groups would be reluctant to book in. So I think what we're going to find when we get to the fourth quarter, not to get too far ahead of ourselves here, is that you're going to see some incredibly strong weeks because group is going to be very compacted into the sort of the open weeks of that quarter. And then those weeks that are affected either by the election or by the holiday will probably be fairly weak."

I think in general, what we're -- the pattern that we've seen the last few years is that there's, of course, estimates from the experts in terms of what's going to happen with supply growth for the beginning of the year. And then normally, what seems to happen is by the time we get to this point in the year a little bit later, we begin to realize that the supply growth that's actually going to materialize is slightly less. It's because projects have a tendency to be delayed. And so this year, I think we started off the year thinking that nationwide supply was probably going to be just under 2, and now it feels like it might be more in that 1.6, 1.7 range, which is not a huge difference but still on the margin a little bit better. So that's sort of 16. We're expecting that supply next year will increase somewhat. I think we see that both in -- across the industry, and we also see that in the upper price points in the top 20 markets. So again, I'd say we're probably expecting the industry supply to be a little bit over 2 and probably expect that the supply in the top 20 markets is a little bit higher than that. I would also guess though that at some point, we're going to see -- we'll see the same sort of lengthening of the delivery time for that supply, which will hopefully maybe pull that down a little bit. New York continues -- New York and Houston and Miami tend to be the markets that continues to see the strongest supply. Seattle might be one more that falls into that category. We are seeing -- while supply for New York will continue to be robust and a lot of it is under construction, my sense in looking at the data was we were seeing fewer projects that were projected to start in the next 12 months and fewer projects in planning. And so we're hoping that, that may signal a return to some level of rationality around New York supply. But we're not going to see the benefits of that in 2017."

Good morning, everyone. Overall, we had a solid quarter. Our operating results, given the trends the industry is experiencing, were quite good and in line with our expectations. We completed the sales of our last 2 New Zealand assets,",1672,"Well, thanks, Gee. Good morning, everyone. 
Overall, we had a solid quarter. Our operating results, given the trends the industry is experiencing, were quite good and in line with our expectations. We completed the sales of our last 2 New Zealand assets, continued to make progress on our redevelopment investments and repurchased 44 million of our stock in September, raising the year-to-date total returns to shareholders to over $800 million. 
Looking at our operating results. Adjusted EBITDA was $342 million for the quarter, reflecting an increase of 5.9%. Year-to-date, adjusted EBITDA was $1.123 billion, an increase of 5.3%. Our adjusted FFO was $0.37 per share for the third quarter and $1.28 year-to-date, reflecting an 11.3% increase over last year. Our strong EBITDA and FFO performance was driven by those top line growth and margin expansion. For the quarter, our average rate grew 2.2%, complemented by solid demand growth in our portfolio as comparable hotel occupancy grew by 1.2 percentage points, allowing our comparable hotel to achieve an occupancy rate of 81.3%. As a result, comparable RevPAR growth, on a constant dollar basis, increased 3.8%. The primary driver of our RevPAR growth this quarter was our group segment. Our domestic hotels benefited from a 3.4% increase in group demand, all generated by a significant increase in association demand. Corporate demand was uneven in the quarter, but the shift in the timing of the Jewish holiday from September of last year to October of this year led to a significant increase in corporate group during September. The net result was a 2.5% increase in average rate, which was generally achieved across all of our group segment, leading our domestic group revenues to increase by 6% for the quarter. Our international assets also [indiscernible] portfolio results in the quarter as our Canadian hotels benefited from strong transient demand, leading to RevPAR growth of almost 15%. And the Olympic Games generated 105% RevPAR growth in our Brazil assets. Since much of our Olympic business was booked this group, our overall group business actually increased by more than 9% for the quarter. As of the expected, the strength in group demand was partially offset by a decline in transient demand, which has been a scene for most of this calendar year. However, unlike the first 2 quarters, our hotels were able to increase rates and also push business into more highly rated segments, leading to transient rate growth of 2% for the quarter, taking into account the decline in transient demand, our transient revenue growth was slightly less than 1%. 
Recognizing the trends we have been experiencing this year, we have been focused on layering in more highly priced contract business at several of our hotels. A contract business, which is still only 5% of our total demand, increased nearly 15% for the quarter and is up 17% year-to-date. The one aspect of our operations that was disappointing in Q3 was our food and beverage department as food and beverage revenues increased by just 0.3%, which was roughly 2% less than we had anticipated. While F&B has been notoriously difficult to forecast, the bulk of the shortfall occurred in catering and resulted from group's being more conservative with their entertaining budget. [indiscernible] revenue actually grew by nearly 2%, which was an impressive result given that transient occupancy have decreased. Offsetting some of the weakness in F&B, our other department revenues grew by a strong 10.5%. We saw a strong increase in [indiscernible] revenues and an increase in attrition and cancellation fees, which was largely concentrated at 3 of our convention hotels. 
Comparable hotel revenues increased 3.3% for the quarter. The increase level of higher rated group activity, combined with the rate increase in our transient business as well as our continued focus on productivity improvements, resulted in strong rooms flow-through. This flow-through, plus reductions in utility and [indiscernible] expenses, contributed to our comparable EBITDA margin growth of 110 basis points in the third quarter. Year-to-date, comparable hotel RevPAR has increased 3% in constant currency terms. Food and beverage has improved by 2.1% and hotel revenues have increased by 3.1%. Comparable EBITDA margin growth is 90 basis points, which is generating 56% flow-through for the year, which is a very solid result. An important focus of our company is actively managing our portfolio and efficiently allocating capital. [indiscernible] goal, as I mentioned earlier, in the third quarter, we completed the sales of final 2 New Zealand properties for $31 million, bringing our year-to-date noncore asset sale total to approximately $500 million. We purchased this New Zealand portfolio for $190 million in New Zealand terms and received total sales proceeds in New Zealand dollars of 266 million, which allowed us to achieve better than a 14.5% unlevered IRR of this investment. We are currently marketing our remaining consolidated Asia-Pacific asset to [indiscernible] Hilton and we hope to complete to a sale during the first half of 2017. In addition, we are marketing a select few other noncore asset. While we are making reasonable progress on these sales, the transactions have not yet gone hard and we do not expect any additional asset sales will be completed in 2016. 
On the investment front, the company invested approximately $46 million in third quarter on redevelopment, return on investment and acquisition capital expenditures. We completed the initial phase of the Denver Marriott Tech Center redevelopment, which included newly-designed guest rooms in one of the towers, a new lobby and lounge, new fitness center and some additional meeting space. While we are pleased with the progress we have made on this project, we are slightly behind schedule due to some permitting challenges, but still expect to be completed by year-end. In addition, we have also made great progress on the first phase of the renovations at The Phoenician during the slower summer months. this phase included a completely design of the guestrooms, casinos and Canyon suites. We are excited to have an opportunity to show you our progress at The Phoenician before [indiscernible] in less than 2 weeks. 
For the full year, we expect to spend $200 million to $215 million on redevelopment, ROI and acquisition projects and $300 million and $310 million on renewal and replacement capital expenditures. 
Now let me spend a few minutes on our outlook for the remainder of 2016. Uncertainties surrounding the U.S. election and other international events lead us to believe that corporate profit growth and business investment levels will not improve meaningfully in the near term, suggesting that business transient demand will remain soft in the fourth quarter. While year-to-date, our domestic group revenues have been up nearly 4%, we expect to experience a softer fourth quarter as the Jewish holiday shift and nationwide election will reduce group demand as the traditionally lower occupancies in the fourth quarter will likely restrain rate growth. Our group booking and revenue pace for Q4 is only slightly positive and assuming continued short-term booking weakness, could easily be slightly negative for the fourth quarter. The combination of these factors suggest that we will experience minimal RevPAR growth in the fourth quarter, leading us to conclude that our full year comparable RevPAR will increase between 2% and 2.5%. 
Weaker group demand and negligible revenue growth will put pressure on operating margins in the fourth quarter, reversing to some degree, the strong results we have seen year-to-date. As a consequence, we expect our full year comparable hotel EBITDA margin growth improvement to be in the range of 40 to 55 basis points. This will translate to full year adjusted EBITDA of $1.440 billion to $1.455 billion and adjusted FFO per share of $1.64 to $1.66. 
Looking ahead to 2017. As we have indicated in prior years, our visibility at this time into next year is limited as we have just started on our detailed operating budget process. There are a number of factors that will influence operating results in 2017, starting, first and foremost, with the economy. This year, we are experiencing weaker GDP growth and declines in corporate profits and investments, plus the strength in the U.S. dollar. These factors have led to weak corporate transient demand and reduced international travel, resulting in industry demand growth of just 1.5%, which is well short of the average of nearly 3% for the last 3 years. The outlook for GDP, corporate profits and corporate investment is more favorable in 2017, but the concept that it will be better next year has been offered frequently during this recovery and generally hasn't come to fruition. The currency outlook is slightly more favorable, especially in countries such as Japan and Brazil, which could lead to better international travel trends. 
As opposed to the uncertainty surrounding demand factors, it is clear that supply is increasing. In our top 19 markets, upscaling [indiscernible] supplies increased by roughly 2.5% in 2016 while a number of reports have correctly noted that our portfolio is less exposed to new supplies than many others in the industry, primarily because we benefit from a more diversified distribution. Supply in our markets is still expected to increase by more than 3% in 2017. While we are experiencing record occupancies this year, this anticipated supply increase suggest that we will need to have stronger demand growth in 2017 to have pricing power. 
Our group revenues for 2017 are up over 2.5%, but short-term bookings have been growing at a slower rate and so we would not currently expect to benefit from the significant increase in group activity that we have seen in 2016. Combining all of these insights, along with the trend of weakening top line growth that we have seen over the last 2 years, we would not expect to see RevPAR accelerate in 2017 unless the economy improves meaningfully. We will provide much greater insight into our outlook for 2017 in our fourth quarter call in February. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Greg Larson, our Chief Financial Officer, who will discuss our operating and financial performance in more detail."
29574,384227136,1069882,"Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2016",2016-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Ed. I'll start with commentary on performance in several of our major markets. Our consolidated international hotel had a spectacular third quarter, with double-digit RevPAR increases in Latin America and Canada of more than 61% and almost 15",1664,"Thank you, Ed. I'll start with commentary on performance in several of our major markets. 
Our consolidated international hotel had a spectacular third quarter, with double-digit RevPAR increases in Latin America and Canada of more than 61% and almost 15%, respectively. As anticipated, the Olympics and Paralympic Games in Brazil drove significant increases in our 3 Brazilian hotels. Our hotels in Calgary and Toronto also experienced double-digit RevPAR growth. Toronto's outperformance was mainly the result of a Microsoft citywide in July, which caused compression in that market. Calgary experienced strong growth due to an increase in events at the Convention Center. Keep in mind that overall demand in Brazil, excluding the demands surrounding the Olympics, has been weak due to concerns over Zika, economic and political issues as well as increased supply. As a result, we expect [indiscernible] fundamentals in Brazil to weaken in the fourth quarter. 
As discussed last quarter, despite the slow start in San Diego in the first half of the year, RevPAR for assets in the market grew an impressive 11.8% this quarter, with occupancy growth of 5.6 percentage points and a 5% increase in average rate. Importantly, our RevPAR result exceeded the STAR upper upscale market results by 430 basis points. The increase in citywide room nights for NLB, All-Star game and [indiscernible] created healthy compression in the market and resulted in strong group business, which was up almost 26%. 
Looking to the fourth quarter. We expect our hotels in San Diego to continue to outperform our portfolio. Our hotels in Hawaii grew RevPAR 7.7% this quarter, leading the STAR upper upscale market results by 220 basis points. Occupancy increased 4.8 percentage points and average rate improved 2.1%. Strong transient demanded at our Maui hotels, coupled with solid group business at the Fairmont, [indiscernible] and Hyatt [indiscernible] Waikiki offset ballroom renovation displacement at Hyatt Maui. Short-term transient demand increased more than anticipated in August and September as vacationers chose Maui over the Zika feared Caribbean location and airfare cost remain stable. We expect our Hawaiian hotels to continue to outperform our portfolio in the fourth quarter. In addition, we should note that Hawaii is the market with the lowest expected supply growth out of the top 20 U.S. markets for the next couple of years, which bodes well for future performance. 
As expected, our properties in D.C. outperformed our portfolio again this quarter, with RevPAR growth of 6.8%, outpacing the STAR upper upscale market RevPAR increase by 120 basis points. This was driven predominantly by an average rate increase of 5.6% as well as a 90 basis point increase in occupancy. The Westin Georgetown, the AWDC and Grand Hyatt all had double-digit RevPAR growth this quarter, benefiting from renovations in the [indiscernible] and a strong group base that created [indiscernible] compression and enables the hotels to drive strong average rate growth. 
With elections next Tuesday and the resulting slowdown in legislative activity, we expect RevPAR growth to slow in the fourth quarter, but still expect outperformance relative to the portfolio. Even though we have not provided any guidance for 2017, it is worth mentioning that citywide's in 2017 look strong for D.C. Combined with Congress operating on a full calendar and inauguration in January, we expect there will be additional demand in 2017. 
Los Angeles continues to outperform the portfolio, with a 6.6% increase in the third quarter. The results were driven by a 3.5% growth in average rate and a 2.5 percentage point increase in occupancy. Strong group in contract business at several of our hotels drove the RevPAR increase, which exceeded the STAR upper upscale market results by 120 basis points. Year-to-date, our hotels in Los Angeles have grown RevPAR by 8.9%. Looking forward to the fourth quarter, group bookings [indiscernible] in Los Angeles remains strong and as a result, we expect continued outperformance from our Los Angeles properties. 
In Atlanta, RevPAR increased 5.6% for the quarter as a result of average rate growth of 0.8% and occupancy increase of 3.6 percentage points. Continued strong citywide group room nights in the third quarter contributed to the outperformance. As anticipated, the citywide calendar on a year-over-year basis for the fourth quarter will be weak. Therefore, we expect fourth quarter RevPAR to be flat to last year. 
Moving to some challenged markets. New York RevPAR decreased 4%, basically in line with the STAR upper upscale decline of 3.6%. Supply continues to outpace demand, which, when combined with lower European travel and tour business due to strong and lower European travel and tour business due to strong U.S. dollar, continued to significantly impact our ability to drive rates. Based on our outlook for the market, we expect the hotels in New York to continue to have a RevPAR decline in the fourth quarter. 
RevPAR in the San Francisco hotels decline 3.4%, with a decrease in both occupancy and rate this quarter. Group room nights were down due to the Moscone Convention Center expansion, which will continue to negatively impact San Francisco in 2017. Due to the lack of group compression, almost all hotels put more lower rate in transient business, resulting in overall transient ADR decline of 5.4%. Our San Francisco hotels will likely underperform our portfolio in the fourth quarter. 
The Houston market continues to be impacted by the struggling oil industry and increased supply, as evidenced by the severe declines in the STAR upper upscale of nearly 14%. Our Houston hotels RevPAR declined 2.9% in the quarter and a 3.7% decrease in ADR was partially offset by a small increase in occupancy. Two major citywide events did not repeat in the third quarter this year, compelling our managers to put group business at our hotels to maintain occupancy. This proved to be the right strategy as we beat the STAR upper upscale market by 11 percentage points. We expect the difficulties in Houston to continue in the fourth quarter, and therefore, anticipate that these hotels will underperform the portfolio. 
RevPAR in the hotels in Seattle declined 1.5% in the third quarter. Occupancy declined about 1 percentage point to almost 91% and ADR decreased 0.3%. Last year, our hotels in Seattle had a record group business in the quarter and grew RevPAR 9.8%, making for difficult comparisons this year. Many of the groups in the third quarter last year did not repeat this year and the market has seen a decrease in Canadian [indiscernible] business, contributing to the weaker results this quarter. We expect performance to improve in the fourth quarter as transient demand increases and the [indiscernible] Seattle will benefit from being under renovation last December. 
RevPAR to Phoenix hotels grew 0.6% in the quarter, with an occupancy decline of 4.3 percentage points and an increase in ADR of 7.9%. Our hotels were negatively impacted by group cancellation, [indiscernible] and soft transient demand. We expect RevPAR to hotels in Phoenix to improve in the fourth quarter. 
Shifting to our European joint venture. The portfolio continued to be negatively impacted by a number of macro factors, including. The lingering effects of the terrorist attacks in Paris and Brussels, and the political and economic uncertainty pre-and post Brexit. All this led to a RevPAR decline of 2.6% in constant euros this quarter. As expected, our hotels in Paris and Brussels significantly underperformed the portfolio while our hotels in London, Spain and Stockholm outperformed. We expect our hotels in Paris and Brussels will continue to be challenged in the fourth quarter. 
As noted in our press release, during the third quarter, we repurchased 2.8 million shares in an average purchase price of $16.04 or a total purchase price of $44 million. Since the inception of our share repurchase program in April of 2015, we have bought back 51.4 million shares of common stock for a total purchase price of approximately $883 million. We currently have $117 million of capacity remaining under the repurchase program. In addition, in October, we paid a regular third quarter cash dividend of $0.20 per share, which represents an annualized yield of over 5% on the current stock price. Based on current operating forecast, combined with taxable gains generated from our completed asset sales to date and our regular fourth quarter dividend, we expect to pay a special dividend of approximately $0.05, bringing total dividends for the fourth quarter to $0.25 per share. We continued to operate from a position of financial strength and flexibility and believe we have one of the best balance sheets in the lodging REIT and overall REIT space. Importantly, we view this as a key competitive and strategic advantage, which enhances our ability to pay our dividends throughout the cycle and allows us to invest as opportunities arise to buy asset, buy back our stock or reinvest in high yielding, redevelopment or ROI projects. 
We ended the third quarter with approximately $340 million of cash and currently have $628 million of available capacity under our revolving credit facility. We improved our leverage ratio as calculated under our credit facility to 2.5x. It is important to note that when updating models for 2017, our 2016 adjusted EBITDA includes $12 million for the reimbursement of operating losses at the New Orleans Marriott due to the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill. In addition, the 2016 full year guidance includes adjusted EBITDA of $13 million that was earned by the hotels that have been sold during the year. Therefore, a total of $25 million of EBITDA will not repeat in 2017. However, keep in mind that comparable EBITDA margin growth in 2016 was not impacted by these items as the business interruption insurance proceeds and sold assets are excluded from our comparable hotel results. 
In summary, we are pleased with our results this quarter as the profitability of our assets continues to improve due to our aggressive asset management strategy in what continues to be a competitive environment.

Overall, we've seen that cancellation and attrition fees, which is what we were talking about, has been higher this year than they have been the last few years. Now I would tell you that the level of attrition cancellations we saw in the first half of this decade was below what I would describe as our long-term average. But the bottom line is, is they're up about 30% for the year. They were up closer to about 60% this particular quarter. We saw the cancellations in Orlando and at 2 of our larger convention hotels, one in San Francisco, which I suspect might have been a little bit related to some of the activity out there at the Convention Center that you all are fully aware of and also at the Marquis. I would imagine that we think that will moderate a bit in the fourth quarter, but it's not abnormal despite of the cycle to start to see a little bit more in terms of cancellation and attrition activity. So we would expect to see that continue at a slightly elevated level compared to that 2010 to 2015 time frame. Part of that, I would note though, is I'd be careful to draw the conclusions that means that people are canceling or not showing up to a greater degree in the past. I'm sure that's part of what's happening. Some of that, this is also reflective of the fact that we have better contracts from our perspective, which is enabling us to recover more when folks don't show up."

I guess, what I'd say, as we looked at this and that we've consistently said that since the transaction was announced, if our Starwood hotels were operated under the Marriott expense and cost structure, not fee structure but the operating costs of running those hotels, we think that there would be an opportunity to reduce expenses at our Starwood hotels.

I think going forward, the other thing that will affect leisure travel, the international leisure, we've had -- the 18 months have been a bit weak primarily because of currency. But assuming that the currency stabilizes, I think there's an opportunity for some pick up there. We're generally fairly bullish as we look out over the next 5 years about our resort profile.

So I would generally expect to see a little bit less capital in '17. Our thought had generally been that we would prefer to -- we would look to increase capital spending a bit later in the cycle under the period that it cost us a little bit maybe less in terms of lost occupancy and it cost us a little bit less because oftentimes, as you get near the end of the cycle, pricing for construction projects drops too.

Sure. So I guess first off, I would say that in terms of thinking about the level of RevPAR and revenue growth that we likely would need from one year to the next in order to maintain the margins that we have, I say today, our thinking is that needs to be right around or just slightly above 2%. And that's based on nothing more complicated than expecting inflation to generally run at about that level. And so if our cost go up by inflations and we sort of need to match that at the revenue line in order to maintain our margins. I will point out that does not -- that does mean that EBITDA grows at that same rate of inflation or slightly better. And so that's not suggesting that we'd be a slight EBITDA. But I think that's still a reasonable reference point. We do think that there are some things that we're working on now, including a continuation of the time motion study work that we've done, which we've talked about before [indiscernible] fair amount of money this year. We do think there are some things on those lines that might benefit us next year and, of course, to the extent that we end up with the lower level of RevPAR growth that we've been suggesting, that we'll be working hard to try to find other ways to take costs out. Some of that will, of course, be dependent upon whether that lower level of RevPAR is generated more by a lack of rate growth or perhaps a reduction in occupancy. The latter, obviously, gives us a better opportunity to try and take cost out of the system. In terms of the benefits that would flow from the Marriott Starwood merger, I honestly would not be expecting to see a significant amount of that benefit in 2017. There are a few things that could happen more quickly, I believe, but I think there's still some work to be done [indiscernible]. I believe that the opportunity to benefit from some -- the new Marriott negotiated OTA agreement could probably take hold next year. But I think longer, a lot of the other integration activities that would be required for us to get the expense savings [indiscernible] happen and so I will not be counting on the benefit of that in 2017."

Our operating results, given the trends the industry is experiencing, were quite good and in line with our expectations. We completed the sales of our last 2 New Zealand assets, continued to make progress on our redevelopment investments and repurchased 44 million of our stock in September, raising the year-to-date total return to shareholders to over $800 million. 
Looking at our operating results. Adjusted EBITDA was $342 million for the quarter, reflecting an increase of 5.9%. Year-to-date, adjusted EBITDA was $1.123 billion, an increase of 5.3%. Our adjusted FFO was $0.37 per share for the third quarter and $1.28 year-to-date, reflecting an 11.3% increase over last year. Our strong EBITDA and FFO performance was driven by both top line growth and margin expansion. For the quarter, our average rate grew 2.2%, complemented by solid demand growth in our portfolio as comparable hotel occupancy grew by 1.2 percentage points, allowing our comparable hotel to achieve an occupancy rate of 81.3%. As a result, comparable RevPAR growth, on a constant dollar basis, increased 3.8%. The primary driver of our RevPAR growth this quarter was our group segment. Our domestic hotels benefited from a 3.4% increase in group demand, all generated by a significant increase in association demand. Corporate demand was uneven in the quarter, but the shift in the timing of the Jewish holidays from September of last year to October of this year led to a significant increase in corporate group during September. The net result was a 2.5% increase in average rate, which was generally achieved across all of our group segment, leading our domestic group revenues to increase by 6% for the quarter. 
Our international assets also buoyed portfolio results in the quarter as our Canadian hotels benefited from strong transient demand, leading to RevPAR growth of almost 15%. And the Olympic Games generated 105% RevPAR growth in our Brazil assets. Since much of our Olympic business was booked by this group, our overall group business actually increased by more than 9% for the quarter. As would be expected, the strength in group demand was partially offset by a decline in transient demand, which has been a theme for most of this calendar year. However, unlike the first 2 quarters, our hotels were able to increase rates and also push business into more highly rated segments, leading to transient rate growth of 2% for the quarter. Taking into account the decline in transient demand, our transient revenue growth was slightly less than 1%. 
Recognizing the trends we have been experiencing this year, we have been focused on layering in more highly priced contract business at several of our hotels. Our contract business, which is still only 5% of our total demand, increased nearly 15% for the quarter and is up 17% year-to-date. The one aspect of our operations that was disappointing in Q3 was our food and beverage department as food and beverage revenues increased by just 0.3%, which was roughly 2% less than we had anticipated. While F&B has been notoriously difficult to forecast, the bulk of the shortfall occurred in catering and resulted from groups being more conservative with their entertaining budgets. Our revenue actually grew by nearly 2%, which was an impressive result given that transient occupancy had decreased. Offsetting some of the weakness in F&B, our other department revenues grew by a strong 10.5%. We saw a strong increase in spa revenues and an increase in attrition and cancellation fees, which was largely concentrated at 3 of our convention hotels. 
Comparable hotel revenues increased 3.3% for the quarter. The increase level of higher-rated group activity, combined with the rate increase in our transient business as well as our continued focus on productivity improvements, resulted in strong rooms flow-through. This flow-through, plus reductions in utility and insurance expenses, contributed to our comparable EBITDA margin growth of 110 basis points in the third quarter. Year-to-date, comparable hotel RevPAR has increased 3% in constant currency terms. Food and beverage has improved by 2.1% and hotel revenues has increased by 3.1%. Comparable EBITDA margin growth is 90 basis points, which has generated 56% flow-through for the year, which is a very solid result. 
An important focus of our company is actively managing our portfolio and efficiently allocating capital. Towards that goal, as I mentioned earlier, in the third quarter, we completed the sale of the final 2 New Zealand properties for $31 million, bringing our year-to-date noncore-asset sale total to approximately $500 million. We purchased this New Zealand portfolio for $190 million in New Zealand terms and received total sales proceeds of New Zealand dollars of 266 million, which allowed us to achieve better than a 14.5% unlevered IRR on this investment. We are currently marketing our remaining consolidated Asia Pacific asset to Melbourne Hilton, and we hope to complete a sale during the first half of 2017. In addition, we are marketing a select few other noncore assets. While we are making reasonable progress on these sales, the transactions have not yet gone hard and we do not expect any additional asset sales will be completed in 2016. 
On the investment front, the company invested approximately $46 million in the third quarter on redevelopment, return on investment and acquisition capital expenditures. We completed the initial phase of the Denver Marriott Tech Center redevelopment, which included newly designed guest rooms in one of the towers, a new lobby and lounge, a new fitness center and some additional meeting space. While we are pleased with the progress we have made on this project, we are slightly behind schedule due to some permitting challenges, but still expect to be completed by year-end. In addition, we have also made great progress on the first phase of the renovations at The Phoenician during the slower summer months. This phase included a complete design of the guestrooms, casitas and Canyon Suites. We are excited to have an opportunity to show you our progress at The Phoenician before NAREIT in less than 2 weeks. 
For the full year, we expect to spend $200 million to $215 million on redevelopment, ROI and acquisition projects and $300 million to $310 million on renewal and replacement capital expenditures. 
Now let me spend a few minutes on our outlook for the remainder of 2016. Uncertainties surrounding the U.S. election and other international events lead us to believe that corporate profit growth and business investment levels will not improve meaningfully in the near term, suggesting that business transient demand will remain soft in the fourth quarter. While year-to-date, our domestic group revenues have been up nearly 4%, we expect to experience a softer fourth quarter as the Jewish holidays shift and nationwide elections will reduce group demand as the traditionally lower occupancies in the fourth quarter will likely restrain rate growth. Our group booking and revenue pace for Q4 is only slightly positive and assuming continued short-term booking weakness, could easily be slightly negative for the fourth quarter. The combination of these factors suggest that we will experience minimal RevPAR growth in the fourth quarter, leading us to conclude that our full year comparable RevPAR will increase between 2% and 2.5%. 
Weaker group demand and negligible revenue growth will put pressure on operating margins in the fourth quarter, reversing to some degree the strong results we have seen year-to-date. As a consequence, we expect our full year comparable hotel EBITDA margin growth improvement to be in the range of 40 to 55 basis points. This will translate to full year adjusted EBITDA of $1.440 billion to $1.455 billion and adjusted FFO per share of $1.64 to $1.66. 
Looking ahead to 2017. As we have indicated in prior years, our visibility at this time into next year is limited as we have just started on our detailed operating budget process. There are a number of factors that will influence operating results in 2017, starting, first and foremost, with the economy. This year, we are experiencing weaker GDP growth and declines in corporate profits and investments, plus the strength in the U.S. dollar. These factors have led to weak corporate transient demand and reduced international travel, resulting in industry demand growth of just 1.5%, which is well short of the average of nearly 3% for the last 3 years. The outlook for GDP, corporate profits and corporate investment is more favorable in 2017, but the concept that it will be better next year has been offered frequently during this recovery and generally hasn't come to fruition. The currency outlook is slightly more favorable, especially in countries such as Japan and Brazil, which could lead to better international travel trends. 
As opposed to the uncertainty surrounding demand factors, it is clear that supply is increasing. In our top 19 markets, upscale and above supply has increased by roughly 2.5% in 2016, while a number of reports have correctly noted that our portfolio is less exposed to new supply than many others in the industry primarily because we benefit from a more diversified distribution. Supply in our markets is still expected to increase by more than 3% in 2017. While we are experiencing record occupancies this year, this anticipated supply increase suggest that we will need to have stronger demand growth in 2017 to have pricing power. 
Our group revenues for 2017 are up over 2.5%, but short-term bookings have been growing at a slower rate and so we would not currently expect to benefit from the significant increase in group activity that we have seen in 2016. Combining all of these insights, along with the trend of weakening top line growth that we had seen over the last 2 years, we would not expect to see RevPAR accelerate in 2017 unless the economy improves meaningfully. We will provide much greater insights into our outlook for 2017 in our fourth quarter call in February. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Greg Larson, our Chief Financial Officer, who will discuss our operating and financial performance in more detail."
29574,384227136,1070323,"Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2016",2016-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Ed. I'll start with commentary on performance in several of our major markets. Our consolidated international hotels had a spectacular third quarter, with double-digit RevPAR increases in Latin America and Canada of more than 61% and almost 15%",1665,"Thank you, Ed. I'll start with commentary on performance in several of our major markets. Our consolidated international hotels had a spectacular third quarter, with double-digit RevPAR increases in Latin America and Canada of more than 61% and almost 15% respectively. As anticipated, the Olympics and Paralympic Games in Brazil drove significant increases in our 3 Brazilian hotels. Our hotels in Calgary and Toronto also experienced double-digit RevPAR growth. Toronto's outperformance was mainly the result of a Microsoft citywide in July, which caused compression in that market. Calgary experienced strong growth due to an increase in events at the Convention Center. Keep in mind that overall demand in Brazil, excluding the demands surrounding the Olympics, has been weak due to concerns over Zika, economic and political issues as well as increased supply. As a result, we expect lodging fundamentals in Brazil to weaken in the fourth quarter. 
As discussed last quarter, despite the slow start in San Diego in the first half of the year, RevPAR for assets in the market grew an impressive 11.8% this quarter, with occupancy growth of 5.6 percentage points and a 5% increase in average rate. Importantly, our RevPAR results exceeded the STAR upper-upscale market results by 430 basis points. The increase in citywide room nights from the MLB All Star Game and Comic-Con created healthy compression in the market and resulted in strong group business, which was up almost 26%. Looking to the fourth quarter. We expect our hotels in San Diego to continue to outperform our portfolio. 
Our hotels in Hawaii grew RevPAR 7.7% this quarter, leading the STAR upper-upscale market results by 220 basis points. Occupancy increased 4.8 percentage points, and average rate improved 2.1%. Strong transient demand at our Maui hotels, coupled with solid group business at the Fairmont Kea Lani and Hyatt Place Waikiki offset ballroom renovation displacement at Hyatt Maui. Short-term transient demand increased more than anticipated in August and September as vacationers chose Maui over the Zika-feared Caribbean location and airfare costs remained stable. We expect our Hawaiian hotels to continue to outperform our portfolio in the fourth quarter. In addition, we should note that Hawaii is the market with the lowest-expected supply growth out of the top 20 U.S. markets for the next couple of years, which bodes well for future performance. 
As expected, our properties in D.C. outperformed our portfolio again this quarter, with RevPAR growth of 6.8%, outpacing the STAR upper-upscale market RevPAR increase by 120 basis points. This was driven predominantly by an average rate increase of 5.6% as well as a 90 basis point increase in occupancy. The Westin Georgetown, the AWDC and Grand Hyatt all had double-digit RevPAR growth this quarter, benefiting from renovations in the comp set and a strong group base that created mid-week compression and enabled the hotels to drive strong average rate growth. 
With elections next Tuesday and the resulting slowdown in legislative activity, we expect RevPAR growth to slow in the fourth quarter, but still expect outperformance relative to the portfolio. Even though we have not provided any guidance for 2017, it is worth mentioning that citywides in 2017 look strong for D.C. Combined with Congress operating on a full calendar and an inauguration in January, we expect there will be additional demand in 2017. 
Los Angeles continues to outperform the portfolio, with a 6.6% increase in the third quarter. The results were driven by a 3.5% growth in average rate and a 2.5 percentage point increase in occupancy. Strong group in contract business at several of our hotels drove the RevPAR increase, which exceeded the STAR upper-upscale market results by 120 basis points. Year-to-date, our hotels in Los Angeles have grown RevPAR by 8.9%. Looking forward to the fourth quarter, group booking pace in Los Angeles remains strong, and as a result, we expect continued outperformance from our Los Angeles properties. 
In Atlanta, RevPAR increased 5.6% for the quarter as a result of average rate growth of 0.8% and occupancy increase of 3.6 percentage points. Continued strong citywide room nights in the third quarter contributed to the outperformance. As anticipated, the citywide calendar on a year-over-year basis for the fourth quarter will be weak, therefore, we expect fourth quarter RevPAR to be flat to last year. 
Moving to some challenged markets. New York RevPAR decreased 4%, basically in line with the STAR upper-upscale decline of 3.6%. Supply continues to outpace demand, which when combined with lower European travel and tour business due to the strong -- and lower European travel and tour business due to the strong U.S. dollar continued to negatively impact our ability to drive rates. Based on our outlook for the market, we expect our hotels in New York to continue to have a RevPAR decline in the fourth quarter. 
RevPAR in the San Francisco hotels declined 3.4%, with a decrease in both occupancy and rate this quarter. Group room nights were down due to the Moscone Convention Center expansion, which will continue to negatively impact San Francisco in 2017. Due to the lack of group compression, almost all hotels booked more lower rate at transient business, resulting in overall transient ADR decline of 5.4%. Our San Francisco hotels will likely underperform our portfolio in the fourth quarter. 
The Houston market continues to be impacted by the struggling oil industry and increased supply as evidenced by the severe declines in the STAR upper-upscale of nearly 14%. Our Houston hotels' RevPAR declined 2.9% in the quarter, and a 3.7% decrease in ADR was partially offset by a small increase in occupancy. 2 major citywide events did not repeat in the third quarter this year, compelling our managers to book group business at our hotels to maintain occupancy. This proved to be the right strategy as we beat the STAR upper-upscale market by 11 percentage points. We expect the difficulties in Houston to continue in the fourth quarter and therefore anticipate that these hotels will underperform the portfolio. 
RevPAR of the hotels in Seattle declined 1.5% in the third quarter. Occupancy declined about 1 percentage point to almost 91%, and ADR decreased 0.3%. Last year, our hotels in Seattle had a record group business in the quarter and grew RevPAR 9.8%, making for difficult comparisons this year. Many of the groups during the third quarter last year did not repeat this year, and the market has seen a decrease in Canadian leisure weekend business, contributing to the weaker results this quarter. We expect performance to improve in the fourth quarter as transient demand increases and the W Seattle will benefit from being under renovation last December. 
RevPAR of the Phoenix hotels grew 0.6% in the quarter, with an occupancy decline of 4.3 percentage points and an increase in ADR of 7.9%. Our hotels were negatively impacted by group cancellations, slippage and soft transient demand. We expect RevPAR at our hotels in Phoenix to improve in the fourth quarter. 
Shifting to our European joint venture. The portfolio continued to be negatively impacted by a number of macro factors, including the lingering effects of the terrorist attacks in Paris and Brussels and the political and economic uncertainty pre- and post-Brexit. All this led to a RevPAR decline of 2.6% in constant euros this quarter. As expected, our hotels in Paris and Brussels significantly underperformed the portfolio, while our hotels in London, Spain and Stockholm outperformed. We expect our hotels in Paris and Brussels will continue to be challenged in the fourth quarter. 
As noted in our press release, during the third quarter, we repurchased 2.8 million shares in an average purchase price of $16.04, for a total purchase price of $44 million. Since the inception of our share repurchase program in April of 2015, we have bought back 51.4 million shares of common stock for a total purchase price of approximately $883 million. We currently have $117 million of capacity remaining under the repurchase program. In addition, in October, we paid a regular third quarter cash dividend of $0.20 per share, which represents an annualized yield of over 5% on the current stock price. Based on our current operating forecast, combined with taxable gains generated from our completed asset sales to date and our regular fourth quarter dividend, we expect to pay a special dividend of approximately $0.05, bringing total dividends for the fourth quarter to $0.25 per share. 
We continue to operate from a position of financial strength and flexibility and believe we have one of the best balance sheets in the lodging REIT and overall REIT space. Importantly, we view this as a key competitive and strategic advantage, which enhances our ability to pay our dividends throughout the cycle and allows us to invest as opportunities arise to buy assets, buy back our stock or reinvest in high-yielding redevelopment or ROI projects. 
We ended the third quarter with approximately $340 million of cash and currently have $628 million of available capacity under our revolving credit facility. We improved our leverage ratio as calculated under our credit facility to 2.5x. It is important to note that when updating models for 2017, our 2016 adjusted EBITDA includes $12 million for the reimbursement of operating losses at the New Orleans Marriott due to the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill. In addition, the 2016 full year guidance includes adjusted EBITDA of $13 million that was earned by the hotels that had been sold during the year. Therefore, a total of $25 million in EBITDA will not repeat in 2017. However, keep in mind that comparable EBITDA margin growth in 2016 was not impacted by these items as the business interruption insurance proceeds and sold assets are excluded from our comparable hotel results. 
In summary, we are pleased with our results this quarter as the profitability of our assets continues to improve due to our aggressive asset management strategies in what continues to be a competitive environment. 
This concludes our prepared remarks. We are now interested in answering any questions you may have. [Operator Instructions]"

Overall, we've seen that cancellation and attrition fees, which is what we were talking about, has been higher this year than they have been in the last few years. Now I would tell you that the level of attrition and cancellations we saw in the first half of this decade was below what I would describe as our long-term average. But the bottom line is, is they're up about 30% for the year. They were up closer to about 60% this particular quarter. We saw the cancellations in Orlando and at the -- 2 of our larger convention hotels, one in San Francisco, which I suspect might have been a little bit related to some of the activity out there in the -- at the Convention Center that you're all fully aware of and also at the Marquis. I would imagine that we'll -- that we think that will moderate a bit in the fourth quarter, but it is not abnormal at this part of the cycle to start to see a little bit more in terms of cancellation and attrition activity. So we would expect to see that continue at a slightly elevated level compared to the 2010 to 2015 time frame. Part of that, I would note though, is that I'd be careful to draw the conclusions. That means that people are canceling or not showing up to a greater degree in the past. I'm sure that's part of what's happening. Some of that, and this is also reflective of the fact that we have better contracts, from our perspective, which is enabling us to recover more when folks don't show up."

So no doubt that, that headline number is better because of Brazil, but we were strong in Mexico and we were strong in Toronto too. So all of our international hotels had a good quarter and domestic portfolio did too."

The number of folks that are participating in a particular -- or chasing a particular transaction is probably a little bit thinner. We're hearing that as we talk with the brokerage community and as we look at the experience we're having, we're finding that international buyers are probably a bit higher percentage of the activity than in past. You're seeing some smaller operators, associated with family offices, chase after some of the smaller deals that are out there. I was also -- I've heard that some of the non-public but nontraded REITs or nonlisted REITs have been a bit more active too. So it's -- there's still a market out there.

We're doing this because we're trying to be smart about how to continue to position our portfolio for the future, and the assets that we're selling now are just ones that we generally think will not perform as well as the remainder of our portfolio or may have higher capital needs. The one exception to that would be Melbourne, where we've made the conscious decision to exit the Asia Pacific market. And so we want to sell that property. We won't sell that for a bad price by any means, but that is one that we are more motivated to sell perhaps than some others.

But it's clear to us that depending upon the property, you may compete with upscale supply too. And so as we look at that particular number, this year, we would say that across our top 19 or 20 markets, we're looking at supply that's roughly 2.5% in 2016. We think that's going to escalate to slightly more than 3% in 2017. Markets that we are a bit concerned about would be ones that you are too, Seattle, Denver, Houston and New York. I think the thing to note for us though is that we do have -- well, while those markets represent about, let's call it, 15% of our EBITDA, if you -- we also have great representation in some markets that are -- like Atlanta, Hawaii, San Diego or San Francisco that are expected to have much lower supply, and in fact, those last 4 markets that I just referred to, we have more than 25% of our EBITDA coming from those markets. So hence my point in our prepared remarks that when we look -- when we see our portfolio compared to others, we think we have a little bit less exposure to supply than some others because of the diversity in the portfolio."

They extended the term a bit, but we retained a fair amount of flexibility in terms of how the hotel would be operating going forward. And when you look across our portfolio, we had -- we do continue to have a number of opportunities. It probably falls in the realm of a couple of years as you sort of space things out over the next 5 to 7 years, where there is an opportunity to consider either replacing the existing branded operator with a franchise operator, or we may have contracts to terminate that offer us even more flexibility. So it's -- I think it's an area that we've been able to have a fair amount of -- we do, that where we've made done conversions or where we've changed contracts, we're consistently seeing anywhere from a 10% to 20% improvement in EBITDA as a result of the changes that we're making.

I guess what I'd say is as we've looked at this, and that we've consistently said that since the transaction was announced, if our Starwood hotels were operated under the Marriott expense and cost structure, not fee structure but the operating costs of running those hotels, we think that there would be an opportunity to reduce expenses at our Starwood hotels. There's a number of elements of the Marriott system, what, be it reservations or purchasing or some other areas, including their agreements with the online companies where the Marriott contracts and the Marriott cost structure is cheaper. I can't --  we know that as they work their way through the integration process, we will start to see the benefits of those cost savings, but it's a little hard right now for us to predict how quickly that will happen."

I think, going forward, the other thing that will affect leisure travel would be international leisure. We've had a -- the 18 months has been a bit weak and primarily because of currency. But assuming that the currency stabilizes, I think there's an opportunity for some pick-up there. We're generally fairly bullish as we look out over the next 5 years about our resort profile.

CapEx for next year, I'd say, we've been -- had been targeting for a few years now to be spending a bit less, especially on maintenance CapEx in '16, and I think that will carry over in '17. So I would generally expect to see a little bit less capital in '17. Our thought had generally been that we would prefer to -- we would look to increase capital spending a bit later in the cycle under the period that it cost us a little bit less maybe in terms of lost occupancy, and it cost us a little bit less because oftentimes, as you get near the end of the cycle, pricing for construction projects drops too. So we're not at the point we're making any decisions about '18. We are looking hard at our '17 plan, and I'd say, general -- the general initial sense, without putting a hard number on it, is it will be lower than what we'd spend in '16."

There may be a little bit of a couple of projects being a hair more expensive than what we had originally anticipated. But the reality is, is overall, I'm talking with our construction group, our overall budget -- our overall performance compared to the budget is coming in pretty consistently with what we expected. And so the mild increase that you see in the numbers compared to the prior quarter really just reflects the fact that we expected to pay for more than the cost this year, and that's likely because we're finishing a little bit sooner for some of those projects. I think as the -- looking beyond that and looking -- and thinking more broadly, we look at all of these different options, whether it's investing in the portfolio, buying stock or other investments on kind of a comparative basis. Opportunities to enhance the portfolio have generally driven higher rates. Higher levels of return will continue to be attractive. Having said that, I don't think we have as many of those opportunities in '17 as we've had in '15 and '16, and so I expect the volume of activity in there will be lower."

Sure. So I guess, first off, I would say that in terms of thinking about the level of RevPAR and revenue growth that we likely would need from 1 year to the next in order to maintain the margins that we have, I'd say, today, our thinking is that needs to be right around or just slightly above 2%. And that's based on nothing more complicated than expecting inflation to generally run at about that level. And so if our costs go up on inflation, then we sort of need to match that at the revenue line in order to maintain our margins. Now I will point out that does not -- that does mean that EBITDA grows at that same rate of inflation or slightly better. And so that's not suggesting that it would be a slight EBITDA. But I think that's still a reasonable reference point. We do think that there are some things that we're working on now, including the continuation of the time motion study work that we've done, which we've talked about before and has saved us a fair amount of money this year. We do think there are some things on those lines that might benefit us next year, and of course, to the extent that we end up with the lower level of RevPAR growth that we've been suggesting, then we'll be working hard at trying to find other ways to take costs out. Some of that will, of course, be dependent upon whether that lower level of RevPAR is generated more by lack of rate growth or perhaps a reduction in occupancy. The latter, obviously, gives us a better opportunity to try to take cost out of the system. In terms of the benefits that would flow from the Marriott-Starwood merger, I honestly would not be expecting to see a significant amount of that benefit in 2017. There are a few things that could happen more quickly, I believe, but I think there's still some work to be done in this area. I believe that the opportunity to benefit from some -- the new -- the Marriott-negotiated OTA agreements could probably take hold next year. But I think longer, a lot of the other integration activities that would be required for us to get the expense savings

to happen, and so I would not be counting on a benefit of that in 2017."

Looking at our operating results. Adjusted EBITDA was $342 million for the quarter, reflecting an increase of 5.9%. Year-to-date, adjusted EBITDA was $1.123 billion, an increase of 5.3%. Our adjusted FFO was $0.37 per share for the third quarter and $1.28 year-to-date, reflecting an 11.3% increase over last year. Our strong EBITDA and FFO performance was driven by both top line growth and margin expansion. For the quarter, our average rate grew 2.2%, complemented by solid demand growth in our portfolio as comparable hotel occupancy grew by 1.2 percentage points, allowing our comparable hotel to achieve an occupancy rate of 81.3%. As a result, comparable RevPAR growth, on a constant dollar basis, increased 3.8%. The primary driver of our RevPAR growth this quarter was our group segment. Our domestic hotels benefited from a 3.4% increase in group demand, all generated by a significant increase in association demand. Corporate demand was uneven in the quarter, but the shift in the timing of the Jewish holidays from September of last year to October of this year led to a significant increase in corporate group during September. The net result was a 2.5% increase in average rate, which was generally achieved across all of our group segment, leading our domestic group revenues to increase by 6% for the quarter. 
Our international assets also buoyed portfolio results in the quarter as our Canadian hotels benefited from strong transient demand, leading to RevPAR growth of almost 15%. And the Olympic Games generated 105% RevPAR growth in our Brazil assets. Since much of our Olympic business was booked as group, our overall group business actually increased by more than 9% for the quarter. As would be expected, the strength in group demand was partially offset by a decline in transient demand, which has been a theme for most of this calendar year. However, unlike the first 2 quarters, our hotels were able to increase rates and also push business into more highly rated segments, leading to transient rate growth of 2% for the quarter. Taking into account the decline in transient demand, our transient revenue growth was slightly less than 1%. 
Recognizing the trends we have been experiencing this year, we have been focused on layering in more highly priced contract business at several of our hotels. Our contract business, which is still only 5% of our total demand, increased nearly 15% for the quarter and is up 17% year-to-date. The one aspect of our operations that was disappointing in Q3 was our food and beverage department as food and beverage revenues increased by just 0.3%, which was roughly 2% less than we had anticipated. While F&B has been notoriously difficult to forecast, the bulk of the shortfall occurred in catering and resulted from groups being more conservative with their entertaining budgets. Our revenue actually grew by nearly 2%, which was an impressive result given that transient occupancy had decreased. Offsetting some of the weakness in F&B, our other department revenues grew by a strong 10.5%. We saw a strong increase in spa revenues and an increase in attrition and cancellation fees, which was largely concentrated at 3 of our convention hotels. 
Comparable hotel revenues increased 3.3% for the quarter. The increase level of higher-rated group activity, combined with the rate increase in our transient business as well as our continued focus on productivity improvements, resulted in strong rooms flow-through. This flow-through, plus reductions in utility and insurance expenses, contributed to our comparable EBITDA margin growth of 110 basis points in the third quarter. Year-to-date, comparable hotel RevPAR has increased 3% in constant currency terms. Food and beverage has improved by 2.1% and hotel revenues has increased by 3.1%. Comparable EBITDA margin growth is 90 basis points, which has generated 56% flow-through for the year, which is a very solid result. 
An important focus of our company is actively managing our portfolio and efficiently allocating capital. Towards that goal, as I mentioned earlier, in the third quarter, we completed the sale of the final 2 New Zealand properties for $31 million, bringing our year-to-date noncore-asset sale total to approximately $500 million. We purchased this New Zealand portfolio for $190 million in New Zealand terms and received total sales proceeds of New Zealand dollars of 266 million, which allowed us to achieve better than a 14.5% unlevered IRR on this investment. We are currently marketing our remaining consolidated Asia Pacific asset to Melbourne Hilton, and we hope to complete a sale during the first half of 2017. In addition, we are marketing a select few other noncore assets. While we are making reasonable progress on these sales, the transactions have not yet gone hard and we do not expect any additional asset sales will be completed in 2016. 
On the investment front, the company invested approximately $46 million in the third quarter on redevelopment, return on investment and acquisition capital expenditures. We completed the initial phase of the Denver Marriott Tech Center redevelopment, which included newly designed guest rooms in one of the towers, a new lobby and lounge, a new fitness center and some additional meeting space. While we are pleased with the progress we have made on this project, we are slightly behind schedule due to some permitting challenges, but still expect to be completed by year-end. In addition, we have also made great progress on the first phase of the renovations at The Phoenician during the slower summer months. This phase included a complete design of the guestrooms, casitas and Canyon Suites. We are excited to have an opportunity to show you our progress at The Phoenician before NAREIT in less than 2 weeks. 
For the full year, we expect to spend $200 million to $215 million on redevelopment, ROI and acquisition projects and $300 million to $310 million on renewal and replacement capital expenditures. 
Now let me spend a few minutes on our outlook for the remainder of 2016. Uncertainties surrounding the U.S. election and other international events lead us to believe that corporate profit growth and business investment levels will not improve meaningfully in the near term, suggesting that business transient demand will remain soft in the fourth quarter. While year-to-date, our domestic group revenues have been up nearly 4%, we expect to experience a softer fourth quarter as the Jewish holidays shift and nationwide elections will reduce group demand as the traditionally lower occupancies in the fourth quarter will likely restrain rate growth. Our group booking and revenue pace for Q4 is only slightly positive and assuming continued short-term booking weakness, could easily be slightly negative for the fourth quarter. The combination of these factors suggest that we will experience minimal RevPAR growth in the fourth quarter, leading us to conclude that our full year comparable RevPAR will increase between 2% and 2.5%. 
Weaker group demand and negligible revenue growth will put pressure on operating margins in the fourth quarter, reversing to some degree the strong results we have seen year-to-date. As a consequence, we expect our full year comparable hotel EBITDA margin growth improvement to be in the range of 40 to 55 basis points. This will translate to full year adjusted EBITDA of $1.440 billion to $1.455 billion and adjusted FFO per share of $1.64 to $1.66. 
Looking ahead to 2017. As we have indicated in prior years, our visibility at this time into next year is limited as we have just started on our detailed operating budget process. There are a number of factors that will influence operating results in 2017, starting, first and foremost, with the economy. This year, we are experiencing weaker GDP growth and declines in corporate profits and investments, plus the strength in the U.S. dollar. These factors have led to weak corporate transient demand and reduced international travel, resulting in industry demand growth of just 1.5%, which is well short of the average of nearly 3% for the last 3 years. The outlook for GDP, corporate profits and corporate investment is more favorable in 2017, but the concept that it will be better next year has been offered frequently during this recovery and generally hasn't come to fruition. The currency outlook is slightly more favorable, especially in countries such as Japan and Brazil, which could lead to better international travel trends. 
As opposed to the uncertainty surrounding demand factors, it is clear that supply is increasing. In our top 19 markets, upscale and above supply has increased by roughly 2.5% in 2016, while a number of reports have correctly noted that our portfolio is less exposed to new supply than many others in the industry primarily because we benefit from a more diversified distribution. Supply in our markets is still expected to increase by more than 3% in 2017. While we are experiencing record occupancies this year, this anticipated supply increase suggest that we will need to have stronger demand growth in 2017 to have pricing power. 
Our group revenues for 2017 are up over 2.5%, but short-term bookings have been growing at a slower rate and so we would not currently expect to benefit from the significant increase in group activity that we have seen in 2016. Combining all of these insights, along with the trend of weakening top line growth that we had seen over the last 2 years, we would not expect to see RevPAR accelerate in 2017 unless the economy improves meaningfully. We will provide much greater insights into our outlook for 2017 in our fourth quarter call in February. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Greg Larson, our Chief Financial Officer, who will discuss our operating and financial performance in more detail."
29574,384227136,1070591,"Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2016",2016-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Ed. I'll start with commentary on performance in several of our major markets. Our consolidated international hotels had a spectacular third quarter, with double-digit RevPAR increases in Latin America and Canada of more than 61% and almost 15%",1665,"Thank you, Ed. I'll start with commentary on performance in several of our major markets. Our consolidated international hotels had a spectacular third quarter, with double-digit RevPAR increases in Latin America and Canada of more than 61% and almost 15% respectively. As anticipated, the Olympics and Paralympic Games in Brazil drove significant increases in our 3 Brazilian hotels. Our hotels in Calgary and Toronto also experienced double-digit RevPAR growth. Toronto's outperformance was mainly the result of a Microsoft citywide in July, which caused compression in that market. Calgary experienced strong growth due to an increase in events at the Convention Center. Keep in mind that overall demand in Brazil, excluding the demands surrounding the Olympics, has been weak due to concerns over Zika, economic and political issues as well as increased supply. As a result, we expect lodging fundamentals in Brazil to weaken in the fourth quarter. 
As discussed last quarter, despite the slow start in San Diego in the first half of the year, RevPAR for assets in the market grew an impressive 11.8% this quarter, with occupancy growth of 5.6 percentage points and a 5% increase in average rate. Importantly, our RevPAR results exceeded the STAR upper-upscale market results by 430 basis points. The increase in citywide room nights from the MLB All Star Game and Comic-Con created healthy compression in the market and resulted in strong group business, which was up almost 26%. Looking to the fourth quarter. We expect our hotels in San Diego to continue to outperform our portfolio. 
Our hotels in Hawaii grew RevPAR 7.7% this quarter, leading the STAR upper-upscale market results by 220 basis points. Occupancy increased 4.8 percentage points, and average rate improved 2.1%. Strong transient demand at our Maui hotels, coupled with solid group business at the Fairmont Kea Lani and Hyatt Place Waikiki offset ballroom renovation displacement at Hyatt Maui. Short-term transient demand increased more than anticipated in August and September as vacationers chose Maui over the Zika-feared Caribbean location and airfare costs remained stable. We expect our Hawaiian hotels to continue to outperform our portfolio in the fourth quarter. In addition, we should note that Hawaii is the market with the lowest-expected supply growth out of the top 20 U.S. markets for the next couple of years, which bodes well for future performance. 
As expected, our properties in D.C. outperformed our portfolio again this quarter, with RevPAR growth of 6.8%, outpacing the STAR upper-upscale market RevPAR increase by 120 basis points. This was driven predominantly by an average rate increase of 5.6% as well as a 90 basis point increase in occupancy. The Westin Georgetown, the AWDC and Grand Hyatt all had double-digit RevPAR growth this quarter, benefiting from renovations in the comp set and a strong group base that created mid-week compression and enabled the hotels to drive strong average rate growth. 
With elections next Tuesday and the resulting slowdown in legislative activity, we expect RevPAR growth to slow in the fourth quarter, but still expect outperformance relative to the portfolio. Even though we have not provided any guidance for 2017, it is worth mentioning that citywides in 2017 looks strong for D.C. Combined with Congress operating on a full calendar and an inauguration in January, we expect there will be additional demand in 2017. 
Los Angeles continues to outperform the portfolio, with a 6.6% increase in the third quarter. The results were driven by a 3.5% growth in average rate and a 2.5 percentage point increase in occupancy. Strong group in contract business at several of our hotels drove the RevPAR increase, which exceeded the STAR upper-upscale market results by 120 basis points. Year-to-date, our hotels in Los Angeles have grown RevPAR by 8.9%. Looking forward to the fourth quarter, group booking pace in Los Angeles remains strong, and as a result, we expect continued outperformance from our Los Angeles properties. 
In Atlanta, RevPAR increased 5.6% for the quarter as a result of average rate growth of 0.8% and occupancy increase of 3.6 percentage points. Continued strong citywide room nights in the third quarter contributed to the outperformance. As anticipated, the citywide calendar on a year-over-year basis for the fourth quarter will be weak, therefore, we expect fourth quarter RevPAR to be flat to last year. 
Moving to some challenged markets. New York RevPAR decreased 4%, basically in line with the STAR upper-upscale decline of 3.6%. Supply continues to outpace demand, which when combined with lower European travel and tour business due to the strong -- and lower European travel and tour business due to the strong U.S. dollar continued to negatively impact our ability to drive rates. Based on our outlook for the market, we expect our hotels in New York to continue to have a RevPAR decline in the fourth quarter. 
RevPAR in the San Francisco hotels declined 3.4%, with a decrease in both occupancy and rate this quarter. Group room nights were down due to the Moscone Convention Center expansion, which will continue to negatively impact San Francisco in 2017. Due to the lack of group compression, almost all hotels booked more lower rate at transient business, resulting in overall transient ADR decline of 5.4%. Our San Francisco hotels will likely underperform our portfolio in the fourth quarter. 
The Houston market continues to be impacted by the struggling oil industry and increased supply as evidenced by the severe declines in the STAR upper-upscale of nearly 14%. Our Houston hotels' RevPAR declined 2.9% in the quarter, and a 3.7% decrease in ADR was partially offset by a small increase in occupancy. 2 major citywide events did not repeat in the third quarter this year, compelling our managers to book group business at our hotels to maintain occupancy. This proved to be the right strategy as we beat the STAR upper-upscale market by 11 percentage points. We expect the difficulties in Houston to continue in the fourth quarter and therefore anticipate that these hotels will underperform the portfolio. 
RevPAR of the hotels in Seattle declined 1.5% in the third quarter. Occupancy declined about 1 percentage point to almost 91%, and ADR decreased 0.3%. Last year, our hotels in Seattle had a record group business in the quarter and grew RevPAR 9.8%, making for difficult comparisons this year. Many of the groups during the third quarter last year did not repeat this year, and the market has seen a decrease in Canadian leisure weekend business, contributing to the weaker results this quarter. We expect performance to improve in the fourth quarter as transient demand increases and the W Seattle will benefit from being under renovation last December. 
RevPAR of the Phoenix hotels grew 0.6% in the quarter, with an occupancy decline of 4.3 percentage points and an increase in ADR of 7.9%. Our hotels were negatively impacted by group cancellations, slippage and soft transient demand. We expect RevPAR at our hotels in Phoenix to improve in the fourth quarter. 
Shifting to our European joint venture. The portfolio continued to be negatively impacted by a number of macro factors, including the lingering effects of the terrorist attacks in Paris and Brussels and the political and economic uncertainty pre- and post-Brexit. All this led to a RevPAR decline of 2.6% in constant euros this quarter. As expected, our hotels in Paris and Brussels significantly underperformed the portfolio, while our hotels in London, Spain and Stockholm outperformed. We expect our hotels in Paris and Brussels will continue to be challenged in the fourth quarter. 
As noted in our press release, during the third quarter, we repurchased 2.8 million shares in an average purchase price of $16.04, for a total purchase price of $44 million. Since the inception of our share repurchase program in April of 2015, we have bought back 51.4 million shares of common stock for a total purchase price of approximately $883 million. We currently have $117 million of capacity remaining under the repurchase program. In addition, in October, we paid a regular third quarter cash dividend of $0.20 per share, which represents an annualized yield of over 5% on the current stock price. Based on our current operating forecast, combined with taxable gains generated from our completed asset sales to date and our regular fourth quarter dividend, we expect to pay a special dividend of approximately $0.05, bringing total dividends for the fourth quarter to $0.25 per share. 
We continue to operate from a position of financial strength and flexibility and believe we have one of the best balance sheets in the lodging REIT and overall REIT space. Importantly, we view this as a key competitive and strategic advantage, which enhances our ability to pay our dividends throughout the cycle and allows us to invest as opportunities arise to buy assets, buy back our stock or reinvest in high-yielding redevelopment or ROI projects. 
We ended the third quarter with approximately $340 million of cash and currently have $628 million of available capacity under our revolving credit facility. We improved our leverage ratio as calculated under our credit facility to 2.5x. It is important to note that when updating models for 2017, our 2016 adjusted EBITDA includes $12 million for the reimbursement of operating losses at the New Orleans Marriott due to the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill. In addition, the 2016 full year guidance includes adjusted EBITDA of $13 million that was earned by the hotels that had been sold during the year. Therefore, a total of $25 million in EBITDA will not repeat in 2017. However, keep in mind that comparable EBITDA margin growth in 2016 was not impacted by these items as the business interruption insurance proceeds and sold assets are excluded from our comparable hotel results. 
In summary, we are pleased with our results this quarter as the profitability of our assets continues to improve due to our aggressive asset management strategies in what continues to be a competitive environment.

Overall, we've seen that cancellation and attrition fees, which is what we were talking about, have been higher this year than they have been in the last few years. Now I would tell you that the level of attrition and cancellations we saw in the first half of this decade was below what I would describe as our long-term average. But the bottom line is, is they're up about 30% for the year. They were up closer to about 60% this particular quarter. We saw the cancellations in Orlando and at the -- 2 of our larger convention hotels, one in San Francisco, which I suspect might have been a little bit related to some of the activity out there in the -- at the Convention Center that you're all fully aware of and also at the Marquis. I would imagine that we'll -- that we think that will moderate a bit in the fourth quarter, but it is not abnormal at this part of the cycle to start to see a little bit more in terms of cancellation and attrition activity. So we would expect to see that continue at a slightly elevated level compared to the 2010 to 2015 time frame. Part of that, I would note though, is that I'd be careful to draw the conclusions. That means that people are canceling or not showing up to a greater degree in the past. I'm sure that's part of what's happening. Some of that, and this is also reflective of the fact that we have better contracts, from our perspective, which is enabling us to recover more when folks don't show up."

We're hearing that as we talk with the brokerage community and as we look at the experience we're having, we're finding that international buyers are probably a bit higher percentage of the activity than in past. You're seeing some smaller operators, associated with family offices, chase after some of the smaller deals that are out there. I was also -- I've heard that some of the non-public but nontraded REITs or nonlisted REITs have been a bit more active too. So it's -- there's still a market out there.

So I think you know that upper-upscale segment generally has very light supply, and I think that's coming -- it's still coming in generally across-the-board in our markets at less than 2%. But it's clear to us that depending upon the property, we may compete with upscale supply too. And so as we look at that particular number, this year, we would say that across our top 19 or 20 markets, we're looking at supply that's roughly 2.5% in 2016. We think that's going to escalate to slightly more than 3% in 2017. Markets that we are a bit concerned about would be ones that you are too, Seattle, Denver, Houston and New York. I think the thing to note for us though is that we do have -- well, while those markets represent about, let's call it, 15% of our EBITDA, if you -- we also have great representation in some markets that are -- like Atlanta, Hawaii, San Diego or San Francisco that are expected to have much lower supply, and in fact, those last 4 markets that I just referred to, we have more than 25% of our EBITDA coming from those markets. So hence my point in our prepared remarks that when we look -- when we see our portfolio compared to others, we think we have a little bit less exposure to supply than some others because of the diversity in the portfolio."

They extended the term a bit, but we retained a fair amount of flexibility in terms of how the hotel would be operating going forward. And when you look across our portfolio, we had -- we do continue to have a number of opportunities. It probably falls in the realm of a couple of years as you sort of space things out over the next 5 to 7 years, where there is an opportunity to consider either replacing the existing branded operator with a franchise operator, or we may have contracts to terminate that offer us even more flexibility. So it's -- I think it's an area that we've been able to have a fair amount of -- we view, that where we've made done conversions or where we've changed contracts, we're consistently seeing anywhere from a 10% to 20% improvement in EBITDA as a result of the changes that we're making.

I'm sure that Marriott and Arne will give you more insights into those issues on their call, which I'm assuming is later this week. I guess what I'd say is as we've looked at this, and that we've consistently said that since the transaction was announced, if our Starwood hotels were operated under the Marriott expense and cost structure, not fee structure but the operating costs of running those hotels, we think that there would be an opportunity to reduce expenses at our Starwood hotels. There's a number of elements of the Marriott system, what, be it reservations or purchasing or some other areas, including their agreements with the online companies where the Marriott contracts and the Marriott cost structure is cheaper. I can't --  we know that as they work their way through the integration process, we will start to see the benefits of those cost savings, but it's a little hard right now for us to predict how quickly that will happen."

I think, going forward, the other thing that will affect leisure travel would be international leisure. We've had a -- the last 18 months has been a bit weak and primarily because of currency.

So I would generally expect to see a little bit less capital in '17. Our thought had generally been that we would prefer to -- we would look to increase capital spending a bit later in the cycle under the theory that it cost us a little bit less maybe in terms of lost occupancy, and it cost us a little bit less because oftentimes, as you get near the end of the cycle, pricing for construction projects drops too. So we're not at the point we're making any decisions about '18.

There may be a little bit of a couple of projects being a hair more expensive than what we had originally anticipated. But the reality is, is overall, I'm talking with our construction group, our overall budget -- our overall performance compared to the budget is coming in pretty consistently with what we expected. And so the mild increase that you see in the numbers compared to the prior quarter really just reflects the fact that we expected to pay for more than the cost this year, and that's likely because we're finishing a little bit sooner for some of those projects. I think as the -- looking beyond that and looking -- and thinking more broadly, we look at all of these different options, whether it's investing in the portfolio, buying stock or other investments on kind of a comparative basis. Opportunities to enhance the portfolio have generally driven higher rates. Higher levels of return will continue to be attractive. Having said that, I don't think we have as many of those opportunities in '17 as we've had in '15 and '16, and so I expect the volume of activity in there will be lower."

Sure. So I guess, first off, I would say that in terms of thinking about the level of RevPAR and revenue growth that we likely would need from 1 year to the next in order to maintain the margins that we have, I'd say, today, our thinking is that needs to be right around or just slightly above 2%. And that's based on nothing more complicated than expecting inflation to generally run at about that level. And so if our costs go up on inflation, then we sort of need to match that at the revenue line in order to maintain our margins. Now I will point out that does not -- that does mean that EBITDA grows at that same rate of inflation or slightly better. And so that's not suggesting that it would be a slight EBITDA. But I think that's still a reasonable reference point. We do think that there are some things that we're working on now, including the continuation of the time motion study work that we've done, which we've talked about before and has saved us a fair amount of money this year. We do think there are some things on those lines that might benefit us next year, and of course, to the extent that we end up with the lower level of RevPAR growth that we've been suggesting, then we'll be working hard at trying to find other ways to take costs out. Some of that will, of course, be dependent upon whether that lower level of RevPAR is generated more by lack of rate growth or perhaps a reduction in occupancy. The latter, obviously, gives us a better opportunity to try to take cost out of the system. In terms of the benefits that would flow from the Marriott-Starwood merger, I honestly would not be expecting to see a significant amount of that benefit in 2017. There are a few things that could happen more quickly, I believe, but I think there's still some work to be done in this area. I believe that the opportunity to benefit from some -- the new -- the Marriott-negotiated OTA agreements could probably take hold next year. But I think longer, a lot of the other integration activities that would be required for us to get the expense savings

Our operating results, given the trends the industry is experiencing, were quite good and in line with our expectations. We completed the sales of our last 2 New Zealand assets, continued to make progress on our redevelopment investments and repurchased 44 million of our stock in September, raising the year-to-date total return to shareholders to over $800 million. 
Looking at our operating results. Adjusted EBITDA was $342 million for the quarter, reflecting an increase of 5.9%. Year-to-date, adjusted EBITDA was $1.123 billion, an increase of 5.3%. Our adjusted FFO was $0.37 per share for the third quarter and $1.28 year-to-date, reflecting an 11.3% increase over last year. Our strong EBITDA and FFO performance was driven by both top line growth and margin expansion. For the quarter, our average rate grew 2.2%, complemented by solid demand growth in our portfolio as comparable hotel occupancy grew by 1.2 percentage points, allowing our comparable hotel to achieve an occupancy rate of 81.3%. As a result, comparable RevPAR growth, on a constant dollar basis, increased 3.8%. The primary driver of our RevPAR growth this quarter was our group segment. Our domestic hotels benefited from a 3.4% increase in group demand, all generated by a significant increase in association demand. Corporate demand was uneven in the quarter, but the shift in the timing of the Jewish holidays from September of last year to October of this year led to a significant increase in corporate group during September. The net result was a 2.5% increase in average rate, which was generally achieved across all of our group segment, leading our domestic group revenues to increase by 6% for the quarter. 
Our international assets also buoyed portfolio results in the quarter as our Canadian hotels benefited from strong transient demand, leading to RevPAR growth of almost 15%. And the Olympic Games generated 105% RevPAR growth in our Brazil assets. Since much of our Olympic business was booked as group, our overall group business actually increased by more than 9% for the quarter. As would be expected, the strength in group demand was partially offset by a decline in transient demand, which has been a theme for most of this calendar year. However, unlike the first 2 quarters, our hotels were able to increase rates and also push business into more highly rated segments, leading to transient rate growth of 2% for the quarter. Taking into account the decline in transient demand, our transient revenue growth was slightly less than 1%. 
Recognizing the trends we have been experiencing this year, we have been focused on layering in more highly priced contract business at several of our hotels. Our contract business, which is still only 5% of our total demand, increased nearly 15% for the quarter and is up 17% year-to-date. The one aspect of our operations that was disappointing in Q3 was our food and beverage department as food and beverage revenues increased by just 0.3%, which was roughly 2% less than we had anticipated. While F&B has been notoriously difficult to forecast, the bulk of the shortfall occurred in catering and resulted from groups being more conservative with their entertaining budgets. Our revenue actually grew by nearly 2%, which was an impressive result given that transient occupancy had decreased. Offsetting some of the weakness in F&B, our other department revenues grew by a strong 10.5%. We saw a strong increase in spa revenues and an increase in attrition and cancellation fees, which was largely concentrated at 3 of our convention hotels. 
Comparable hotel revenues increased 3.3% for the quarter. The increase level of higher-rated group activity, combined with the rate increase in our transient business as well as our continued focus on productivity improvements, resulted in strong rooms flow-through. This flow-through, plus reductions in utility and insurance expenses, contributed to our comparable EBITDA margin growth of 110 basis points in the third quarter. Year-to-date, comparable hotel RevPAR has increased 3% in constant currency terms. Food and beverage has improved by 2.1% and hotel revenues has increased by 3.1%. Comparable EBITDA margin growth is 90 basis points, which has generated 56% flow-through for the year, which is a very solid result. 
An important focus of our company is actively managing our portfolio and efficiently allocating capital. Towards that goal, as I mentioned earlier, in the third quarter, we completed the sale of the final 2 New Zealand properties for $31 million, bringing our year-to-date noncore-asset sale total to approximately $500 million. We purchased this New Zealand portfolio for $190 million in New Zealand terms and received total sales proceeds of New Zealand dollars of 266 million, which allowed us to achieve better than a 14.5% unlevered IRR on this investment. We are currently marketing our remaining consolidated Asia Pacific asset to Melbourne Hilton, and we hope to complete a sale during the first half of 2017. In addition, we are marketing a select few other noncore assets. While we are making reasonable progress on these sales, the transactions have not yet gone hard and we do not expect any additional asset sales will be completed in 2016. 
On the investment front, the company invested approximately $46 million in the third quarter on redevelopment, return on investment and acquisition capital expenditures. We completed the initial phase of the Denver Marriott Tech Center redevelopment, which included newly designed guest rooms in one of the towers, a new lobby and lounge, a new fitness center and some additional meeting space. While we are pleased with the progress we have made on this project, we are slightly behind schedule due to some permitting challenges, but still expect to be completed by year-end. In addition, we have also made great progress on the first phase of the renovations at The Phoenician during the slower summer months. This phase included a complete design of the guestrooms, casitas and Canyon Suites. We are excited to have an opportunity to show you our progress at The Phoenician before NAREIT in less than 2 weeks. 
For the full year, we expect to spend $200 million to $215 million on redevelopment, ROI and acquisition projects and $300 million to $310 million on renewal and replacement capital expenditures. 
Now let me spend a few minutes on our outlook for the remainder of 2016. Uncertainties surrounding the U.S. election and other international events lead us to believe that corporate profit growth and business investment levels will not improve meaningfully in the near term, suggesting that business transient demand will remain soft in the fourth quarter. While year-to-date, our domestic group revenues have been up nearly 4%, we expect to experience a softer fourth quarter as the Jewish holidays shift and nationwide elections will reduce group demand as the traditionally lower occupancies in the fourth quarter will likely restrain rate growth. Our group booking and revenue pace for Q4 is only slightly positive and assuming continued short-term booking weakness, could easily be slightly negative for the fourth quarter. The combination of these factors suggest that we will experience minimal RevPAR growth in the fourth quarter, leading us to conclude that our full year comparable RevPAR will increase between 2% and 2.5%. 
Weaker group demand and negligible revenue growth will put pressure on operating margins in the fourth quarter, reversing to some degree the strong results we have seen year-to-date. As a consequence, we expect our full year comparable hotel EBITDA margin growth improvement to be in the range of 40 to 55 basis points. This will translate to full year adjusted EBITDA of $1.440 billion to $1.455 billion and adjusted FFO per share of $1.64 to $1.66. 
Looking ahead to 2017. As we have indicated in prior years, our visibility at this time into next year is limited as we have just started on our detailed operating budget process. There are a number of factors that will influence operating results in 2017, starting, first and foremost, with the economy. This year, we are experiencing weaker GDP growth and declines in corporate profits and investments, plus the strength in the U.S. dollar. These factors have led to weak corporate transient demand and reduced international travel, resulting in industry demand growth of just 1.5%, which is well short of the average of nearly 3% for the last 3 years. The outlook for GDP, corporate profits and corporate investment is more favorable in 2017, but the concept that it will be better next year has been offered frequently during this recovery and generally hasn't come to fruition. The currency outlook is slightly more favorable, especially in countries such as Japan and Brazil, which could lead to better international travel trends. 
As opposed to the uncertainty surrounding demand factors, it is clear that supply is increasing. In our top 19 markets, upscale and above supply has increased by roughly 2.5% in 2016, while a number of reports have correctly noted that our portfolio is less exposed to new supply than many others in the industry primarily because we benefit from a more diversified distribution. Supply in our markets is still expected to increase by more than 3% in 2017. While we are experiencing record occupancies this year, this anticipated supply increase suggest that we will need to have stronger demand growth in 2017 to have pricing power. 
Our group revenues for 2017 are up over 2.5%, but short-term bookings have been growing at a slower rate and so we would not currently expect to benefit from the significant increase in group activity that we have seen in 2016. Combining all of these insights, along with the trend of weakening top line growth that we had seen over the last 2 years, we would not expect to see RevPAR accelerate in 2017 unless the economy improves meaningfully. We will provide much greater insights into our outlook for 2017 in our fourth quarter call in February. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Greg Larson, our Chief Financial Officer, who will discuss our operating and financial performance in more detail."
29574,384227136,1072775,"Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2016",2016-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Ed. I'll start with commentary on performance in several of our major markets. Our consolidated international hotels had a spectacular third quarter, with double-digit RevPAR increases in Latin America and Canada of more than 61% and almost 15%",1665,"Thank you, Ed. I'll start with commentary on performance in several of our major markets. Our consolidated international hotels had a spectacular third quarter, with double-digit RevPAR increases in Latin America and Canada of more than 61% and almost 15% respectively. As anticipated, the Olympics and Paralympic Games in Brazil drove significant increases in our 3 Brazilian hotels. Our hotels in Calgary and Toronto also experienced double-digit RevPAR growth. Toronto's outperformance was mainly the result of a Microsoft citywide in July, which caused compression in that market. Calgary experienced strong growth due to an increase in events at the Convention Center. Keep in mind that overall demand in Brazil, excluding the demands surrounding the Olympics, has been weak due to concerns over Zika, economic and political issues as well as increased supply. As a result, we expect lodging fundamentals in Brazil to weaken in the fourth quarter. 
As discussed last quarter, despite the slow start in San Diego in the first half of the year, RevPAR for assets in the market grew an impressive 11.8% this quarter, with occupancy growth of 5.6 percentage points and a 5% increase in average rate. Importantly, our RevPAR results exceeded the STAR upper-upscale market results by 430 basis points. The increase in citywide room nights from the MLB All Star Game and Comic-Con created healthy compression in the market and resulted in strong group business, which was up almost 26%. Looking to the fourth quarter. We expect our hotels in San Diego to continue to outperform our portfolio. 
Our hotels in Hawaii grew RevPAR 7.7% this quarter, leading the STAR upper-upscale market results by 220 basis points. Occupancy increased 4.8 percentage points, and average rate improved 2.1%. Strong transient demand at our Maui hotels, coupled with solid group business at the Fairmont Kea Lani and Hyatt Place Waikiki offset ballroom renovation displacement at Hyatt Maui. Short-term transient demand increased more than anticipated in August and September as vacationers chose Maui over the Zika-feared Caribbean location and airfare costs remained stable. We expect our Hawaiian hotels to continue to outperform our portfolio in the fourth quarter. In addition, we should note that Hawaii is the market with the lowest-expected supply growth out of the top 20 U.S. markets for the next couple of years, which bodes well for future performance. 
As expected, our properties in D.C. outperformed our portfolio again this quarter, with RevPAR growth of 6.8%, outpacing the STAR upper-upscale market RevPAR increase by 120 basis points. This was driven predominantly by an average rate increase of 5.6% as well as a 90 basis point increase in occupancy. The Westin Georgetown, the AWDC and Grand Hyatt all had double-digit RevPAR growth this quarter, benefiting from renovations in the comp set and a strong group base that created mid-week compression and enabled the hotels to drive strong average rate growth. 
With elections next Tuesday and the resulting slowdown in legislative activity, we expect RevPAR growth to slow in the fourth quarter, but still expect outperformance relative to the portfolio. Even though we have not provided any guidance for 2017, it is worth mentioning that citywides in 2017 looks strong for D.C. Combined with Congress operating on a full calendar and an inauguration in January, we expect there will be additional demand in 2017. 
Los Angeles continues to outperform the portfolio, with a 6.6% increase in the third quarter. The results were driven by a 3.5% growth in average rate and a 2.5 percentage point increase in occupancy. Strong group in contract business at several of our hotels drove the RevPAR increase, which exceeded the STAR upper-upscale market results by 120 basis points. Year-to-date, our hotels in Los Angeles have grown RevPAR by 8.9%. Looking forward to the fourth quarter, group booking pace in Los Angeles remains strong, and as a result, we expect continued outperformance from our Los Angeles properties. 
In Atlanta, RevPAR increased 5.6% for the quarter as a result of average rate growth of 0.8% and occupancy increase of 3.6 percentage points. Continued strong citywide room nights in the third quarter contributed to the outperformance. As anticipated, the citywide calendar on a year-over-year basis for the fourth quarter will be weak, therefore, we expect fourth quarter RevPAR to be flat to last year. 
Moving to some challenged markets. New York RevPAR decreased 4%, basically in line with the STAR upper-upscale decline of 3.6%. Supply continues to outpace demand, which when combined with lower European travel and tour business due to the strong -- and lower European travel and tour business due to the strong U.S. dollar continued to negatively impact our ability to drive rates. Based on our outlook for the market, we expect our hotels in New York to continue to have a RevPAR decline in the fourth quarter. 
RevPAR in the San Francisco hotels declined 3.4%, with a decrease in both occupancy and rate this quarter. Group room nights were down due to the Moscone Convention Center expansion, which will continue to negatively impact San Francisco in 2017. Due to the lack of group compression, almost all hotels booked more lower rate at transient business, resulting in overall transient ADR decline of 5.4%. Our San Francisco hotels will likely underperform our portfolio in the fourth quarter. 
The Houston market continues to be impacted by the struggling oil industry and increased supply as evidenced by the severe declines in the STAR upper-upscale of nearly 14%. Our Houston hotels' RevPAR declined 2.9% in the quarter, and a 3.7% decrease in ADR was partially offset by a small increase in occupancy. 2 major citywide events did not repeat in the third quarter this year, compelling our managers to book group business at our hotels to maintain occupancy. This proved to be the right strategy as we beat the STAR upper-upscale market by 11 percentage points. We expect the difficulties in Houston to continue in the fourth quarter and therefore anticipate that these hotels will underperform the portfolio. 
RevPAR of the hotels in Seattle declined 1.5% in the third quarter. Occupancy declined about 1 percentage point to almost 91%, and ADR decreased 0.3%. Last year, our hotels in Seattle had a record group business in the quarter and grew RevPAR 9.8%, making for difficult comparisons this year. Many of the groups during the third quarter last year did not repeat this year, and the market has seen a decrease in Canadian leisure weekend business, contributing to the weaker results this quarter. We expect performance to improve in the fourth quarter as transient demand increases and the W Seattle will benefit from being under renovation last December. 
RevPAR of the Phoenix hotels grew 0.6% in the quarter, with an occupancy decline of 4.3 percentage points and an increase in ADR of 7.9%. Our hotels were negatively impacted by group cancellations, slippage and soft transient demand. We expect RevPAR at our hotels in Phoenix to improve in the fourth quarter. 
Shifting to our European joint venture. The portfolio continued to be negatively impacted by a number of macro factors, including the lingering effects of the terrorist attacks in Paris and Brussels and the political and economic uncertainty pre- and post-Brexit. All this led to a RevPAR decline of 2.6% in constant euros this quarter. As expected, our hotels in Paris and Brussels significantly underperformed the portfolio, while our hotels in London, Spain and Stockholm outperformed. We expect our hotels in Paris and Brussels will continue to be challenged in the fourth quarter. 
As noted in our press release, during the third quarter, we repurchased 2.8 million shares in an average purchase price of $16.04, for a total purchase price of $44 million. Since the inception of our share repurchase program in April of 2015, we have bought back 51.4 million shares of common stock for a total purchase price of approximately $883 million. We currently have $117 million of capacity remaining under the repurchase program. In addition, in October, we paid a regular third quarter cash dividend of $0.20 per share, which represents an annualized yield of over 5% on the current stock price. Based on our current operating forecast, combined with taxable gains generated from our completed asset sales to date and our regular fourth quarter dividend, we expect to pay a special dividend of approximately $0.05, bringing total dividends for the fourth quarter to $0.25 per share. 
We continue to operate from a position of financial strength and flexibility and believe we have one of the best balance sheets in the lodging REIT and overall REIT space. Importantly, we view this as a key competitive and strategic advantage, which enhances our ability to pay our dividends throughout the cycle and allows us to invest as opportunities arise to buy assets, buy back our stock or reinvest in high-yielding redevelopment or ROI projects. 
We ended the third quarter with approximately $340 million of cash and currently have $628 million of available capacity under our revolving credit facility. We improved our leverage ratio as calculated under our credit facility to 2.5x. It is important to note that when updating models for 2017, our 2016 adjusted EBITDA includes $12 million for the reimbursement of operating losses at the New Orleans Marriott due to the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill. In addition, the 2016 full year guidance includes adjusted EBITDA of $13 million that was earned by the hotels that had been sold during the year. Therefore, a total of $25 million in EBITDA will not repeat in 2017. However, keep in mind that comparable EBITDA margin growth in 2016 was not impacted by these items as the business interruption insurance proceeds and sold assets are excluded from our comparable hotel results. 
In summary, we are pleased with our results this quarter as the profitability of our assets continues to improve due to our aggressive asset management strategies in what continues to be a competitive environment.

Overall, we've seen that cancellation and attrition fees, which is what we were talking about, have been higher this year than they have been in the last few years. Now I would tell you that the level of attrition and cancellations we saw in the first half of this decade was below what I would describe as our long-term average. But the bottom line is, is they're up about 30% for the year. They were up closer to about 60% this particular quarter. We saw the cancellations in Orlando and at the -- 2 of our larger convention hotels, one in San Francisco, which I suspect might have been a little bit related to some of the activity out there in the -- at the Convention Center that you're all fully aware of and also at the Marquis. I would imagine that we'll -- that we think that will moderate a bit in the fourth quarter, but it is not abnormal at this part of the cycle to start to see a little bit more in terms of cancellation and attrition activity. So we would expect to see that continue at a slightly elevated level compared to the 2010 to 2015 time frame. Part of that, I would note though, is that I'd be careful to draw the conclusions.

But it's clear to us that depending upon the property, we may compete with upscale supply too. And so as we look at that particular number, this year, we would say that across our top 19 or 20 markets, we're looking at supply that's roughly 2.5% in 2016. We think that's going to escalate to slightly more than 3% in 2017. Markets that we are a bit concerned about would be ones that you are too, Seattle, Denver, Houston and New York. I think the thing to note for us though is that we do have -- well, while those markets represent about, let's call it, 15% of our EBITDA, if you -- we also have great representation in some markets that are -- like Atlanta, Hawaii, San Diego or San Francisco that are expected to have much lower supply, and in fact, those last 4 markets that I just referred to, we have more than 25% of our EBITDA coming from those markets. So hence my point in our prepared remarks that when we look -- when we see our portfolio compared to others, we think we have a little bit less exposure to supply than some others because of the diversity in the portfolio."

And when you look across our portfolio, we had -- we do continue to have a number of opportunities. It probably falls in the realm of a couple of years as you sort of space things out over the next 5 to 7 years, where there is an opportunity to consider either replacing the existing branded operator with a franchise operator, or we may have contracts to terminate that offer us even more flexibility. So it's -- I think it's an area that we've been able to have a fair amount of -- we view, that where we've made done conversions or where we've changed contracts, we're consistently seeing anywhere from a 10% to 20% improvement in EBITDA as a result of the changes that we're making.

I'm sure that Marriott and Arne will give you more insights into those issues on their call, which I'm assuming is later this week. I guess what I'd say is as we've looked at this, and that we've consistently said that since the transaction was announced, if our Starwood hotels were operated under the Marriott expense and cost structure, not fee structure but the operating costs of running those hotels, we think that there would be an opportunity to reduce expenses at our Starwood hotels. There's a number of elements of the Marriott system, what, be it reservations or purchasing or some other areas, including their agreements with the online companies where the Marriott contracts and the Marriott cost structure is cheaper. I can't --  we know that as they work their way through the integration process, we will start to see the benefits of those cost savings, but it's a little hard right now for us to predict how quickly that will happen."

So I would generally expect to see a little bit less capital in '17. Our thought had generally been that we would prefer to -- we would look to increase capital spending a bit later in the cycle under the theory that it cost us a little bit less maybe in terms of lost occupancy, and it cost us a little bit less because oftentimes, as you get near the end of the cycle, pricing for construction projects drops too. So we're not at the point we're making any decisions about '18.

But the reality is, is overall, I'm talking with our construction group, our overall budget -- our overall performance compared to the budget is coming in pretty consistently with what we expected.

Having said that, I don't think we have as many of those opportunities in '17 as we've had in '15 and '16, and so I expect the volume of activity in there will be lower."

Now they're added to -- their optimism about what the numbers might be for next year versus ours trying to be realistic -- it's hard to predict exactly how they're going to look at next year and what message they want to try to convey. So I guess, at the end of the day, we've tried to provide you with as clear a view as we can have at this particular time in terms of what's going to happen for '17.

And your comments about next year kind of suggest that maybe you wouldn't expect more than a 2% increase, maybe even lower or just kind of something similar to this year's levels, around 2%. How should we think about expense growth without -- or I guess the impact on profitability if RevPAR is not up above the level to offset those higher expenses? And your comment about maybe savings from the Starwood-Marriott transaction, if I'm understanding that right, it sounded like maybe that's only 100 basis points of expense to be offset. And I guess that would only be in the sort of -- I don't know. Is that like 20% or 25% of your room base that are Starwood -- coming from Starwood? Maybe you could put some color around that?"

Sure. So I guess, first off, I would say that in terms of thinking about the level of RevPAR and revenue growth that we likely would need from 1 year to the next in order to maintain the margins that we have, I'd say, today, our thinking is that needs to be right around or just slightly above 2%. And that's based on nothing more complicated than expecting inflation to generally run at about that level. And so if our costs go up on inflation, then we sort of need to match that at the revenue line in order to maintain our margins. Now I will point out that does not -- that does mean that EBITDA grows at that same rate of inflation or slightly better. And so that's not suggesting that it would be a slight EBITDA. But I think that's still a reasonable reference point. We do think that there are some things that we're working on now, including the continuation of the time motion study work that we've done, which we've talked about before and has saved us a fair amount of money this year. We do think there are some things on those lines that might benefit us next year, and of course, to the extent that we end up with the lower level of RevPAR growth that we've been suggesting, then we'll be working hard at trying to find other ways to take costs out. Some of that will, of course, be dependent upon whether that lower level of RevPAR is generated more by lack of rate growth or perhaps a reduction in occupancy. The latter, obviously, gives us a better opportunity to try to take cost out of the system. In terms of the benefits that would flow from the Marriott-Starwood merger, I honestly would not be expecting to see a significant amount of that benefit in 2017. There are a few things that could happen more quickly, I believe, but I think there's still some work to be done in this area. I believe that the opportunity to benefit from some -- the new -- the Marriott-negotiated OTA agreements could probably take hold next year. But I think longer, a lot of the other integration activities that would be required for us to get the expense savings
[Audio Gap]
to happen, and so I would not be counting on a benefit of that in 2017."
