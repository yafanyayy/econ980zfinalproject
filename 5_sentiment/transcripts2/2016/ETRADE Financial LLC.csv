As always, it is a pleasure to share my thoughts with you. Later Mr. Pizzi will dissect the quarter. But first, I'd like to spend some time reflecting on what has been, by all accounts, a banner year at E*TRADE. 
An adjusted net income of $340 million or $1.17 per share represent the company's strongest financial performance in nearly a decade, it is a product of exceptional efforts by our colleagues across the organization. We've come so far as a company to bolster our financial competitive positions and in the hall of accomplishments, 2015 display case houses some of our most celebrated and hard earned trophies. 
During the year, our risk profile exhibited a step function improvement as the continued reduction of legacy assets was marked by 2 consecutive quarters of lowering reserves while our demonstration of enhanced enterprise risk controls, among other things, helped solidify our regulatory standing. We embarked upon 4 major capital deployment actions emblematic of our improved position and greater flexibility. And most importantly, we focused on the customer experience, bringing several digital enhancements and offerings to market while further sharpening our focus through the discontinuation of noncore businesses. 
Let's start with our financial position. Faced with tremendous opportunity, my colleagues rose to the challenge, exceeding even our own demanding expectations. To provide a highlight reel of our triumphs, we kicked off 2015 announcing regulatory approval to reduce our bank's Tier 1 leverage ratio by 50 basis points to a level of 9%; reduced and refinanced our corporate debt through our target level of $1 billion at a blended average coupon of 5%, the lowest in company history; simplified our operating structure by extracting our broker-dealer subsidiaries from the bank, which now serves as a more efficient source of capital for the parent, distributed more than $800 million of excess capital to the parent; terminated costly legacy funding sources from our balance sheet markedly improving its profile returns while creating capacity for fuel growth with core customer deposits. 
And began the process of growing the balance sheet to a target of circa $49.5 billion. Put in place, we began executing on an $800 million share repurchase program. And finally, announced yet another approval to reduce our targeted bank leverage ratio in early 2016, this time by 100 basis points to 8%, a full year ahead of expectations. Our accomplishments numbered large and were significant in scope and we ended the year in a dominant stronger position than we began in and frankly, better than the company has been in more than a decade. 
Notably, our progress resulting position were recognized by our regulators and rating agencies across a few dimensions. First, we use at both the bank and parent were lifted early in the year. Next, reflective of our much improved risk profile and regulatory standing, our FDIC insurance rates were cut by more than half. And finally, we received investment-grade credit ratings for the first time in company history, following 7 notches of cumulative upgrades from our 2 covering agencies during the year, with a BBB designation from S&P in August and Moody's following suit in the December. 
While it is more than a pleasure to look back on these achievements, make no mistake that we are acutely focused on what is next, marked by our unwavering commitment to be faithful stewards of shareholder capital. To that end, we are currently in the midst of executing 2 important initiatives. First, we are steadily marching towards our target balance sheet size of $49.5 billion, which we expect to achieve in the second quarter. Second, we are actively executing on our $800 million share repurchase program announced in November. Through year-end, we repurchased 50 million and at a generated date, we have put another $26 million to work. 
Meanwhile, we continue to evaluate other possibilities for capital deployment. Beyond making prudent investments in the business, chief among these possibilities are potential acquisitions. I mentioned that we think of these in 3 broad categories, of which 2 continue to rise at the top of the list. Those are scale acquisitions in the brokerage business and opportunities to better capitalize on our customer deposits through banking. On the brokerage side, we have superior platforms and systems in place and utilizing the scale inherent there in is attractive. 
On banking, we see value in optimizing our low-cost stable deposits through a more favorable approach. While an abundance of small and medium-size opportunities exist in these areas, we are staying highly objective with an eye on delivering compelling returns on capital, ensuring our customers will be well served and the remaining close to our digital repos. As we examine specific opportunities, management and our board passed each through a robust filter, ensuring our heightened standards for risk, our demonstrated commitment to creating value for shareholders and our regulatory standing are at the forefront of any decisions.  
Irrespective of acquisitions, as we think about both growth and capital deployment, we have started to work on sizing the implications of exceeding $50 billion in assets. While I remain hopeful that logic rears its noble head and that certain relations might change, we take a more pragmatic approach to managing our business. Accordingly, I charged Mr. Pizzi and team of understanding all elements crossing this threshold, from systems to reporting to personnel, and most relevant for your purposes, costs. While there's still a lot of analysis to do and the numbers will be refined, initial estimates suggest about $50 million over 2 years related to getting in shape with an additional recurring component of approximately $15 million, annually. 
Keep in mind that not all of these costs, specifically those related to the initial build out, would have immediate P&L impact. Mr. Pizzi will cover more on that later. These costs are certainly not insignificant. And as we noted on numerous occasions, tip toeing over the $50 billion line won't benefit our owners, particularly in the current rate environment. However, with cost and benefits were clearly defined, we will be able to make an informed decision considering rates, growth and return on capital. So we're spending a healthy amount of time working through this exercise for the avoidance of any doubt, our intent for the foreseeable future is to manage our balance sheet to our stated target and not across the nifty land to 50. 
While on the top of expenses, the team has completed the budgeting work for 2016, and I would like to give some color on how we are thinking about spend going forward. We have made a lot of important investments in the business over the past few years, in particular, fortifying the company's risk and control framework in line with our enhanced expectations; bolstering our foundations through improved systems and infrastructure; and finally, upgrading talent. With much of the foundational work complete, we have really just begun to shift our dollars to chip away at delivering enhancements through the year towards improving our competitive position. 
Today, with this more rational expense structure, we are transitioning the way we think and talk about overall spending to be more directly in line with the revenue environment, meaning operating margin. On this measure for 2016, we expect it to be 39%. There are substantial upside in a more normalized rate environment where our target should move to the mid 40s range. While Mr. Pizzi will share additional thoughts and expenses in the coming quarter, I wanted to accentuate our revamped approach on the matter. 
Turning to our business metrics. Customer activity rates slowed in this global and macroeconomic uncertainty during the year, with DARTs of 155,000 down 8% from 2014. Q4 continued to try the moderation as DARTs of 147,000 were down 6% from the third quarter. Options during the quarter, were stable at 24% of total DARTs, consistent with our full-year mix. In January to date, we see an uptick in training activity in this volatile markets and in line with seasonal patterns. Through yesterday, DARTs are tracking up 26% from December. 
Despite uncertainty in the markets our customers showed confidence when they acted as they were net buyers of $6.8 billion securities during the year and maintained relatively healthy margin balances throughout, ending the year at $7.4 billion. For the quarter, margin balances averaged $7.5 billion down from $8 billion last quarter. Recently, we've seen a decline to about $7 billion. Despite the macroeconomic morass, our core franchise also continued its steady growth, adding 13,000 net new brokerage accounts during the fourth quarter, bringing the full-year total to 96,000 after we adjust for unique items. 
Our adjusted attrition rate for the quarter of 8.2% improved from 9.3% in the prior quarter, that brings our full year adjusted attrition rate to 8.9% in line with 2014 in a range that we think is healthy, given our business model. We brought in $2.8 billion of net new brokerage assets during the quarter, which was up from $2.1 billion in the third quarter, that brings our full year total to $9.3 billion, representing a 3.8% growth rate. Importantly, approximately 1/3 of those net new assets were flows into retirement accounts. 
Retirement investing in savings continue to represent a key component of our future growth, both our challenge and our opportunity is to better engage our customers to broaden their awareness and showcase our capabilities as a provider of investment solutions for both the near and long-term focus. We ended the year with $48 billion of retirement assets with our 880,000 retirement house, both of which increased modestly during the year. We also have $3.2 billion of assets and managed accounts, which we think complements this component of our business quite nicely. 
Another tremendous area of opportunity for us is our Stock Plan Administration business. We continue to invest in this business during the year and completed the transition of clients onto our award-winning Equity Edge Online platform. During the year, we added 144,000 net new accounts in this business and ended the year with 1.4 million planned participants. 
Turning to the enhancements we've made to our digital storefront and core platforms, leading with E*TRADE.com, we launched a new welcome page for prospective customers to better deliver our value proposition the moment a window shopper steps into the store. While it is in the early days, we have see an improvement in the funding rate for the accounts directed to this page. It was up over 2.5 percentage points compared to our prior experience. Once in the door, all customers were met with several overhauled sections of our site, including a revamped account overview page, our new retirement center, which provide a simple interface and inviting content to help customers engage, take charge and keep their goals on track. Our new tax center, which brings more efficiency and ease to a process that is notoriously stressful and convoluted. 
And finally, this morning, we announced the introduction of tip ranks to our platform. In listening to customers, we heard a strong need for help navigating the scores of public content across social and financial channels. The tool, which presents analyst settlement on individual stocks in an ultra clear way, takes a unique algorithm-based approach in analyzing it, aggregating representation to more than 3,700 cell site analysts and 4,500 financial bloggers. 
Turning to our active trader platform, E*TRADE Pro, we made a number of upgrades to further equip retail investors with professional grade tools. The big ticket items include a new options analyzer, which simplifies very complex strategies. In addition to a new streamlined design, the revamped tool enables traders to build multiple option strategies, mounting various strike in 8 scenarios, customize graphing features and more seamlessly than any strategy for trading. 
And our new margin analyzer, which provides greater clarity by way of a new detailed overview of buying power, explaining real-time requirements for each position in the customers portfolio. Lastly, is mobile, which continues to become a more prevalent component of our offering as mobile DARTs were a record 14% of our total DARTs in 2015 and 15% in Q4. Customers seek an experience that rival the desktop in terms of power and depth. And this year, we delivered robust enhancements to further empower customer on the go. 
Some of them were noteworthy features we added this year include, conditional orders to help customers more nimbly seize opportunities based on different market conditions; multi-leg options to execute complex strategies; bespoke mutual fund trading experience that embraces the unique form factor, and several new technologies available on Apple products, including home screen support of iOS, Apple Pay, and of course, our Apple Watch app where we're the only broker among our peers to offer account level data. 
When it comes to the progress of our digital offerings, we received significant third-party recognition this year, including earning 4 out of 5 stars overall in 2015 Broker Review, 3 First Place awards along with 5 best-in-class ratings and stockbrokers.com 2015 review. And for the fourth year running, Equity Edge Online was rated #1 for client satisfaction and loyalty by Group 5.
So in summary, 2015 was a great year for E*TRADE. We're very proud of the accomplish we made, but recognize, there's more to do to drive growth in the metrics and I know we can do better. So as we turn the page to a new year, I'm enthusiastic about the many initiatives we have underway to enhance our offering and grow our franchise, all while keeping focused on continuing to deliver value for shareholders. I am eager to share our progress along the way and I'm confident 2016 will be another great year for E*TRADE. 
And with that, I will turn it over to our CFO, Mr. Pizzi."

For the quarter, we reported earnings of $89 million or $0.30 per share. That compares to $98 million or $0.33 per share in the prior quarter after excluding the impact of the wholesale funding transaction. It also compares to adjusted net income of $78 million or $0.26 per share in the year-ago quarter after excluding early extinguishment of corporate debt. The quarter also included an elevated tax rate of 43% largely related to the impact of our wholesale funding transaction on the full year's pretax income and the associated impact on nondeductible items. 
We expected to return to a more normalized 30% to 40% range in 2016. Revenues were $454 million, up from an adjusted $443 million in the prior quarter, attributable to higher net interest spread, but down from $461 million in the year-ago quarter as a result of lower customer activity. Net interest income of $285 million improved $22 million from the prior quarter, driven by a healthy 30 basis point improvement in spread primarily related to the elimination of expensive wholesale funding, partially offset by a $1 billion lower average balance sheet, again the result of the wholesale elimination. 
Spread for the quarter was 288 basis points, above the high 270s range we discussed in the last call as a result of better marginal yields, coupled with meaningfully slower prepayment fees within our securities portfolio. As for 2016 spread, holding the Fed funds rate constant and doing the same for our most erratic variables relative to where they end the year, margin, stock lending and prepayment fees, we expect our spread for the year to be in the 270 to 275 basis point range with Q1 in the high 270s [ph]. I would note that with margin relative to where it ended the year, there is some downside. 
Commissions, fees and service charges and other revenues were $160 million, down $10 million from the prior quarter and down $16 million versus the year-ago quarter, largely attributable to a decline in trading activity relative to both periods. Average commission for trade of $10.66 declined $0.21 from the prior quarter and $0.18 from the year-ago quarter. The sequential decrease was driven by a higher mix of Active Traders and fewer contracts per option trade. The year-over-year decline was also driven by a higher mix of Active Traders. 
Securities gains were $9 million compared with an adjusted $10 million in the prior quarter. For the full year, we expect gains to be in the $30 to $40 million though any given quarter could vary. Expenses for the quarter were $305 million, up $12 million from the prior quarter, influenced by a couple of unique items. First, we had $6 million of executive severance within the restructuring line. Second, we had an $8 million onetime third-party contract charge in the communications line. Excluding those 2 items, expenses were $291 million. 
Looking ahead, we are truly shifting our framework to be more aligned with the revenue environment and that is evident in the investments we are making going forward. These investments are ones that will have a more direct impact on the growth in our business. As for the most significant drivers of the current year's expense guidance, which is predicated on an operating margin of 39%, they are the following: first, the impact of adding talent. We grew headcount in 2015 and we'll have the full year run rate of those additions as well as continue hiring throughout 2016. 
In 2015, many of the hires we made related to foundational enhancements and improvement to project management. In 2016, many of the hires we make will be related to business growth. In conjunction with this, we expect consultant headcounts to decline, which is captured in professional services. Second, we plan to increase our marketing spend in the high single-digit percentage range during the year. We maintained flexibility here and will be mindful of what market conditions warrant. And last, the impact of our reduced FDIC insurance premiums. We had a drop in our assessment rate mid 2015 and will recognize the full benefit of that in 2016. We expect this expense to be approximately $6 million per quarter with a $49.5 billion balance sheet. 
So those are the piece that will impact the full year. More specifically for Q1, we expect operating expenses to be around $310 million, which includes a sequential uptick in marketing spend. That combined with a smaller balance sheet we'll have in Q1 relative to the rest of the year will cause our op margin for the quarter to be below our full-year guidance. And to be clear on our operating margin guidance. The metric is aligned with our -- with that, which we report in our key performance metrics and is the percentage we make on revenue after provision and operating expenses, meeting it excludes corporate expense and other below the line items. We view this metric as an important measure of how we are managing the business. 
Moving on to the loan portfolio. It ended the year at $5 billion, down 6% during the quarter, and down 22% for the full year. The allowance reduced yet again, as we continue to see positive performance relative to our expectations, ending the quarter $353 million, a $23 million decline from the prior quarter. This translated into the benefits to provisions for loan losses of $23 million as net charge-offs were 0. 
With respect to HELOCs, we began 2015 with $600 million of HELOCs scheduled to convert to amortizing payments or mature during the year. We manage through the first significant volume of conversions and maturities, and we now have a sizable sample of converted loan performance to measure against our original expectations. We entered 2016 armed with even more data to forecast the performance of the future conversions and maturities. 
This year, we have about $800 million of our total $2.1 billion of home equity loans, of which $1.7 billion our HELOC scheduled to do so. So here's what I would emphasize on the topic. In the month of HELOC converts from an interest-only to an amortizing payment, we observed a significant increase in the rate of new 30-day delinquencies would ultimately results in the default rate approximately twice that of the non-converting population. 
Translating that into actual loss terms, the 24-month benchmark on non-converting loans has been about 6% while those that have converted are closer to 12%. Furthermore, the charge off occurs approximately 6 to 9 months after the conversion event when the loan reaches 180 days past due consistent with our standard accounting process for mortgage loan charge-offs. 
And finally our loss estimates incorporate our assumption on loans, converting in 2016 are generally at poor credit quality than the average converted loans to date, as national housing values peaked in 2006 when most of them originated, translating to higher CLT and less equities in the properties -- less equity in the properties today. These conversions and their performance are the single largest factor impacting our loss modeling, and while we expect charge-offs to increase in 2016, we are comfortable with our current level of reserves and continue it to expect provision expense for the year to be near 0. 
Moving on to capital. We announced 4 major deployment capital employment actions in 2014 and we are in the midst of executing  on 2 of them, balance sheet growth and share repurchases. On balance sheet growth, we expect to reach our targeted balance sheet size in Q2. 
At that point, our pro forma basis, we would be left with about $7 [ph] billion of off balance sheet deposits. Before assuming any level of growth in the bus, $2 billion of these deposits could be brought on the balance sheet at our direction. So taking this into account, and again, before assuming any level of customer cash growth, we have the ability to cross $50 billion organically.
To expand on Paul's comments regarding the work underway to size the impact of expenses across $50 billion in assets. First, we would have the upfront nonrecurring expenses to implement the qualitative requirements associated with crossing the threshold. More specifically, those are tied to requirement scripted under Dodd Frank, namely CCAR, the liquidity coverage ratio and resolution plan. Within the rough initial estimate of $50 million, we are still -- we're doing much work to determine what the final number will be and what portion of that would actually flow through the P&L versus how much will be capitalized. This does not include any additional FDIC costs, which would be incurred at a rate relatively aligned with our cost today. 
With respect to the $15 million estimate of recurring annual expenses that would be predominantly associated with additional headcount in various legal compliance and financial roles. But while the work -- while we work through these calculations, it is important to note that we will only cross the $50 billion threshold, if doing so presents compelling returns. Lastly, with respect to corporate cash. We ended the quarter with $447 million, up $15 million from the prior quarter as a $50 million dividend for each of our securities were offset by these $15 million repurchased shares. 
As a reminder, we intend to resume quarterly dividends from the Bank to the parent in Q1, and in light of our reduced Tier 1 leverage threshold to 8% at the bank this quarter, we intend to request dividends in excess of its $97 million of Q4 net income. 
And with that, operator, we will open the call for questions."

As always, it is a pleasure to share my thoughts with you. Later, Mr. Pizzi will dissect the quarter. But first, I'd like to spend some time reflecting on what has been, by all accounts, a banner year at E*TRADE.
An adjusted net income of $340 million or $1.17 per share represents the company's strongest financial performance in nearly a decade and is the product of exceptional efforts by our colleagues across the organization. We've come so far as a company to bolster our financial and competitive positions and in the hall of accomplishments, 2015 display case houses some of our most celebrated and hard earned trophies.
During the year, our risk profile exhibited a step function improvement as the continued reduction on legacy assets was marked by 2 consecutive quarters of lowering reserves, while our demonstration of enhanced enterprise risk controls, among other things, helped solidify our regulatory standing. We embarked upon 4 major capital deployment actions emblematic of our improved position and greater flexibility. And most importantly, we focused on the customer experience, bringing several digital enhancements and offerings to market while further sharpening our focus through the discontinuation of noncore businesses.
Let's start with our financial position. Faced with tremendous opportunity, my colleagues rose to the challenge, exceeding even our own demanding expectations. To provide a highlight reel of our triumphs, we kicked off 2015 announcing regulatory approval to reduce our bank's Tier 1 leverage ratio by 50 basis points to a level of 9%; reduced and refinanced our corporate debt to our target level of $1 billion at a blended average coupon of 5%, the lowest in company history; simplified our operating structure by extracting our broker-dealer subsidiaries from the bank, which now serves as a more efficient source of capital for the parent; distributed more than $800 million of excess capital to the parent; terminated costly legacy funding sources from our balance sheet, markedly improving its profile of returns while creating capacity to fuel growth with core customer deposits and began a process of growing the balance sheet to a target of circa $49.5 billion; put in place and began executing on an $800 million share repurchase program; and finally, announced yet another approval to reduce our targeted bank leverage ratio in early 2016, this time by 100 basis points to 8%, a full year ahead of expectations. Our accomplishments numbered large and were significant in scope, and we ended the year in a bountifully stronger position than we began it and frankly, better and stronger than the company has been in more than a decade.
Notably, our progress resulting position were recognized by our regulators and rating agencies across a few dimensions. First, the MOUs at both the bank and parent were lifted early in the year. Next, reflective of our much improved risk profile and regulatory standing, our FDIC insurance rates were cut by more than half. And finally, we received investment-grade credit ratings for the first time in company history, following 7 notches of cumulative upgrades from our 2 covering agencies during the year with a BBB designation from S&P in August and Moody's following suit in the December.
While it is more than a pleasure to look back on these achievements, make no mistake that we are acutely focused on what is next, marked by our unwavering commitment to be faithful stewards of shareholder capital. To that end, we are currently in the midst of executing 2 important initiatives. First, we are steadily marching towards our target balance sheet size of $49.5 billion, which we expect to achieve in the second quarter. Second, we are actively executing on our $800 million share repurchase program announced in November. Through year-end, we repurchased 50 million and at January to date, we have put another $26 million to work. Meanwhile, we continue to evaluate other possibilities for capital deployment.
Beyond making prudent investments in the business, chief among these possibilities are potential acquisitions. I mentioned that we think of these in 3 broad categories, of which 2 continue to rise to the top of the list. Those are scale acquisitions in the brokerage business and opportunities to better capitalize on our customer deposits through banking.
On the brokerage side, we have superior platforms and systems in place, and utilizing the scale inherent therein is attractive. On banking, we see value in optimizing our low-cost stable deposits through a more traditional approach. While an abundance of small and medium-size opportunities exist in these areas, we are staying highly objective with an eye on delivering compelling returns on capital, ensuring our customers will be well served and remaining close to our digital ethos. As we examine specific opportunities, management and our board pass each through a robust filter, ensuring our heightened standards for risk, our demonstrated commitment to creating value for shareholders and our regulatory standing are at the forefront of any decisions. 
Irrespective of acquisitions, as we think about both growth and capital deployment, we have started to work on sizing the implications of exceeding $50 billion in assets. While I remain hopeful that logic rears its noble head and that certain regulations might change, we take a more pragmatic approach to managing our business.
Accordingly, I charged Mr. Pizzi and team with understanding all elements of crossing this threshold, from systems to reporting to personnel and most relevant for your purposes, cost. While there's still a lot of analysis to do and the numbers will be refined, initial estimates suggest about $50 million over 2 years related to getting in shape with an additional recurring component of approximately $15 million annually. Keep in mind that not all of these costs, specifically those related to the initial build out, would have immediate P&L impact. Mr. Pizzi will cover more on that later.
These costs are certainly not insignificant, and as we noted on numerous occasions, tiptoeing over the $50 billion line won't benefit our owners, particularly in the current rate environment. However, with costs and benefits more clearly defined, we will be able to make an informed decision considering rates, growth and return on capital. So we are spending a healthy amount of time working through this exercise. For the avoidance of any doubt, our intent for the foreseeable future is to manage our balance sheet to our stated target and that cross into the nifty land of 50.
While on the top of expenses, the team has completed the budgeting work for 2016, and I would like to give some color on how we are thinking about spend going forward. We have made a lot of important investments in the business over the past few years, in particular, fortifying the company's risk and control framework in line with our enhanced expectations; bolstering our foundation through improvements to systems and infrastructure; and finally, upgrading talent. With much of the foundational work complete, we have really just begun to shift our dollars to chip away at delivering enhancements truly geared towards improving our competitive position.
Today, with this more rational expense structure, we are transitioning the way we think and talk about overall spending to be more directly in line with the revenue environment, meaning operating margin. On this measure, for 2016, we expect it to be 39%. There's substantial upside in a more normalized rate environment where our target should move to the mid-40s range. While Mr. Pizzi will share additional thoughts on expenses in the coming quarter, I wanted to accentuate our revamped approach on the matter.
Turning to our business metrics. Customer activity rates slowed amidst global and macroeconomic uncertainty during the year with DARTs of 155,000, down 8% from 2014. Q4 continued to trend in moderation as DARTs of 147,000 were down 6% from the third quarter. Options during the quarter were stable at 24% of total DARTs, consistent with our full year mix. In January to date, we've seen an uptick in training activity amidst volatile markets and in line with seasonal patterns. Through yesterday, DARTs are tracking up 26% from December.
Despite uncertainty in the markets, our customers showed confidence when they acted as they were net buyers of $6.8 billion of securities during the year and maintained relatively healthy margin balances throughout, ending the year at $7.4 billion. For the quarter, margin balances averaged $7.5 billion, down from $8 billion last quarter. Recently, we've seen a decline to about $7 billion. Despite the macroeconomic morass, our core franchise also continued its steady growth, adding 13,000 net new brokerage accounts during the fourth quarter, bringing the full year total to 96,000 after we adjust for unique items.
Our adjusted attrition rate for the quarter of 8.2% improved from 9.3% in the prior quarter. That brings our full year adjusted attrition rate to 8.9% in line with 2014 in a range that we think is healthy given our business model. We brought in $2.8 billion of net new brokerage assets during the quarter, which was up from $2.1 billion in the third quarter and brings our full year total to $9.3 billion, representing a 3.8% growth rate. Importantly, approximately 1/3 of those net new assets were flows into retirement accounts.
Retirement investing and savings continue to represent a key component of our future growth. Both our challenge and our opportunity is to better engage our customers to broaden their awareness and showcase our capabilities as a provider of investment solutions for both the near- and long-term focus. We ended the year with $48 billion of retirement assets with our 880,000 retirement accounts, both of which increased modestly during the year. We also have $3.2 billion of assets in managed accounts, which we think complements this component of our business quite nicely.
Another tremendous area of opportunity for us is our Stock Plan Administration business. We continue to invest in this business during the year and completed the transition of clients onto our award-winning Equity Edge Online platform. During the year, we added 144,000 net new accounts in this business and ended the year with 1.4 million planned participants.
Turning to the enhancements we've made to our digital storefront and core platforms. Leading with etrade.com, we launched a new welcome page for prospective customers to better deliver our value proposition the moment a window shopper steps into the store. While it is in the early days, we have seen an improvement in the funding rate for new accounts directed to this page, which is up over 2.5 percentage points compared to our prior experience.
Once in the door, all customers were met with several overhauled sections of our site, including a revamped account overview page; our new retirement center, which provides a simpler interface and inviting content to help customers engage, take charge and keep their goals on track; our new tax center, which brings more efficiency and ease to a process that is notoriously stressful and convoluted.
And finally, this morning we announced the introduction of TipRanks to our platform. In listening to customers, we heard a strong need for help navigating the scores of public content across social and financial channels. The tool, which presents analysts' sentiment on individual stocks in an ultra clear way, takes a unique algorithm-based approach to analyzing and aggregating recommendations from more than 3,700 sell-side analysts and 4,500 financial bloggers.
Turning to our active trader platform, E*TRADE Pro, we made a number of upgrades to further equip retail investors with professional-grade tools. The big ticket items include a new options analyzer, which simplifies very complex strategies. In addition to a new streamlined design, the revamped tool enables traders to build multiple option strategies, run through various strike and date scenarios, customize graphing features and more seamlessly submit any strategy for trading; and our new margin analyzer, which provides greater clarity by way of a new detailed overview of buying power, explaining real-time requirements for each position in the customer's portfolio.
Lastly, is mobile, which continues to become a more prevalent component of our offering as mobile DARTs were a record 14% of total DARTs in 2015 and 15% in Q4. Customers seek an experience that rival the desktop in terms of power and depth and this year, we delivered robust enhancements to further empower customers on the go. Some of the more noteworthy features we added this year include conditional orders to help customers more nimbly seize opportunities based on different market conditions; multi-leg options to execute complex strategies; a bespoke mutual fund trading experience in mobile that embraces the unique form factor; and several new technologies available on Apple products, including home screen support on iOS, Apple Pay and of course, our Apple Watch app where we're the only broker among our peers to offer account level data.
When it comes to the prowess of our digital offerings, we received significant third-party recognition this year, including earning 4 out of 5 stars overall in Barron's 2015 Broker Review; 3 first place awards along with 5 best-in-class ratings in StockBrokers.com 2015 review; and for the fourth year running, Equity Edge Online was rated #1 for client satisfaction and loyalty by Group Five.
So in summary, 2015 was a great year for E*TRADE. We're very proud of the accomplish we made, but recognize there's more to do to drive growth in the metrics and I know we can do better. So as we turn the page to a new year, I'm enthusiastic about the many initiatives we have underway to enhance our offering and grow our franchise, all while keeping focused on continuing to deliver value for shareholders. I am eager to share our progress along the way, and I'm confident 2016 will be another great year for E*TRADE.
And with that, I will turn it over to our impavid CFO, Mr. Pizzi."

For the quarter, we reported earnings of $89 million or $0.30 per share. That compares to $98 million or $0.33 per share in the prior quarter after excluding the impact of the wholesale funding transaction. It also compares to adjusted net income of $78 million or $0.26 per share in the year-ago quarter after excluding early extinguishment of corporate debt. The quarter also included an elevated tax rate of 43% largely related to the impact of our wholesale funding transaction on the full year's pretax income and the associated impact on nondeductible items. We expect it to return to more normalized 30% to 40% range in 2016.
Revenues were $454 million, up from an adjusted $443 million in the prior quarter attributable to higher net interest spread, but down from $461 million in the year-ago quarter as a result of lower customer activity. Net interest income of $285 million improved $22 million from the prior quarter driven by a healthy 30 basis point improvement in spread primarily related to the elimination of expensive wholesale funding, partially offset by a $1 billion lower average balance sheet, again, the result of the wholesale elimination.
Spread for the quarter was 288 basis points, above the high 270s range we discussed on the last call as a result of better margin loan yields coupled with meaningfully slower prepayment fees within our securities portfolio. As for 2016 spread, holding the fed funds rate constant and doing the same for our most erratic variables relative to where they ended the year, margin, stock lending and prepayment fees, we expect our spread for the year to be in the 270 to 275 basis point range with Q1 in the high 270s. I would note that with margin relative to where it ended the year, there is some downside.
Commissions, fees and service charges and other revenues were $160 million, down $10 million from the prior quarter and down $16 million versus the year-ago quarter largely attributable to a decline in trading activity relative to both periods. Average commission for trade of $10.66 declined $0.21 from the prior quarter and $0.18 from the year-ago quarter. The sequential decrease was driven by a higher mix of Active Traders and fewer contracts per option trade. The year-over-year decline was also driven by a higher mix of Active Traders.
Securities gains were $9 million compared with an adjusted $10 million in the prior quarter. For the full year, we expect gains to be in the $30 million to $40 million range though any given quarter could vary.
Expenses for the quarter were $305 million, up $12 million from the prior quarter influenced by a couple of unique items. First, we had $6 million of executive severance within the restructuring line. Second, we had an $8 million onetime third-party contract charge in the communications line. Excluding those 2 items, expenses were $291 million.
Looking ahead, we are truly shifting our framework to be more aligned with the revenue environment, and that is evident in the investments we are making going forward. These investments are ones that will have more direct impact on the growth in our business.
As for the most significant drivers of the current year's expense guidance, which is predicated on an operating margin of 39%, they are the following. First, the impact of adding talent. We grew headcount in 2015, and we'll have the full year run rate of those additions as well as continued hiring throughout 2016. In 2015, many of the hires we made related to foundational enhancements and improvements to project management. In 2016, many of the hires we make will be related to business growth. In conjunction with this, we expect consultant headcount to decline, which is captured in professional services.
Second, we plan to increase our marketing spend in the high single-digit percentage range during the year. We maintained flexibility here and will be mindful of what market conditions warrant.
And last, the impact of our reduced FDIC insurance premiums. We had a drop in our assessment rate mid 2015, and we'll recognize the full benefit of that in 2016. We expect this expense to be approximately $6 million per quarter with a $49.5 billion balance sheet.
So those are the pieces that will impact the full year. More specifically for Q1, we expect operating expenses to be around $310 million, which includes a sequential uptick in marketing spend. That, combined with a smaller balance sheet we'll have in Q1 relative to the rest of the year, will cause our op margin for the quarter to be below our full year guidance. And to be clear on our operating margin guidance. The metric is aligned with our -- with that which we report in our key performance metrics and is the percentage we make on revenue after provision and operating expenses, meaning it excludes corporate interest expense and other below-the-line items. We view this metric as an important measure of how we are managing the business.
Moving on to the loan portfolio. It ended the year at $5 billion, down 6% during the quarter and down 22% for the full year. The allowance reduced yet again as we continue to see positive performance relative to our expectations, ending the quarter at $353 million, a $23 million decline from the prior quarter. This translated into a benefit to provision for loan losses of $23 million as net charge-offs were 0.
With respect to HELOCs, we began 2015 with $600 million of HELOCs scheduled to convert to amortizing payments or mature during the year. We managed through the first significant volume of conversions and maturities, and we now have a sizable sample of converted loan performance to measure against our original expectations. We entered 2016 armed with even more data to forecast the performance of the future conversions and maturities. This year we have about $800 million of our total $2.1 billion of home equity loans, of which $1.7 billion are HELOCs scheduled to do so.
So here's what I would emphasize on the topic. In the month a HELOC converts from an interest-only to an amortizing payment, we observe a significant increase in the rate of new 30-day delinquencies, which ultimately result in a default rate approximately twice that of the nonconverting population. Translating that into actual loss terms, the 24-month benchmark default rate on nonconverting loans has been about 6%, while those that have converted are closer to 12%. Furthermore, the charge-off occurs approximately 6 to 9 months after the conversion event when the loan reaches 180 days past due consistent with our standard accounting process for mortgage loan charge-offs.
And finally, our loss estimates incorporate our assumption on loans converting in 2016 are generally of poor credit quality than the average converted loans to date as national housing values peaked in 2006 when most of them were originated, translating to higher CLTVs and less equities in the -- less equity in the properties today. These conversions and their performance are the single largest factor impacting our loss modeling. And while we expect charge-offs to increase in 2016, we are comfortable with our current level of reserves and continue to expect provision expense for the year to be near 0.
Moving on to capital. We announced 4 major capital deployment actions in 2014, and we are in the midst of executing on 2 of them: balance sheet growth and share repurchases.
On balance sheet growth, we expect to reach our targeted balance sheet size in Q2. At that point, on a pro forma basis, we would be left with about $7 billion of off-balance sheet deposits. Before assuming any level of growth in the business, $2 billion of these deposits could be brought on the balance sheet at our direction. So taking this into account, and again before assuming any level of customer cash growth, we have the ability to cross $50 billion organically.
To expand on Paul's comments regarding the work underway to size the impact of expenses of crossing $50 billion in assets, first, we would have the upfront nonrecurring expenses to implement the qualitative requirements associated with crossing the threshold. More specifically, those are tied to requirements scripted under Dodd-Frank, namely, CCAR, the liquidity coverage ratio and resolution planning.
Within the rough initial estimate of $50 million, we are still -- we're doing much work to determine what the final number will be and what portion of that would actually flow through the P&L versus how much will be capitalized. This does not include any additional FDIC costs, which will be incurred at a rate relatively aligned with our cost today.
With respect to the $15 million estimate of recurring annual expenses, that would be predominantly associated with additional headcount in various legal, compliance and financial roles. But while the work -- while we work through these calculations, it is important to note that we will only cross the $50 billion threshold if doing so presents compelling returns.
Lastly, with respect to corporate cash, we ended the quarter with $447 million, up $15 million from the prior quarter as the $50 million dividend from E*TRADE Securities was offset by the usage of $50 million to repurchase shares. As a reminder, we intend to resume quarterly dividends from the bank to the parent in Q1. And in light of our reduced Tier 1 leverage threshold to 8% at the bank this quarter, we intend to request dividends in excess of its $97 million of Q4 net income.
And with that, operator, we will open the call for questions."

Continuing -- if you look at our customer cash balances over time and the trends, you'll see that over time that they have been growing. So we would expect that number to grow with our business as we grow accounts and grow customers. The $2 billion you have there, think about what we give as our reinvestment rate of essentially 175 basis points or so. You can use that to estimate the revenue that's available on that $2 billion. When we think of returns, we're not really just talking about dollar return or margin, but we have to put equity against that balance sheet. So what we're really talking about is a compelling ROE to grow the balance sheet through 50, taking into account those costs."

As always, it is a pleasure to share my thoughts with you. Later, Mr. Pizzi will dissect the quarter. But first, I'd like to spend some time reflecting on what has been, by all accounts, a banner year at E*TRADE.
An adjusted net income of $340 million or $1.17 per share represents the company's strongest financial performance in nearly a decade and is the product of exceptional efforts by our colleagues across the organization. We've come so far as a company to bolster our financial and competitive positions, and in the hall of accomplishments, the 2015 display case houses some of our most celebrated and hard-earned trophies.
During the year, our risk profile exhibited a step function improvement as the continued reduction on legacy assets was marked by 2 consecutive quarters of lowering reserves while our demonstration of enhanced enterprise risk controls, among other things, helped solidify our regulatory standing. We embarked upon 4 major capital deployment actions emblematic of our improved position and greater flexibility. And most importantly, we focused on the customer experience, bringing several digital enhancements and offerings to market while further sharpening our focus through the discontinuation of noncore businesses.
Let's start with our financial position. Faced with tremendous opportunity, my colleagues rose to the challenge, exceeding even our own demanding expectations. To provide a highlight reel of our triumphs, we kicked off 2015 announcing regulatory approval to reduce our bank's Tier 1 leverage ratio by 50 basis points to a level of 9%; reduced and refinanced our corporate debt to our target level of $1 billion at a blended average coupon of 5%, the lowest in company history; simplified our operating structure by extracting our broker-dealer subsidiaries from the bank, which now serve as a more efficient source of capital for the parent; distributed more than $800 million of excess capital to the parent; terminated costly legacy funding sources from our balance sheet, markedly improving its profile on returns while creating capacity to fuel growth with core customer deposits; and began a process of growing the balance sheet to a target of circa $49.5 billion; put in place and began executing on an $800 million share repurchase program; and finally, announced yet another approval to reduce our targeted bank leverage ratio in early 2016, this time by 100 basis points to 8%, a full year ahead of expectations; our accomplishments numbered large and were significant in scope, and we ended the year in a bountifully stronger position than we began it and, frankly, better and stronger than the company has been in more than a decade.
Notably, our progress and resulting position were recognized by our regulators and rating agencies across a few dimensions. First, the MOUs at both the bank and parent were lifted early in the year. Next, reflective of our much-improved risk profile and regulatory standing, our FDIC insurance rates were cut by more than half. And finally, we received investment-grade credit ratings for the first time in company history following 7 notches of cumulative upgrades from our 2 covering agencies during the year with a BBB designation from S&P in August and Moody's following suit in December.
While it is more than a pleasure to look back on these achievements, make no mistake that we are acutely focused on what is next, marked by our unwavering commitment to be faithful stewards of shareholder capital. To that end, we are currently in the midst of executing 2 important initiatives. First, we are steadily marching towards our target balance sheet size of $49.5 billion, which we expect to achieve in the second quarter. Second, we are actively executing on our $800 million share repurchase program announced in November. Through year-end, we repurchased 50 million and in January to-date, we have put another $26 million to work. Meanwhile, we continue to evaluate other possibilities for capital deployment.
Beyond making prudent investments in the business, chief among these possibilities are potential acquisitions. I've mentioned that we think of these in 3 broad categories, of which 2 continue to rise to the top of the list. Those are scale acquisitions in the brokerage business and opportunities to better capitalize on our customer deposits through banking.
On the brokerage side, we have superior platforms and systems in place, and utilizing the scale inherent therein is attractive. On banking, we see value in optimizing our low-cost stable deposits through a more traditional approach. While an abundance of small and medium-size opportunities exist in these areas, we are staying highly objective with an eye on delivering compelling returns on capital, ensuring our customers will be well served and remaining close to our digital ethos. As we examine specific opportunities, management and our board pass each through a robust filter, ensuring our heightened standards for risk, our demonstrated commitment to creating value for shareholders and our regulatory standing are at the forefront of any decisions. 
Irrespective of acquisitions, as we think about both growth and capital deployment, we have started to work on sizing the implications of exceeding $50 billion in assets. While I remain hopeful that logic rears its noble head and that certain regulations might change, we take a more pragmatic approach to managing our business.
Accordingly, I charge Mr. Pizzi and team with understanding all elements of crossing this threshold, from systems to reporting to personnel and, most relevant for your purposes, cost. While there's still a lot of analysis to do and the numbers will be refined, initial estimates suggest about $50 million over 2 years related to getting in shape with an additional recurring component of approximately $15 million annually. Keep in mind that not all of these costs, specifically those related to the initial buildout, would have immediate P&L impact. Mr. Pizzi will cover more on that later.
These costs are certainly not insignificant, and as we noted on numerous occasions, tiptoeing over the $50 billion line won't benefit our owners, particularly in the current rate environment. However, with costs and benefits more clearly defined, we will be able to make an informed decision considering rates, growth and return on capital. So we are spending a healthy amount of time working through this exercise. For the avoidance of any doubt, our intent for the foreseeable future is to manage our balance sheet to our stated target and that cross into the nifty land of 50.
While on the top of expenses, the team has completed the budgeting work for 2016, and I'd like to give some color on how we are thinking about spend going forward. We have made a lot of important investments in the business over the past few years, in particular, fortifying the company's risk and control framework in line with our enhanced expectations; bolstering our foundation through improvements to systems and infrastructure; and finally, upgrading talent. With much of the foundational work complete, we have really just begun to shift our dollars to chip away at delivering enhancements truly geared towards improving our competitive position.
Today, with this more rational expense structure, we are transitioning the way we think and talk about overall spending to be more directly in line with the revenue environment, meaning operating margin. On this measure, for 2016, we expect it to be 39%. There's substantial upside in a more normalized rate environment where our target should move to the mid-40s range. While Mr. Pizzi will share additional thoughts on expenses in the coming quarter, I wanted to accentuate our revamped approach on the matter.
Turning to our business metrics. Customer activity rates slowed amidst global and macroeconomic uncertainty during the year with DARTs of 155,000, down 8% from 2014. Q4 continued the trend of moderation as DARTs of 147,000 were down 6% from the third quarter. Options during the quarter were stable at 24% of total DARTs, consistent with our full year mix. In January to-date, we've seen uptick in trading activity amidst volatile markets and in line with seasonal patterns. Through yesterday, DARTs are tracking up 26% from December.
Despite uncertainty in the markets, our customers showed confidence when they acted as they were net buyers of $6.8 billion of securities during the year and maintained relatively healthy margin balances throughout, ending the year at $7.4 billion. For the quarter, margin balances averaged $7.5 billion, down from $8 billion last quarter. Recently, we've seen a decline to about $7 billion. Despite the macroeconomic morass, our core franchise also continued its steady growth, adding 13,000 net new brokerage accounts during the fourth quarter, bringing the full year total to 96,000 after we adjust for unique items.
Our adjusted attrition rate for the quarter of 8.2% improved from 9.3% in the prior quarter. That brings our full year adjusted attrition rate to 8.9% in line with 2014 in a range that we think is healthy given our business model. We brought in $2.8 billion of net new brokerage assets during the quarter, which was up from $2.1 billion in the third quarter and brings our full year total to $9.3 billion, representing a 3.8% growth rate. Importantly, approximately 1/3 of those net new assets were flows into retirement accounts.
Retirement investing and savings continue to represent a key component of our future growth. Both our challenge and our opportunity is to better engage our customers to broaden their awareness and showcase our capabilities as a provider of investment solutions for both the near- and long-term focus. We ended the year with $48 billion of retirement assets with our 880,000 retirement accounts, both of which increased modestly during the year. We also have $3.2 billion of assets in managed accounts, which we think complements this component of our business quite nicely.
Another tremendous area of opportunity for us is our Stock Plan Administration business. We continue to invest in this business during the year and completed the transition of clients onto our award-winning Equity Edge Online platform. During the year, we added 144,000 net new accounts in this business and ended the year with 1.4 million planned participants.
Turning to the enhancements we've made to our digital storefront and core platforms. Leading with etrade.com, we launched a new welcome page for prospective customers to better deliver our value proposition the moment a window shopper steps into the store. While it is in early days, we have seen an improvement in the funding rate for new accounts directed to this page, which is up over 2.5 percentage points compared to our prior experience.
Once in the door, all customers were met with several overhauled sections of our site, including a revamped account overview page; our new retirement center, which provides a simpler interface and inviting content to help customers engage, take charge and keep their goals on track; our new tax center, which brings more efficiency and ease to a process that is notoriously stressful and convoluted; and finally, this morning we announced the introduction of TipRanks to our platform. In listening to customers, we heard a strong need for help navigating the scores of public content across social and financial channels. The tool, which presents analysts' sentiment on individual stocks in an ultra clear way, takes a unique algorithm-based approach to analyzing and aggregating recommendations from more than 3,700 sell-side analysts and 4,500 financial bloggers.
Turning to our active trader platform, E*TRADE Pro, we made a number of upgrades to further equip retail investors with professional-grade tools. The big-ticket items include a new options analyzer, which simplifies very complex strategies. In addition to a new streamlined design, the revamped tool enables traders to build multiple option strategies, run through various strike and date scenarios, customize graphing features, and more seamlessly submit any strategy for trading; and our new margin analyzer, which provides greater clarity by way of a new detailed overview of buying power, explaining realtime requirements for each position in the customer's portfolio.
Lastly, is mobile, which continues to become a more prevalent component of our offering as mobile DARTs were a record 14% of total DARTs in 2015 and 15% in Q4. Customers seek an experience that rivals the desktop in terms of power and depth, and this year, we delivered robust enhancements to further empower customers on the go. Some of the more noteworthy features we added this year include conditional orders to help customers more nimbly seize opportunities based on different market conditions; multi-leg options to execute complex strategies; a bespoke mutual fund trading experience in mobile that embraces the unique form factor; and several new technologies available on Apple products, including home screen support on iOS, Apple Pay and of course, our Apple Watch app where we're the only broker among our peers to offer account-level data.
When it comes to the prowess of our digital offerings, we received significant third-party recognition this year, including earning 4 out of 5 stars overall in Barron's 2015 broker review; 3 first-place awards along with 5 best-in-class ratings in StockBrokers.com 2015 review; and for the fourth year running, Equity Edge Online was rated #1 for client satisfaction and loyalty by Group Five.
So in summary, 2015 was a great year for E*TRADE. We're very proud of the accomplish [ph] we made, but recognize there's more to do to drive growth in the metrics, and I know we can do better. So as we turn the page to a new year, I'm enthusiastic about the many initiatives we have underway to enhance our offering and grow our franchise, all while keeping focused on continuing to deliver value for shareholders. I am eager to share our progress along the way, and I'm confident 2016 will be another great year for E*TRADE.
And with that, I will turn it over to our impavid CFO, Mr. Pizzi."

For the quarter, we reported earnings of $89 million or $0.30 per share. That compares to $98 million or $0.33 per share in the prior quarter after excluding the impact of the wholesale funding transaction. It also compares to adjusted net income of $78 million or $0.26 per share in the year-ago quarter after excluding early extinguishment of corporate debt. The quarter also included an elevated tax rate of 43% largely related to the impact of our wholesale funding transaction on the full year's pretax income and the associated impact on nondeductible items. We expect it to return to a more normalized 38% to 40% range in 2016.
Revenues were $454 million, up from an adjusted $443 million in the prior quarter attributable to higher net interest spread but down from $461 million in the year-ago quarter as a result of lower customer activity. Net interest income of $285 million improved $22 million from the prior quarter driven by a healthy 30 basis point improvement in spread primarily related to the elimination of expensive wholesale funding, partially offset by a $1 billion lower average balance sheet, again, the result of the wholesale elimination.
Spread for the quarter was 288 basis points, above the high 270s range we discussed on the last call as a result of better margin loan yields coupled with meaningfully slower prepayment speeds within our securities portfolio. As for 2016 spread, holding the fed funds rate constant and doing the same for our most erratic variables relative to where they ended the year, margin, stock lending and prepayment speeds, we expect our spread for the year to be in the 270 to 275 basis point range with Q1 in the high 270s. I would note that with margin relative to where it ended the year, there is some downside.
Commissions, fees and service charges and other revenues were $160 million, down $10 million from the prior quarter and down $16 million versus the year-ago quarter largely attributable to a decline in trading activity relative to both periods. Average commission per trade of $10.66 declined $0.21 from the prior quarter and $0.18 from the year-ago quarter. The sequential decrease was driven by a higher mix of Active Traders and fewer contracts per option trade. The year-over-year decline was also driven by a higher mix of Active Traders.
Securities gains were $9 million compared with an adjusted $10 million in the prior quarter. For the full year, we expect gains to be in the $30 million to $40 million range, though any given quarter could vary.
Expenses for the quarter were $305 million, up $12 million from the prior quarter, influenced by a couple of unique items. First, we had $6 million of executive severance within the restructuring line. Second, we had an $8 million onetime third-party contract charge in the communications line. Excluding those 2 items, expenses were $291 million.
Looking ahead, we are truly shifting our framework to be more aligned with the revenue environment, and that is evident in the investments we are making going forward. These investments are ones that will have more direct impact on the growth in our business.
As for the most significant drivers of the current year's expense guidance, which is predicated on an operating margin of 39%, they are the following. First, the impact of adding talent. We grew headcount in 2015, and we'll have the full year run rate of those additions as well as continued hiring throughout 2016. In 2015, many of the hires we made related to foundational enhancements and improvements to project management. In 2016, many of the hires we make will be related to business growth. In conjunction with this, we expect consultant headcount to decline, which is captured in professional services.
Second, we plan to increase our marketing spend in the high single-digit percentage range during the year. We maintained flexibility here and will be mindful of what market conditions warrant.
And last, the impact of our reduced FDIC insurance premiums. We had a drop in our assessment rate mid 2015, and we'll recognize the full benefit of that in 2016. We expect this expense to be approximately $6 million per quarter with a $49.5 billion balance sheet.
So those are the pieces that will impact the full year. More specifically for Q1, we expect operating expenses to be around $310 million, which includes a sequential uptick in marketing spend. That, combined with a smaller balance sheet we'll have in Q1 relative to the rest of the year, will cause our op margin for the quarter to be below our full year guidance. And to be clear on our operating margin guidance. The metric is aligned with our -- with that which we report in our key performance metrics and is the percentage we make on revenue after provision and operating expenses, meaning it excludes corporate interest expense and other below-the-line items. We view this metric as an important measure of how we are managing the business.
Moving on to the loan portfolio. It ended the year at $5 billion, down 6% during the quarter and down 22% for the full year. The allowance reduced yet again as we continue to see positive performance relative to our expectations, ending the quarter at $353 million, a $23 million decline from the prior quarter. This translated into a benefit to provision for loan losses of $23 million as net charge-offs were 0.
With respect to HELOCs, we began 2015 with $600 million of HELOCs scheduled to convert to amortizing payments or mature during the year. We managed through the first significant volume of conversions and maturities, and we now have a sizable sample of converted loan performance to measure against our original expectations. We enter 2016 armed with even more data to forecast the performance of the future conversions and maturities. This year, we have about $800 million of our total $2.1 billion of home equity loans, of which $1.7 billion are HELOCs scheduled to do so.
So here's what I would emphasize on the topic. In the month a HELOC converts from an interest-only to an amortizing payment, we observe a significant increase in the rate of new 30-day delinquencies, which ultimately result in a default rate approximately twice that of the nonconverting population. Translating that into actual loss terms, the 24-month benchmark default rate on nonconverting loans has been about 6%, while those that have converted are closer to 12%. Furthermore, the charge-off occurs approximately 6 to 9 months after the conversion event when the loan reaches 180 days past due consistent with our standard accounting process for mortgage loan charge-offs.
And finally, our loss estimates incorporate our assumption on loans converting in 2016 are generally of poor credit quality than the average converted loans to-date as national housing values peaked in 2006 when most of them were originated, translating to higher CLTVs and less equities in the -- less equity in the properties today. These conversions and their performance are the single largest factor impacting our loss modeling. And while we expect charge-offs to increase in 2016, we are comfortable with our current level of reserves and continue to expect provision expense for the year to be near 0.
Moving on to capital. We announced 4 major capital deployment actions in 2015, and we are in the midst of executing on 2 of them: balance sheet growth and share repurchases.
On balance sheet growth, we expect to reach our targeted balance sheet size in Q2. At that point, on a pro forma basis, we would be left with about $7 billion of off-balance sheet deposits. Before assuming any level of growth in the business, $2 billion of these deposits could be brought on the balance sheet at our direction. So taking this into account, and again before assuming any level of customer cash growth, we have the ability to cross $50 billion organically.
To expand on Paul's comments regarding the work underway to size the impact of expenses of crossing $50 billion in assets, first, we would have the upfront nonrecurring expenses to implement the qualitative requirements associated with crossing the threshold. More specifically, those are tied to requirements scripted under Dodd-Frank, namely, CCAR, the liquidity coverage ratio and resolution planning.
Within the rough initial estimate of $50 million, we are still -- we're doing much work to determine what the final number will be and what portion of that would actually flow to the P&L versus how much will be capitalized. This does not include any additional FDIC costs, which would be incurred at a rate relatively aligned with our costs today.
With respect to the $15 million estimate of recurring annual expenses, that would be predominantly associated with additional headcount in various legal, compliance and financial roles. But while the work -- while we work through these calculations, it is important to note that we will only cross the $50 billion threshold if doing so presents compelling returns.
Lastly, with respect to corporate cash, we ended the quarter with $447 million, up $15 million from the prior quarter as the $50 million dividend from E*TRADE Securities was offset by the usage of $50 million to repurchase shares. As a reminder, we intend to resume quarterly dividends from the bank to the parent in Q1. And in light of our reduced Tier 1 leverage threshold to 8% at the bank this quarter, we intend to request dividends in excess of its $97 million of Q4 net income.
And with that, operator, we will open the call for questions."

So we would expect that number to grow with our business as we grow accounts and grow customers. The $2 billion that you have there, if you think about what we give as our reinvestment rate of essentially 175 basis points or so, you can use that to estimate the revenue that's available on that $2 billion.

So as the music's changed here, we wanted to make sure that we were very clear with the Street with the sell-side, with our investors that we're now in a different spot, and we can't entertain these things. As we said today, 2 of those 3 categories have emerged as having more potential attractive opportunities, and I say potential. One is certainly trying to find ways to add scale in the brokerage business because the operating leverage is so attractive. The second is in banking, finding a way to monetize the value of our customer deposits to a greater degree than we do today, and that would imply acquiring an institution that has strong capabilities in traditional intermediary activities."

An adjusted net income of $340 million or $1.17 per share represents the company's strongest financial performance in nearly a decade and is the product of exceptional efforts by our colleagues across the organization. We've come so far as a company to bolster our financial and competitive positions, and in the hall of accomplishments, the 2015 display case houses some of our most celebrated and hard-earned trophies.
During the year, our risk profile exhibited a step function improvement as the continued reduction on legacy assets was marked by 2 consecutive quarters of lowering reserves while our demonstration of enhanced enterprise risk controls, among other things, helped solidify our regulatory standing. We embarked upon 4 major capital deployment actions emblematic of our improved position and greater flexibility. And most importantly, we focused on the customer experience, bringing several digital enhancements and offerings to market while further sharpening our focus through the discontinuation of noncore businesses.
Let's start with our financial position. Faced with tremendous opportunity, my colleagues rose to the challenge, exceeding even our own demanding expectations. To provide a highlight reel of our triumphs, we kicked off 2015 announcing regulatory approval to reduce our bank's Tier 1 leverage ratio by 50 basis points to a level of 9%; reduced and refinanced our corporate debt to our target level of $1 billion at a blended average coupon of 5%, the lowest in company history; simplified our operating structure by extracting our broker-dealer subsidiaries from the bank, which now serve as a more efficient source of capital for the parent; distributed more than $800 million of excess capital to the parent; terminated costly legacy funding sources from our balance sheet, markedly improving its profile on returns while creating capacity to fuel growth with core customer deposits; and began a process of growing the balance sheet to a target of circa $49.5 billion; put in place and began executing on an $800 million share repurchase program; and finally, announced yet another approval to reduce our targeted bank leverage ratio in early 2016, this time by 100 basis points to 8%, a full year ahead of expectations; our accomplishments numbered large and were significant in scope, and we ended the year in a bountifully stronger position than we began it and, frankly, better and stronger than the company has been in more than a decade.
Notably, our progress and resulting position were recognized by our regulators and rating agencies across a few dimensions. First, the MOUs at both the bank and parent were lifted early in the year. Next, reflective of our much improved risk profile and regulatory standing, our FDIC insurance rates were cut by more than half. And finally, we received investment-grade credit ratings for the first time in company history following 7 notches of cumulative upgrades from our 2 covering agencies during the year with a BBB designation from S&P in August and Moody's following suit in December.
While it is more than a pleasure to look back on these achievements, make no mistake that we are acutely focused on what is next, marked by our unwavering commitment to be faithful stewards of shareholder capital. To that end, we are currently in the midst of executing 2 important initiatives. First, we are steadily marching towards our target balance sheet size of $49.5 billion, which we expect to achieve in the second quarter. Second, we are actively executing on our $800 million share repurchase program announced in November. Through year-end, we repurchased 50 million and in January to date, we have put another $26 million to work. Meanwhile, we continue to evaluate other possibilities for capital deployment.
Beyond making prudent investments in the business, chief among these possibilities are potential acquisitions. I've mentioned that we think of these in 3 broad categories, of which 2 continue to rise to the top of the list. Those are scale acquisitions in the brokerage business and opportunities to better capitalize on our customer deposits through banking.
On the brokerage side, we have superior platforms and systems in place, and utilizing the scale inherent therein is attractive. On banking, we see value in optimizing our low-cost stable deposits through a more traditional approach. While an abundance of small and medium-size opportunities exist in these areas, we are staying highly objective with an eye on delivering compelling returns on capital, ensuring our customers will be well served and remaining close to our digital ethos. As we examine specific opportunities, management and our board pass each through a robust filter, ensuring our heightened standards for risk, our demonstrated commitment to creating value for shareholders and our regulatory standing are at the forefront of any decisions. 
Irrespective of acquisitions, as we think about both growth and capital deployment, we have started to work on sizing the implications of exceeding $50 billion in assets. While I remain hopeful that logic rears its noble head and that certain regulations might change, we take a more pragmatic approach to managing our business.
Accordingly, I charge Mr. Pizzi and team with understanding all elements of crossing this threshold, from systems to reporting to personnel and, most relevant for your purposes, cost. While there's still a lot of analysis to do and the numbers will be refined, initial estimates suggest about $50 million over 2 years related to getting in shape with an additional recurring component of approximately $15 million annually. Keep in mind that not all of these costs, specifically those related to the initial buildout, would have immediate P&L impact. Mr. Pizzi will cover more on that later.
These costs are certainly not insignificant, and as we noted on numerous occasions, tiptoeing over the $50 billion line won't benefit our owners, particularly in the current rate environment. However, with costs and benefits more clearly defined, we will be able to make an informed decision considering rates, growth and return on capital. So we are spending a healthy amount of time working through this exercise. For the avoidance of any doubt, our intent for the foreseeable future is to manage our balance sheet to our stated target and that cross into the nifty land of 50.
While on the top of expenses, the team has completed the budgeting work for 2016, and I'd like to give some color on how we are thinking about spend going forward. We have made a lot of important investments in the business over the past few years, in particular, fortifying the company's risk and control framework in line with our enhanced expectations; bolstering our foundation through improvements to systems and infrastructure; and finally, upgrading talent. With much of the foundational work complete, we have really just begun to shift our dollars to chip away at delivering enhancements truly geared towards improving our competitive position.
Today, with this more rational expense structure, we are transitioning the way we think and talk about overall spending to be more directly in line with the revenue environment, meaning operating margin. On this measure, for 2016, we expect it to be 39%. There's substantial upside in a more normalized rate environment where our target should move to the mid-40s range. While Mr. Pizzi will share additional thoughts on expenses in the coming quarter, I wanted to accentuate our revamped approach on the matter.
Turning to our business metrics. Customer activity rates slowed amidst global and macroeconomic uncertainty during the year with DARTs of 155,000, down 8% from 2014. Q4 continued the trend of moderation as DARTs of 147,000 were down 6% from the third quarter. Options during the quarter were stable at 24% of total DARTs, consistent with our full year mix. In January to date, we've seen uptick in trading activity amidst volatile markets and in line with seasonal patterns. Through yesterday, DARTs are tracking up 26% from December.
Despite uncertainty in the markets, our customers showed confidence when they acted as they were net buyers of $6.8 billion of securities during the year and maintained relatively healthy margin balances throughout, ending the year at $7.4 billion. For the quarter, margin balances averaged $7.5 billion, down from $8 billion last quarter. Recently, we've seen a decline to about $7 billion. Despite the macroeconomic morass, our core franchise also continued its steady growth, adding 13,000 net new brokerage accounts during the fourth quarter, bringing the full year total to 96,000 after we adjust for unique items.
Our adjusted attrition rate for the quarter of 8.2% improved from 9.3% in the prior quarter. That brings our full year adjusted attrition rate to 8.9% in line with 2014 in a range that we think is healthy given our business model. We brought in $2.8 billion of net new brokerage assets during the quarter, which was up from $2.1 billion in the third quarter and brings our full year total to $9.3 billion, representing a 3.8% growth rate. Importantly, approximately 1/3 of those net new assets were flows into retirement accounts.
Retirement investing and savings continue to represent a key component of our future growth. Both our challenge and our opportunity is to better engage our customers to broaden their awareness and showcase our capabilities as a provider of investment solutions for both the near- and long-term focus. We ended the year with $48 billion of retirement assets with our 880,000 retirement accounts, both of which increased modestly during the year. We also have $3.2 billion of assets in managed accounts, which we think complements this component of our business quite nicely.
Another tremendous area of opportunity for us is our Stock Plan Administration business. We continue to invest in this business during the year and completed the transition of clients onto our award-winning Equity Edge Online platform. During the year, we added 144,000 net new accounts in this business and ended the year with 1.4 million planned participants.
Turning to the enhancements we've made to our digital storefront and core platforms. Leading with etrade.com, we launched a new welcome page for prospective customers to better deliver our value proposition the moment a window shopper steps into the store. While it is in early days, we have seen an improvement in the funding rate for new accounts directed to this page, which is up over 2.5 percentage points compared to our prior experience.
Once in the door, all customers were met with several overhauled sections of our site, including a revamped account overview page; our new retirement center, which provides a simpler interface and inviting content to help customers engage, take charge and keep their goals on track; our new tax center, which brings more efficiency and ease to a process that is notoriously stressful and convoluted; and finally, this morning we announced the introduction of TipRanks to our platform. In listening to customers, we heard a strong need for help navigating the scores of public content across social and financial channels. The tool, which presents analysts' sentiment on individual stocks in an ultra clear way, takes a unique algorithm-based approach to analyzing and aggregating recommendations from more than 3,700 sell-side analysts and 4,500 financial bloggers.
Turning to our active trader platform, E*TRADE Pro, we made a number of upgrades to further equip retail investors with professional-grade tools. The big ticket items include a new options analyzer, which simplifies very complex strategies. In addition to a new streamlined design, the revamped tool enables traders to build multiple option strategies, run through various strike and date scenarios, customize graphing features, and more seamlessly submit any strategy for trading; and our new margin analyzer, which provides greater clarity by way of a new detailed overview of buying power, explaining realtime requirements for each position in the customer's portfolio.
Lastly, is mobile, which continues to become a more prevalent component of our offering as mobile DARTs were a record 14% of total DARTs in 2015 and 15% in Q4. Customers seek an experience that rivals the desktop in terms of power and depth, and this year, we delivered robust enhancements to further empower customers on the go. Some of the more noteworthy features we added this year include conditional orders to help customers more nimbly seize opportunities based on different market conditions; multi-leg options to execute complex strategies; a bespoke mutual fund trading experience in mobile that embraces the unique form factor; and several new technologies available on Apple products, including home screen support on iOS, Apple Pay and of course, our Apple Watch app where we're the only broker among our peers to offer account level data.
When it comes to the prowess of our digital offerings, we received significant third-party recognition this year, including earning 4 out of 5 stars overall in Barron's 2015 broker review; 3 first place awards along with 5 best-in-class ratings in StockBrokers.com 2015 review; and for the fourth year running, Equity Edge Online was rated #1 for client satisfaction and loyalty by Group Five.
So in summary, 2015 was a great year for E*TRADE. We're very proud of the accomplish [ph] we made, but recognize there's more to do to drive growth in the metrics, and I know we can do better. So as we turn the page to a new year, I'm enthusiastic about the many initiatives we have underway to enhance our offering and grow our franchise, all while keeping focused on continuing to deliver value for shareholders. I am eager to share our progress along the way, and I'm confident 2016 will be another great year for E*TRADE.
And with that, I will turn it over to our impavid CFO, Mr. Pizzi."

For the quarter, we reported earnings of $89 million or $0.30 per share. That compares to $98 million or $0.33 per share in the prior quarter after excluding the impact of the wholesale funding transaction. It also compares to adjusted net income of $78 million or $0.26 per share in the year-ago quarter after excluding early extinguishment of corporate debt. The quarter also included an elevated tax rate of 43% largely related to the impact of our wholesale funding transaction on the full year's pretax income and the associated impact on nondeductible items. We expect it to return to a more normalized 38% to 40% range in 2016.
Revenues were $454 million, up from an adjusted $443 million in the prior quarter attributable to higher net interest spread but down from $461 million in the year-ago quarter as a result of lower customer activity. Net interest income of $285 million improved $22 million from the prior quarter driven by a healthy 30 basis point improvement in spread primarily related to the elimination of expensive wholesale funding, partially offset by a $1 billion lower average balance sheet, again, the result of the wholesale elimination.
Spread for the quarter was 288 basis points, above the high 270s range we discussed on the last call as a result of better margin loan yields coupled with meaningfully slower prepayment speeds within our securities portfolio. As for 2016 spread, holding the fed funds rate constant and doing the same for our most erratic variables relative to where they ended the year, margin, stock lending and prepayment speeds, we expect our spread for the year to be in the 270 to 275 basis point range with Q1 in the high 270s. I would note that with margin relative to where it ended the year, there is some downside.
Commissions, fees and service charges and other revenues were $160 million, down $10 million from the prior quarter and down $16 million versus the year-ago quarter largely attributable to a decline in trading activity relative to both periods. Average commission per trade of $10.66 declined $0.21 from the prior quarter and $0.18 from the year-ago quarter. The sequential decrease was driven by a higher mix of Active Traders and fewer contracts per option trade. The year-over-year decline was also driven by a higher mix of Active Traders.
Securities gains were $9 million compared with an adjusted $10 million in the prior quarter. For the full year, we expect gains to be in the $30 million to $40 million range, though any given quarter could vary.
Expenses for the quarter were $305 million, up $12 million from the prior quarter, influenced by a couple of unique items. First, we had $6 million of executive severance within the restructuring line. Second, we had an $8 million onetime third-party contract charge in the communications line. Excluding those 2 items, expenses were $291 million.
Looking ahead, we are truly shifting our framework to be more aligned with the revenue environment, and that is evident in the investments we are making going forward. These investments are ones that will have more direct impact on the growth in our business.
As for the most significant drivers of the current year's expense guidance, which is predicated on an operating margin of 39%, they are the following. First, the impact of adding talent. We grew headcount in 2015, and we'll have the full year run rate of those additions as well as continued hiring throughout 2016. In 2015, many of the hires we made related to foundational enhancements and improvements to project management. In 2016, many of the hires we make will be related to business growth. In conjunction with this, we expect consultant headcount to decline, which is captured in professional services.
Second, we plan to increase our marketing spend in the high single-digit percentage range during the year. We maintained flexibility here and will be mindful of what market conditions warrant.
And last, the impact of our reduced FDIC insurance premiums. We had a drop in our assessment rate mid-2015, and we'll recognize the full benefit of that in 2016. We expect this expense to be approximately $6 million per quarter with a $49.5 billion balance sheet.
So those are the pieces that will impact the full year. More specifically for Q1, we expect operating expenses to be around $310 million, which includes a sequential uptick in marketing spend. That, combined with a smaller balance sheet we'll have in Q1 relative to the rest of the year, will cause our op margin for the quarter to be below our full year guidance. And to be clear on our operating margin guidance. The metric is aligned with our -- with that which we report in our key performance metrics and is the percentage we make on revenue after provision and operating expenses, meaning it excludes corporate interest expense and other below-the-line items. We view this metric as an important measure of how we are managing the business.
Moving on to the loan portfolio. It ended the year at $5 billion, down 6% during the quarter and down 22% for the full year. The allowance reduced yet again as we continue to see positive performance relative to our expectations, ending the quarter at $353 million, a $23 million decline from the prior quarter. This translated into a benefit to provision for loan losses of $23 million as net charge-offs were 0.
With respect to HELOCs, we began 2015 with $600 million of HELOCs scheduled to convert to amortizing payments or mature during the year. We managed through the first significant volume of conversions and maturities, and we now have a sizable sample of converted loan performance to measure against our original expectations. We enter 2016 armed with even more data to forecast the performance of the future conversions and maturities. This year, we have about $800 million of our total $2.1 billion of home equity loans, of which $1.7 billion are HELOCs scheduled to do so.
So here's what I would emphasize on the topic. In the month a HELOC converts from an interest-only to an amortizing payment, we observe a significant increase in the rate of new 30-day delinquencies, which ultimately result in a default rate approximately twice that of the nonconverting population. Translating that into actual loss terms, the 24-month benchmark default rate on nonconverting loans has been about 6%, while those that have converted are closer to 12%. Furthermore, the charge-off occurs approximately 6 to 9 months after the conversion event when the loan reaches 180 days past due consistent with our standard accounting process for mortgage loan charge-offs.
And finally, our loss estimates incorporate our assumption on loans converting in 2016 are generally of poor credit quality than the average converted loans to date as national housing values peaked in 2006 when most of them were originated, translating to higher CLTVs and less equities in the -- less equity in the properties today. These conversions and their performance are the single largest factor impacting our loss modeling. And while we expect charge-offs to increase in 2016, we are comfortable with our current level of reserves and continue to expect provision expense for the year to be near 0.
Moving on to capital. We announced 4 major capital deployment actions in 2015, and we are in the midst of executing on 2 of them: balance sheet growth and share repurchases.
On balance sheet growth, we expect to reach our targeted balance sheet size in Q2. At that point, on a pro forma basis, we would be left with about $7 billion of off-balance sheet deposits. Before assuming any level of growth in the business, $2 billion of these deposits could be brought on the balance sheet at our direction. So taking this into account, and again before assuming any level of customer cash growth, we have the ability to cross $50 billion organically.
To expand on Paul's comments regarding the work underway to size the impact of expenses of crossing $50 billion in assets, first, we would have the upfront nonrecurring expenses to implement the qualitative requirements associated with crossing the threshold. More specifically, those are tied to requirements scripted under Dodd-Frank, namely, CCAR, the liquidity coverage ratio and resolution planning.
Within the rough initial estimate of $50 million, we are still -- we're doing much work to determine what the final number will be and what portion of that would actually flow to the P&L versus how much will be capitalized. This does not include any additional FDIC costs, which would be incurred at a rate relatively aligned with our costs today.
With respect to the $15 million estimate of recurring annual expenses, that would be predominantly associated with additional headcount in various legal, compliance and financial roles. But while the work -- while we work through these calculations, it is important to note that we will only cross the $50 billion threshold if doing so presents compelling returns.
Lastly, with respect to corporate cash, we ended the quarter with $447 million, up $15 million from the prior quarter as the $50 million dividend from E*TRADE Securities was offset by the usage of $50 million to repurchase shares. As a reminder, we intend to resume quarterly dividends from the bank to the parent in Q1. And in light of our reduced Tier 1 leverage threshold to 8% at the bank this quarter, we intend to request dividends in excess of its $97 million of Q4 net income.
And with that, operator, we will open the call for questions."

So we would expect that number to grow with our business as we grow accounts and grow customers. The $2 billion that you have there, if you think about what we give as our reinvestment rate of essentially 175 basis points or so, you can use that to estimate the revenue that's available on that $2 billion. When we think of returns, we're not really just talking about a dollar return or margin, but we have to put equity against that balance sheet.

As always, it is a pleasure to share my thoughts with you. Later, Mr. Pizzi will dissect the quarter. But first, I'd like to spend some time reflecting on what has been, by all accounts, a banner year at E*TRADE.
An adjusted net income of $340 million or $1.17 per share represents the company's strongest financial performance in nearly a decade and is the product of exceptional efforts by our colleagues across the organization. We've come so far as a company to bolster our financial and competitive positions, and in the hall of accomplishments, the 2015 display case houses some of our most celebrated and hard-earned trophies.
During the year, our risk profile exhibited a step function improvement as the continued reduction in legacy assets was marked by 2 consecutive quarters of lowering reserves while our demonstration of enhanced enterprise risk controls, among other things, helped solidify our regulatory standing. We embarked upon 4 major capital deployment actions emblematic of our improved position and greater flexibility. And most importantly, we focused on the customer experience, bringing several digital enhancements and offerings to market while further sharpening our focus through the discontinuation of noncore businesses.
To start with our financial position, faced with tremendous opportunity, my colleagues rose to the challenge, exceeding even our own demanding expectations. To provide a highlight reel of our triumphs, we kicked off 2015 announcing regulatory approval to reduce our bank's Tier 1 leverage ratio by 50 basis points to a level of 9%; reduced and refinanced our corporate debt to our target level of $1 billion at a blended average coupon of 5%, the lowest in company history; simplified our operating structure by extracting our broker-dealer subsidiaries from the bank, which now serve as a more efficient source of capital for the parent; distributed more than $800 million of excess capital to the parent; terminated costly legacy funding sources from our balance sheet, markedly improving its profile and returns while creating capacity to fuel growth with core customer deposits; and began the process of growing the balance sheet to our target of circa $49.5 billion; put in place and began executing on an $800 million share repurchase program; and finally, announced yet another approval to reduce our targeted bank leverage ratio in early 2016, this time by 100 basis points to 8%, a full year ahead of expectations; our accomplishments numbered large and were significant in scope, and we ended the year in a bountifully stronger position than we began it and, frankly, better and stronger than the company has been in more than a decade.
Notably, our progress and resulting position were recognized by our regulators and rating agencies across a few dimensions. First, the MOUs at both the bank and parent were lifted early in the year. Next, reflective of our much improved risk profile and regulatory standing, our FDIC insurance rates were cut by more than half. And finally, we received investment grade credit ratings for the first time in company history following 7 notches of cumulative upgrades from our 2 covering agencies during the year with a BBB designation from S&P in August and Moody's following suit in December.
While it is more than a pleasure to look back on these achievements, make no mistake that we are acutely focused on what is next, marked by our unwavering commitment to be faithful stewards of shareholder capital. To that end, we are currently in the midst of executing 2 important initiatives. First, we are steadily marching towards our target balance sheet size of $49.5 billion, which we expect to achieve in the second quarter. Second, we are actively executing on our $800 million share repurchase program announced in November. Through year-end, we repurchased $50 million, and in January to date we have put another $26 million to work. Meanwhile, we continue to evaluate other possibilities for capital deployment.
Beyond making prudent investments in the business, chief among these possibilities are potential acquisitions. I've mentioned that we think of these in 3 broad categories, of which 2 continue to rise to the top of the list. Those are scale acquisitions in the brokerage business and opportunities to better capitalize on our customer deposits through banking.
On the brokerage side, we have superior platforms and systems in place and utilizing the scale inherent they're in is attractive. On banking, we see value in optimizing our low cost stable deposits through a more traditional approach. While an abundance of small and medium size opportunities exist in these areas, we are staying highly objective with an eye on delivering compelling returns on capital, ensuring our customers will be well served and remaining close to our digital ethos. As we examine specific opportunities, management and our board pass each through a robust filter, ensuring our heightened standards for risk, our demonstrated commitment to creating value for shareholders and our regulatory standing are at the forefront of any decisions. 
Irrespective of acquisitions, as we think about both growth and capital deployment, we have started the work on sizing the implications of exceeding $50 billion in assets. While I remain hopeful that logic rears its noble head and that certain regulations might change, we take a more pragmatic approach to managing our business. Accordingly, I charged Mr. Pizzi and team with understanding all elements of crossing this threshold, from systems to reporting to personnel and most relevant for your purposes, cost. While there's still a lot of analysis to do and the numbers will be refined, initial estimates suggest about $50 million over 2 years related to getting in shape with an additional recurring component of approximately $15 million annually. Keep in mind that not all of these costs, specifically those related to the initial buildout, would have immediate P&L impact. Mr. Pizzi will cover more on that later.
These costs are certainly not insignificant. And as we noted on numerous occasions, tiptoeing over the $50 billion line won't benefit our owners, particularly in the current rate environment. However, with costs and benefits more clearly defined, we will be able to make an informed decision considering rates, growth and return on capital. So we are spending a healthy amount of time working through this exercise for the avoidance of any doubt, our intent for the foreseeable future is to manage our balance sheet to our stated target and not cross into the nifty land of 50.
While on the top of expenses, the team has completed the budgeting work for 2016, and I would like to give some color on how we are thinking about spend going forward. We have made a lot of important investments in the business over the past few years. In particular, fortifying the company's risk and control framework in line with our enhanced expectations, bolstering our foundation through improvements to systems and infrastructure, and finally upgrading talent. With much of the foundational work complete, we have really just begun to shift our dollars to chip away at delivering enhancements truly geared towards improving our competitive position. Today, with this more rational expense structure, we are transitioning the way we think and talk about overall spending to be more directly aligned with the revenue environment, meaning operating margin. On this measure, for 2016, we expect it to be 39%. There's substantial upside in a more normalized rate environment where our target should move to the mid-40s range. While Mr. Pizzi will share additional thoughts on expenses in the coming quarter, I wanted to accentuate our revamped approach on the matter.
Turning to our business metrics. Customer activity rates slowed amidst global and macroeconomic uncertainty during the year with DARTs of 155,000, down 8% from 2014. Q4 continued the trend in moderation as DARTs of 147,000 were down 6% from the third quarter. Options during the quarter were stable at 24% of total DARTs, consistent with our full year mix. In January to date, we've seen uptick in trading activity amidst volatile markets and in line with seasonal patterns. Through yesterday, DARTs are tracking up 26% from December.
Despite uncertainty in the markets, our customers showed confidence when they acted as there were net buyers of $6.8 billion of securities during the year and maintained relatively healthy margin balances throughout, ending the year at $7.4 billion. For the quarter, margin balances averaged $7.5 billion, down from $8 billion last quarter. Recently, we've seen a decline to about $7 billion. Despite the macroeconomic morass, our core franchise also continued its steady growth, adding 13,000 net new brokerage accounts during the fourth quarter, bringing the full year total to 96,000 after we adjust for unique items.
Our adjusted attrition rate for the quarter of 8.2% improved from 9.3% in the prior quarter. That brings our full year adjusted attrition rate to 8.9% in line with 2014 in a range that we think is healthy given our business model. We brought in $2.8 billion of net new brokerage assets during the quarter, which was up from $2.1 billion in the third quarter and brings our full year total to $9.3 billion, representing a 3.8% growth rate. Importantly, approximately 1/3 of those net new assets were flows into retirement accounts.
Retirement, investing and savings continue to represent a key component of our future growth. Both our challenge and our opportunity is to better engage our customers to broaden their awareness and showcase our capabilities as a provider of investment solutions for both the near- and long-term focus. We ended the year with $48 billion in retirement assets with our 880,000 retirement accounts, both of which increased modestly during the year. We also have $3.2 billion of assets in managed accounts, which we think complements this component of our business quite nicely.
Another tremendous area of opportunity for us is our Stock Plan Administration business. We continue to invest in this business during the year and completed the transition of clients onto our award-winning Equity Edge Online platform. During the year, we added 144,000 net new accounts in this business and ended the year with 1.4 million planned participants.
Turning to the enhancements we've made to our digital storefront and core platforms. Leading with etrade.com, we launched a new welcome page for prospective customers to better deliver our value proposition the moment a window shopper steps into the store. While it is in early days, we have seen an improvement in the funding rate for new accounts directed to this page, which is up over 2.5 percentage points compared to our prior experience.
Once in the door, all customers were met with several overhauled sections of our site, including a revamped account overview page; our new retirement center, which provides a simpler interface and inviting content to help customers engage, take charge and keep their goals on track; our new tax center, which brings more efficiency and ease to a process that is notoriously stressful and convoluted; and finally, this morning we announced the introduction of TipRanks to our platform. In listening to customers, we heard a strong need for help navigating the scores of public content across social and financial channels. The tool, which presents analysts' sentiment on individual stocks in an ultra clear way, takes a unique algorithm-based approach to analyzing and aggregating recommendations from more than 3,700 sell-side analysts and 4,500 financial bloggers.
Turning to our active trader platform, E*TRADE Pro, we made a number of upgrades to further equip retail investors with professional grade tools. The big ticket items include a new options analyzer, which simplifies very complex strategies. In addition to a new streamlined design, the revamped tool enables traders to build multiple option strategies, run through various strike and date scenarios, customize graphing features, and more seamlessly submit any strategy for trading. And our new margin analyzer, which provides greater clarity by way of a new detailed overview of buying power, displaying realtime requirements for each position in a customer's portfolio.
Lastly is mobile, which continues to become a more prevalent component of our offering as mobile DARTs were a record 14% of total DARTs in 2015 and 15% in Q4. Customers seek an experience that rivals the desktop in terms of power and depth, and this year, we delivered robust enhancements to further empower customers on the go. Some of the more noteworthy features we added this year include conditional orders to help customers more nimbly seize opportunities based on different market conditions; multi-leg options to execute complex strategies; a bespoke mutual fund trading experience on mobile that embraces the unique form factor; and several new technologies available on Apple products, including home screen support in iOS, Apple Pay and of course, our Apple Watch app where we're the only broker among our peers to offer account level data.
When it comes to the prowess of our digital offerings, we received significant third-party recognition this year, including earning 4 out of 5 stars overall in Barron's 2015 broker review; 3 first place awards along with 5 best-in-class ratings in StockBrokers.com 2015 review; and for the fourth year running, Equity Edge Online was rated #1 for client satisfaction and loyalty by Group Five.
So in summary, 2015 was a great year for E*TRADE. We're very proud of the accomplish we made, but recognize there's more to do to drive growth in the metrics, and I know we can do better. So as we turn the page to a new year, I'm enthusiastic about the many initiatives we have underway to enhance our offering and grow our franchise, all while keeping focused on continuing to deliver value for shareholders. I am eager to share our progress along the way, and I'm confident 2016 will be another great year for E*TRADE.
And with that, I will turn it over to our impavid CFO, Mr. Pizzi."

For the quarter, we reported earnings of $89 million or $0.30 per share. That compares to $98 million or $0.33 per share in the prior quarter after excluding the impact of the wholesale funding transaction. It also compares to adjusted net income of $78 million or $0.26 per share in the year ago quarter after excluding early extinguishment of corporate debt. The quarter also included an elevated tax rate of 43% largely related to the impact of our wholesale funding transaction on the full year's pretax income and the associated impact on nondeductible items. We expect it to return to a more normalized 38% to 40% range in 2016.
Revenues were $454 million, up from an adjusted $443 million in the prior quarter attributable to higher net interest spread, but down from $461 million in the year ago quarter as a result of lower customer activity. Net interest income of $285 million improved $22 million from the prior quarter driven by a healthy 30 basis point improvement in spread primarily related to the elimination of expensive wholesale funding, partially offset by a $1 billion lower average balance sheet, again, the result of the wholesale elimination.
Spread for the quarter was 288 basis points, above the high 270s range we discussed on the last call as a result of better margin loan yields coupled with meaningfully slower prepayment speeds within our securities portfolio. As for 2016 spread, holding the fed funds rate constant and doing the same for our most erratic variables relative to where they ended the year, margin, stock lending and prepayment speeds, we expect our spread for the year to be in the 270 to 275 basis point range with Q1 in the high 270s. I would note that with margin relative to where it ended the year, there is some downside.
Commissions, fees and service charges and other revenues were $160 million, down $10 million from the prior quarter and down $16 million versus the year ago quarter largely attributable to a decline in trading activity relative to both periods. Average commission per trade of $10.66 declined $0.21 from the prior quarter and $0.18 from the year ago quarter. The sequential decrease was driven by a higher mix of Active Traders and fewer contracts per option trade. The year-over-year decline was also driven by a higher mix of Active Traders.
Securities gains were $9 million compared with an adjusted $10 million in the prior quarter. For the full year, we expect gains to be in the $30 million to $40 million range, though any given quarter could vary. Expenses for the quarter were $305 million, up $12 million from the prior quarter, influenced by a couple of unique items. First, we had $6 million of executive severance within the restructuring line. Second, we had an $8 million onetime third-party contract charge in the communications line. Excluding those 2 items, expenses were $291 million.
Looking ahead, we are truly shifting our framework to be more aligned with the revenue environment and that is evident in the investments we are making going forward. These investments are ones that will have a more direct impact on the growth in our business. As for the most significant drivers of the current year's expense guidance, which is predicated on an operating margin of 39%, they are the following. First, the impact of adding talent. We grew headcount in 2015 and will have the full year run rate of those additions as well as continued hiring throughout 2016. In 2015, many of the hires we made related to foundational enhancements and improvements to project management. In 2016, many of the hires we make will be related to business growth. In conjunction with this, we expect consultant headcount to decline, which is captured in professional services.
Second, we plan to increase our marketing spend in the high single-digit percentage range during the year. We maintain flexibility here and will be mindful of what market conditions warrant. And last, the impact of our reduced FDIC insurance premiums. We had a drop in our assessment rate mid-2015 and will recognize the full benefit of that in 2016. We expect this expense to be approximately $6 million per quarter with a $49.5 billion balance sheet.
So those are the pieces that will impact the full year. More specifically for Q1, we expect operating expenses to be around $310 million, which includes a sequential uptick in marketing spend. That, combined with a smaller balance sheet we'll have in Q1 relative to the rest of the year, will cause our op margin for the quarter to be below our full year guidance. And to be clear on our operating margin guidance. The metric is aligned with our -- with that which we report in our key performance metrics and is the percentage we make on revenue after provision and operating expenses, meaning it excludes corporate interest expense and other below-the-line items. We view this metric as an important measure of how we are managing the business.
Moving on to the loan portfolio. It ended the year at $5 billion, down 6% during the quarter and down 22% for the full year. The allowance reduced yet again as we continued to see positive performance relative to our expectations, ending the quarter at $353 million, a $23 million decline from the prior quarter. This translated into a benefit to provision for loan losses of $23 million as net charge-offs were 0.
With respect to HELOCs, we began 2015 with $600 million of HELOCs scheduled to convert to amortizing payments or mature during the year. We managed through the first significant volume of conversions and maturities, and we now have a sizable sample of converted loan performance to measure against our original expectations. We enter 2016 armed with even more data to forecast the performance of the future conversions and maturities. This year, we have about $800 million of our total $2.1 billion of home equity loans, of which $1.7 billion are HELOCs scheduled to do so.
So here's what I would emphasize on the topic. In the month a HELOC converts from an interest only to an amortizing payment, we observe a significant increase in the rate of new 30-day delinquencies, which ultimately result in a default rate approximately twice that of the nonconverting population. Translating that into actual loss terms, the 24-month benchmark default rate on nonconverting loans has been about 6%, while those that have converted are closer to 12%. Furthermore, the charge-off occurs approximately 6 to 9 months after the conversion event when the loan reaches 180 days past due consistent with our standard accounting process for mortgage loan charge-offs.
And finally, our loss estimates incorporate our assumption on loans converting in 2016 are generally of poor credit quality than the average converted loans to date as national housing values peaked in 2006 when most of them were originated, translating to higher CLTVs and less equities in the -- less equity in the properties today. These conversions and their performance are the single largest factor impacting our loss modeling. And while we expect charge-offs to increase in 2016, we are comfortable with our current level of reserves and continue to expect provision expense for the year to be near 0.
Moving on to capital. We announced 4 major capital deployment actions in 2015, and we are in the midst of executing on 2 of them: balance sheet growth and share repurchases. On balance sheet growth, we expect to reach our targeted balance sheet size in Q2. At that point, on a pro forma basis, we would be left with about $7 billion of off-balance sheet deposits. Before assuming any level of growth in the business, $2 billion of these deposits could be brought on the balance sheet at our direction. So taking this into account, and again, before assuming any level of customer cash growth, we have the ability to cross $50 billion organically.
To expand on Paul's comments regarding the work underway to size the impact of expenses of crossing $50 billion in assets. First, we would have the upfront nonrecurring expenses to implement the qualitative requirements associated with crossing the threshold. More specifically, those are tied to requirements scripted under Dodd-Frank, namely, CCAR, the liquidity coverage ratio and resolution planning.
Within the rough initial estimate of $50 million, we are still -- we're doing much work to determine what the final number will be and what portion of that would actually flow through the P&L versus how much will be capitalized. This does not include any additional FDIC costs, which would be incurred at a rate relatively in line with our costs today.
With respect to the $15 million estimate of recurring annual expenses that would be predominantly associated with additional headcount in various legal, compliance and financial roles. But while the work -- while we work through these calculations, it is important to note that we will only cross the $50 billion threshold if doing so presents compelling returns.
Lastly, with respect to corporate cash, we ended the quarter with $447 million, up $15 million from the prior quarter as the $50 million dividend from E*TRADE Securities was offset by the usage of $50 million to repurchase shares. As a reminder, we intend to resume quarterly dividends from the bank to the parent in Q1. And in light of our reduced Tier 1 leverage threshold to 8% at the bank this quarter, we intend to request dividends in excess of its $97 million of Q4 net income.
And with that, operator, we will open the call for questions."

Continuing to -- if you look at our customer cash balances over time and a trend, you'll see that, over time, that they have been growing. So we would expect that number to grow with our business as we grow accounts and grow customers. The $2 billion that you have there, if you think about what we give as our reinvestment rate of essentially 175 basis points or so, you can use that to estimate the revenue that's available on that $2 billion. When we think of returns, we're not really just talking about a dollar return or margin, but we have to put equity against that balance sheet. So what we're really talking about is a compelling ROE to grow the balance sheet through 50, taking into account those costs."

Good evening, and thank you for joining us to reflect on what has been a meaningful quarter for E*TRADE. We kicked off the year with solid play by all our lines as we posted strong results and continued to roll out enhancements to our customer offering and deployed a conservative quantum of capital to shareholders. Amidst the market environment characterized by a trepidation and unease, we posted respectable growth in our business as our customers remained relatively active. Our results again benefited from the dwindling size and better-than-expected performance of our legacy loan portfolio, and we made significant progress in our premeditated march towards a $50 billion balance sheet.
Meanwhile, we began managing the bank to a lower Tier 1 leverage ratio, distributed a considerable amount of capital to the parent and continue to put capital to work for our owners.
Starting with our results. We reported net income of $153 million or $0.53 per share for the quarter. On the metrics, customer activity increased sequentially, a trend that is typical in Q1. We also traditionally expect an uptick in activity from our corporate services customers in Q1 and that trend was less pronounced, attributable to the underperformance of the market. Options contribute a steady 23% of total DARTs. Additionally, the portion of trades executed by our mobile platforms held steady at 16%.  N April to date, DARTs are tracking down 1% from March.
In terms of sentiment, Q1 presented a bleak opening for our customers as the markets kicked off January as one of the worst starts in history. Confidence and activity improved to the quarter and by March had seen the [indiscernible] curtain have lifted. The sum total of this quarter's activity was solid with our customers being net buyers of $1.2 billion of securities. While exhibiting some purposeful derisking behavior, margin balances were dialed back by slightly over $1 billion with balances averaging $6.7 billion and ending the period at $6.3 billion for the quarter. In April to date, balances are flat where they ended the quarter.
Meanwhile, we continue to post solid growth. Excluding the impact of shattering our Hong Kong and Singapore operations, we added 45,000 net new brokerage accounts during the quarter, while our adjusted attrition rate improved to 7.3%, both of which represent our best quarterly marks in 2 years.
We had a $2.9 billion of net new brokerage assets during the quarter, healthy for Q1, but down from $3.5 million[ph] year ago primarily due to lower activity from our stock plan customers. Our focus on retirement investing and savings is present in this metric as 1 quarter of these flows were attributed to retirement accounts.
Q1's results also included a $0.10 per share income tax benefit and some important changes to our reporting and segments and Mr. Pizzi will elegantly walk you through each of those. There is 1 element I will highlight, however, which is the impact of these changes in our operating margin calculation, reducing it by about 2 percentage points, making our equivalent target 37% for this year. Also you'll find that we'll present this metric both straight up and adjusted, which excludes provision for loan losses this quarter. The latter being the measure to which we manage our spending.
While we are ever mindful of the impact of the provision can have on our bottom line and capital, we don't view it as a key factor governing our investments in the business. That said, a large benefit is not a license to spend nor would we ignore any meaningful charges. And with that, context out of the way, we posted an adjusted operating margin of 34% in Q1, below our full year target of 37%, yet broadly inline with our expectations given the timing of balance sheet growth and seasonality in comp and advertising.
The performance of the loan portfolio exceeded our expectations and our results included a net benefit in the charge-off line, a first for the company. We continue to benefit from recoveries along with better-than-expected performance of HELOC conversions, which we are now more than halfway through. This diminishing portfolio ended the quarter at just $4.7 billion.
On to capital, where we delivered some remarkable numbers and progress this quarter across each stage of the capital life cycle: Generation, distribution and deployment. Talking about our generation of capital, we've done a lot, both from an earnings standpoint as well as through lower capital thresholds. The progress we've made clearly reflects our improved financial position and regulatory progress, which are proof positive of all the work the entire team has done on the enterprise risk management front, the enhancements we've made to our operations and leadership team, as well as the continued and marked improvement to our overall risk profile.
Concordant with our much approved stature is the freedom we've earned to internally distribute the company we generate, continuing to benefit from an improved flexibility in the bank and company-wide. This quarter, we distributed a hefty $400 million to the parent, well above our typical contribution. This included capital from the bank, both formed through earnings and liberated through the 100 basis point drop in our target leverage ratio and capital from our brokers from the earnings of our introducing broker and the extraction of excess capital from our dealing broker.
One related element of note, while we achieved a reduction in our bank leverage ratio of 8%, well ahead of our regional plan, we have our sights set on continued improvement our capital efficiency there and aim to manage closer to 7.5% in early 2017. This, of course, is our aspiration and will require regulatory approval.
On capital deployment, we exceeded $350 million in cumulative share repurchased during the quarter, putting us nearly halfway through our current authorization just a few months after embarking on the program. While market dislocations during the quarter presented us with opportunities to be aggressive buyers of our stock, we aim to continue buybacks at a more modest pace with an eye on completing the current $800 million program by year-end. We are devotees of buybacks as they allow us to return capital to shareholders efficiently and with lower risk.
With regard to additional capital deployment, we're progressing on growing our balance sheet to $49.5 billion, ending $2.5 billion during the period. We intend to reach our target size this quarter.
And exploring other avenues to put capital to work, we continue to focus on growth with acquisition as 1 method to achieve that goal. This quarter we sharpened our focus and elect to walk through our current thinking. We believe scale acquisitions in the brokerage space make the most sense.
We also look for opportunities to bolster our capabilities through acquisition in consideration of our retirement, investing and savings vertical as well as our corporate services channel. However, we continue to evaluate build versus buy on this front.
Specific to acquisitions in the banking space, our areas of focus include: Innovative financial technology within custody and payment services; and trust and wealth management offerings to the extent we find a logical fit in support of our current strategy.
Now we certainly understand there's been significant investor interest throughout acquisitions that can result in credit exposure and I'd like to summarize our present thinking on this. To the extent we would consider taking on credit exposure throughout acquisition, it would have to exceed a substantially higher hurdle for returns, to ensure the benefits and associated risks would truly be worthy of our owners capital and management's time. To make this point very clear, we will not explore acquisitions in a traditional banking model unless it is overwhelmingly compelling for shareholders. We have come too far as a company to go around the bend by assuming unwarranted risk through an injudicious acquisition.
We also continue to evaluate other options for capital deployment, including share repurchases beyond our current program and balance sheet growth beyond $50 billion. Mr. Pizzi will provide color on how we measure these options.
With respect to enhancements and roll offs, Q1 was a busy quarter. To cover a few of the highlights, we continue to expand our industry-leading mobile offerings as we incorporated customer feedback to increase customization capabilities on the mobile dashboard. As mobile continued to become a channel for long-term investors, as much as for Active Traders, we also introduced a mobile retirement center, helping customers plan their retirement savings for the calculated tool and easily open an IRA or roll over an existing 401(k) account.
On our website, we upgraded our Income Estimator tool, which now provides an improved logic that can be applied to securities within a watchlist and can seamlessly send any stock, ETF and mutual fund through for execution. It was recently we rolled out a new dashboard in E*TRADE Pro, creating a homebase for our most Active Traders to attract the market's manage their portfolios and much more in a consolidated manner.
We have a pipeline of great tools, features and new experiences in store for our customers this year, so stay tuned. I look forward to sharing more with you.
We've just emerged from our industry's award season with an ample assessment of accolades, receiving high marks and bearance in nerve wallet, 9 best-in-class distinctions from StockBrokers.com, which includes earning the #1 mobile app, 3 gold awards from Corporate Insight and an honorary designation from the Webbie[ph] awards.
Our industry also witnessed one of the more impactful pieces of overreaching regulations seen in recent history, the Department of Labor's ruling on the applicability of the fiduciary standard. First, I want to state unequivocally that we support efforts to advance the best interest of retail investors have a work within the new regulatory guidelines to continue to deliver guidance on our customers terms and provide services that help investors take control of their financial health.
We're also pleased with the DOL hitting many of the industry's concerns regarding the initial draft, delivering a final rule that is less burdensome than originally proposed. We believe as a matter of principle that all we serve the retail investors should be held to the highest standards when it comes to working in their best interest. At the same time, we believe this pursuit must be balanced against ensuring investors continue to have seamless access to investment support and the greatest provider of financial choices at their disposal to help them trade, invest and save.
We're still working through the ruling significance, but we're confident will have minimal impact on our ability to properly serve our customers.
On the leadership front, I'm very pleased to welcome an addition to our executive suite as we concluded our comprehensive search for a new Chief Risk Officer earlier this month, reporting Ms. Ellen Kubler to the post, where the risk management career spanning nearly 2 decades in a handful of large and complex financial institutions, Ellen brings considerable firepower to this crucial function and to our Executive Committee.
As Ellen comes onboard, our unassailable acting CRO and the original architect at E*TRADE's risk organization, Mr. Paul Brandow, has graciously agreed to stay on in an advisory capacity to me and the entire executive team. I'm happy to know we'll contribute to benefit from his sage perspective and consummate insight.
In closing, as I think about 2016, we have a lot of exciting things in the works on the customer experience front and we'll continue to ruthlessly pursue the best path forward and capital deployment. I look forward to keeping you apprised.
And with that, I will turn it over to our CFO, Mr. Pizzi."

For the quarter, we reported adjusted net income of $122 million or $0.43 per share. This excludes $31 million or a 10% per share tax benefit related to the release of a valuation allowance against state deferred tax assets. Our results compared to $89 million or $0.30 per share in the prior quarter. It also compares to adjusted net income of $85 million or $0.29 per share in the year-ago quarter, which excludes the loss on early extinguishment of corporate debt.
Before I delve into the details of our income statement, I'd like to review the changes we made to our reporting this quarter. For those of you following along, these changes are laid out graphically in our quarterly financial supplement on about.etrade.com under the Quarterly Earnings section. There you will also find realigned financials going back through 2014. I'll refer to those during this call.
We consolidated our business segments and realigned both our income statement and yield table, all of which are reflective of how we currently manage the business.
As for the specifics, beginning with segment reporting, we collapsed our operating segments and are now presenting only consolidated financial results with the vast majority of our legacy costs in the rearview mirror and the management of our balance sheet now focused solely on maximizing the value of customer deposits, we thought it was the right thing to wave goodbye to the balance sheet management segment as well as the corporate category. We also realigned our income statement, moving our below-the-line items into revenue and expenses. Most notable among those changes is that corporate interest expense is now included in net interest income.
Additionally, other income and expense was moved into the gains and losses on securities and other revenue line, and losses on early extinguishment of debt are now included within the noninterest expense section.
Taking a deeper dive into net interest income, we are now reported net interest margin as opposed to spread. After all, most of you already call it NIM.
Now on to the result. Revenue for the quarter were $472 million, up from $439 million in the prior quarter, attributable to higher net interest income as both net interest margin and balance sheet size increased sequentially, and up from $441 million in the year-ago quarter as a result of the termination of wholesale borrowings, the Fed rate hike and the corporate debt reduction and refinance.
Net interest income of $287 million improved $17 million[ph] from the prior quarter driven by a 7 basis point improvement in the net interest margin on a $1.4 billion larger average interest-earning balance sheet. Our net interest margin of 281 basis points increased as a result of the full quarter impact of the Fed rate hike, coupled with slower prepayment speeds on the securities portfolio but was partially offset by lower margin balances.
Because we guided to spread on our last call, I'll tell you that based on our prior reporting, our spread for the quarter would have been 294 basis points, meaning we significantly outperformed our expectations of high 270s.
As for our expectations for the full year, holding the Fed funds rate constant and doing the same to margin balances, we expect our net interest margin for the full year to be in the 260 to 265 basis point range. Adjusted for the reported changes, this is consistent with our previous guidance. Note that our significant outperformance in Q1 is offsetting our expectation for NIM to contract in the remainder of the year. For Q2 specifically, we expect it to land in the mid-260s.
Commissions, fees and service charges and other revenue were $175 million, up $15 million from the prior quarter and down just modestly versus the year-ago quarter. 2 main factors contributed to the fluctuations. First, customer activity increased 12% versus Q4 but decreased 3% versus the year-ago period; and second, improved rates on off-balance sheet, helped drive increases in fees and service charges relative to both periods.
On the latter, the average rate earned on off-balance sheet cash was 30 basis points in Q1, up 17 basis points from Q4 as a result of the full quarter impact of the December rate hike. Keep in mind this is a gross number, so net of the fees paid to our third-party platform administrator, we earned 24 basis points on average in the period.
Average commission per trade of $10.64 declined $0.02 from the prior quarter and $0.30 from the year-ago quarter. The year-over-year decline was driven by a lower contribution from stock planned customer trades and fewer options contracts per trade.
Securities and other gains were $10 million, flat with the prior quarter. For the full year, we expect gains to be in the $30 million to $40 million range.
Noninterest expense for the quarter was $312 million, up $7 million from the prior quarter, which included $14 million in nonrecurring charges. Excluding those items, the $21 million sequential increase was driven by compensation and benefits, which reflect the full quarter impact of hires in Q4 as well as seasonality related to compensation.
We remain highly attuned to the operating environment and the impact it has on how we manage our expenses. As Paul mentioned, for the quarter our adjusted operating margin was 34%. Our target for the year remains 37%, the equivalent of 39% prior to our reporting changes. For Q2 specifically, we expect expenses to decrease approximately $10 million sequentially, primarily related to lower marketing spend.
Provision for the quarter was a benefit of $34 million. Needless to say, better than we expected. Net charge-offs were also positive at $3 million of recoveries, resulting in a $31 million reduction in the allowance to $322 million. Meanwhile, the overall portfolio itself reduced by $284 million or 6% to $4.7 billion.
In addition to the positive impact of recoveries, our provision benefit also reflected better-than-expected performance on converted HELOCs that were previously classified as high risk and had been reserved for -- and we reserved for using the full life of loan loss expectation. This includes balloon loans of which there are just $25 million remaining. The vast majority of which will convert in the current quarter.
In total, we had $213 million of HELOCs convert to amortizing loans during Q1, which has puts us more than halfway through the conversions. Performance in Q1 was consistent with the observations we discussed last quarter, where the default rate from the converted loan is about twice that of the nonconverting loan at approximately 12%. So while we have been pleasantly surprised by performance to date, please keep in mind that we have a sizable pipeline of conversions through Q1 of next year. For this reason, we expect our provision to be approximately 0, with  a caveat that recoveries of greater-than-expected magnitude could again result in a provision benefit.
One final note on the P&L, regarding the tax benefit we recorded this quarter. With the move from our broker-dealers behind us, we took a hard look at our organizational alignment and found an opportunity to reinstate the tax treatment of our broker-dealers prior to moving them under the bank. The tax selection resulted in the release of valuation allowance against associated state deferred tax assets. We're always looking for ways to deliver for shareholders and we're pleased to come to uncover additional value in this pursuit.
Moving on to capital. We've distributed nearly $400 million up to the parent during the quarter comprising the following: $248 million from the bank, which included $97 million from the prior quarter's net income and $151 million as a result of our reduced bank leverage ratio; and $148 million from the brokers, which included $24 million of excess capital generation at the introducing broker, as well as $124 million from the clearing broker.
In the second quarter, we expect total dividends to the parent of approximately $190 million from the bank and brokers. Starting with the bank. Since balance sheet growth consumes bank capital and directly impacts our leverage ratio, in Q2, we will request an $85 million dividend to the parent, which is below the prior quarter bank net income of $108 million.
From the introducing broker, we anticipate $27 million to the parent as part of the standard quarterly distribution. And from the clearing broker, we plan to move $75 million. We continually assess the capital position of the entity and based on the business environment, we may periodically move surplus capital.
We remain in the midst of 2 capital deployment initiatives: balance sheet growth and share repurchases. On the former, we expect to reach our targeted balance sheet side by the end of the current quarter. At that point, based on Q1 deposits, we would have $2 billion in off-balance sheet deposits available to onboard.
With respect to the cost of exceeding $50 billion, we completed additional work during the quarter and our initial estimate remains intact, which is $50 million over 2 years related to the build-out with an annual recurring component of roughly $15 million. So to justify these expenses, along with the capital required to be held against the assets, we need some combination of higher rates and an abundance of customer cash. So for the time being, we plan to hold steady under the $50 billion mark.
On share repurchases, as Paul highlighted, we are nearly halfway through the $800 million program, having picked up nearly 15 million shares at an average price of $23.81. To elaborate on our internal parameters regarding utilizing capital for repurchases, while corporate cash is a clear measure of our dry powder, we are also mindful of our consolidated Tier 1 leverage ratio, which we manage to a floor of 7%, meaning we would not utilize capital to the extent it would put us below this level. We ended the quarter with corporate cash of $482 million and consolidated Tier 1 leverage of 7.8%, which provides the ability to make substantial progress on our program.
With that operator, we will open the call for questions."

And so that elevated recovery number that we see, that's really been really very influential in the last few quarters is very difficult to forecast on a go-forward basis. And that's what contributes to coming out where we are on the current allowance."

Good evening, and thank you for joining us to reflect on what has been a meaningful quarter for E*TRADE.

Good evening, and thank you for joining us to reflect on what has been a meaningful quarter for E*TRADE. We kicked off the year with solid play by all our lines as we posted strong results and continued to roll out enhancements to our customer offering and deployed a conservative [ph] quantum of capital to shareholders. Amidst a market environment characterized by trepidation and unease, we posted respectable growth in the business as our customers remained relatively active. Our results again benefited from the dwindling size and better-than-expected performance of our legacy loan portfolio, and we made significant progress in our premeditated march towards a $50 billion balance sheet.
Meanwhile, we began managing the bank to a lower Tier 1 leverage ratio, distributed a considerable amount of capital to the parent and continued to put capital to work for our owners.
Starting with our results. We reported net income of $153 million or $0.53 per share for the quarter. On the metrics, customer activity increased sequentially, a trend that is typical in Q1. We also traditionally expect an uptick in activity from our corporate services customers in Q1, and that trend was less pronounced, attributable to the underperformance of the market. Options contributed a steady 23% of total DARTs. Additionally, the portion of trades executed by our mobile platforms held steady at 16%. And April-to-date, DARTs are tracking down 1% from March.
In terms of sentiment, Q1 presented a bleak opening for our customers as the markets kicked off January with one of the worst starts in history. Confidence and activity improved to the quarter, and by March end, it seemed the Cimmerian curtain [ph] had lifted. The sum total of this quarter's activity was solid, with our customers being net buyers of $1.2 billion of securities  while exhibiting some purposeful derisking behavior. Margin balances were dialed back by slightly over $1 billion, with balances averaging $6.7 billion and ending the period at $6.3 billion for the quarter. And April-to-date, balances are flat where they ended the quarter.
Meanwhile, we continue to post solid growth. Excluding the impact of shuttering our Hong Kong and Singapore operations, we added 45,000 net new brokerage accounts during the quarter, while our adjusted attrition rate improved to 7.3%, both of which represent our best quarterly marks in 2 years.
We had a $2.9 billion of net new brokerage assets during the quarter, healthy for Q1, but down from $3.5 billion a year ago, primarily due to lower activity from our stock plan customers. Our focus on retirement, investing and savings is present in this metric, as 1/4 of these flows were attributed [ph] to retirement accounts.
Q1's results also included a $0.10 per share income tax benefit and some important changes to our reporting and segments, and Mr. Pizzi will elegantly walk you through each of those. There is one element I will highlight, however, which is the impact of these changes on our operating margin calculation, reducing it by about 2 percentage points, making our equivalent target 37% for this year. Also, you'll find that we present this metric both straight up and adjusted, which excludes provision for loan losses this quarter, the latter being the measure to which we manage our spending.
While we are ever mindful of the impact that provision can have on our bottom line and capital, we don't view it as a key factor governing our investments in the business. That said, a large benefit is not a license to spend nor would we ignore any meaningful charges. And with that context out of the way, we posted an adjusted operating margin of 34% in Q1, below our full year target of 37%, yet broadly in line with our expectations given the timing of balance sheet growth and seasonality in comp and advertising.
The performance of the loan portfolio exceeded our expectations, and our results included a net benefit in the charge-off line, a first for the company. We continue to benefit from recoveries along with better-than-expected performance of HELOC conversions, which we are now more than halfway through. This diminishing portfolio ended the quarter at just $4.7 billion.
On to capital, where we delivered some remarkable numbers and progress this quarter across each stage of the capital life cycle: generation, distribution and deployment. Talking about our generation of capital, we've done a lot, both from an earnings standpoint as well as through lower capital thresholds. The progress we've made acutely reflects our improved financial position and regulatory progress, which are proof-positive of all the work the entire team has done on the enterprise risk management front, the enhancements we've made to our operations and leadership team as well as the continued and marked improvement to our overall risk profile.
Concordant with our much improved stature is the freedom we've earned to internally distribute the capital we generate, continuing to benefit from improved flexibility at the bank and company-wide. This quarter, we distributed a hefty $400 million to the parent, well above our typical contribution. This included capital from the bank, both formed through earnings and liberated through the 100 basis point drop in our target leverage ratio and capital from our brokers from the earnings of our introducing broker and the extraction of excess capital from our dealing broker.
One related element of note. While we achieved a reduction in our bank leverage ratio to 8%, well ahead of our original plan, we have our sights set on continued improvement to our capital efficiency there and aim to manage closer to 7.5% in early 2017. This, of course, is our aspiration and would require regulatory approval.
On capital deployment, we exceeded $350 million in cumulative share repurchased during the quarter, putting us nearly halfway through our current authorization just a few months after embarking on the program. While market dislocations during the quarter presented us with opportunities to be aggressive buyers of our stock, we aim to continue buybacks at a more modest pace with an eye on completing the current $800 million program by year-end. We are devotees of buybacks, as they allow us to return capital to shareholders efficiently and with low risk.
With regard to additional capital deployment, we're progressing on growing our balance sheet to $49.5 billion, adding $2.5 billion during the period. We intend to reach our target size this quarter.
And exploring other avenues to put capital to work, we continue to focus on growth, with acquisition as one method to achieve that goal. This quarter we sharpened our focus, and I'd to walk through our current thinking. We believe scale acquisitions in the brokerage space make the most sense. We also look for opportunities to bolster our capabilities through acquisition in consideration of our retirement, investing and savings vertical as well as our corporate services channel. However, we continually evaluate build versus buy on this front.
Specific to acquisitions in the banking space, our areas of focus include: innovative financial technology within custody and payment services; and trust and wealth management offerings, to the extent we find a logical fit in support of our current strategy.
Now we certainly understand there's been significant investor interest around acquisitions that could result in credit exposure, and I'd like to summarize our present thinking on this. To the extent we would consider taking on credit exposure through acquisition, it would have to exceed a substantially higher hurdle for returns to ensure the benefits and associated risks would truly be worthy of our owners' capital and management's time. To make this point very clear, we will not explore acquisitions in a traditional banking model unless it is overwhelmingly compelling for shareholders. We have come too far as a company to go around the bend by assuming unwarranted risk through an injudicious acquisition.
We also continue to evaluate other options for capital deployment, including share repurchases beyond our current program and balance sheet growth beyond $50 billion. Mr. Pizzi will provide color on how we measure these options.
With respect to enhancements and rollouts, Q1 was a busy quarter. To cover a few of the highlights, we continued to expand our industry-leading mobile offerings as we incorporated customer feedback to increase customization capabilities on the mobile dashboard. As mobile continues to become a channel for long-term investors as much as for Active Traders, we also introduced a mobile retirement center, helping customers plan their retirement savings with a calculator tool and easily open an IRA or roll over an existing 401(k) account.
On our website, we upgraded our income estimator tool, which now provides an improved logic that can be applied to securities within a watch list and can seamlessly send any stock, ETF and mutual fund through for execution. Most recently, we rolled out a new dashboard in E*TRADE Pro, creating a home base for our most Active Traders to attract the markets, manage their portfolios and much more in a consolidated manner.
We have a pipeline of great tools, features and new experiences in store for our customers this year, so stay tuned. I look forward to sharing more with you.
We've just emerged from our industry's award season with an ample assortment of accolades, receiving high marks from Barron's and NerdWallet; 9 best-in-class distinctions from StockBrokers.com, which includes earning the #1 mobile app; 3 gold awards from Corporate Insight; and an honorary designation from the Webby Awards.
Our industry also witnessed one of the more impactful pieces of overreaching regulations seen in recent history, the Department of Labor's ruling on the applicability of the fiduciary standard. First, I want to state unequivocally that we support efforts to advance the best interest of retail investors, and we'll work within the new regulatory guidelines to continue to deliver guidance on our customers' terms and provide services that help investors take control of their financial health.
We're also pleased that the DOL heeded many of the industry's concerns regarding the initial draft, delivering a final rule that is less burdensome than originally proposed. And we believe as a matter of principle that all who serve the retail investors should be held to the highest standards when it comes to working in their best interest. At the same time, we believe this pursuit must be balanced against ensuring investors continue to have seamless access to investment support and the greatest variety of financial choices at their disposal to help them trade, invest and save.
We're still working through the ruling's significance but are confident it will have minimal impact on our ability to properly serve our customers.
On the leadership front, I'm very pleased to welcome an addition to our executive suite, as we concluded our comprehensive search for a new Chief Risk Officer earlier this month, appointing [ph] Ms. Ellen Koebler to the post. With her risk management career spanning nearly 2 decades at a handful of large and complex financial institutions, Ellen brings considerable firepower to this crucial function and to our Executive Committee.
As Ellen comes onboard, our unassailable acting CRO and the original architect of E*TRADE's risk organization, Mr. Paul Brandow, has graciously agreed to stay on in an advisory capacity to me and the entire executive team. I'm happy to know we'll continue to benefit from his sage perspective and consummate insight.
In closing, as I think about 2016, we have a lot of exciting things in the works on the customer experience front, and we'll continue to ruthlessly pursue the best path forward on capital deployment. I look forward to keeping you apprised.
And with that, I will turn it over to our sedulous CFO, Mr. Pizzi."
27807,330346460,961481,"E*TRADE Financial Corporation, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2016",2016-04-21,"Earnings Calls","E*TRADE Financial, LLC","Executives","Thank you, Mr. Idzik.For the quarter, we reported adjusted net income of $122 million or $0.43 per share. This excludes $31 million or a 10% per share tax benefit related to the release of a valuation allowance against state-deferred tax assets. Our res",1689,"Thank you, Mr. Idzik.
For the quarter, we reported adjusted net income of $122 million or $0.43 per share. This excludes $31 million or a 10% per share tax benefit related to the release of a valuation allowance against state-deferred tax assets. Our results compare to $89 million or $0.30 per share in the prior quarter. It also compares to adjusted net income of $85 million or $0.29 per share in the year ago quarter, which excludes the loss on early extinguishment of corporate debt.
Before I delve into the details of our income statement, I'd like to review the changes we made to our reporting this quarter. For those of you following along, these changes are laid out graphically in our quarterly financial supplement on about.etrade.com under the Quarterly Earnings section. There, you will also find realigned financials going back through 2014. I'll refer to those during this call.
We consolidated our business segments and realigned both our income statement and yield table, all of which are reflective of how we currently manage the business.
As for the specifics, beginning with segment reporting. We collapsed our operating segments and are now presenting only consolidated financial results. With the vast majority of our legacy costs in the rearview mirror and the management of our balance sheet now focused solely on maximizing the value of customer deposits, we thought it was the right time to wave goodbye to the balance sheet management segment as well as the corporate category. We also realigned our income statement, moving our below-the-line items into revenue and expenses. Most notable among those changes is that corporate interest expense is now included in net interest income.
Additionally, other income and expense was moved into the gains and losses on securities and other revenue line, and losses on early extinguishment of debt are now included within the noninterest expense section.
Taking a deeper dive into net interest income, we are now reporting net interest margin as opposed to spread. After all, most of you already call it NIM.
Now on to the result. Revenue for the quarter were $472 million, up from $439 million in the prior quarter, attributable to higher net interest income, as both net interest margin and balance sheet size increased sequentially, and up from $441 million in the year ago quarter as a result of the termination of wholesale borrowings, the Fed rate hike and the corporate debt reduction and refinance.
Net interest income of $287 million improved $17 million from the prior quarter, driven by a 7 basis point improvement in the net interest margin on a $1.4 billion larger average interest-earning balance sheet. Our net interest margin of 281 basis points increased as a result of the full quarter impact of the Fed rate hike coupled with slower prepayment speeds on the securities portfolio, but was partially offset by lower margin balances.
Because we guided to spread on our last call, I'll tell you that based on our prior reporting, our spread for the quarter would have been 294 basis points, meaning we significantly outperformed our expectations of high 270s.
As for our expectations for the full year, holding the Fed funds rate constant and doing the same to margin balances, we expect our net interest margin for the full year to be in the 260 to 265 basis point range. Adjusted for the reporting changes, this is consistent with our previous guidance. Note that our significant outperformance in Q1 is offsetting our expectation for NIM to contract in the remainder of the year. For Q2 specifically, we expect it to land in the mid-260s.
Commissions, fees and service charges and other revenue were $175 million, up $15 million from the prior quarter and down just modestly versus the year ago quarter. Two main factors contributed to the fluctuations. First, customer activity increased 12% versus Q4 but decreased 3% versus the year ago period; and second, improved rates on off-balance sheet cash helped drive increases in fees and service charges relative to both periods.
On the latter, the average rate earned on off-balance sheet cash was 30 basis points in Q1, up 17 basis points from Q4 as a result of the full quarter impact of the December rate hike. Keep in mind, this is a gross number. So net of the fees paid to our third-party platform administrator, we earned 24 basis points on average in the period.
Average commission per trade of $10.64 declined $0.02 from the prior quarter and $0.30 from the year ago quarter. The year-over-year decline was driven by a lower contribution from stock plan customer trades and fewer options contracts per trade.
Securities and other gains were $10 million, flat with the prior quarter. For the full year, we expect gains to be in the $30 million to $40 million range.
Noninterest expense for the quarter was $312 million, up $7 million from the prior quarter, which included $14 million in nonrecurring charges. Excluding those items, the $21 million sequential increase was driven primarily by compensation and benefits, which reflect the full quarter impact of hires we made in Q4 as well as seasonality related to compensation.
We remain highly attuned to the operating environment and the impact it has on how we manage our expenses. As Paul mentioned, for the quarter, our adjusted operating margin was 34%. Our target for the year remains 37%, the equivalent of 39% prior to our reporting changes. For Q2 specifically, we expect expenses to decrease approximately $10 million sequentially, primarily related to lower marketing spend.
Provision for the quarter was a benefit of $34 million, needless to say, better than we expected. Net charge-offs were also positive at $3 million of recoveries, resulting in a $31 million reduction in the allowance to $322 million. Meanwhile, the overall portfolio itself reduced by $284 million or 6% to $4.7 billion.
In addition to the positive impact of recoveries, our provision benefit also reflected better-than-expected performance on converted HELOCs that were previously classified as high risk and had been reserved for -- and reserved for using the full life-of-loan loss expectation. This includes balloon loans, of which there are just $25 million remaining, the vast majority of which will convert in the current quarter.
In total, we had $213 million of HELOCs convert to amortizing loans during Q1, which has -- puts us more than halfway through the conversions. Performance in Q1 was consistent with the observations we discussed last quarter, where the default rate on the converting loan is about twice that of a nonconverting loan at approximately 12%. So while we have been pleasantly surprised by performance to date, please keep in mind that we have a sizable pipeline of conversions through Q1 of next year. For this reason, we expect our provision to be approximately 0, with  a caveat that recoveries of greater-than-expected magnitude could again result in a provision benefit.
One final note on the P&L, regarding the tax benefit we recorded this quarter. With the move of our broker-dealers behind us, we took a hard look at our organizational alignment and found an opportunity to reinstate the tax treatment of our broker-dealers prior to moving them under the bank. The tax selection resulted in the release of valuation allowance against the associated state-deferred tax assets. We are always looking for ways to deliver for shareholders, and we're pleased to come -- to uncover additional value in this pursuit.
Moving on to capital. We distributed nearly $400 million up to the parent during the quarter comprising the following: $248 million from the bank, which included $97 million from the prior quarter's net income and $151 million as a result of our reduced bank leverage ratio; and $148 million from the brokers, which included $24 million of excess capital generation at the introducing broker as well as $124 million from the clearing broker.
In the second quarter, we expect total dividends to the parent of approximately $190 million from the bank and brokers. Starting with the bank. Since balance sheet growth consumes bank capital and directly impacts our leverage ratio, in Q2, we will request an $85 million dividend to the parent, which is below the prior quarter bank net income of $108 million.
From the introducing broker, we anticipate $27 million to the parent as part of the standard quarterly distribution. And from the clearing broker, we plan to move $75 million. We continually assess the capital position of the entity, and based on the business environment, we may periodically move surplus capital.
We remain in the midst of 2 capital deployment initiatives: balance sheet growth and share repurchases. On the former, we expect to reach our targeted balance sheet size by the end of the current quarter. At that point, based on Q1 deposits, we would have $2 billion in off-balance sheet deposits available to onboard.
With respect to the cost of exceeding $50 billion, we completed additional work during the quarter, and our initial estimate remains intact, which is $50 million over 2 years related to the buildout, with an annual recurring component of roughly $15 million. So to justify these expenses, along with the capital required to be held against the assets, we need some combination of higher rates and an abundance of customer cash. So for the time being, we plan to hold steady under the $50 billion mark.
On share repurchases, as Paul highlighted, we are nearly halfway through the $800 million program, having picked up nearly 15 million shares at an average price of $23.81. To elaborate on our internal parameters regarding utilizing capital for repurchases, while corporate cash is a clear measure of our dry powder, we are also mindful of our consolidated Tier 1 leverage ratio, which we manage to a floor of 7%, meaning we would not utilize capital to the extent it would put us below this level. We ended the quarter with corporate cash of $482 million and consolidated Tier 1 leverage of 7.8%, which provides the ability to make substantial progress on our program.
And with that, operator, we will open the call for questions."

Would it strengthen the customer tie with our company? And so we're continuing to look. I do think the valuations make certain deals difficult, and so we evaluate that.

Good evening, and thank you for joining us to reflect on what has been a meaningful quarter for E*TRADE.

Good evening, and thank you for joining us to reflect on what has been a meaningful quarter for E*TRADE. We kicked off the year with solid play by all our lines as we posted strong results and continued to roll out enhancements to our customer offering and deployed a considerable quantum of capital to shareholders. Amidst a market environment characterized by trepidation and unease, we posted respectable growth in the business as our customers remained relatively active. Our results again benefited from the dwindling size and better-than-expected performance of our legacy loan portfolio, and we made significant progress in our premeditated march towards a $50 billion balance sheet.
Meanwhile, we began managing the bank to a lower Tier 1 leverage ratio, distributed a considerable amount of capital to the parent and continued to put capital to work for our owners.
Starting with our results. We reported net income of $153 million or $0.53 per share for the quarter. On the metrics, customer activity increased sequentially, a trend that is typical in Q1. We also traditionally expect an uptick in activity from our corporate services customers in Q1, and that trend was less pronounced, attributable to the underperformance of the market. Options contributed a steady 23% of total DARTs. Additionally, the portion of trades executed by our mobile platforms held steady at 16%. And April-to-date, DARTs are tracking down 1% from March.
In terms of sentiment, Q1 presented a bleak opening for our customers as the markets kicked off January with one of the worst starts in history. Confidence and activity improved to the quarter, and by March end, it seemed the Sumerian curtain had lifted. The sum total of this quarter's activity was solid, with our customers being net buyers of $1.2 billion of securities  while exhibiting some purposeful derisking behavior. Margin balances were dialed back by slightly over $1 billion, with balances averaging $6.7 billion and ending the period at $6.3 billion for the quarter. And April-to-date, balances are flat where they ended the quarter.
Meanwhile, we continue to post solid growth. Excluding the impact of shuttering our Hong Kong and Singapore operations, we added 45,000 net new brokerage accounts during the quarter, while our adjusted attrition rate improved to 7.3%, both of which represent our best quarterly marks in 2 years.
We had a $2.9 billion of net new brokerage assets during the quarter, healthy for Q1, but down from $3.5 billion a year ago, primarily due to lower activity from our stock plan customers. Our focus on retirement, investing and savings is present in this metric, as 1/4 of these flows were into retirement accounts.
Q1's results also included a $0.10 per share income tax benefit and some important changes to our reporting and segments, and Mr. Pizzi will elegantly walk you through each of those. There is one element I will highlight, however, which is the impact of these changes on our operating margin calculation, reducing it by about 2 percentage points, making our equivalent target 37% for this year. Also, you'll find that we present this metric both straight up and adjusted, which excludes provision for loan losses this quarter, the latter being the measure to which we manage our spending.
While we are ever mindful of the impact that provision can have on our bottom line and capital, we don't view it as a key factor governing our investments in the business. That said, a large benefit is not a license to spend nor would we ignore any meaningful charges. And with that context out of the way, we posted an adjusted operating margin of 34% in Q1, below our full year target of 37%, yet broadly in line with our expectations given the timing of balance sheet growth and seasonality in comp and advertising.
The performance of the loan portfolio exceeded our expectations, and our results included a net benefit in the charge-off line, a first for the company. We continue to benefit from recoveries along with better-than-expected performance of HELOC conversions, which we are now more than halfway through. This diminishing portfolio ended the quarter at just $4.7 billion.
On to capital, where we delivered some remarkable numbers and progress this quarter across each stage of the capital life cycle: generation, distribution and deployment. Talking about our generation of capital, we've done a lot, both from an earnings standpoint as well as through lower capital thresholds. The progress we've made acutely reflects our improved financial position and regulatory progress, which are proof-positive of all the work the entire team has done on the enterprise risk management front, the enhancements we've made to our operations and leadership team as well as the continued and marked improvement to our overall risk profile.
Concordant with our much improved stature is the freedom we've earned to internally distribute the capital we generate, continuing to benefit from improved flexibility at the bank and company-wide. This quarter, we distributed a hefty $400 million to the parent, well above our typical contribution. This included capital from the bank, both formed through earnings and liberated through the 100 basis point drop in our target leverage ratio and capital from our brokers from the earnings of our introducing broker and the extraction of excess capital from our dealing broker.
One related element of note. While we achieved a reduction in our bank leverage ratio to 8%, well ahead of our original plan, we have our sights set on continued improvement to our capital efficiency there and aim to manage closer to 7.5% in early 2017. This, of course, is our aspiration and would require regulatory approval.
On capital deployment, we exceeded $350 million in cumulative share repurchased during the quarter, putting us nearly halfway through our current authorization just a few months after embarking on the program. While market dislocations during the quarter presented us with opportunities to be aggressive buyers of our stock, we aim to continue buybacks at a more modest pace with an eye on completing the current $800 million program by year-end. We are devotees of buybacks, as they allow us to return capital to shareholders efficiently and with low risk.
With regard to additional capital deployment, we're progressing on growing our balance sheet to $49.5 billion, adding $2.5 billion during the period. We intend to reach our target size this quarter.
In exploring other avenues to put capital to work, we continue to focus on growth, with acquisition as one method to achieve that goal. This quarter we sharpened our focus, and I'd to walk through our current thinking. We believe scale acquisitions in the brokerage space make the most sense. We also look for opportunities to bolster our capabilities through acquisition in consideration of our retirement, investing and savings vertical as well as our corporate services channel. However, we continually evaluate build versus buy on this front.
Specific to acquisitions in the banking space, our areas of focus include: innovative financial technology within custody and payment services; and trust and wealth management offerings, to the extent we find a logical fit in support of our current strategy.
Now we certainly understand there's been significant investor interest around acquisitions that could result in credit exposure, and I'd like to summarize our present thinking on this. To the extent we would consider taking on credit exposure through acquisition, it would have to exceed a substantially higher hurdle for returns to ensure the benefits and associated risks would truly be worthy of our owners' capital and management's time. To make this point very clear, we will not explore acquisitions in a traditional banking model unless it is overwhelmingly compelling for shareholders. We have come too far as a company to go around the bend by assuming unwarranted risk through an injudicious acquisition.
We also continue to evaluate other options for capital deployment, including share repurchases beyond our current program and balance sheet growth beyond $50 billion. Mr. Pizzi will provide color on how we measure these options.
With respect to enhancements and rollouts, Q1 was a busy quarter. To cover a few of the highlights, we continued to expand our industry-leading mobile offerings as we incorporated customer feedback to increase customization capabilities on the mobile dashboard. As mobile continues to become a channel for long-term investors as much as for Active Traders, we also introduced a mobile retirement center, helping customers plan their retirement savings with a calculator tool and easily open an IRA or roll over an existing 401(k) account.
On our website, we upgraded our income estimator tool, which now provides an improved logic that can be applied to securities within a watch list and can seamlessly send any stock, ETF or mutual fund through for execution. Most recently, we rolled out a new dashboard in E*TRADE Pro, creating a home base for our most Active Traders to attract the markets, manage their portfolios and much more in a consolidated manner.
We have a pipeline of great tools, features and new experiences in store for our customers this year, so stay tuned. I look forward to sharing more with you.
We've just emerged from our industry's award season with an ample assortment of accolades, receiving high marks from Barron's and NerdWallet; 9 best-in-class distinctions from StockBrokers.com, which includes earning the #1 mobile app; 3 gold awards from Corporate Insight; and an honoree designation from the Webby Awards.
Our industry also witnessed one of the more impactful pieces of overreaching regulations seen in recent history, the Department of Labor's ruling on the applicability of the fiduciary standard. First, I want to state unequivocally that we support efforts to advance the best interest of retail investors, and we'll work within the new regulatory guidelines to continue to deliver guidance on our customers' terms and provide services that help investors take control of their financial health.
We're also pleased that the DOL heeded many of the industry's concerns regarding the initial draft, delivering a final rule that is less burdensome than originally proposed. And we believe as a matter of principle that all who serve the retail investors should be held to the highest standards when it comes to working in their best interest. At the same time, we believe this pursuit must be balanced against ensuring investors continue to have seamless access to investment support and the greatest variety of financial choices at their disposal to help them trade, invest and save.
We're still working through the ruling's significance but are confident it will have minimal impact on our ability to properly serve our customers.
On the leadership front, I'm very pleased to welcome an addition to our executive suite, as we concluded our comprehensive search for a new Chief Risk Officer earlier this month, appointing Ms. Ellen Koebler to the post. With a risk management career spanning nearly 2 decades at a handful of large and complex financial institutions, Ellen brings considerable firepower to this crucial function and to our Executive Committee.
As Ellen comes onboard, our unassailable acting CRO and the original architect of E*TRADE's risk organization, Mr. Paul Brandow, has graciously agreed to stay on in an advisory capacity to me and the entire executive team. I'm happy to know we'll continue to benefit from his sage perspective and consummate insight.
In closing, as I think about 2016, we have a lot of exciting things in the works on the customer experience front, and we'll continue to ruthlessly pursue the best path forward on capital deployment. I look forward to keeping you apprised.
And with that, I will turn it over to our sedulous CFO, Mr. Pizzi."
27807,330346460,961521,"E*TRADE Financial Corporation, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2016",2016-04-21,"Earnings Calls","E*TRADE Financial, LLC","Executives","Thank you, Mr. Idzik.For the quarter, we reported adjusted net income of $122 million or $0.43 per share. This excludes $31 million or a 10% per share tax benefit related to the release of a valuation allowance against state-deferred tax assets. Our res",1689,"Thank you, Mr. Idzik.
For the quarter, we reported adjusted net income of $122 million or $0.43 per share. This excludes $31 million or a 10% per share tax benefit related to the release of a valuation allowance against state-deferred tax assets. Our results compare to $89 million or $0.30 per share in the prior quarter. It also compares to adjusted net income of $85 million or $0.29 per share in the year ago quarter, which excludes the loss on early extinguishment of corporate debt.
Before I delve into the details of our income statement, I'd like to review the changes we made to our reporting this quarter. For those of you following along, these changes are laid out graphically in our quarterly financial supplement on about.etrade.com under the Quarterly Earnings section. There, you will also find realigned financials going back through 2014. I'll refer to those during this call.
We consolidated our business segments and realigned both our income statement and yield table, all of which are reflective of how we currently manage the business.
As for the specifics, beginning with segment reporting. We collapsed our operating segments and are now presenting only consolidated financial results. With the vast majority of our legacy costs in the rearview mirror and the management of our balance sheet now focused solely on maximizing the value of customer deposits, we thought it was the right time to wave goodbye to the balance sheet management segment as well as the corporate category. We also realigned our income statement, moving our below-the-line items into revenue and expenses. Most notable among those changes is that corporate interest expense is now included in net interest income.
Additionally, other income and expense was moved into the gains and losses on securities and other revenue line, and losses on early extinguishment of debt are now included within the noninterest expense section.
Taking a deeper dive into net interest income, we are now reporting net interest margin as opposed to spread. After all, most of you already call it NIM.
Now on to the result. Revenue for the quarter were $472 million, up from $439 million in the prior quarter, attributable to higher net interest income, as both net interest margin and balance sheet size increased sequentially, and up from $441 million in the year ago quarter as a result of the termination of wholesale borrowings, the Fed rate hike and the corporate debt reduction and refinance.
Net interest income of $287 million improved $17 million from the prior quarter, driven by a 7 basis point improvement in the net interest margin on a $1.4 billion larger average interest-earning balance sheet. Our net interest margin of 281 basis points increased as a result of the full quarter impact of the Fed rate hike coupled with slower prepayment speeds on the securities portfolio, but was partially offset by lower margin balances.
Because we guided to spread on our last call, I'll tell you that based on our prior reporting, our spread for the quarter would have been 294 basis points, meaning we significantly outperformed our expectations of high 270s.
As for our expectations for the full year, holding the Fed funds rate constant and doing the same to margin balances, we expect our net interest margin for the full year to be in the 260 to 265 basis point range. Adjusted for the reporting changes, this is consistent with our previous guidance. Note that our significant outperformance in Q1 is offsetting our expectation for NIM to contract in the remainder of the year. For Q2 specifically, we expect it to land in the mid-260s.
Commissions, fees and service charges and other revenue were $175 million, up $15 million from the prior quarter and down just modestly versus the year ago quarter. Two main factors contributed to the fluctuations. First, customer activity increased 12% versus Q4 but decreased 3% versus the year ago period; and second, improved rates on off-balance sheet cash helped drive increases in fees and service charges relative to both periods.
On the latter, the average rate earned on off-balance sheet cash was 30 basis points in Q1, up 17 basis points from Q4 as a result of the full quarter impact of the December rate hike. Keep in mind, this is a gross number. So net of the fees paid to our third-party platform administrator, we earned 24 basis points on average in the period.
Average commission per trade of $10.64 declined $0.02 from the prior quarter and $0.30 from the year ago quarter. The year-over-year decline was driven by a lower contribution from stock plan customer trades and fewer options contracts per trade.
Securities and other gains were $10 million, flat with the prior quarter. For the full year, we expect gains to be in the $30 million to $40 million range.
Noninterest expense for the quarter was $312 million, up $7 million from the prior quarter, which included $14 million in nonrecurring charges. Excluding those items, the $21 million sequential increase was driven primarily by compensation and benefits, which reflect the full quarter impact of hires we made in Q4 as well as seasonality related to compensation.
We remain highly attuned to the operating environment and the impact it has on how we manage our expenses. As Paul mentioned, for the quarter, our adjusted operating margin was 34%. Our target for the year remains 37%, the equivalent of 39% prior to our reporting changes. For Q2 specifically, we expect expenses to decrease approximately $10 million sequentially, primarily related to lower marketing spend.
Provision for the quarter was a benefit of $34 million, needless to say, better than we expected. Net charge-offs were also positive at $3 million of recoveries, resulting in a $31 million reduction in the allowance to $322 million. Meanwhile, the overall portfolio itself reduced by $284 million or 6% to $4.7 billion.
In addition to the positive impact of recoveries, our provision benefit also reflected better-than-expected performance on converted HELOCs that were previously classified as high risk and had been reserved for -- and reserved for using the full life-of-loan loss expectation. This includes balloon loans, of which there are just $25 million remaining, the vast majority of which will convert in the current quarter.
In total, we had $213 million of HELOCs convert to amortizing loans during Q1, which has -- puts us more than halfway through the conversions. Performance in Q1 was consistent with the observations we discussed last quarter, where the default rate on the converting loan is about twice that of a nonconverting loan at approximately 12%. So while we have been pleasantly surprised by performance to date, please keep in mind that we have a sizable pipeline of conversions through Q1 of next year. For this reason, we expect our provision to be approximately 0, with the caveat that recoveries of greater-than-expected magnitude could again result in a provision benefit.
One final note on the P&L, regarding the tax benefit we recorded this quarter. With the move of our broker-dealers behind us, we took a hard look at our organizational alignment and found an opportunity to reinstate the tax treatment of our broker-dealers prior to moving them under the bank. The tax election resulted in the release of valuation allowance against the associated state-deferred tax assets. We are always looking for ways to deliver for shareholders, and we're pleased to come -- to uncover additional value in this pursuit.
Moving on to capital. We distributed nearly $400 million up to the parent during the quarter comprising the following: $248 million from the bank, which included $97 million from the prior quarter's net income and $151 million as a result of our reduced bank leverage ratio; and $148 million from the brokers, which included $24 million of excess capital generation at the introducing broker as well as $124 million from the clearing broker.
In the second quarter, we expect total dividends to the parent of approximately $190 million from the bank and brokers. Starting with the bank. Since balance sheet growth consumes bank capital and directly impacts our leverage ratio, in Q2, we will request an $85 million dividend to the parent, which is below the prior quarter bank net income of $108 million.
From the introducing broker, we anticipate $27 million to the parent as part of the standard quarterly distribution. And from the clearing broker, we plan to move $75 million. We continually assess the capital position of the entity, and based on the business environment, we may periodically move surplus capital.
We remain in the midst of 2 capital deployment initiatives: balance sheet growth and share repurchases. On the former, we expect to reach our targeted balance sheet size by the end of the current quarter. At that point, based on Q1 deposits, we would have $2 billion in off-balance sheet deposits available to onboard.
With respect to the cost of exceeding $50 billion, we completed additional work during the quarter, and our initial estimate remains intact, which is $50 million over 2 years related to the buildout, with an annual recurring component of roughly $15 million. So to justify these expenses, along with the capital required to be held against the assets, we need some combination of higher rates and an abundance of customer cash. So for the time being, we plan to hold steady under the $50 billion mark.
On share repurchases, as Paul highlighted, we are nearly halfway through the $800 million program, having picked up nearly 15 million shares at an average price of $23.81. To elaborate on our internal parameters regarding utilizing capital for repurchases, while corporate cash is a clear measure of our dry powder, we are also mindful of our consolidated Tier 1 leverage ratio, which we managed to a floor of 7%, meaning we would not utilize capital to the extent it would put us below this level. We ended the quarter with corporate cash of $482 million and consolidated Tier 1 leverage of 7.8%, which provides the ability to make substantial progress on our program.
And with that, operator, we will open the call for questions."

And so that elevated recovery number that we see that's really been -- really very influential in the last few quarters is very difficult to forecast on a go-forward basis.

Just wanted to get your sense on what environment that might be. And then, on the strategic side, it seems like there's a ton going on in financials in the tech area or fintech. On one hand, it seems like that's the pricier area, but on the other hand, it's obviously where the industry is going. And so I just wanted to get your thoughts on how quickly can you build something versus having to acquire something and vice versa? Is there are a lot of demand out there for a financial services company for -- or on the tech side, meaning tech firms looking at financial service firms to kind of grow in that space?"

I mean, clearly, you want to have a quantum of cash that makes it worth your while to earn on that cash. Because the costs are the same, whether you're at $51 billion or $61 billion. And the rate environment, obviously, makes it easier to jump more quickly. Just do the math. With regard to looking at fintech opportunities, I think the question for us continues to be, how quickly can we deploy something across our customer base? And would it bring incremental revenues? Would it strengthen the customer tie with our company? And so we're continuing to look. I do think the valuations make certain deals difficult, and so we evaluate that. But speed to market is important. And I'm not all that familiar, I presume some of your guys would be more familiar than I am with a lot of fintech firms looking at actually acquiring something that's going to get them nicely regulated, to the degree that I don't think they can even possibly imagine. So that'd be my way of looking at it."

Good evening, and thank you for spending some time with us. We had a productive quarter marked by a number of accomplishments in both the customer facing and financial fronts. We launched one of our most compelling offerings in recent history,",1537,"Thank you. Good evening, and thank you for spending some time with us. We had a productive quarter marked by a number of accomplishments in both the customer facing and financial fronts. We launched one of our most compelling offerings in recent history, we generated healthy levels of capital, while marching forward on our capital deployment initiatives, and the investment made to strengthen our platforms in infrastructure, again proved their worth as we handled the flurry of Brexit-inspired customer activity without getting onto a sticky wicket. Meanwhile, on an industry level, we managed the challenges of the revenue environment, while progressing our work related to the Department of Labor fiduciary standard. 
starting with our results. We reported net income of $133 million or $0.48 per share for the quarter. We again had a sizable benefit to the provisional line, led by a solid nonperformance and outsized recoveries. This recoveries are phenomenon which is difficult to predict, but can dramatically impact the portfolio as seasoned as ours. On the customer activity front, metrics remain healthy, largely reflecting seasonality relative to the prior quarter. Training activities declined throughout the period, but experienced a spike surrounding the courageous U.K. vote to leave the European Union, when our customers took advantage of the dip in the equity markets to the tune of $1.1 billion of net buying during the single trading day, the highest on record. The significant attention we placed on strengthening our infrastructure over the past several years enabled our platforms to handle these elevated volumes with room to spare. For the entire quarter, a record 17% of DARTs were executive by our mobile platforms. And July to date, DARTs are currently tracking down 1% from June.
Margin balances, which had slowed edged down through our Q1, ended the second quarter up at $6.8 billion. The majority of the $0.5 billion increase was a Brexit bolstered spike, so the quarter's average was lower at $6.5 billion. In July to date, balances have tapered to $6.4 billion.
We had a 23,000 net new accounts in Q2, down from Q1 solid 45,000. Adjusted new accounts in last year's 25,000. Our attrition rate of 8.3% remain encouraging for the quarter, while an increase from a near-record adjusted 7.3% in the prior quarter, a decrease from adjusted 8.7% a year ago. We also attracted $1.6 billion in net new brokerage assets, reflecting our strongest Q2 in several years, but down sequentially on typical tax-related outflows in April. We made meaningful enhancement to the customer experience this quarter. On the product front, portfolio our robust solution is the most important new product launch in some time. While still very early days from our June launch, we are pleased with the adoptions, having amassed more than 100 million of assets under management in the program, including legacy managed account balances converted upon launch. The offering stands out in a few ways. First, it provides our customer the option of combining active and passive management, a new concept for auto investing space, which has relied on passive-only portfolios. Second, it falls between our pure digital and managed account solutions, delivering a best in class digital experience combined with access to financial consultants when customers have questions and want to discuss the portfolio selected by the online tool. Third, at circa 1% below cash allocation, means customer put to work for them through there investments, while keeping just enough cash to rebalance and service the portfolio as necessary. And last, consistent with our unbiased approach to providing our customers with the solution right for their own needs, we have no proprietary products within our model portfolios. So the investments available to customers are selected to be the best for each particular portfolio construction, and not just the best to happen to carry our name. Importantly, the solution serves longer-term retirement investing and savings dollars, so it is an important component of our ongoing efforts to increase share wallet among our existing customer base. Additionally, we found that as customers and prospects are navigating the portfolio experience, they are also looking at other offerings leading to increased activity and self-directed account openings. 
over to our corporate services channels, we are in a midst of rolling out a completely redesigned stock plan experience. We have long had an edge in this business because of our top rated platform, Equity Edge Online. However, over the part 3 years, we have been acutely focused on further improving both the B2B and B2C elements of this channel. This rollout presents planned participants with a more streamlined, intuitive and engaging experience. We always strive to surprise and delight our customers when it comes to stock plan participants getting the digital experience right is essential. We understand deeply that these participants are not your typical investor, often joining us with financial knowledge of less developed than what we find with mainstream E*TRADE  customers. Further, stock plan benefits are complicated, so the more we can do educate and engage these participants, the more they value to this component of their compensation, and thus appropriately their employer for providing it. This is no small responsibility, and what we take extremely seriously.
In terms of industry accolades, we recognized by this quarter and by any overview of online brokers, earning high marks in tools and ease of use, as well as first place for mobile, a platform which is increasingly important to our customers and where we frequently stand out from the crowd. 
Expenses for the quarter were $295 million, down $17 million from Q1, primary due to advertising, driving our adjusted operating margin, which excludes provision to 38% from 34%. In the face of a progressively challenging interest-rate environment, we remain committed to keeping our expenses appropriately sized and continue to expect a 37% adjusted operative margin for the full year, factors.
On the capital front, we continue to execute on both of our deployment initiatives, putting a $151 million to work, repurchasing our common stock, ending the quarter nearly 2/3 the way through our $800 million program, and continuing to grow the balance sheet, ending the quarter at $49.2 billion, closely approaching our target of $49.5 billion. And form what's next, we continue to dedicate a lot of time and energy to this question, considering share repurchase beyond their current program, evaluating growth through acquisition and examining balance sheet growth beyond our current target. Regarding that final point, we have been very clear that in order to justify the compliance costs and achieve appropriate returns on capital, we need combination of high interest rates and a more sizable quantum of deposits to allow us to pounce constantly over the $50 billion threshold. Today with interest rate unlike to rise in the near-term and our current level of available off-balance sheet deposits at about $2 billion, we have planned to dance below the line as crossing would equate to more of a tiptoe than the pounce. However, with industry form making money markets fund to suboptimal sweep vehicle for customers, the team is working to convert approximately $4 billion or substantially all of our money market funds into our cash program, thus increasing about potential balance sheet size to above $55 billion. While there is still boxes to check, we already have regulatory approval and we to complete this conversion in September. With that move, we anticipate crossing $50 billion in the first half of next year. Mr.  will provide update on the particulars and the cost to conduct the pounds. 
Moving on to the DOL standards, we made significant headway this quarter working through this overreaching rule, which is proved rather in nature and shrouded with ambiguity. I'm pleased to report that we completed much of the analysis and are moving on to implementation. This was no small task, and I commend the internal team that worked diligently to get us where we are. We do anticipate additional cost as we work through the implementation phase, including those related to third-party assistance, industry experts and council, digital enhancements to adopt the rule in our platform and increased legal and compliance costs. Importantly, we are well-positioned to be fully compliant within the DOL state of implementation days, and these expenses are included within our target operating margin for the year.
And now, a note on A couple of weeks ago, we further strengthened our board with addition of Kevin Kevin's extensive background in financial services at our Board, which now stands at 12 members. Kevin spent more than 30 years in the industry, including the last 8 years as CEO of Bank Corp. In addition, he has experience in a number of boards, both public companies, insurable organizations. We are fortunate to benefit from his insights, particularly as we position the company to cross $50 billion. 
So in summary, it's been a solid first half of the year, and while I'm pleased with where we stand, we have plenty to accomplish on capital deployment, growth, expense management and our primary mandate, which is to serve the retail investor. On all fronts, I'm excited about what's in store for the remainder of this year. And with that, I will turn it over to our CFO, Mr. Pizzi."

For the quarter, we reported net income of a $133 million or $0.48 per share.

For the quarter, we reported net income of a $133 million or $0.48 per share. This compares to adjusted net income of $122 million or $0.43 per share in the prior quarter, which excludes the $31 million income tax benefit. It also compares to adjusted net income of $72 million or $0.25 per share in the year-ago quarter, which excludes the $220 million income tax benefit. Revenues for the quarter were $474 million, up $2 million from the prior quarter, largely related to higher yields on customer assets held by third parties, and up $45 million from the year-ago quarter, largely attributable to the benefits from our wholesale termination and the Fed rate hike. Net interest income was $286 million for the quarter, down $1 million from the prior quarter as a 17 basis point reduction in net interest margin was mostly offset by a $2.5 billion larger average balance sheet. Our net interest margin of 264 basis points decreased as we put money to work growing our balance sheet in rate environment and as average margin balances contracted. The rate environment is certainly impacting us, with our average reinvestment rate now in the range of 150 to 175 basis points. We continue to expect our full year net interest margin to be 260 to 265 basis points, with the back half of the year in the mid-250s. This also assumes no change in the Fed fund's rate and that margin balances remain constant with their current level. Commission, fees and service charges and other revenue were $178 million, up $3 million from the prior quarter and up $11 million versus the year-ago quarter. Compared to Q1, commissions revenue decreased $1 million as lower trading activity was offset by higher average commission, per trade, which increased $0.18 to $10.82, driven by a higher portion of stock plan customer traits and more options contracts per trade. Relative to the year-ago quarter, commissions revenue increased $3 million on higher trading activity, partially offset by a $0.14 decline in the average commission related to higher mix of active traders. Fees and service charges revenue increased relative to both the prior quarter and the year-ago quarter, primarily attributable to the higher fees and higher yield on customer assets held by third parties. This quarter, the average yield on those assets was 41 basis points, up 11 basis points from Q1. As Paul mentioned, we expect to convert approximately $4 billion of money market funds into our cash program in September. Securities and other gains were $10 million, flat with the prior quarter. For the full year, we expect gains to be at the high-end of our $30 million to $40 million range. Noninterest expenses for the quarter was $295 million, down $17 million sequentially, with the biggest driver being a seasonal decline in marketing. Expenses were about $7 million below our expectations due to a further up marketing in response to the environment and a small benefit running through expense. Our adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 38%, up from 34% in Q1 as revenues were slightly and expenses decreased significantly. Our commitment to manage to an operating margin requires us to our expense closely. And while our operating margin improved, there is much more work to do as our revenue continues to face environment headwinds from low interest rates.
With the rational expense structure already in place and a discipline-to-marketing spend, we are committed to regularly productivity, where output can be achieved with resources. While this effort is ongoing, the current revenue environment makes our commitment to respond all the more important, and we're steadfast in supporting our operating margin target of 37% for the year. 
Moving on to the provision line. We recorded a benefit of $35 million for the quarter, once again better-than-expected. Net charge-offs were positive at $6 million of recoveries, contributed to the $29 million reduction in the allowance of $293 million. While the overall portfolio reduced by $300 million or 6%, ending the quarter at $4.4 billion.
Recoveries continue to be a significant factor propelling provision benefit. As we have said in the past, recoveries in the recapture previously charge-offs loans are exceptionally difficult to predict and can meaningfully swing our results. We also continue to benefit from better-than-expected performance of high risk loans that have been  reserved for the full life of loan. This quarter, we had a relatively small amount of new conversions at just about 50 million. Overall, the performance of conversions remains consistent, with an average rate of approximately 12%, about twice that of a nonconverting loan. At this point, about $0.7 million or 45% of the HELOC portfolio has yet to convert. Nearly all of those occur over the next 3 quarters, with a fairly even distribution across each. So while we are pleased with the performance of HELOC conversions to date, we have a sizable amount left to convert, and we do expect losses to increase as a result. We believe we are adequately reserved for the losses and thus expect provision to be 0 the remainder of the year, with the caveat that many of the variables I just covered, can have a meaningful impact on the provision result. 
Moving on to capital. We distributed $190 million up to the during the quarter comprising the following. $85 million from the bank, which is below Q1 net income of $108 million, as we utilized capital to fund balance sheet growth, and $102 million from the brokers, comprising $27 million from the introducing broker and $75 million from the clearing broker. In Q3, we expect total dividend to the parent of roughly $125 million, which includes $40 million from the banks, again below current quarter bank net income of $106 million, as we will use capital in Q3 for balance sheet growth. $57 million from the introducing broker and $28 million from a clearing broker. As with last quarter's move, capital is being released from have as it have reduced.
We're currently in the process of merging our 2 broker-dealers. So starting in the fourth quarter, we will have a single brokerage entity to distribute capital to the parent. Without going into too much detail, the entities were separated about 15 years ago for operational reasons that are no longer relevant. The combined entity will streamline our organizational structure and regulatory oversight. In terms of capital, we expect future distributions to be consistent with that historically distributed out of the introducing broker. 
So on to capital generation. We ended the quarter with strong measures at both the bank and parent. The bank's leverage issue ended the quarter at 8.2%, above our current 8% target. Keep in mind, that we intend to seek approval to lower this targets to 7.5% early next year. At the parent, we ended the quarter with Tier 1 leverage issue of 7.5%, above our minimum of 7%. And the other metric by which we measure available capital cash ended the quarter at $523 million, well above our minimum of $100 million or 2 years of debt service coverage. So we are in a strong position to continue deploying capital. 
We remain active on that front in the quarter, repurchasing a 151 million of our common stock and growing the balance sheet by $1.3 billion. We have now completed more than $500 million of our 800 million share repurchase program, having repurchase 5.9 million shares during the quarter and 20.6 million over the course of the entire programs at an average price of $24.34. On balance sheet growth, we ended the quarter at $49.2 billion, just shy of our current target of $49.5 billion of consolidated assets. To expand on Paul's comments regarding our plans to exceed $50 billion in the first half of next year, after converting the money market funds to our program in September, on a pro forma basis, we have approximately $6 billion of deposits readily available to bring on balance sheet, assuming no organic growth between now and then. That amount puts crossing $50 billion squarely within economic reach. From a capital perspective, we anticipate funding this growth through earnings and a lower bank Tier 1 leverage threshold. There are host of reporting changes and filing we will enjoy with our increased size, all of which we're currently digging through. We will provide updates on these on future calls.
With respect to incurring the expenses related to crossings, it is still too early to assign precision to timing, however, our rought estimates assume $50 million related to the build-out, with around $5 million incurred in the second half of this year and the remainder evenly spend in 2017 and 2018, and the running cost of approximately $15 million per year will start to occur in 2017 with a full run rate in 2018. Needless to say, with the right amount of deposit at our disposables, the returns are quite campaigning and we're excited to unshackle our growth. And with that operator, we will open the call for questions."

Good evening, and thank you for spending some time with us. We had a productive quarter marked by a number of accomplishments on both the customer-facing and financial fronts. We launched one of our most compelling offerings in recent history.",1577,"Thank you. Good evening, and thank you for spending some time with us. We had a productive quarter marked by a number of accomplishments on both the customer-facing and financial fronts. We launched one of our most compelling offerings in recent history. We generated healthy levels of capital while marching forward on our capital deployment initiatives. And the investment made to strengthen our platforms in infrastructure again proved their worth as we handled the flurry of Brexit-inspired customer activity without getting onto a sticky wicket. Meanwhile, on an industry level, we gutfully [ph] managed the challenges of the revenue environment while progressing our work related to the Department of Labor fiduciary standard. 
Starting with our results. We reported net income of $133 million or $0.48 per share for the quarter. We again had a sizable benefit to the provision line, led by a solid loan performance and outsized recoveries. These recoveries are a phenomenon which is difficult to predict, but can dramatically impact the portfolio as seasoned as ours. 
On the customer activity front, metrics remained healthy, largely reflecting seasonality relative to the prior quarter. Training activities declined throughout the period, but experienced a spike surrounding the courageous U.K. vote to leave the European Union when our customers took advantage of the dip in the equity markets to the tune of $1.1 billion of net buying during a single trading day, the highest on record. 
The significant attention we placed on strengthening our infrastructure over the past several years enabled our platforms to handle these elevated volumes with room to spare. For the entire quarter, a record 17% of DARTs were executed by our mobile platforms. In July to date, DARTs are currently tracking down 1% from June.
Margin balances, which had slowed edged down throughout Q1, ended the second quarter up at $6.8 billion. The majority of the $0.5 billion increase was a Brexit-bolstered spike. So the quarter's average was lower at $6.5 billion. In July to date, balances have tapered to $6.4 billion.
We had a 23,000 net new accounts in Q2, down from Q1 solid 45,000, adjusted to new accounts in last year's 25,000. Our attrition rate of 8.3% remain encouraging for the quarter, while an increase from a near-record adjusted 7.3% in the prior quarter, a decrease from an adjusted 8.7% a year ago. We also attracted $1.6 billion in net new brokerage assets, reflecting our strongest Q2 in several years, but down sequentially on typical tax-related outflows in April. 
We made meaningful enhancements to the customer experience this quarter. On the product front, Adaptive portfolio, our robo solution, is the most important new product launch in some time. While still very early days from our June launch, we are pleased with adoptions thus far, having amassed more than 100 million of assets under management in the program, including legacy managed account balances converted upon launch. 
The offering stands out in a few ways. First, it provides our customers the option of combining active and passive management, a new concept for the auto investing space, which has traditionally relied on passive-only portfolios. Second, it falls between our pure digital and managed account solutions, delivering a best-in-class digital experience, combined with access to financial consultants when customers have questions or want to discuss the portfolio selected by the online tool. Third, at circa 1%, below cash allocation means customers' moneys being put to work for them through their investments while keeping just enough cash to rebalance and service the portfolio as necessary. And last, consistent with our unbiased approach to providing our customers with the solutions right for their own needs, we have no proprietary products within our model portfolios. So the investments available to customers are selected to be the best for each particular portfolio construction, and not just the best but happen to carry our name. 
Importantly, the solution serves longer-term retirement investing and savings dollars, so it is an important component of our ongoing efforts to increase share of wallet among our existing customer base. Additionally, we found that as customers and prospects are navigating the Adaptive portfolio experience, they are also looking at our other offerings, leading to increased activity and self-directed account openings. 
Transitioning over to our Corporate Services channel, we are in a midst of rolling out a completely redesigned stock plan participant experience. We have long had an edge in this business because of our top-rated platform, Equity Edge Online. However, over the past 3 years, we have been acutely focused on further improving both the B2B and B2C elements of this channel. This rollout presents planned participants with a more streamlined, intuitive and engaging experience. 
We always strive to surprise and delight our customers, but when it comes to the stock plan participant, getting the digital experience right is essential. We understand deeply that these participants are not your typical investor, often joining us with financial knowledge less developed than what we find with mainstream E*TRADE  customers. Further, stock plan benefits are complicated, so the more we can do to educate and engage these participants, the more they may value this component of their compensation, and thus appropriately value their employer for providing it. This is no small responsibility and one we take extremely seriously.
In terms of industry accolades, we were recognized by Kiplinger's this quarter entered by annual review of online brokers, earning high marks in tools and ease of use as well as first place for Mobile, a platform which is increasingly important to our customers and where we frequently standout from the crowd. 
Expenses for the quarter were $295 million, down $17 million from Q1, primarily due to seasonality in advertising, driving our adjusted operating margin, which excludes provision, to 38% from 34%. In the face of a progressively challenging interest rate environment, we remain committed to keeping our expenses appropriately sized and continue to expect a 37% adjusted operating margin for the full year, barring exogenous factors.
On the capital front, we continue to execute on both of our deployment initiatives, putting a $151 million to work, repurchasing our common stock, ending the quarter nearly 2/3 the way through our $800 million program; and continuing to grow the balance sheet, ending the quarter at $49.2 billion, closely approaching our target of $49.5 billion. 
And for what's next, we continue to dedicate a lot of time and energy to this question, considering share repurchase beyond their current program, evaluating growth through enrichment through acquisition and examining balance sheet growth beyond our current target. Regarding that final point, we have been very clear that in order to justify the compliance costs and achieve appropriate returns on capital, we need some combination of higher interest rates and a more sizable quantum of deposits to allow us to pounce constantly over the $50 billion threshold. 
Today, with interest rates unlikely to rise in the near term and our current level of available off-balance sheet deposits at about $2 billion, we've planned to asymptotically dance below the nifty 50-line as crossing would equate to more of a tiptoe than a pounce. However, with industry form making money market fund to suboptimal sweep vehicle for customers, the team is working to convert approximately $4 billion or substantially all of our money market funds into our cash program, thus increasing our potential balance sheet size to above $55 billion. 
While there's still boxes to check, we already have regulatory approval, and we intend to complete this conversion in September. With that move, we anticipate crossing $50 billion in the first half of next year. Mr. Pizzi will provide an update on the particulars and the costs to conduct the Pizzi pounce.
Moving on to the DOL fiduciary standards, we made significant headway this quarter working through this overreaching rule, which is proved rather too strained in nature and shrouded with ambiguity. I'm pleased to report that we completed much of the analysis and are moving on to implementation. This was no small task, and I commend the internal teams that worked so diligently to get us where we are. We do anticipate additional costs as we work through the implementation phase, including those related to third-party assistance, industry experts and council, digital enhancements to adopt the rule in our platform and increased legal and compliance costs. Importantly, we are well positioned to be fully compliant within the DOL state of implementation days, and these expenses are included within our target operating margin for the year.
And now a note on governance. A couple of weeks ago, we further strengthened our board with the addition of Kevin Kabat. Kevin's extensive background in financial services rounds up our board, which now stands at 12 members. Kevin spent more than 30 years in the industry, including the last 8 years as CEO of Fifth Third Bancorp. In addition, he has experience in a number of boards, both public companies and charitable organizations. We are fortunate to benefit from his insights, particularly as we position the company to cross $50 billion. 
So in summary, it's been a solid first half of the year. And while I'm pleased with where we stand, we have plenty to accomplish on capital deployment, growth, expense management and our primary mandate, which is to serve the retail investor. On all fronts, I'm excited about what's in store for the remainder of this year. 
And with that, I will turn it over to our sapient CFO, Mr. Pizzi."

It also compares to adjusted net income of $72 million or $0.25 per share in the year-ago quarter, which excludes a $220 million income tax benefit. 
Revenues for the quarter were $474 million, up $2 million from the prior quarter, largely related to higher yields on customer assets held by third parties; and up $45 million from the year-ago quarter, largely attributable to the benefits from our wholesale funding termination and the Fed rate hike. 
Net interest income was $286 million for the quarter, down $1 million from the prior quarter as a 17-basis-point reduction in net interest margin was mostly offset by a $2.5 billion larger average balance sheet. Our net interest margin of 264 basis points decreased as we put money to work growing our balance sheet in unspectacular rate environment and as average margin balances contracted. 
The rate environment is certainly impacting us, with our average reinvestment rate now in the range of 150 to 175 basis points. We continue to expect our full year net interest margin to be 260 to 265 basis points, with the back half of the year in the mid-250s. This also assumes no change in the Fed fund's rate, and that margin balances remain constant with their current level. 
Commission, fees and service charges and other revenues were $178 million, up $3 million from the prior quarter and up $11 million versus the year-ago quarter. Compared to Q1, commissions revenue decreased $1 million as lower trading activity was offset by higher average commission, per trade, which increased $0.18 to $10.82, driven by a higher portion of stock plan customer trades and more options contracts per trade. Relative to the year-ago quarter, commissions revenue increased $3 million on higher trading activity, partially offset by a $0.14 decline in the average commission related to a higher mix of active traders. 
Fees and service charges revenue increased relative to both the prior quarter and the year-ago quarter, primarily attributable to higher re-org fees and higher yields on customer assets held by third parties. This quarter, the average yield on these assets was 41 basis points, up 11 basis points from Q1. As Paul mentioned, we expect to convert approximately $4 billion of money market funds into our cash sweep program in September. 
Securities and other gains were $10 million, flat with the prior quarter. For the full year, we expect gains to be near the high-end of our $30 million to $40 million range. 
Noninterest expense for the quarter was $295 million, down $17 million sequentially, with the biggest driver being a seasonal decline in marketing. Expenses were about $7 million below our expectations due to a further pull-back in marketing in response to the environment and a small benefit running through communications expense. 
Our adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 38%, up from 34% in Q1 as revenues were slightly and expenses decreased significantly. Our commitment to manage to an operating margin requires us to govern our expense days closely. And while our operating margin improved, there is much more work to do as our revenue continues to face environmental headwinds from low interest rates.
With the rational expense structure already in place and a discipline to marketing spend, we are committed to regularly reviewing productivity, where output can be achieved with leaner resources. While this effort is ongoing, the current revenue environment makes our commitment to respond all the more important. And we are steadfast in supporting our operating margin target of 37% for the year. 
Moving on to the provision line. We recorded a benefit of $35 million for the quarter, once again better than expected. Net charge-offs were positive at $6 million of recoveries, contributed to the $29 million reduction in the allowance of $293 million; while the overall portfolio reduced by $300 million or 6%, ending the quarter at $4.4 billion.
Recoveries continue to be a significant factor propelling provision benefit. As we have said in the past, recoveries in the recapture of previously charge-offs loans are exceptionally difficult to predict and can meaningfully swing our results. We also continue to benefit from better-than-expected performance of high-risk loans that have been  reserved for the full life of loan. 
This quarter, we had a relatively small amount of HELOC conversions at just over 50 million. Overall, the performance of conversions remains consistent, with an average default rate of approximately 12%, about twice that of a nonconverting loan. 
At this point, about $0.7 billion or 45% of the HELOC portfolio has yet to convert. Nearly all of those occur over the next 3 quarters, with a fairly even distribution across each. So while we are pleased with the performance of HELOC conversions to date, we have a sizable amount left to convert, and we do expect losses to increase as a result. We believe we are adequately reserved for the losses and thus expect provision to be 0 through the remainder of the year, with the caveat that many of the variables I just covered can have a meaningful impact on the provision result. 
Moving on to capital. We distributed $190 million up to the parent during the quarter, comprising the following: $85 million from the bank, which is below Q1 net income of $108 million, as we utilized capital to fund balance sheet growth, and $102 million from the brokers, comprising $27 million from the introducing broker and $75 million from the clearing broker. 
In Q3, we expect total dividend to the parent of roughly $125 million, which includes $40 million from the bank, again, below current quarter bank net income of $106 million as we will use capital in Q3 for balance sheet growth. $57 million from the introducing broker and $28 million from a clearing broker. As with last quarter's move, capital is being released from the clearer as it needs have reduced.
We are currently in the process of merging our 2 broker-dealers. So starting in the fourth quarter, we will have a single brokerage entity to distribute capital to the parent. Without going into too much detail, the entities were separated about 15 years ago for operational reasons that are no longer relevant. The combined entity will streamline our organizational structure and regulatory oversight. In terms of capital, we expect future distributions to be consistent with that historically distributed out of the introducing broker. 
So on to capital generation. We ended the quarter with strong measures at both the bank and parent. The bank's leverage ratio ended the quarter at 8.2%, above our current 8% target. Keep in mind that we intend to seek approval to lower this target to 7.5% early next year. At the parent, we ended the quarter with a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 7.5%, above our minimum of 7%. 
And the other metric by which we measure, available capital corporate cash, ended the quarter at $523 million, well above our minimum of $100 million or 2 years of debt service coverage. So we are in a strong position to continue deploying capital. 
We remain active on that front in the quarter, repurchasing a 151 million of our common stock and growing the balance sheet by $1.3 billion. We have now completed more than $500 million of our $800 million share repurchase program, having repurchase 5.9 million shares during the quarter and 20.6 million over the course of the entire program at an average price of $24.34. 
On balance sheet growth, we ended the quarter at $49.2 billion, just shy of our current target of $49.5 billion of consolidated assets. To expand on Paul's comments regarding our plans to exceed $50 billion in the first half of next year, after converting the money market funds to our sweep program in September, on a pro forma basis, we have approximately $6 billion of deposits readily available to bring on balance sheet, assuming no organic growth between now and then. That amount puts crossing $50 billion squarely within economic reach. 
From a capital perspective, we anticipate funding this growth through earnings and a lower bank Tier 1 leverage threshold. There are host of reporting changes and filing requirements we will enjoy with our increased size, all of which we are currently digging through. We will provide updates on these on future calls.
With respect to incurring the expenses related to crossing, it is still too early to assign precision to timing. However, our rough estimates assume $50 million related to the build-out, with around $5 million incurred in the second half of this year and the remainder evenly spent in 2017 and 2018; and the running cost of approximately $15 million per year will start to occur in 2017, with a full run rate in 2018. 
Needless to say, with the right amount of deposits at our disposal, the returns are quite compelling, and we are excited to unshackle our growth. 
And with that operator, we will open the call for questions."

Good evening, and thank you for spending some time with us. We had a productive quarter marked by a number of accomplishments on both the customer-facing and financial fronts. We launched one of our most compelling offerings in recent history.",1579,"Thank you. Good evening, and thank you for spending some time with us. We had a productive quarter marked by a number of accomplishments on both the customer-facing and financial fronts. We launched one of our most compelling offerings in recent history. We generated healthy levels of capital while marching forward on our capital deployment initiatives. And the investments made to strengthen our platforms in infrastructure again proved their worth as we handled the flurry of Brexit-inspired customer activity without getting onto a sticky wicket. Meanwhile, on an industry level, we definitely managed the challenges of the revenue environment while progressing our work related to the Department of Labor fiduciary standard. 
Starting with our results. We reported net income of $133 million or $0.48 per share for the quarter. We again had a sizable benefit to the provision line, led by a solid loan performance and outsized recoveries. These recoveries are a phenomenon which is difficult to predict, but can dramatically impact the portfolio as seasoned as ours. 
On the customer activity front, metrics remained healthy, largely reflecting seasonality relative to the prior quarter. Training activities declined throughout the period, but experienced a spike surrounding the courageous U.K. vote to leave the European Union when our customers took advantage of the dip in the equity markets to the tune of $1.1 billion of net buying during a single trading day, the highest on record. 
The significant attention we placed on strengthening our infrastructure over the past several years enabled our platforms to handle these elevated volumes with room to spare. For the entire quarter, a record 17% of DARTs were executed by our mobile platforms. In July to date, DARTs are currently tracking down 1% from June.
Margin balances, which had slowly edged down throughout Q1, ended the second quarter up at $6.8 billion. The majority of the $0.5 billion increase was a Brexit-bolstered spike. So the quarter's average was lower at $6.5 billion. In July to date, balances have tapered to $6.4 billion.
We had a 23,000 net new accounts in Q2, down from Q1 solid 45,000, adjusted new accounts in last year's 25,000. Our attrition rate of 8.3% remained encouraging for the quarter, while an increase from a near-record adjusted 7.3% in the prior quarter, a decrease from an adjusted 8.7% a year ago. We also attracted $1.6 billion in net new brokerage assets, reflecting our strongest Q2 in several years, but down sequentially on typical tax-related outflows in April. 
We made meaningful enhancements to the customer experience this quarter. On the product front, Adaptive portfolio, our robo solution, is the most important new product launch in some time. While still very early days from our June launch, we are pleased with adoption thus far, having amassed more than $100 million of assets under management in the program, including legacy managed account balances converted upon launch. 
The offering stands out in a few ways. First, it provides our customers the option of combining active and passive management, a new concept for the auto investing space, which has traditionally relied on passive-only portfolios. Second, it falls between our pure digital and managed account solutions, delivering a best-in-class digital experience, combined with access to financial consultants when customers have questions or want to discuss the portfolio selected by the online tool. Third, at circa 1%, the low cash allocation means customers' money is being put to work for them through their investments while keeping just enough cash to rebalance and service the portfolio as necessary. And last, consistent with our unbiased approach to providing our customers with the solutions right for their own needs, we have no proprietary products within our model portfolios. So the investments available to customers are selected to be the best for each particular portfolio construction, and not just the best but happen to carry our name. 
Importantly, the solution serves longer-term retirement investing and savings dollars, so it is an important component of our ongoing efforts to increase share of wallet among our existing customer base. Additionally, we found that as customers and prospects are navigating the Adaptive portfolio experience, they are also looking at our other offerings, leading to increased activity and self-directed account openings. 
Transitioning over to our Corporate Services channel, we are in a midst of rolling out a completely redesigned stock plan participant experience. We have long had an edge in this business because of our top-rated platform, Equity Edge Online. However, over the past 3 years, we have been acutely focused on further improving both the B2B and B2C elements of this channel. This rollout presents planned participants with a more streamlined, intuitive and engaging experience. 
We always strive to surprise and delight our customers, but when it comes to the stock plan participant, getting the digital experience right is essential. We understand deeply that these participants are not your typical investor, often joining us with financial knowledge less developed than what we find with mainstream E*TRADE  customers. Further, stock plan benefits are inherently complicated, so the more we can do to educate and engage these participants, the more they may value this component of their compensation, and thus appropriately value their employer for providing it. This is no small responsibility and one we take extremely seriously.
In terms of industry accolades, we were recognized by Kiplinger's this quarter in their biennial review of online brokers, earning high marks in tools and ease of use as well as first place for mobile, a platform which is increasingly important to our customers and where we frequently standout from the crowd. 
Expenses for the quarter were $295 million, down $17 million from Q1, primarily due to seasonality in advertising, driving our adjusted operating margin, which excludes provision, to 38% from 34%. In the face of a progressively challenging interest rate environment, we remain committed to keeping our expenses appropriately sized and continue to expect a 37% adjusted operating margin for the full year, barring exogenous factors.
On the capital front, we continue to execute on both of our deployment initiatives, putting a $151 million to work, repurchasing our common stock, ending the quarter nearly 2/3 the way through our $800 million program; and continuing to grow the balance sheet, ending the quarter at $49.2 billion, closely approaching our target of $49.5 billion. 
And for what's next, we continue to dedicate a lot of time and energy to this question, considering share repurchase beyond our current program, evaluating growth through enrichment through acquisition and examining balance sheet growth beyond our current target. Regarding that final point, we have been very clear that in order to justify the compliance costs and achieve appropriate returns on capital, we need some combination of higher interest rates and a more sizable quantum of deposits to allow us to pounce constantly over the $50 billion threshold. 
Today, with interest rates unlikely to rise in the near term and our current level of available off-balance sheet deposits at about $2 billion, we've planned to asymptotically dance below the nifty 50-line as crossing would equate to more of a tiptoe than a pounce. However, with industry form making money market funds a suboptimal sweep vehicle for customers, the team is working to convert approximately $4 billion or substantially all of our money market funds into our cash sweep program, thus increasing our potential balance sheet size to above $55 billion. 
While there's still boxes to check, we already have regulatory approval, and we intend to complete this conversion in September. With that move, we anticipate crossing $50 billion in the first half of next year. Mr. Pizzi will provide an update on the particulars and the costs to conduct the Pizzi pounce.
Moving on to the DOL fiduciary standards, we made significant headway this quarter working through this overreaching rule, which is proved rather too strained in nature and shrouded with ambiguity. I'm pleased to report that we completed much of the analysis and are moving on to implementation. This was no small task, and I commend the internal teams that worked so diligently to get us where we are. We do anticipate additional costs as we work through the implementation phase, including those related to third-party assistance, industry experts and council, digital enhancements to adopt the rule in our platform and increased legal and compliance costs. Importantly, we are well positioned to be fully compliant within the DOL state of implementation dates, and these expenses are included within our target operating margin for the year.
And now a note on governance. A couple of weeks ago, we further strengthened our board with the addition of Kevin Kabat. Kevin's extensive background in financial services rounds out our board, which now stands at 12 members. Kevin spent more than 30 years in the industry, including the last 8 years as CEO of Fifth Third Bancorp. In addition, he has experience on a number of boards, both public companies and charitable organizations. We are fortunate to benefit from his insights, particularly as we position the company to cross $50 billion. 
So in summary, it's been a solid first half of the year. And while I'm pleased with where we stand, we have plenty to accomplish on capital deployment, growth, expense management and our primary mandate, which is to serve the retail investor. On all fronts, I'm excited about what's in store for the remainder of this year. 
And with that, I will turn it over to our sapient CFO, Mr. Pizzi."
27807,372452452,1010326,"E*TRADE Financial Corporation, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 21, 2016",2016-07-21,"Earnings Calls","E*TRADE Financial, LLC","Executives","Thank you, Mr. Idzik. For the quarter, we reported net income of a $133 million or $0.48 per share. This compares to adjusted net income of $122 million or $0.43 per share in the prior quarter, which excludes a $31 million income tax benefit. It also comp",1535,"Thank you, Mr. Idzik. For the quarter, we reported net income of a $133 million or $0.48 per share. This compares to adjusted net income of $122 million or $0.43 per share in the prior quarter, which excludes a $31 million income tax benefit. It also compares to adjusted net income of $72 million or $0.25 per share in the year-ago quarter, which excludes a $220 million income tax benefit. 
Revenues for the quarter were $474 million, up $2 million from the prior quarter, largely related to higher yields on customer assets held by third parties; and up $45 million from the year-ago quarter, largely attributable to the benefits from our wholesale funding termination and the Fed rate hike. 
Net interest income was $286 million for the quarter, down $1 million from the prior quarter as a 17-basis-point reduction in net interest margin was mostly offset by a $2.5 billion larger average balance sheet. Our net interest margin of 264 basis points decreased as we put money to work growing our balance sheet in an unspectacular rate environment and as average margin balances contracted. 
The rate environment is certainly impacting us, with our average reinvestment rate now in the range of 150 to 175 basis points. We continue to expect our full year net interest margin to be 260 to 265 basis points, with the back half of the year in the mid-250s. This also assumes no change in the Fed fund's rate, and that margin balances remain constant with their current level. 
Commission, fees and service charges and other revenues were $178 million, up $3 million from the prior quarter and up $11 million versus the year-ago quarter. Compared to Q1, commissions revenue decreased $1 million as lower trading activity was offset by higher average commission, per trade, which increased $0.18 to $10.82, driven by a higher portion of stock plan customer trades and more options contracts per trade. Relative to the year-ago quarter, commissions revenue increased $3 million on higher trading activity, partially offset by a $0.14 decline in the average commission related to a higher mix of active traders. 
Fees and service charges revenue increased relative to both the prior quarter and the year-ago quarter, primarily attributable to higher re-org fees and higher yields on customer assets held by third parties. This quarter, the average yield on these assets was 41 basis points, up 11 basis points from Q1. As Paul mentioned, we expect to convert approximately $4 billion of money market funds into our cash sweep program in September. 
Securities and other gains were $10 million, flat with the prior quarter. For the full year, we expect gains to be near the high-end of our $30 million to $40 million range. 
Noninterest expense for the quarter was $295 million, down $17 million sequentially, with the biggest driver being a seasonal decline in marketing. Expenses were about $7 million below our expectations due to a further pull-back in marketing in response to the environment and a small benefit running through communications expense. 
Our adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 38%, up from 34% in Q1 as revenues rose slightly and expenses decreased significantly. Our commitment to manage to an operating margin requires us to govern our expense base closely. And while our operating margin improved, there is much more work to do as our revenue continues to face environmental headwinds from low interest rates.
With the rational expense structure already in place and a discipline to marketing spend, we are committed to regularly reviewing productivity, where output can be achieved with leaner resources. While this effort is ongoing, the current revenue environment makes our commitment to respond all the more important. And we are steadfast in supporting our operating margin target of 37% for the year. 
Moving on to the provision line. We recorded a benefit of $35 million for the quarter, once again better than expected. Net charge-offs were positive at $6 million of recoveries, contributed to the $29 million reduction in the allowance of $293 million; while the overall portfolio reduced by $300 million or 6%, ending the quarter at $4.4 billion.
Recoveries continue to be a significant factor propelling provision benefit. As we have said in the past, recoveries in the recapture of previously charge-offs loans are exceptionally difficult to predict and can meaningfully swing our results. We also continue to benefit from better-than-expected performance of high-risk loans that have been  reserved for the full life of the loan. 
This quarter, we had a relatively small amount of HELOC conversions at just over 50 million. Overall, the performance of conversions remains consistent, with an average default rate of approximately 12%, about twice that of a nonconverting loan. 
At this point, about $0.7 billion or 45% of the HELOC portfolio has yet to convert. Nearly all of those occur over the next 3 quarters, with a fairly even distribution across each. So while we are pleased with the performance of HELOC conversions to date, we have a sizable amount left to convert, and we do expect losses to increase as a result. We believe we are adequately reserved for the losses and thus expect provision to be 0 through the remainder of the year, with the caveat that many of the variables I just covered can have a meaningful impact on the provision result. 
Moving on to capital. We distributed $190 million up to the parent during the quarter, comprising the following: $85 million from the bank, which is below Q1 net income of $108 million, as we utilized capital to fund balance sheet growth, and $102 million from the brokers, comprising $27 million from the introducing broker and $75 million from the clearing broker. 
In Q3, we expect total dividend to the parent of roughly $125 million, which includes $40 million from the bank, again, below current quarter bank net income of $106 million as we will use capital in Q3 for balance sheet growth. $57 million from the introducing broker and $28 million from a clearing broker. As with last quarter's move, capital is being released from the clearer as its needs have reduced.
We are currently in the process of merging our 2 broker-dealers. So starting in the fourth quarter, we will have a single brokerage entity to distribute capital to the parent. Without going into too much detail, the entities were separated about 15 years ago for operational reasons that are no longer relevant. The combined entity will streamline our organizational structure and regulatory oversight. In terms of capital, we expect future distributions to be consistent with that historically distributed out of the introducing broker. 
So on to capital generation. We ended the quarter with strong measures at both the bank and parent. The bank's leverage ratio ended the quarter at 8.2%, above our current 8% target. Keep in mind that we intend to seek approval to lower this target to 7.5% early next year. At the parent, we ended the quarter with a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 7.5%, above our minimum of 7%. 
And the other metric by which we measure, available capital corporate cash, ended the quarter at $523 million, well above our minimum of $100 million or 2 years of debt service coverage. So we are in a strong position to continue deploying capital. 
We remained active on that front in the quarter, repurchasing a 151 million of our common stock and growing the balance sheet by $1.3 billion. We have now completed more than $500 million of our $800 million share repurchase program, having repurchased 5.9 million shares during the quarter and 20.6 million over the course of the entire program at an average price of $24.34. 
On balance sheet growth, we ended the quarter at $49.2 billion, just shy of our current target of $49.5 billion of consolidated assets. To expand on Paul's comments regarding our plans to exceed $50 billion in the first half of next year, after converting the money market funds to our sweep program in September, on a pro forma basis, we have approximately $6 billion of deposits readily available to bring on balance sheet, assuming no organic growth between now and then. That amount puts crossing $50 billion squarely within economic reach. 
From a capital perspective, we anticipate funding this growth through earnings and a lower bank Tier 1 leverage threshold. There are host of reporting changes and filing requirements we will enjoy with our increased size, all of which we are currently digging through. We will provide updates on these on future calls.
With respect to incurring the expenses related to crossing, it is still too early to assign precision to timing. However, our rough estimates assume $50 million related to the build-out, with around $5 million incurred in the second half of this year and the remainder evenly spent in 2017 and 2018; and the running cost of approximately $15 million per year will start to occur in 2017, with a full run rate in 2018. 
Needless to say, with the right amount of deposits at our disposal, the returns are quite compelling, and we are excited to unshackle our growth. 
And with that operator, we will open the call for questions."

Interestingly, as we've started this product, which was sadly lacking from our families of products, we're seeing people come, look at the site, and in addition to looking at robo, finding out that they're also opening sometimes in conjunction with or sometimes instead of opening a self-directed account.

Good evening, and thank you for spending some time with us. We had a productive quarter marked by a number of accomplishments on both the customer-facing and financial fronts. We launched one of our most compelling offerings in recent history.",1579,"Thank you. Good evening, and thank you for spending some time with us. We had a productive quarter marked by a number of accomplishments on both the customer-facing and financial fronts. We launched one of our most compelling offerings in recent history. We generated healthy levels of capital while marching forward on our capital deployment initiatives. And the investments made to strengthen our platforms in infrastructure again proved their worth as we handled the flurry of Brexit-inspired customer activity without getting onto a sticky wicket. Meanwhile, on an industry level, we definitely managed the challenges of the revenue environment while progressing our work related to the Department of Labor fiduciary standard. 
Starting with our results. We reported net income of $133 million or $0.48 per share for the quarter. We again had a sizable benefit to the provision line, led by a solid loan performance and outsized recoveries. These recoveries are a phenomenon which is difficult to predict, but can dramatically impact the portfolio as seasoned as ours. 
On the customer activity front, metrics remained healthy, largely reflecting seasonality relative to the prior quarter. Training activities declined throughout the period, but experienced a spike surrounding the courageous U.K. vote to leave the European Union when our customers took advantage of the dip in the equity markets to the tune of $1.1 billion of net buying during a single trading day, the highest on record. 
The significant attention we placed on strengthening our infrastructure over the past several years enabled our platforms to handle these elevated volumes with room to spare. For the entire quarter, a record 17% of DARTs were executed by our mobile platforms. In July to date, DARTs are currently tracking down 1% from June.
Margin balances, which had slowly edged down throughout Q1, ended the second quarter up at $6.8 billion. The majority of the $0.5 billion increase was a Brexit-bolstered spike. So the quarter's average was lower at $6.5 billion. In July to date, balances have tapered to $6.4 billion.
We had a 23,000 net new accounts in Q2, down from Q1 solid 45,000, adjusted new accounts in last year's 25,000. Our attrition rate of 8.3% remained encouraging for the quarter, while an increase from a near-record adjusted 7.3% in the prior quarter, a decrease from an adjusted 8.7% a year ago. We also attracted $1.6 billion in net new brokerage assets, reflecting our strongest Q2 in several years, but down sequentially on typical tax-related outflows in April. 
We made meaningful enhancements to the customer experience this quarter. On the product front, Adaptive portfolio, our robo solution, is the most important new product launch in some time. While still very early days from our June launch, we are pleased with adoption thus far, having amassed more than $100 million of assets under management in the program, including legacy managed account balances converted upon launch. 
The offering stands out in a few ways. First, it provides our customers the option of combining active and passive management, a new concept for the auto investing space, which has traditionally relied on passive-only portfolios. Second, it falls between our pure digital and managed account solutions, delivering a best-in-class digital experience, combined with access to financial consultants when customers have questions or want to discuss the portfolio selected by the online tool. Third, at circa 1%, the low cash allocation means customers' money is being put to work for them through their investments while keeping just enough cash to rebalance and service the portfolio as necessary. And last, consistent with our unbiased approach to providing our customers with the solutions right for their own needs, we have no proprietary products within our model portfolios. So the investments available to customers are selected to be the best for each particular portfolio construction, and not just the best but happen to carry our name. 
Importantly, the solution serves longer-term retirement investing and savings dollars, so it is an important component of our ongoing efforts to increase share of wallet among our existing customer base. Additionally, we found that as customers and prospects are navigating the Adaptive portfolio experience, they are also looking at our other offerings, leading to increased activity and self-directed account openings. 
Transitioning over to our Corporate Services channel, we are in a midst of rolling out a completely redesigned stock plan participant experience. We have long had an edge in this business because of our top-rated platform, Equity Edge Online. However, over the past 3 years, we have been acutely focused on further improving both the B2B and B2C elements of this channel. This rollout presents planned participants with a more streamlined, intuitive and engaging experience. 
We always strive to surprise and delight our customers, but when it comes to the stock plan participant, getting the digital experience right is essential. We understand deeply that these participants are not your typical investor, often joining us with financial knowledge less developed than what we find with mainstream E*TRADE customers. Further, stock plan benefits are inherently complicated, so the more we can do to educate and engage these participants, the more they may value this component of their compensation, and thus appropriately value their employer for providing it. This is no small responsibility and one we take extremely seriously.
In terms of industry accolades, we were recognized by Kiplinger's this quarter in their biennial review of online brokers, earning high marks in tools and ease of use as well as first place for mobile, a platform which is increasingly important to our customers and where we frequently standout from the crowd. 
Expenses for the quarter were $295 million, down $17 million from Q1, primarily due to seasonality in advertising, driving our adjusted operating margin, which excludes provision, to 38% from 34%. In the face of a progressively challenging interest rate environment, we remain committed to keeping our expenses appropriately sized and continue to expect a 37% adjusted operating margin for the full year, barring exogenous factors.
On the capital front, we continue to execute on both of our deployment initiatives, putting a $151 million to work, repurchasing our common stock, ending the quarter nearly 2/3 the way through our $800 million program; and continuing to grow the balance sheet, ending the quarter at $49.2 billion, closely approaching our target of $49.5 billion. 
And for what's next, we continue to dedicate a lot of time and energy to this question, considering share repurchase beyond our current program, evaluating growth through enrichment through acquisition and examining balance sheet growth beyond our current target. Regarding that final point, we have been very clear that in order to justify the compliance costs and achieve appropriate returns on capital, we need some combination of higher interest rates and a more sizable quantum of deposits to allow us to pounce constantly over the $50 billion threshold. 
Today, with interest rates unlikely to rise in the near term and our current level of available off-balance sheet deposits at about $2 billion, we've planned to asymptotically dance below the nifty 50-line as crossing would equate to more of a tiptoe than a pounce. However, with industry form making money market funds a suboptimal sweep vehicle for customers, the team is working to convert approximately $4 billion or substantially all of our money market funds into our cash sweep program, thus increasing our potential balance sheet size to above $55 billion. 
While there's still boxes to check, we already have regulatory approval, and we intend to complete this conversion in September. With that move, we anticipate crossing $50 billion in the first half of next year. Mr. Pizzi will provide an update on the particulars and the costs to conduct the Pizzi pounce.
Moving on to the DOL fiduciary standards, we made significant headway this quarter working through this overreaching rule, which is proved rather too strained in nature and shrouded with ambiguity. I'm pleased to report that we completed much of the analysis and are moving on to implementation. This was no small task, and I commend the internal teams that worked so diligently to get us where we are. We do anticipate additional costs as we work through the implementation phase, including those related to third-party assistance, industry experts and council, digital enhancements to adopt the rule in our platform and increased legal and compliance costs. Importantly, we are well positioned to be fully compliant within the DOL state of implementation dates, and these expenses are included within our target operating margin for the year.
And now a note on governance. A couple of weeks ago, we further strengthened our board with the addition of Kevin Kabat. Kevin's extensive background in financial services rounds out our board, which now stands at 12 members. Kevin spent more than 30 years in the industry, including the last 8 years as CEO of Fifth Third Bancorp. In addition, he has experience on a number of boards, both public companies and charitable organizations. We are fortunate to benefit from his insights, particularly as we position the company to cross $50 billion. 
So in summary, it's been a solid first half of the year. And while I'm pleased with where we stand, we have plenty to accomplish on capital deployment, growth, expense management and our primary mandate, which is to serve the retail investor. On all fronts, I'm excited about what's in store for the remainder of this year. 
And with that, I will turn it over to our sapient CFO, Mr. Pizzi."
27807,372452452,1011047,"E*TRADE Financial Corporation, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 21, 2016",2016-07-21,"Earnings Calls","E*TRADE Financial, LLC","Executives","Thank you, Mr. Idzik. For the quarter, we reported net income of a $133 million or $0.48 per share. This compares to adjusted net income of $122 million or $0.43 per share in the prior quarter, which excludes a $31 million income tax benefit. It also comp",1535,"Thank you, Mr. Idzik. For the quarter, we reported net income of a $133 million or $0.48 per share. This compares to adjusted net income of $122 million or $0.43 per share in the prior quarter, which excludes a $31 million income tax benefit. It also compares to adjusted net income of $72 million or $0.25 per share in the year-ago quarter, which excludes a $220 million income tax benefit. 
Revenues for the quarter were $474 million, up $2 million from the prior quarter, largely related to higher yields on customer assets held by third parties; and up $45 million from the year-ago quarter, largely attributable to the benefits from our wholesale funding termination and the Fed rate hike. 
Net interest income was $286 million for the quarter, down $1 million from the prior quarter as a 17-basis-point reduction in net interest margin was mostly offset by a $2.5 billion larger average balance sheet. Our net interest margin of 264 basis points decreased as we put money to work growing our balance sheet in an unspectacular rate environment and as average margin balances contracted. 
The rate environment is certainly impacting us, with our average reinvestment rate now in the range of 150 to 175 basis points. We continue to expect our full year net interest margin to be 260 to 265 basis points, with the back half of the year in the mid-250s. This also assumes no change in the Fed fund's rate, and that margin balances remain constant with their current level. 
Commission, fees and service charges and other revenues were $178 million, up $3 million from the prior quarter and up $11 million versus the year-ago quarter. Compared to Q1, commissions revenue decreased $1 million as lower trading activity was offset by higher average commission, per trade, which increased $0.18 to $10.82, driven by a higher portion of stock plan customer trades and more options contracts per trade. Relative to the year-ago quarter, commissions revenue increased $3 million on higher trading activity, partially offset by a $0.14 decline in the average commission related to a higher mix of active traders. 
Fees and service charges revenue increased relative to both the prior quarter and the year-ago quarter, primarily attributable to higher re-org fees and higher yields on customer assets held by third parties. This quarter, the average yield on these assets was 41 basis points, up 11 basis points from Q1. As Paul mentioned, we expect to convert approximately $4 billion of money market funds into our cash sweep program in September. 
Securities and other gains were $10 million, flat with the prior quarter. For the full year, we expect gains to be near the high-end of our $30 million to $40 million range. 
Noninterest expense for the quarter was $295 million, down $17 million sequentially, with the biggest driver being a seasonal decline in marketing. Expenses were about $7 million below our expectations due to a further pull-back in marketing in response to the environment and a small benefit running through communications expense. 
Our adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 38%, up from 34% in Q1 as revenues rose slightly and expenses decreased significantly. Our commitment to manage to an operating margin requires us to govern our expense base closely. And while our operating margin improved, there is much more work to do as our revenue continues to face environmental headwinds from low interest rates.
With the rational expense structure already in place and a discipline to marketing spend, we are committed to regularly reviewing productivity, where output can be achieved with leaner resources. While this effort is ongoing, the current revenue environment makes our commitment to respond all the more important. And we are steadfast in supporting our operating margin target of 37% for the year. 
Moving on to the provision line. We recorded a benefit of $35 million for the quarter, once again better than expected. Net charge-offs were positive at $6 million of recoveries, contributed to the $29 million reduction in the allowance of $293 million; while the overall portfolio reduced by $300 million or 6%, ending the quarter at $4.4 billion.
Recoveries continue to be a significant factor propelling provision benefit. As we have said in the past, recoveries in the recapture of previously charge-offs loans are exceptionally difficult to predict and can meaningfully swing our results. We also continue to benefit from better-than-expected performance of high-risk loans that have been reserved for the full life of the loan. 
This quarter, we had a relatively small amount of HELOC conversions at just over 50 million. Overall, the performance of conversions remains consistent, with an average default rate of approximately 12%, about twice that of a nonconverting loan. 
At this point, about $0.7 billion or 45% of the HELOC portfolio has yet to convert. Nearly all of those occur over the next 3 quarters, with a fairly even distribution across each. So while we are pleased with the performance of HELOC conversions to date, we have a sizable amount left to convert, and we do expect losses to increase as a result. We believe we are adequately reserved for the losses and thus expect provision to be 0 through the remainder of the year, with the caveat that many of the variables I just covered can have a meaningful impact on the provision result. 
Moving on to capital. We distributed $190 million up to the parent during the quarter, comprising the following: $85 million from the bank, which is below Q1 net income of $108 million, as we utilized capital to fund balance sheet growth, and $102 million from the brokers, comprising $27 million from the introducing broker and $75 million from the clearing broker. 
In Q3, we expect total dividend to the parent of roughly $125 million, which includes $40 million from the bank, again, below current quarter bank net income of $106 million as we will use capital in Q3 for balance sheet growth. $57 million from the introducing broker and $28 million from a clearing broker. As with last quarter's move, capital is being released from the clearer as its needs have reduced.
We are currently in the process of merging our 2 broker-dealers. So starting in the fourth quarter, we will have a single brokerage entity to distribute capital to the parent. Without going into too much detail, the entities were separated about 15 years ago for operational reasons that are no longer relevant. The combined entity will streamline our organizational structure and regulatory oversight. In terms of capital, we expect future distributions to be consistent with that historically distributed out of the introducing broker. 
So on to capital generation. We ended the quarter with strong measures at both the bank and parent. The bank's leverage ratio ended the quarter at 8.2%, above our current 8% target. Keep in mind that we intend to seek approval to lower this target to 7.5% early next year. At the parent, we ended the quarter with a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 7.5%, above our minimum of 7%. 
And the other metric by which we measure, available capital corporate cash, ended the quarter at $523 million, well above our minimum of $100 million or 2 years of debt service coverage. So we are in a strong position to continue deploying capital. 
We remained active on that front in the quarter, repurchasing a 151 million of our common stock and growing the balance sheet by $1.3 billion. We have now completed more than $500 million of our $800 million share repurchase program, having repurchased 5.9 million shares during the quarter and 20.6 million over the course of the entire program at an average price of $24.34. 
On balance sheet growth, we ended the quarter at $49.2 billion, just shy of our current target of $49.5 billion of consolidated assets. To expand on Paul's comments regarding our plans to exceed $50 billion in the first half of next year, after converting the money market funds to our sweep program in September, on a pro forma basis, we have approximately $6 billion of deposits readily available to bring on balance sheet, assuming no organic growth between now and then. That amount puts crossing $50 billion squarely within economic reach. 
From a capital perspective, we anticipate funding this growth through earnings and a lower bank Tier 1 leverage threshold. There are host of reporting changes and filing requirements we will enjoy with our increased size, all of which we are currently digging through. We will provide updates on these on future calls.
With respect to incurring the expenses related to crossing, it is still too early to assign precision to timing. However, our rough estimates assume $50 million related to the build-out, with around $5 million incurred in the second half of this year and the remainder evenly spent in 2017 and 2018; and the running cost of approximately $15 million per year will start to occur in 2017, with a full run rate in 2018. 
Needless to say, with the right amount of deposits at our disposal, the returns are quite compelling, and we are excited to unshackle our growth. 
And with that operator, we will open the call for questions."

And so rather than some of the pure plays, we're also there for them when they want to call us and talk about what's happening. Interestingly, as we've started this product, which was sadly lacking from our families of products, we're seeing people come, look at the site, and in addition to looking at robo, finding out that they're also opening sometimes in conjunction with or sometimes instead of opening a self-directed account. So anything we can do to get new customers and existing customers to really think about what's the right way to position their portfolio, we think it's just an important service to provide, and it's going to pay off well for us in the future."

We are at a critical juncture for E*TRADE and this last quarter was particularly significant. While all of you tune in are certainly aware of the more headline-inducing changes we made, I'm going to take a few minutes to reiterate the emphasis for those changes before getting a bit of color on the board's current thinking about what constitutes success. And then finally, provide my observations of the company's current trajectory from my new unique vantage point as an insider. 
First of all, our decision to replace the CEO. E*TRADE has spent the last several years appropriately focused on the most impactful opportunities in its past, namely managing the wind down of the legacy balance sheet, bolstering its risk [ph] and operating foundations, improving all factors in its [ph] regulatory standing and, of course, unlocking and deploying a meaningful amount of capital to the benefit of the shareholders. Many of these efforts were interdependent and somewhat set in motion many years ago. But over the last 3 years, we've harvested most of the fruit of this labor, and the stock appreciated in commensurate fashion. During that period, the board has vigorously supported the management team in pursuing all of those matters. 
At the same time, however, we, as a board, always remained fully cognizant to the need to develop ongoing avenues of growth and value creation once the [ph] fixed story have been executed. Key to that growth has always been our core brokerage business. And as you would [ph] expect, we've remained particularly focused on the major business driver metrics of accounts, DARTs and assets. I believe our business driver focus has always been thoughtful and certainly alert to the impact of the [indiscernible] of the markets. But having said that, as a board, we have become increasingly concerned with both current business driver results as well as the forward trajectory. 
Given that we face 2 choices, give us more time or take action. We also [indiscernible] the latter and made changes at the top of the company. Again, the former CEO was a good steward of the company through its recent chapter. But we believe shareholders are better served with the reconfigured executive team to align the company for future growth. In putting together that team, we strongly believe that Karl Roessner was a natural choice to lead E*TRADE. Karl has a deep history of the company, substantial experience and knowledge across all elements of E*TRADE's business, a sharp commercial acumen and is a truly trusted partner to the board as well as an ongoing [indiscernible] presence with our regulators, which you all know is extremely important. 
Additionally, capitalizing on the completion of our OptionsHouse acquisition, Karl, again, with strong support from the board, has taken advantage of an opportunity to fill an important gap in our brokerage leadership, with the appointment of Michael Curcio as our Chief Brokerage Officer. Bolstered [ph] by the continued and noteworthy service of Mike Pizzi, as CFO, along with other leaders, the board feels truly confident that this structure and this executive roster is well suited to accomplishing our goals. 
As for me, I've joined the team in a full-time role as Executive Chairman to ensure Karl has [ph] access to my years of industry experience as well as to support the board's agenda on a daily basis while working constructively with Karl and the management team. My role is not a permanent one, and I look forward to returning to nonexecutive chairmanship in due time. 
With the leadership team in place, however, I want to stress that we are not just looking to implement the right structure, but to drive tangible results to shareholders, which brings me to my next topic. 
What constitutes success for the company? In short, there are 3 areas: growth, improved operating leverage and a sense of urgency. I'll touch on each of these, none of which are mutually exclusive and then pass it over to Karl to elaborate further. 
Starting with our growth ambitions. Balance sheet expansion and breaking through the $50 billion threshold is well underway and is in a more-than-capable hands of Mike Pizzi and his team for implementation. I'm sure that we will discuss further today. 
Our growth focus on what we characterize as key business drivers comes in 2 flavors: organic and inorganic. Organically, the key growth levers are well-known, namely how we market our company to customers and prospects; how we package and promote our products; and finally, how we capitalize on the corporate services channel to drive more meaningful activity. By addressing these elements, we feel strongly that the company can make up lost ground relative to our industry peers. And as previously stated, we quantify that as a 2 to 3 percentage point improvement in our rate of annual organic growth across accounts, assets and trades. 
Inorganically, growth may come from [indiscernible] opportunities as well as adjacent ones, provided an acquisition supports our core business and aligns with our digital ETOS [ph]. There is currently plenty of public chatter [ph] surrounding this topic, and I won't indulge it further. Allow me to say this, the E*TRADE Board is highly value conscious and the company's leadership is smart and methodical in their evaluation process. Translation, we will not overpay and we will not do anything stupid. 
Moving now to improving operating leverage, our perspective is very simple: we must find money to spend money. In this regard, this team is steadfast in their commitments in managing expenses through an operating margin framework, and -- Karl will speak more about this. But I'll mention that I've been impressed with how methodically the new leadership team has driven this goal forward in just a few weeks. I'd also add that this is an ongoing dynamic process. We will always be looking to enhance our operating leverage in the future, both through sound management as well as the intelligent application of technology. This is an attitude possessed by all good companies and is most certainly not a once-and-done approach. 
Now what do we mean by a sense of urgency? Philosophically, we believe it focus [ph] on the board and the senior management team to create and establish an ongoing sense of urgency in our business endeavors. With our capital initiatives and options relatively clearly defined, it's time for the core brokerage business to embrace initiatives and move forward more quickly. As a board, we certainly believe the new company leadership team can produce the desired results. It's critical that we also set it [ph] by series time line for that to unfold. 
Last month, I said that was 18 to 24 months at which point the board will take stock and assess options for the company if our goals are not achieved. That time line stands and has been embraced by management as motivation to get things done, and I find that extraordinary encouraging. 
Finally, I would like to share my observations for the company from the inside. I'm impressed with the management team's ability under Karl's leadership to make difficult decisions to drive results and to focus on our goals. This includes the work to integrate OptionsHouse, the meaningful changes to our organizational structure, and the intense drive to address expense issues. I'll let Karl speak to his team's work, but I'll just say the board is pleased with our state of play. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Karl."
27807,403988623,1058242,"E*TRADE Financial Corporation, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 20, 2016",2016-10-20,"Earnings Calls","E*TRADE Financial, LLC","Executives","Thank you, Rodger.

I wanted to start by building on Rodger's observation with my own. 
With 7.5 years in the company, I can confidently speak that I've never seen our leadership team act with more purpose or cohesiveness than it has over the past month. I'm truly impressed and believe we are all growing in the same direction. This is largely attributable to how we've realigned the team, but certainly aided by that board encouraged sense of urgency that Rodger mentioned. I will start with the executive leadership team and the changes we made. 
First, with our most crucial goal centered on the brokerage business, installing a strong brokerage head was a key priority and Mike Curcio has definitely filled that role. Next, to centralize functions to directly support our business goals, I moved marketing and corporate services from the executive office to Mike Curcio's organization. Further, we removed an inefficient senior layer of business line COOs along with an unnecessary support and consulting structure across the company. It's easy to speak to growth, but if the internal environment isn't conducive to execution, it can be an impossible quarter [ph]. So we have made all of these changes with an eye of getting back to our lean, scrappy brokerage roots. Separately, we have consolidated oversight of our compliance and AML functions under Paul Brandow as Chief Risk Officer, aligning the structure to be consistent with industry standards and regulatory expectations. All of these organizational changes foster a more accountable and collaborative culture, one which I believe will produce measurable, positive results and one which comes at a significant savings to the P&L. 
To be clear, we have a sense of urgency and are focused on results. The key priorities to which we will hold ourselves accountable are: integrating OptionsHouse. This one's pretty obvious but it sits at the top of the list because of the importance that hangs on getting this right. It's imperative that we capture the full value associated with the deal, and we're on track to accomplish this. 
Refocusing on trading. We were once the undisputed leader in this space [ph], but have notably fallen behind. We need to reearn this top spot and the purchase of OptionsHouse is only the beginning of these efforts. 
Deepening engagement with existing customers. Reinforcing our long-term investing offering remains a crucial component of our efforts. We offer the same products and services that many of our customers use elsewhere and need to create greater awareness of these offerings, particularly through our marketing efforts. 
Finally, never losing sight of all that we've accomplished on the risk and regulatory fronts. These key priorities are meant to improve performance across our core metrics and specifically generate accounts and asset growth and trading activity where, as Rodger noted, we're targeting a 2 to 3 percentage point improvement in our annual rate of growth. 
Additionally, we're turning up the focus on our derivatives mix, with an aggressive target of growing it to 35% of DARTs within the next 2 years. Further, with respect to long-term investing, we aim to grow our managed product AUM to $6 billion within the next 2 years. 
In tandem with our commitment to grow the business, we also understand our responsibility to be good stewards of shareholder value through operational efficiency. As a management team, we took a hard look at our operating model during the quarter, considering the impacts of the OptionsHouse acquisition and of our organizational realignment. As a result, we identified significant cost savings in the combined organization to be realized as part of our mandate to become more nimble while maintaining our strong risk culture, where I believe we are standard bearers in many respects. With regard to our $49 million of deal-related expense synergies, we have completed $15 million as of this call, with the balance expected to be realized by Q3 of next year when we complete the OptionsHouse integration. Also related to the close of the transaction, we had a $7 million charge in the restructuring line. 
Separately, following a focused review of our structure and expenses, this quarter we have eliminated an additional $21 million of annual run rate expenses. The restructuring line also reflects charges of $18 million, primarily related to these actions. 
Moving on to our results. We reported net income of $139 million or $0.51 per share. There's a decent amount of noise in these results, which boosted the bottom line by $19 million or $0.07 per share in total. On a pretax basis, these items were $6 million of severance related to our prior CEO, the $25 million of restructuring- and acquisition-related expense I just mentioned and a $62 million provision benefit. 
On the metrics, excluding the OptionsHouse accounts we acquired, we added 14,000 net new brokerage accounts during the quarter, and our attrition rate was a healthy 8%. Our brokerage account growth rate was 1.7% for the quarter, down from 2.8% in the prior quarter. We also added $1.7 billion in net new brokerage assets, excluding OptionsHouse asset, which compares to $1.6 billion in the prior quarter and $2.1 billion a year ago. We ended the quarter with $307 billion in total customer assets, including $24.4 billion in fee-based assets, which are predominantly mutual funds and managed products. We ended the quarter with $3.7 billion in managed product AUM, including $176 million in adaptive portfolio, our newly launched robo-solution. 
Our DARTs for the quarter were 152,000, flat with the prior quarter and down 3% year-over-year. Excluding OptionsHouse, our DARTs would have been 146,000 for the quarter, down 4% sequentially and down 6% year-over-year. The quarterly decline reflects some seasonality and a fairly quiet macro market environment. The year-over-year comparison is a tough one given the turmoil in global markets that led us to a single-day trading record in August of last year. Approximately 26% of our DARTs were in derivatives in Q3, which includes a 1.7 percentage point boost from OptionsHouse over the final 15 days of the quarter. Pro forma with OptionsHouse for the full quarter, derivatives would have been 30%. Our customer margin balance has ended the quarter at $6.8 billion, including approximately $300 million from OptionsHouse. 
In closing, we're working hard to align the organization and all of our efforts for growth, and I'm confident in our ability to achieve our goals. I hope my remarks start [ph] to show that we mean business when it comes to growing our business. I look forward to delivering and to keeping you all apprized along the way. 
I'll now turn it over to our CFO, Mike Pizzi."

For the quarter, we reported net income of $139 million or $0.51 per share. This compares to net income of $133 million or $0.48 per share in the prior quarter. It also compares to adjusted net income of $96 million or $0.32 per share in",1317,"Thank you, Karl. For the quarter, we reported net income of $139 million or $0.51 per share. This compares to net income of $133 million or $0.48 per share in the prior quarter. It also compares to adjusted net income of $96 million or $0.32 per share in the year ago quarter, which excludes $430 million [ph] of pretax charges related to the termination of wholesale funding obligations. 
Revenues for the quarter were $486 million, up $8 million from the prior quarter, largely related to higher customer cash held by third parties and up $55 million on an adjusted basis from the year ago quarter, which is attributable to the benefits from our wholesale funding termination and the Fed rate hike. 
Net interest income was $287 million for the quarter, up $1 million from the prior quarter as a 5 basis point reduction and [ph] net interest margin was offset by a $1.1 billion larger average balance sheet. Our net interest margin of 259 basis points decreased primarily due to faster prepayment speed on the securities portfolio, continued runoff of higher yielding legacy loan -- of the legacy loan portfolio and an unfavorable shift in margin balances to lower-priced tiers. Our average reinvestment rate is now in the range of 175 to 200 basis points. We continue to expect our full year net interest margin to be 260 to 265 basis points with Q4 in the mid-250s. This also assumes no change in the Fed fund's rate and that margin balance has remained constant with their current levels. 
Commissions, fees and service charges and other revenues were $185 million, up $7 million from the prior quarter and up $50 million versus the year-ago quarter. Compared to Q2, commissions revenue increased $1 million as DARTs were flat and average commission per trade increased $0.15 to $10.97. This was driven by higher options and stock plan mix. Relative to the year-ago quarter, commissions revenue decreased $1 million on lower trading activity, partially offset by a $0.10 increase in the average commission per trade also related to higher options and stock plan mix. Our DARTs of 152,000 this quarter include 6,500 from OptionsHouse for the 15 trading days of the quarter that they were under our umbrella. 
Fees and service charges revenue increased relative to both the prior quarter and the year-ago quarter. We recorded a $3 million sequentially increase on customer cash held by third parties as off-balance sheet cash grew amidst customer net selling. Meanwhile, we had a marginally higher average yield on these balances following the conversion of $4 billion of money market funds into our sweep program in early September. The $16 million year-over-year change reflects higher yield on third-party customer cash as well as an increased asset -- as well as increased asset-based fee revenue. For some context, the average yield on customer cash held by third parties was 47 basis points, up 6 basis points from Q2 and up 29 basis points from Q3 of last year. We expect this rate to move in line with broader short-term benchmark rates. 
The fees and services -- the fees and service charges line also contains approximately $3 million from OptionsHouse, which includes revenue from their customer margin and cash balances. Once we convert their third-party clearing arrangements in Q3 of next year, we will capture this revenue through NII. 
Securities and other gains were $14 million, up $10 million from the prior quarter as we reposition portions of the portfolio around Brexit-driven market volatility. For Q4, we expect gains to return to the $10 million range. 
Noninterest expense for the quarter was $323 million, up $28 million sequentially, including the unique items Karl mentioned. Our adjusted operating margin, which excludes provision, was 34%. This was driven lower by approximately 6 percentage points related to CEO severance, restructuring and acquisition-related costs. For Q4, we expect our adjusted op margin to be approximately 35%, which reflects the full quarter impact of OptionsHouse. 
Moving to the provision line. We recorded the benefit of $62 million for the quarter. The allowance ended at $235 million, a reduction of $58 million in the quarter as net charge-offs were a recovery of $4 million. The current period provision benefit resulted primarily from updated performance expectations based on sustained outperformance of high-risk HELOCs. The current period also reflected recoveries in excess of prior expectations as well as payoffs on loans converting to amortizing [ph]. We are now 73% through the HELOC conversions, providing ample data on the performance of these loans. 
Additionally, the portfolio continues to reduce in size ending the quarter at just $4.1 billion, down $315 million from the prior quarter. Further, our allowance coverage ratio remains healthy at 6% of the total loan portfolio. 
Moving on to capital. We distributed $125 million up to the parent during the quarter, including $85 million from the brokers and $40 million from the bank, which was below Q2 bank net income of $106 million as we preserved capital at the banks to fund planned [ph] balance sheet growth. I'd note that with respect to brokerage distributions in connection with the merger of our clearing and securities entities, we intend to distribute approximately $100 million [ph] to the parent in Q4. In the future, brokerage distribution should be consistent with excess capital generation. As for the bank, we intend to utilize the majority of its capital generation to fuel our balance sheet growth, but plan to distribute $50 million to the parent this quarter. 
On assets, we ended the quarter at $49.2 billion and have our sights on crossing $50 billion in the first half of next year. With significant customer net selling of $2.4 billion in the quarter, the conversion of $4 billion of money market funds to our sweep program and the addition of OptionsHouse, off-balance sheet customer cash is $14 billion. With around $3 billion now available to bring on -- not available to bring on balance sheet on a pro forma basis, we are just shy of $11 billion of cash for balance sheet growth. 
On a related note, with work on the enhanced regulatory build-out well underway, we feel good about crossing $50 billion in the first half of next year and anticipate ending Q2 with total assets of approximately $56 billion. As for the cost of the build-out, we continue to expect $50 million over 2 years with $15 million in annual run rate expense. The cost we have incurred to date are minimal and are included in our adjusted operating margin guidance for 2016. 
The bank's leverage ratio of 8.5% implies about $180 million of capital above[ph] our current 8% target. We intend to seek regulatory approval to lower that target to 7.5% early next year, which would free up an additional $180 million. As for parent capital, we ended the quarter with Tier 1 leverage ratio of 7.3%, down from 7.5% last quarter but above our floor of 7%. Corporate cash ended the quarter at $306 million, a decrease of $217 million from the prior quarter. We issued $400 million of 5 7/8 Tier 1 qualifying noncumulative perpetual preferred stock during the quarter to partially fund the purchase of OptionsHouse. The remainder of the $725 million purchase price was funded with cash, thus contributing to the decrease during the quarter. This was partially offset by $125 million of subsidiary dividends. 
Barring any other attractive uses for parent cash, we will be in a position to resume share repurchases in the second half of 2017. 
To briefly summarize, Q3 was a busy quarter. We completed a meaningful acquisition, made progress achieving our expense synergy targets, aligned the company through a focus on core growth, identified additional cost saves, positioned the balance sheet to deliver considerable incremental value, and continue to exhibit marked progress on reducing risk. 
And with that, operator, we will open the call for questions."

This is a very important question, a lot of people I'm sure are thinking of the same question. So thanks for asking it. In terms of my response, let me give you a little bit about of context and I may answer this question slightly longer than normal. We picked the 18 to 24 months because, I think, we all thought that was an adequate time to really show the Board and to show shareholders that we could get along the growth map that we described at the conference. Actually we talked, Rich, about organic growth and may well be that an inorganic opportunity comes along during that process. But just an 18- to 24-month period we thought it was adequate time to show we could deliver. And I think from a Board point of view, we need to feel very, very comfortable and we can continue to add shareholder value. Now let's go to the potential outcomes and to the heart of your question, let's take a negative outlook first. What happens if we can't deliver? We conclude that we cannot get to those kind of growth rates and that we can't therefore, continue to deliver shareholder value. And I think there are a series of options, more options than one might think. The one which obviously goes through is the sale. But maybe other options in terms of partnerships, we have weakness we know them in our business model. If we can not treat them ourselves, it may be feasible to correct them with partners. But, clearly, a sale, partnerships, there are series of different scenarios which crop up. The only thing I would say, which is definitive is that the Board will not allow loss of value. Now having said that, I looked at the positive side, let's assume we do deliver, which -- because it goes both ways and I recognize your question, what if we don't. Let's assume we do deliver, we actually at this moment in time really consider that is possible, wherein, just speaking to myself, I don't know if I speak for Karl and Mike and Brett, we're very, very impressed with what's happening here. And there's a real commitment to deliver on the growth drivers that we talked about at the conference. There are a body of people at this rate who really want to succeed and really want to see the company succeed. So even though we're talking about what happens if we don't succeed, I think it's not out of order to say that we believe very strongly we will. And having said that, I'm sure we have in the phone audience who would say that's just words, but it gives you a little reminder. I came on this Board at the beginning of 2012, along with my Board colleague [indiscernible] from Charles Schwab. And I remember at that time, Rich, a lot of doubts are being expressed on whether we could deliver and what I characterize as a low-hanging fruit, but it really was tough to achieve. A lot of doubt are being expressed then, could we refinance that debt, could we improve our funding cost, was our portfolio going to drown, what's going to happen to the HELOCs? Will we get the benefit of our DTA given the fact that the DTA if you're not earning, how the hell can you use your DTA. And so I think that, that, by the way, what was my interpretation of body language and these share price stock, it was somewhere in the middle or low single-digits. And yet 4.5 years later, here we are. So I think at that time it was real doubt as to where the management team could deliver. Rich, I think we put our money where our mouth was and delivered good credit to them. So now, where do we go with the next 34 months, we will, as a Board, seriously consider how we're doing and we'll consider options. So this is not usually out on anything, we will consider all options, we understand what our role is and the value we have to deliver. But I will say again, given the kind of people we got it at E*TRADE, I think we believe that you could achieve the value goals we will set. And we clearly that will mean an improvement in shareholder value as we go forward. So I'll give you a long run around, Rich, so the question you asked. But I hope it illustrates what our thinking is."

I can't tell you what the precise algorithm is 2% to 3% equals an accessible level of shareholder appreciation. But what I would say that, that level of growth gets us to markets down this because that's how far we're behind. It will run through assuming we acquired the types of accounts and the types of trading activity and the types of margin of all things obviously, you're very well aware of. And we have absorbed this huge amount of fixed expense in the company over the course of the last 2 or 3 years. Remember, seeing some of the prepared remarks addressed the fact that we really have fixed the operating foundation I think are the words we used in the company. So I think the reality is that level of growth will get us to a rate of return, which I think is comparable to our competitors in terms of the organic growth. We did say 18 to 24 months, but the world doesn't end at the end of 24 months. I think we'll continuously be reviewing that. We do have weaknesses in the business model, we recognize that. We would be happier we have developed the RAA channel, we don't have it. Clearly, if we could have one acquired inorganically or at a sensible price, I think it will make us more competitive. But I think the 2% to 3% will deliver comparable rates of increase return. I think it also is a rallying cry for all the troops in the company to pursue what has to be done in order for us to be as competitive as we are. But having said all of the above, it's really never ending, it's a continuous evolution and we're going to have to keep evolving the company as we go forward."

Right now though, that is the plan. So that's information that we have. In terms of the year, if you look at toward the onetime items, they're pushing our adjusted operating margin down in the period to 34% by about 6 percentage points. So if you take those onetime items out, which are about $31 million or $0.07 throughout and then take the 35, you'll see that we're coming in on target."

We are at a critical juncture for E*TRADE and this last quarter was particularly significant. While all of you tune in are certainly aware of the more headline-inducing changes we made, I'm going to take a few minutes to reiterate the emphasis for those changes before getting a bit of color on the board's current thinking about what constitutes success. And then finally, provide my observations of the company's current trajectory from my new unique vantage point as an insider. 
First of all, our decision to replace the CEO. E*TRADE has spent the last several years appropriately focused on the most impactful opportunities in its past, namely managing the wind down of the legacy balance sheet, bolstering its risk and operating foundations, improving all factors in its regulatory standing and, of course, unlocking and deploying a meaningful amount of capital to the benefit of the shareholders. Many of these efforts were interdependent and somewhat set in motion many years ago. But over the last 3 years, we've harvested most of the fruit of this labor, and the stock appreciated in commensurate fashion. During that period, the board has vigorously supported the management team in pursuing all of those matters. 
At the same time, however, we, as a board, always remained fully cognizant to the need to develop ongoing avenues of growth and value creation once its fixed story have been executed. Key to that growth has always been our core brokerage business. And as you would expect, we've remained particularly focused on the major business driver metrics of accounts, DARTs and assets. I believe our business driver focus has always been thoughtful and certainly alert to the impact of the [indiscernible] of the markets. But having said that, as a board, we have become increasingly concerned with both current business driver results as well as the forward trajectory. 
Given that we face 2 choices, give us more time or take action. We also managed the latter and made changes at the top of the company. Again, the former CEO was a good steward of the company through its recent chapter. But we believe shareholders are better served with the reconfigured executive team to align the company for future growth. In putting together that team, we strongly believe that Karl Roessner was a natural choice to lead E*TRADE. Karl has a deep history of the company, substantial experience and knowledge across all elements of E*TRADE's business, a sharp commercial acumen and is a truly trusted partner to the board as well as an ongoing creditor [ph] presence with our regulators, which you all know is extremely important. 
Additionally, capitalizing on the completion of our OptionsHouse acquisition, Karl, again, with strong support from the board, has taken advantage of an opportunity to fill an important gap in our brokerage leadership, with the appointment of Michael Curcio as our Chief Brokerage Officer. Bolstered [ph] by the continued and noteworthy service of Mike Pizzi, as CFO, along with other leaders, the board feels truly confident that this structure and this executive roster is well suited to accomplishing our goals. 
As for me, I've joined the team in a full-time role as Executive Chairman to ensure Karl has [ph] access to my years of industry experience as well as to support the board's agenda on a daily basis while working constructively with Karl and the management team. My role is not a permanent one, and I look forward to returning to nonexecutive chairmanship in due time. 
With the leadership team in place, however, I want to stress that we are not just looking to implement the right structure, but to drive tangible results to shareholders, which brings me to my next topic. 
What constitutes success for the company? In short, there are 3 areas: growth, improved operating leverage and a sense of urgency. I'll touch on each of these, none of which are mutually exclusive and then pass it over to Karl to elaborate further. 
Starting with our growth ambitions. Balance sheet expansion and breaking through the $50 billion threshold is well underway and is in a more-than-capable hands of Mike Pizzi and his team for implementation. I'm sure that we will discuss further today. 
Our growth focus on what we characterize as key business drivers comes in 2 flavors: organic and inorganic. Organically, the key growth levers are well-known, namely how we market our company to customers and prospects; how we package and promote our products; and finally, how we capitalize on the corporate services channel to drive more meaningful activity. By addressing these elements, we feel strongly that the company can make up lost ground relative to our industry peers. And as previously stated, we quantify that as a 2 to 3 percentage point improvement in our rate of annual organic growth across accounts, assets and trades. 
Inorganically, growth may come from [indiscernible] opportunities as well as adjacent ones, provided an acquisition supports our core business and aligns with our digital ethos. There is currently plenty of public chatter surrounding this topic, and I won't indulge it further. Allow me to say this, the E*TRADE Board is highly value conscious and the company's leadership is smart and methodical in their evaluation process. Translation, we will not overpay and we will not do anything stupid. 
Moving now to improving operating leverage, our perspective is very simple: we must find money to spend money. In this regard, this team is steadfast in their commitments in managing expenses through an operating margin framework, and -- Karl will speak more about this. But I'll mention that I've been impressed with how methodically the new leadership team has driven this goal forward in just a few weeks. I'd also add that this is an ongoing dynamic process. We will always be looking to enhance our operating leverage in the future, both through sound management as well as the intelligent application of technology. This is an attitude possessed by all good companies and is most certainly not a once-and-done approach. 
Now what do we mean by a sense of urgency? Philosophically, we believe it falls on the board and the senior management team to create and establish an ongoing sense of urgency in our business endeavors. With our capital initiatives and options relatively clearly defined, it's time for the core brokerage business to embrace initiatives and move forward more quickly. As a board, we certainly believe the new company leadership team can produce the desired results. It is critical that we also set it by a series time line for that to unfold. 
Last month, I said that was 18 to 24 months at which point the board will take stock and assess options for the company if our goals are not achieved. That time line stands and has been embraced by management as motivation to get things done, and I find that extraordinary encouraging. 
Finally, I would like to share my observations for the company from the inside. I'm impressed with the management team's ability under Karl's leadership to make difficult decisions to drive results and to focus on our goals. This includes the work to integrate OptionsHouse, the meaningful changes to our organizational structure, and the intense drive to address expense issues. I'll let Karl speak to his team's work, but I'll just say the board is pleased with our state of play. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Karl."
27807,403988623,1058322,"E*TRADE Financial Corporation, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 20, 2016",2016-10-20,"Earnings Calls","E*TRADE Financial, LLC","Executives","Thank you, Rodger.

I wanted to start by building on Rodger's observation with my own. 
With 7.5 years in the company, I can confidently speak that I've never seen our leadership team act with more purpose or cohesiveness than it has over the past month. I'm truly impressed and believe we are all growing in the same direction. This is largely attributable to how we've realigned the team, but certainly aided by that board encouraged sense of urgency that Rodger mentioned. I will start with the executive leadership team and the changes we made. 
First, with our most crucial goal centered on the brokerage business, installing a strong brokerage head was a key priority and Mike Curcio has definitely filled that role. Next, to centralize functions to directly support our business goals, I moved marketing and corporate services from the executive office to Mike Curcio's organization. Further, we removed an inefficient senior layer of business line COOs along with an unnecessary support and consulting structure across the company. It's easy to speak to growth, but if the internal environment isn't conducive to execution, it can be an impossible order. So we have made all of these changes with an eye of getting back to our lean, scrappy brokerage roots. Separately, we have consolidated oversight of our compliance and AML functions under Paul Brandow as Chief Risk Officer, aligning the structure to be consistent with industry standards and regulatory expectations. All of these organizational changes foster a more accountable and collaborative culture, one which I believe will produce measurable, positive results and one which comes at a significant savings to the P&L. 
To be clear, we have a sense of urgency and are focused on results. The key priorities to which we will hold ourselves accountable are: integrating OptionsHouse. This one's pretty obvious but it sits at the top of the list because of the importance that hangs on getting this right. It's imperative that we capture the full value associated with the deal, and we're on track to accomplish this. 
Refocusing on trading. We were once the undisputed leader in this space, but have notably fallen behind. We need to reearn this top spot and the purchase of OptionsHouse is only the beginning of these efforts. 
Deepening engagement with existing customers. Reinforcing our long-term investing offering remains a crucial component of our efforts. We offer the same products and services that many of our customers use elsewhere and need to create greater awareness of these offerings, particularly through our marketing efforts. 
Finally, never losing sight of all that we've accomplished on the risk and regulatory fronts. These key priorities are meant to improve performance across our core metrics and specifically generate accounts and asset growth and trading activity where, as Rodger noted, we're targeting a 2 to 3 percentage point improvement in our annual rate of growth. 
Additionally, we're turning up the focus on our derivatives mix, with an aggressive target of growing it to 35% of DARTs within the next 2 years. Further, with respect to long-term investing, we aim to grow our managed product AUM to $6 billion within the next 2 years. 
In tandem with our commitment to grow the business, we also understand our responsibility to be good stewards of shareholder value through operational efficiency. As a management team, we took a hard look at our operating model during the quarter, considering the impacts of the OptionsHouse acquisition and of our organizational realignment. As a result, we identified significant cost savings in the combined organization to be realized as part of our mandate to become more nimble while maintaining our strong risk culture, where I believe we are standard bearers in many respects. With regard to our $49 million of deal-related expense synergies, we have completed $15 million as of this call, with the balance expected to be realized by Q3 of next year when we complete the OptionsHouse integration. Also related to the close of the transaction, we had a $7 million charge in the restructuring line. 
Separately, following a focused review of our structure and expenses, this quarter we have eliminated an additional $21 million of annual run rate expenses. The restructuring line also reflects charges of $18 million, primarily related to these actions. 
Moving on to our results. We reported net income of $139 million or $0.51 per share. There's a decent amount of noise in these results, which boosted the bottom line by $19 million or $0.07 per share in total. On a pretax basis, these items were $6 million of severance related to our prior CEO, the $25 million of restructuring- and acquisition-related expense I just mentioned and a $62 million provision benefit. 
On the metrics, excluding the OptionsHouse accounts we acquired, we added 14,000 net new brokerage accounts during the quarter, and our attrition rate was a healthy 8%. Our brokerage account growth rate was 1.7% for the quarter, down from 2.8% in the prior quarter. We also added $1.7 billion in net new brokerage assets, excluding OptionsHouse asset, which compares to $1.6 billion in the prior quarter and $2.1 billion a year ago. We ended the quarter with $307 billion in total customer assets, including $24.4 billion in fee-based assets, which are predominantly mutual funds and managed products. We ended the quarter with $3.7 billion in managed product AUM, including $176 million in adaptive portfolio, our newly launched robo-solution. 
Our DARTs for the quarter were 152,000, flat with the prior quarter and down 3% year-over-year. Excluding OptionsHouse, our DARTs would have been 146,000 for the quarter, down 4% sequentially and down 6% year-over-year. The quarterly decline reflects some seasonality and a fairly quiet macro market environment. The year-over-year comparison is a tough one given the turmoil in global markets that led us to a single-day trading record in August of last year. Approximately 26% of our DARTs were in derivatives in Q3, which includes a 1.7 percentage point boost from OptionsHouse over the final 15 days of the quarter. Pro forma with OptionsHouse for the full quarter, derivatives would have been 30%. Our customer margin balance has ended the quarter at $6.8 billion, including approximately $300 million from OptionsHouse. 
In closing, we're working hard to align the organization and all of our efforts for growth, and I'm confident in our ability to achieve our goals. I hope my remarks serve to show that we mean business when it comes to growing our business. I look forward to delivering and to keeping you all apprized along the way. 
I'll now turn it over to our CFO, Mike Pizzi."

For the quarter, we reported net income of $139 million or $0.51 per share. This compares to net income of $133 million or $0.48 per share in the prior quarter. It also compares to adjusted net income of $96 million or $0.32 per share in",1312,"Thank you, Karl. For the quarter, we reported net income of $139 million or $0.51 per share. This compares to net income of $133 million or $0.48 per share in the prior quarter. It also compares to adjusted net income of $96 million or $0.32 per share in the year ago quarter, which excludes $430 million of pretax charges related to the termination of wholesale funding obligations. 
Revenues for the quarter were $486 million, up $8 million from the prior quarter, largely related to higher customer cash held by third parties and up $55 million on an adjusted basis from the year ago quarter, which is attributable to the benefits from our wholesale funding termination and the Fed rate hike. 
Net interest income was $287 million for the quarter, up $1 million from the prior quarter as a 5 basis point reduction and net interest margin was offset by a $1.1 billion larger average balance sheet. Our net interest margin of 259 basis points decreased primarily due to faster prepayment speed on the securities portfolio, continued runoff of higher yielding legacy loan -- of the legacy loan portfolio and an unfavorable shift in margin balances to lower-priced tiers. Our average reinvestment rate is now in the range of 175 to 200 basis points. We continue to expect our full year net interest margin to be 260 to 265 basis points with Q4 in the mid-250s. This also assumes no change in the Fed fund's rate and that margin balance has remained constant with their current levels. 
Commissions, fees and service charges and other revenues were $185 million, up $7 million from the prior quarter and up $50 million versus the year-ago quarter. Compared to Q2, commissions revenue increased $1 million as DARTs were flat and average commission per trade increased $0.15 to $10.97. This was driven by higher options and stock plan mix. Relative to the year-ago quarter, commissions revenue decreased $1 million on lower trading activity, partially offset by a $0.10 increase in the average commission per trade also related to higher options and stock plan mix. Our DARTs of 152,000 this quarter include 6,500 from OptionsHouse for the 15 trading days of the quarter that they were under our umbrella. 
Fees and service charges revenue increased relative to both the prior quarter and the year-ago quarter. We recorded a $3 million sequentially increase on customer cash held by third parties as off-balance sheet cash grew amidst customer net selling. Meanwhile, we had a marginally higher average yield on these balances following the conversion of $4 billion of money market funds into our sweep program in early September. The $16 million year-over-year change reflects higher yield on third-party customer cash as well as an increased asset -- as well as increased asset-based fee revenue. For some context, the average yield on customer cash held by third parties was 47 basis points, up 6 basis points from Q2 and up 29 basis points from Q3 of last year. We expect this rate to move in line with broader short-term benchmark rates. 
The fees and services -- the fees and service charges line also contains approximately $3 million from OptionsHouse, which includes revenue from their customer margin and cash balances. Once we convert their third-party clearing arrangements in Q3 of next year, we will capture this revenue through NII. 
Securities and other gains were $14 million, up $10 million from the prior quarter as we reposition portions of the portfolio around Brexit-driven market volatility. For Q4, we expect gains to return to the $10 million range. 
Noninterest expense for the quarter was $323 million, up $28 million sequentially, including the unique items Karl mentioned. Our adjusted operating margin, which excludes provision, was 34%. This was driven lower by approximately 6 percentage points related to CEO severance, restructuring and acquisition-related costs. For Q4, we expect our adjusted op margin to be approximately 35%, which reflects the full quarter impact of OptionsHouse. 
Moving to the provision line. We recorded the benefit of $62 million for the quarter. The allowance ended at $235 million, a reduction of $58 million in the quarter as net charge-offs were a recovery of $4 million. The current period provision benefit resulted primarily from updated performance expectations based on sustained outperformance of high-risk HELOCs. The current period also reflected recoveries in excess of prior expectations as well as payoffs on loans converting to amortizing. We are now 73% through the HELOC conversions, providing ample data on the performance of these loans. 
Additionally, the portfolio continues to reduce in size ending the quarter at just $4.1 billion, down $315 million from the prior quarter. Further, our allowance coverage ratio remains healthy at 6% of the total loan portfolio. 
Moving on to capital. We distributed $125 million up to the parent during the quarter, including $85 million from the brokers and $40 million from the bank, which was below Q2 bank net income of $106 million as we preserved capital at the banks to fund planned balance sheet growth. I'd note that with respect to brokerage distributions in connection with the merger of our clearing and securities entities, we intend to distribute approximately $100 million to the parent in Q4. In the future, brokerage distribution should be consistent with excess capital generation. As for the bank, we intend to utilize the majority of its capital generation to fuel our balance sheet growth, but plan to distribute $50 million to the parent this quarter. 
On assets, we ended the quarter at $49.2 billion and have our sights on crossing $50 billion in the first half of next year. With significant customer net selling of $2.4 billion in the quarter, the conversion of $4 billion of money market funds to our sweep program and the addition of OptionsHouse, off-balance sheet customer cash is $14 billion. With around $3 billion now available to bring on -- not available to bring on balance sheet on a pro forma basis, we are just shy of $11 billion of cash for balance sheet growth. 
On a related note, with work on the enhanced regulatory build-out well underway, we feel good about crossing $50 billion in the first half of next year and anticipate ending Q2 with total assets of approximately $56 billion. As for the cost of the build-out, we continue to expect $50 million over 2 years with $15 million in annual run rate expense. The cost we have incurred to date are minimal and are included in our adjusted operating margin guidance for 2016. 
The bank's leverage ratio of 8.5% implies about $180 million of capital above our current 8% target. We intend to seek regulatory approval to lower that target to 7.5% early next year, which would free up an additional $180 million. As for parent capital, we ended the quarter with Tier 1 leverage ratio of 7.3%, down from 7.5% last quarter, but above our floor of 7%. Corporate cash ended the quarter at $306 million, a decrease of $217 million from the prior quarter. We issued $400 million of 5 7/8 Tier 1 qualifying noncumulative perpetual preferred stock during the quarter to partially fund the purchase of OptionsHouse. The remainder of the $725 million purchase price was funded with cash, thus contributing to the decrease during the quarter. This was partially offset by $125 million of subsidiary dividends. Barring any other attractive uses for parent cash, we will be in a position to resume share repurchases in the second half of 2017. 
To briefly summarize, Q3 was a busy quarter. We completed a meaningful acquisition, made progress achieving our expense synergy targets, aligned the company through a focus on core growth, identified additional cost saves, positioned the balance sheet to deliver considerable incremental value, and continue to exhibit marked progress on reducing risk. 
And with that, operator, we will open the call for questions."

And so this amount that's being released catches it up to that new guidance. So from a look forward perspective, the best guidance I can give you is 0."

This is a very important question, a lot of people I'm sure are thinking of the same question. So thanks for asking it. In terms of my response, let me give you a little bit of context and I may answer this question sl",781,"Okay, Rich, thanks for the question. This is a very important question, a lot of people I'm sure are thinking of the same question. So thanks for asking it. In terms of my response, let me give you a little bit of context and I may answer this question slightly longer than normal. We picked the 18 to 24 months because, I think, we all thought that was an adequate time to really show the board and to show shareholders that we could get along the growth map that we described at the Barclays conference. Actually we talked, Rich, about organic growth and may well be that an inorganic opportunity comes along during that process. But just with 18- to 24-month period, we thought it was adequate time to show we could deliver. And I think from a board point of view, we need to feel very, very comfortable and we can continue to add shareholder value. So now let's go to the potential outcomes and to the heart of your question, let's take a negative outlook first. What happens if we can't deliver? We conclude that we cannot get to those kind of growth rates and that we can't, therefore, continue to deliver shareholder value. And I think there are a series of options, more options than one might think. The one which obviously one goes through is a sale. But there may be other options in terms of partnerships, we have weaknesses, we know them in our business model. If we cannot correct them ourselves, it may be feasible to correct them with partners. But clearly, a sale, partnerships, there are a series of different scenarios which crop up. The only thing I would say, which is definitive is that the board will not allow loss of value. Now having said that, I looked at the positive side, let's assume we do deliver, which -- because it goes both ways and I recognize your question, what if we don't. Let's assume we do deliver, we actually at this moment in time really consider that is possible, wherein -- just speaking for myself, I don't know, if I speak for Karl and Mike and Brett, we're very, very impressed with what's happening here. And there's a real commitment to deliver on the growth drivers that we talked about at the Barclays conference. There are a body of people at E*TRADE who really want to succeed and want to see the company succeed. So even though we're talking about what happens if we don't succeed, I think it's not out of order to say that we believe very strongly we will. Now having said that, I'm sure we have the [indiscernible] in the phone audience who would say that's just words, but it gives you a little reminder. I came on this board at the beginning of 2012, along with my board colleague, Betty Zager [ph], from Charles Schwab. And I remember at that time, Rich, a lot of doubts are being expressed on whether we could deliver on what I characterize as a low-hanging fruit, but it really was tough to achieve. A lot of doubts are being expressed then. Could we refinance that debt? Could we improve our funding cost? Was our portfolio going to drown us? What's going to happen to the HELOCs? Will we be able get the benefit of our DTA given the fact that the DTA -- if you're not earning, how the hell can you use your DTA? And so -- and I think that doubt, by the way, wasn't my interpretation of body language and with the share price suck, it was somewhere in middle or low single digits. And yet 4.5 years later, here we are. So I think at that time was real doubt as to where the management team could deliver. Rich, I think we put our money where our mouth was and deliver good credit to them. So now, where do we go with the next 24 months, we will, as a board, seriously consider how we're doing and we'll consider all options. So this is not -- we usually out on anything, we will consider all options, we understand what our role is and the value we have to deliver. But I will say, again, given the kind of people we got at E*TRADE, I think we believe that we could achieve the value goals we will set. And we clearly that will mean an improvement in shareholder value as we go forward. So I've given you a longer answer, Rich, than the question you asked. But I hope it at least illustrative of what our thinking is."

I'm going to take a slightly different take here. As we think about some of the best avenues for creating long-term shareholder value and you certainly framed it in that context in terms of how you're thinking about the long-term brokerage strategy, can you articulate specifically how improving the organic growth profile by 200 to 300 basis points would justify operating on a stand-alone basis and is maybe a better alternative or more accretive path versus a combination with one of your largest brokerage peers?"

I can't tell you what the precise algorithm is that says 2% to 3% equals an accessible level of shareholder appreciation. But what I would say that, that level of growth gets us to market standards because that's how far we're behind. It will run through -- assuming we acquired the types of accounts and the types of trading activity and the types of margin that all things you obviously are very well aware of. And we have absorbed this huge amount of fixed expense in the company over the course of the last 2 or 3 years. Remember, seeing some of the prepared remarks addressed the fact that we really have fixed the operating foundation, I think were the words we used, of the company. So I think the reality is that level of growth will get us to a rate of return, which I think is comparable to our competitors in terms of the organic growth. We did say 18 to 24 months, but the world doesn't end at the end of 24 months. I think we'll be continuously reviewing that. We do have weaknesses in the business model, we recognize that. We would be happier if we have developed the RAA channel, we don't have it. Clearly, if we could have one acquired inorganically or at a sensible price, I think it will make us more competitive. But I think the 2% to 3% will deliver comparable rates of increased return. I think it also is a rallying cry for getting all the troops in the company to pursue what has to be done in order for us to be as competitive as we are. But having said all of the above, it's -- there really is never an end date. It's a continuous evolution, and we're going to have to keep evolving the company as we go forward."

We are at a critical juncture for E*TRADE and this last quarter was particularly significant. While all of you tuned in are certainly aware of the more headline-inducing changes we made, I'm going to take a few minutes to reiterate the emphasis for those changes before getting a bit of color on the board's current thinking about what constitutes success. And then finally, provide my observations of the company's current trajectory from my new unique vantage point as an insider. 
First of all, our decision to replace the CEO. E*TRADE has spent the last several years appropriately focused on the most impactful opportunities in its past, namely managing the wind down of the legacy balance sheet, bolstering its risk and operating foundations, improving all factors in its regulatory standing and, of course, unlocking and deploying a meaningful amount of capital to the benefit of the shareholders. Many of these efforts were interdependent and some were set in motion many years ago. But over the last 3 years, we've harvested most of the fruit of this labor, and the stock appreciated in commensurate fashion. During that period, the board has vigorously supported the management team in pursuing all of those matters. 
At the same time, however, we, as a board, always remained fully cognizant to the need to develop ongoing avenues of growth and value creation once the fixed [ph] story have been executed. Key to that growth has always been our core brokerage business. And as you'd expect, we've remained particularly focused on the major business driver metrics of accounts, DARTs and assets. I believe our business driver focus has always been thoughtful and certainly alert to the  impact of the vagaries of the markets. But having said that, as a board, we have become increasingly concerned with both current business driver results as well as the forward trajectory. 
Given that, we faced 2 choices: Give us more time or take action. We ultimately favored the latter and made changes at the top of the company. Again, the former CEO was a good steward of the company through its recent chapter. But we believe shareholders are better served with a reconfigured executive team to align the company for future growth. In putting together that team, we strongly believe that Karl Roessner was a natural choice to lead E*TRADE. Karl has a deep history of the company, substantial experience and knowledge across all elements of E*TRADE's business, a sharp commercial acumen and is a truly trusted partner to the board as well as an ongoing credible  presence with our regulators, which you all know is extremely important -- 
-- additionally, capitalizing on the completion of our OptionsHouse acquisition, Karl, again, with strong support from the board, has taken advantage of an opportunity to fill an important gap in our brokerage leadership, with the appointment of Michael Curcio as our Chief Brokerage Officer. Buttressed by the continued and noteworthy service of Mike Pizzi, as CFO, along with our other leaders, the board feels truly confident that this structure and this executive roster is well suited to accomplishing our goals. 
As for me, I've joined the team in a full-time role as Executive Chairman to ensure Karl has access to my years of industry experience as well as to support the board's agenda on a daily basis while working constructively with Karl and the management team. My role is not a permanent one, and I look forward to returning to nonexecutive chairmanship in due time. 
With the leadership team in place, however, I want to stress that we are not just looking to implement the right structure, but to drive tangible results to shareholders, which brings me to my next topic. 
What constitutes success for the company? In short, there are 3 areas: growth, improved operating leverage and a sense of urgency. I'll touch on each of these, none of which are mutually exclusive and then pass it over to Karl to elaborate further. 
Starting with our growth ambitions. Balance sheet expansion and breaking through the $50 billion threshold is well underway and is in the more-than-capable hands of Mike Pizzi and his team for implementation. I'm sure that will be discussed further today. 
Our growth focus and what we characterize as key business drivers comes in 2 flavors: organic and inorganic. Organically, the key growth levers are well-known, namely how we market our company to customers and prospects; how we package and promote our products; and finally, how we capitalize on the corporate services channel to drive more meaningful activity. By addressing these elements, we feel strongly that the company can make up lost ground relative to our industry peers. And as previously stated, we quantify that as a 2 to 3 percentage point improvement in our rate of annual organic growth across accounts, assets and trades. 
Inorganically, growth may come from in sector opportunities as well as adjacent ones, provided an acquisition supports our core business and aligns with our digital ethos. There is currently plenty of public chatter surrounding this topic, and I won't indulge it further. Allow me to say this, the E*TRADE Board is highly value conscious and the company's leadership is smart and methodical in their evaluation process. Translation: We will not overpay and we will not do anything stupid. 
Moving now to improving operating leverage, our perspective is very simple: we must find money to spend money. In this regard, this team is steadfast in their commitments in managing expenses through an operating margin framework, and -- Karl will speak more about this. But I'll mention that I've been impressed with how methodically the new leadership team has driven this goal forward in just a few weeks. I'd also add that this is an ongoing dynamic process. We will always be looking to enhance our operating leverage in the future, both through sound management as well as the intelligent application of technology. This is an attitude possessed by all good companies and is most certainly not a once-and-done approach. 
Now what do we mean by a sense of urgency? Philosophically, we believe it falls on the board and the senior management team to create and establish an ongoing sense of urgency in our business endeavors. With our capital initiatives and options relatively clearly defined, it's time for the core brokerage business to embrace initiatives and move forward more quickly. As a board, we certainly believe the new company leadership team can produce the desired results. It is critical that we also set and abide by a serious time line for that to unfold. 
Last month, I said that was 18 to 24 months, at which point the board will take stock and assess options for the company if our goals are not achieved. That time line stands and has been embraced by management as motivation to get things done, and I find that extraordinarily encouraging. 
Finally, I would like to share my observations for the company from the inside. I'm impressed with the management team's ability under Karl's leadership to make difficult decisions to drive results and to focus on our goals. This includes the work to integrate OptionsHouse, the meaningful changes to our organizational structure, and the intense drive to address expense issues. I'll let Karl speak to his team's work, but I'll just say the board is pleased with our state of play. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Karl."

I want to start by building on Rodger's observation with my own. 
With 7.5 years in the company, I can confidently state that I've never seen our leadership team act with more purpose or cohesiveness than it has over the past month. I'm truly impressed and believe we are all growing in the same direction. This is largely attributable to how we've realigned the team, but certainly aided by that board-encouraged sense of urgency that Rodger mentioned. I will start with the executive leadership team and the changes we made. 
First, with our most crucial goal centered on the brokerage business, installing a strong brokerage head was a key priority and Mike Curcio has definitely filled that role. Next, to centralize functions to directly support our business goals, I moved marketing and corporate services from the executive office to Mike Curcio's organization. Further, we removed an inefficient senior layer of business line COOs along with an unnecessary support and consulting structure across the company. It's easy to speak to growth, but if the internal environment isn't conducive to execution, it can be an impossible order. So we have made all of these changes with an eye on getting back to our lean, scrappy brokerage roots. Separately, we have consolidated oversight of our compliance and AML functions under Paul Brandow as Chief Risk Officer, aligning the structure to be consistent with industry standards and regulatory expectations. All of these organizational changes foster a more accountable and collaborative culture, one which I believe will produce measurable, positive results and one which comes at a significant savings to the P&L. 
To be clear, we have a sense of urgency and are focused on results. The key priorities to which we will hold ourselves accountable are: integrating OptionsHouse. This one's pretty obvious but it sits at the top of the list because of the importance that hangs on getting this right. It's imperative that we capture the full value associated with the deal, and we're on track to accomplish this. 
Refocusing on trading. We were once the undisputed leader in this space, but have notably fallen behind. We need to reearn this top spot and the purchase of OptionsHouse is only the beginning of these efforts. 
Deepening engagement with existing customers. Reinforcing our long-term investing offering remains a crucial component of our efforts. We offer the same products and services that many of our customers use elsewhere and need to create greater awareness of these offerings, particularly through our marketing efforts. 
Finally, never losing sight of all that we've accomplished on the risk and regulatory fronts. These key priorities are meant to improve performance across our core metrics and specifically generate account and asset growth and trading activity where, as Rodger noted, we're targeting a 2 to 3 percentage point improvement in our annual rate of growth. 
Additionally, we're turning up the focus on our derivatives mix, with an aggressive target of growing it to 35% of DARTs within the next 2 years. Further, with respect to long-term investing, we aim to grow our managed product AUM to $6 billion within the next 2 years. 
In tandem with our commitment to grow the business, we also understand our responsibility to be good stewards of shareholder value through operational efficiency. As a management team, we took a hard look at our operating model during the quarter, considering the impacts of the OptionsHouse acquisition and of our organizational realignment. As a result, we identified significant cost savings in the combined organization to be realized as part of our mandate to become more nimble while maintaining our strong risk culture, where I believe we are standard bearers in many respects. With regard to our $49 million of deal-related expense synergies, we have completed $15 million as of this call, with the balance expected to be realized by Q3 of next year when we complete the OptionsHouse integration. Also related to the close of the transaction, we had a $7 million charge in the restructuring line. 
Separately, following a focused review of our structure and expenses, this quarter we have eliminated an additional $21 million of annual run rate expenses. The restructuring line also reflects charges of $18 million, primarily related to these actions. 
Moving on to our results. We reported net income of $139 million or $0.51 per share. There's a decent amount of noise in these results, which boosted the bottom line by $19 million or $0.07 per share in total. On a pretax basis, these items were $6 million of severance related to our prior CEO, the $25 million of restructuring- and acquisition-related expenses I just mentioned and a $62 million provision benefit. 
On the metrics, excluding the OptionsHouse accounts we acquired, we added 14,000 net new brokerage accounts during the quarter, and our attrition rate was a healthy 8%. Our brokerage account growth rate was 1.7% for the quarter, down from 2.8% in the prior quarter. We also added $1.7 billion in net new brokerage assets, excluding OptionsHouse assets, which compares to $1.6 billion in the prior quarter and $2.1 billion a year ago. We ended the quarter with $307 billion in total customer assets, including $24.4 billion in fee-based assets, which are predominantly mutual funds and managed products. We ended the quarter with $3.7 billion in managed product AUM, including $176 million in adaptive portfolio, our newly launched robo-solution. 
Our DARTs for the quarter were 152,000, flat with the prior quarter and down 3% year-over-year. Excluding OptionsHouse, our DARTs would have been 146,000 for the quarter, down 4% sequentially and down 6% year-over-year. The quarterly decline reflects some seasonality and a fairly quiet macro market environment. The year-over-year comparison is a tough one given the turmoil in global markets that led us to a single-day trading record in August of last year. Approximately 26% of our DARTs were in derivatives in Q3, which includes a 1.7 percentage point boost from OptionsHouse over the final 15 days of the quarter. Pro forma with OptionsHouse for the full quarter, derivatives would have been 30%. Our customer margin balance has ended the quarter at $6.8 billion, including approximately $300 million from OptionsHouse. 
In closing, we're working hard to align the organization and all of our efforts for growth, and I'm confident in our ability to achieve our goals. I hope my remarks serve to show that we mean business when it comes to growing our business. I look forward to delivering and to keeping you all apprized along the way. 
I'll now turn it over to our CFO, Mike Pizzi."

For the quarter, we reported net income of $139 million or $0.51 per share. This compares to net income of $133 million or $0.48 per share in the prior quarter. It also compares to adjusted net income of $96 million or $0.32 per share in",1311,"Thank you, Karl. For the quarter, we reported net income of $139 million or $0.51 per share. This compares to net income of $133 million or $0.48 per share in the prior quarter. It also compares to adjusted net income of $96 million or $0.32 per share in the year ago quarter, which excludes $430 million of pretax charges related to the termination of wholesale funding obligations. 
Revenues for the quarter were $486 million, up $8 million from the prior quarter, largely related to higher customer cash held by third parties and up $55 million on an adjusted basis from the year ago quarter, which is attributable to the benefits from our wholesale funding termination and the Fed rate hike. 
Net interest income was $287 million for the quarter, up $1 million from the prior quarter as a 5 basis point reduction in net interest margin was offset by a $1.1 billion larger average balance sheet. Our net interest margin of 259 basis points decreased primarily due to faster prepayment speed on the securities portfolio, continued runoff of higher yielding legacy loan -- of the legacy loan portfolio and an unfavorable shift in margin balances to lower-priced tiers. Our average reinvestment rate is now in the range of 175 to 200 basis points. We continue to expect our full year net interest margin to be 260 to 265 basis points with Q4 in the mid-250s. This also assumes no change in the Fed fund's rate and that margin balances remain constant with their current levels. 
Commissions, fees and service charges and other revenues were $185 million, up $7 million from the prior quarter and up $15 million versus the year-ago quarter. Compared to Q2, commissions revenue increased $1 million as DARTs were flat and average commission per trade increased $0.15 to $10.97. This was driven by higher options and stock plan mix. Relative to the year-ago quarter, commissions revenue decreased $1 million on lower trading activity, partially offset by a $0.10 increase in the average commission per trade also related to higher options and stock plan mix. Our DARTs, up 152,000 this quarter include 6,500 from OptionsHouse for the 15 trading days of the quarter that they were under our umbrella. 
Fees and service charges revenue increased relative to both the prior quarter and the year-ago quarter. We recorded a $3 million sequentially increase on customer cash held by third parties as off-balance sheet cash grew amidst customer net selling. Meanwhile, we had a marginally higher average yield on these balances following the conversion of $4 billion of money market funds into our Sweep Program in early September. The $16 million year-over-year change reflects higher yield on third-party customer cash as well as an increased asset -- as well as increased asset-based fee revenue. For some context, the average yield on customer cash held by third parties was 47 basis points, up 6 basis points from Q2 and up 29 basis points from Q3 of last year. We expect this rate to move in line with broader short-term benchmark rates. 
The fees and services -- the fees and service charges line also contains approximately $3 million from OptionsHouse, which includes revenue from their customer margin and cash balances. Once we convert their third-party clearing arrangements in Q3 of next year, we will capture this revenue through NII. 
Securities and other gains were $14 million, up $10 million from the prior quarter as we reposition portions of the portfolio around Brexit-driven market volatility. For Q4, we expect gains to return to the $10 million range. 
Noninterest expense for the quarter was $323 million, up $28 million sequentially, including the unique items Karl mentioned. Our adjusted operating margin, which excludes provision, was 34%. This was driven lower by approximately 6 percentage points related to CEO severance, restructuring and acquisition-related costs. For Q4, we expect our adjusted op margin to be approximately 35%, which reflects the full quarter impact of OptionsHouse. 
Moving to the provision line. We recorded the benefit of $62 million for the quarter. The allowance ended at $235 million, a reduction of $58 million in the quarter as net charge-offs were a recovery of $4 million. The current period provision benefit resulted primarily from updated performance expectations based on sustained outperformance of high-risk HELOCs. The current period also reflected recoveries in excess of prior expectations as well as payoffs on loans converting to amortizing. We are now 73% through the HELOC conversions, providing ample data on the performance of these loans. 
Additionally, the portfolio continues to reduce in size ending the quarter at just $4.1 billion, down $315 million from the prior quarter. Further, our allowance coverage ratio remains healthy at 6% of the total loan portfolio. 
Moving on to capital. We distributed $125 million up to the parent during the quarter, including $85 million from the brokers and $40 million from the bank, which was below Q2 bank net income of $106 million as we preserved capital at the banks to fund planned balance sheet growth. I'd note that with respect to brokerage distributions in connection with the merger of our clearing and securities entities, we intend to distribute approximately $100 million to the parent in Q4. In the future, brokerage distribution should be consistent with excess capital generation. As for the bank, we intend to utilize the majority of its capital generation to fuel our balance sheet growth, but plan to distribute $50 million to the parent this quarter. 
On assets, we ended the quarter at $49.2 billion and have our sights on crossing $50 billion in the first half of next year. With significant customer net selling of $2.4 billion in the quarter, the conversion of $4 billion of money market funds to our Sweep Program and the addition of OptionsHouse, off-balance sheet customer cash is $14 billion. With around $3 billion now available to bring on -- not available to bring on balance sheet on a pro forma basis, we have just shy of $11 billion of cash for balance sheet growth. 
On a related note, with work on the enhanced regulatory build-out well underway, we feel good about crossing $50 billion in the first half of next year and anticipate ending Q2 with total assets of approximately $56 billion. As for the cost of the build-out, we continue to expect $50 million over 2 years with $15 million in annual run rate expense. The costs we have incurred to date are minimal and are included in our adjusted operating margin guidance for 2016. 
The bank's leverage ratio of 8.5% implies about $180 million of capital above our current 8% target. We intend to seek regulatory approval to lower that target to 7.5% early next year, which would free up an additional $180 million. As for parent capital, we ended the quarter with Tier 1 leverage ratio of 7.3%, down from 7.5% last quarter, but above our floor of 7%. Corporate cash ended the quarter at $306 million, a decrease of $217 million from the prior quarter. We issued $400 million of 5 7/8 Tier 1 qualifying noncumulative perpetual preferred stock during the quarter to partially fund the purchase of OptionsHouse. The remainder of the $725 million purchase price was funded with cash, thus contributing to the decrease during the quarter. This was partially offset by $125 million of subsidiary dividends. Barring any other attractive uses for parent cash, we will be in a position to resume share repurchases in the second half of 2017. 
To briefly summarize, Q3 was a busy quarter. We completed a meaningful acquisition, made progress achieving our expense synergy targets, aligned the company through a focus on core growth, identified additional cost saves, positioned the balance sheet to deliver considerable incremental value, and continue to exhibit marked progress on reducing risk. 
And with that, operator, we will open the call for questions."

This is a very important question, a lot of people I'm sure are thinking of the same question. So thanks for asking it. In terms of my response, let me give you a little bit of context and I may answer this question slightly longer than normal. We picked the 18 to 24 months because, I think, we all thought that was an adequate time to really show the board and to show shareholders that we could get along the growth map that we described at the Barclays conference. Actually we talked, Rich, more about organic growth and it may well be that an inorganic opportunity comes along during that process. But just with 18- to 24-month period, we thought it was adequate time to show we could deliver. And I think from a board point of view, we need to feel very, very comfortable that we can continue to add shareholder value. So now let's go to the potential outcomes and to the heart of your question. Let's take a negative outlook first. What happens if we can't deliver? We conclude that we cannot get to those kind of growth rates and that we can't, therefore, continue to deliver shareholder value. And I think there are a series of options, more options than one might think. The one which obviously everyone goes to is a sale. But there may be other options in terms of partnerships; we have weaknesses, we note them in our business model. If we cannot correct them ourselves, it may be feasible to correct them with partners. But clearly, a sale, partnerships, there are a series of different scenarios which crop up. The only thing I would say, which is definitive is that the board will not allow loss of value. Now having said that, I looked at the positive side, let's assume we do deliver, which -- because it goes both ways and I recognize your question was what if we don't. Let's assume we do deliver, we actually at this moment in time really consider that is possible, wherein -- just speaking for myself, but I know I speak for Karl and Mike and Brett, we're very, very impressed with what's happening here. And there's a real commitment to deliver on the growth drivers that we talked about at the Barclays conference. There are a body of people at E*TRADE who really want to succeed and want to see the company succeed. So even though we're talking about what happens if we don't succeed, I think it's not out of order to say that we believe very strongly we will. Now having said that, I'm sure we have the odd cynic in the phone audience who would say that's just words, but it gives you a little reminder. I came on this board at the beginning of 2012, along with my board colleague, Betty Zager [ph], from Charles Schwab. And I remember at that time, Rich, a lot of doubts are being expressed on whether we could deliver on what I characterize as a low-hanging fruit, but it really was tough to achieve. A lot of doubts were being expressed then. Could we refinance that debt? Could we improve our funding cost? Was our portfolio going to drown us? What's going to happen to the HELOCs? Will we be able to get the benefit of our DTA given the fact that the DTA -- if you're not earning, how the hell can you use your DTA? And so -- and I think that doubt, by the way, wasn't my interpretation of body language, I mean the share price sucked; it was somewhere in middle or low single digits. And yet 4.5 years later, here we are. So I think at that time was real doubt as to whether the management team could deliver. Rich, I think we put our money where our mouth was and delivered. Good credit to them. So now, where do we go with the next 24 months, we will, as a board, seriously consider how we're doing and we'll consider all options. So this is not -- we usually out on anything, we will consider all options, we understand what our role is and the value we have to deliver. But I will say, again, given the kind of people we've got at E*TRADE, I think we believe that we could achieve the value goals we will set. And we clearly that will mean an improvement in shareholder value as we go forward. So I've given you a longer answer, Rich, than the question you asked. But I hope it at least illustrative of what our thinking is."

I'm going to take a slightly different take here. As we think about some of the best avenues for creating long-term shareholder value and you certainly framed it in that context in terms of how you're thinking about the long-term brokerage strategy, can you articulate specifically how improving the organic growth profile by 200 to 300 basis points would justify operating on a stand-alone basis and is maybe a better alternative or more accretive path versus a combination with one of your largest brokerage peers?"

I can't tell you what the precise algorithm is that says 2% to 3% equals an accessible level of shareholder appreciation. But what I would say that, that level of growth gets us to market standards because that's how far we're behind. It will run through -- assuming we acquire the types of accounts and the types of trading activity and the types of margin that all things you obviously are very well aware of. And we have absorbed this huge amount of fixed expense in the company over the course of the last 2 or 3 years. Remember, seeing some of the prepared remarks addressed the fact that we really have fixed the operating foundation, I think were the words we used, of the company. So I think the reality is that level of growth will get us to a rate of return, which I think is comparable to our competitors in terms of the organic growth. We did say 18 to 24 months. The world doesn't end at the end of 24 months, I think we'll be continuously reviewing that. We do have weaknesses in the business model, we recognize that. We would be happier if we have developed the RAA channel, we don't have it. Clearly, if we could have one acquired inorganically or at a sensible price, I think it will make us more competitive. But I think the 2% to 3% will deliver comparable rates of increased return. I think it also is a rallying cry for getting all the troops in the company to pursue what has to be done in order for us to be as competitive as we are. But having said all of the above, it's -- there really is never an end date. It's a continuous evolution, and we're going to have to keep evolving the company as we go forward."

We, as a company, as you're well aware, have had our distractions over the last 5 or 6 years, maybe that takes some of the emphasis off. But I think we have dropped the ball to a degree. And personally, I think we've taken -- as we ought to great credit for the fact that we have really fixed the foundations of the company as per my prepared remarks. And we've also generated the kind of financial returns, which I alluded to earlier when I said I think there were doubts, we could do it. I think all credit to Michael Pizzi and his predecessor, [indiscernible] and others, because they've really delivered. But I think during that phase, we may have taken our eye off some of the marketing endeavors and we thought that financial success was an end in its own right as opposed to a means to an end.

For a reconciliation of such non-GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP figures and for a discussion of additional risks and uncertainties that may affect the future results of E*TRADE Financial, please refer to our earnings release furnished on Form 8-K and our 10-Ks, 10-Qs and other documents the company has filed with the SEC. All of these documents are also available at about.etrade.com. Note that we have not reconciled our forward-looking non-GAAP measures, including non-GAAP adjusted operating margin to the most directly comparable GAAP measures because material items that impact that measure are out of our control and cannot be reasonably predicted. This call will present information as of October 20, 2016. The company disclaims any duty to update forward-looking statements made during the call. 
This call is being recorded and a replay will be available via phone and webcast later this evening at about.etrade.com. No other recordings or copies of this call are authorized or may be relied upon.

We are at a critical juncture for E*TRADE and this last quarter was particularly significant. While all of you tuned in are certainly aware of the more headline-inducing changes we made, I'm going to take a few minutes to reiterate the emphasis for those changes before getting a bit of color on the board's current thinking about what constitutes success. And then finally, provide my observations of the company's current trajectory from my new unique vantage point as an insider. 
First of all, our decision to replace the CEO. E*TRADE has spent the last several years appropriately focused on the most impactful opportunities in its past, namely managing the wind down of the legacy balance sheet, bolstering its risk and operating foundations, improving all factors in its regulatory standing and, of course, unlocking and deploying a meaningful amount of capital to the benefit of the shareholders. Many of these efforts were interdependent and some were set in motion many years ago. But over the last 3 years, we've harvested most of the fruit of this labor, and the stock appreciated in commensurate fashion. During that period, the board has vigorously supported the management team in pursuing all of those matters. 
At the same time, however, we, as a board, always remained fully cognizant to the need to develop ongoing avenues of growth and value creation once the fixed [ph] story have been executed. Key to that growth has always been our core brokerage business. And as you'd expect, we've remained particularly focused on the major business driver metrics of accounts, DARTs and assets. I believe our business driver focus has always been thoughtful and certainly alert to the  impact of the vagaries of the markets. But having said that, as a board, we have become increasingly concerned with both current business driver results as well as the forward trajectory. 
Given that, we faced 2 choices: Give us more time or take action. We ultimately favored the latter and made changes at the top of the company. Again, the former CEO was a good steward of the company through its recent chapter. But we believe shareholders are better served with a reconfigured executive team to align the company for future growth. In putting together that team, we strongly believe that Karl Roessner was a natural choice to lead E*TRADE. Karl has a deep history of the company, substantial experience and knowledge across all elements of E*TRADE's business, a sharp commercial acumen and is a truly trusted partner to the board as well as an ongoing credible  presence with our regulators, which you all know is extremely important -- 
-- additionally, capitalizing on the completion of our OptionsHouse acquisition, Karl, again, with strong support from the board, has taken advantage of an opportunity to fill an important gap in our brokerage leadership, with the appointment of Michael Curcio as our Chief Brokerage Officer. Buttressed by the continued and noteworthy service of Mike Pizzi, as CFO, along with our other leaders, the board feels truly confident that this structure and this executive roster is well suited to accomplishing our goals. 
As for me, I've joined the team in a full-time role as Executive Chairman to ensure Karl has access to my years of industry experience as well as to support the board's agenda on a daily basis while working constructively with Karl and the management team. My role is not a permanent one, and I look forward to returning to nonexecutive chairmanship in due time. 
With the leadership team in place, however, I want to stress that we are not just looking to implement the right structure, but to drive tangible results to shareholders, which brings me to my next topic. 
What constitutes success for the company? In short, there are 3 areas: growth, improved operating leverage and a sense of urgency. I'll touch on each of these, none of which are mutually exclusive and then pass it over to Karl to elaborate further. 
Starting with our growth ambitions. Balance sheet expansion and breaking through the $50 billion threshold is well underway and is in the more-than-capable hands of Mike Pizzi and his team for implementation. I'm sure that will be discussed further today. 
Our growth focus and what we characterize as key business drivers comes in 2 flavors: organic and inorganic. Organically, the key growth levers are well-known, namely how we market our company to customers and prospects; how we package and promote our products; and finally, how we capitalize on the corporate services channel to drive more meaningful activity. By addressing these elements, we feel strongly that the company can make up lost ground relative to our industry peers. And as previously stated, we quantify that as a 2 to 3 percentage point improvement in our rate of annual organic growth across accounts, assets and trades. 
Inorganically, growth may come from in sector opportunities as well as adjacent ones, provided an acquisition supports our core business and aligns with our digital ethos. There is currently plenty of public chatter surrounding this topic, and I won't indulge it further. Allow me to say this, the E*TRADE Board is highly value conscious and the company's leadership is smart and methodical in their evaluation process. Translation: We will not overpay and we will not do anything stupid. 
Moving now to improving operating leverage, our perspective is very simple: we must find money to spend money. In this regard, this team is steadfast in their commitments in managing expenses through an operating margin framework, and -- Karl will speak more about this. But I'll mention that I've been impressed with how methodically the new leadership team has driven this goal forward in just a few weeks. I'd also add that this is an ongoing dynamic process. We will always be looking to enhance our operating leverage in the future, both through sound management as well as the intelligent application of technology. This is an attitude possessed by all good companies and is most certainly not a once-and-done approach. 
Now what do we mean by a sense of urgency? Philosophically, we believe it falls on the board and the senior management team to create and establish an ongoing sense of urgency in our business endeavors. With our capital initiatives and options relatively clearly defined, it's time for the core brokerage business to embrace initiatives and move forward more quickly. As a board, we certainly believe the new company leadership team can produce the desired results. It is critical that we also set and abide by a serious time line for that to unfold. 
Last month, I said that was 18 to 24 months, at which point the board will take stock and assess options for the company if our goals are not achieved. That time line stands and has been embraced by management as motivation to get things done, and I find that extraordinarily encouraging. 
Finally, I would like to share my observations for the company from the inside. I'm impressed with the management team's ability under Karl's leadership to make difficult decisions to drive results and to focus on our goals. This includes the work to integrate OptionsHouse, the meaningful changes to our organizational structure, and the intense drive to address expense issues. I'll let Karl speak to his team's work, but I'll just say the board is pleased with our state of play. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Karl."

I want to start by building on Rodger's observation with my own. 
With 7.5 years in the company, I can confidently state that I've never seen our leadership team act with more purpose or cohesiveness than it has over the past month. I'm truly impressed and believe we are all growing in the same direction. This is largely attributable to how we've realigned the team, but certainly aided by that board-encouraged sense of urgency that Rodger mentioned. I will start with the executive leadership team and the changes we made. 
First, with our most crucial goal centered on the brokerage business, installing a strong brokerage head was a key priority and Mike Curcio has definitely filled that role. Next, to centralize functions to directly support our business goals, I moved marketing and corporate services from the executive office to Mike Curcio's organization. Further, we removed an inefficient senior layer of business line COOs along with an unnecessary support and consulting structure across the company. It's easy to speak to growth, but if the internal environment isn't conducive to execution, it can be an impossible order. So we have made all of these changes with an eye on getting back to our lean, scrappy brokerage roots. Separately, we have consolidated oversight of our compliance and AML functions under Paul Brandow as Chief Risk Officer, aligning the structure to be consistent with industry standards and regulatory expectations. All of these organizational changes foster a more accountable and collaborative culture, one which I believe will produce measurable, positive results and one which comes at a significant savings to the P&L. 
To be clear, we have a sense of urgency and are focused on results. The key priorities to which we will hold ourselves accountable are: integrating OptionsHouse. This one's pretty obvious but it sits at the top of the list because of the importance that hangs on getting this right. It's imperative that we capture the full value associated with the deal, and we're on track to accomplish this. 
Refocusing on trading. We were once the undisputed leader in this space, but have notably fallen behind. We need to reearn this top spot and the purchase of OptionsHouse is only the beginning of these efforts. 
Deepening engagement with existing customers. Reinforcing our long-term investing offering remains a crucial component of our efforts. We offer the same products and services that many of our customers use elsewhere and need to create greater awareness of these offerings, particularly through our marketing efforts. 
Finally, never losing sight of all that we've accomplished on the risk and regulatory fronts. These key priorities are meant to improve performance across our core metrics and specifically generate account and asset growth and trading activity where, as Rodger noted, we're targeting a 2 to 3 percentage point improvement in our annual rate of growth. 
Additionally, we're turning up the focus on our derivatives mix, with an aggressive target of growing it to 35% of DARTs within the next 2 years. Further, with respect to long-term investing, we aim to grow our managed product AUM to $6 billion within the next 2 years. 
In tandem with our commitment to grow the business, we also understand our responsibility to be good stewards of shareholder value through operational efficiency. As a management team, we took a hard look at our operating model during the quarter, considering the impacts of the OptionsHouse acquisition and of our organizational realignment. As a result, we identified significant cost savings in the combined organization to be realized as part of our mandate to become more nimble while maintaining our strong risk culture, where I believe we are standard bearers in many respects. With regard to our $49 million of deal-related expense synergies, we have completed $15 million as of this call, with the balance expected to be realized by Q3 of next year when we complete the OptionsHouse integration. Also related to the close of the transaction, we had a $7 million charge in the restructuring line. 
Separately, following a focused review of our structure and expenses, this quarter we have eliminated an additional $21 million of annual run rate expenses. The restructuring line also reflects charges of $18 million, primarily related to these actions. 
Moving on to our results. We reported net income of $139 million or $0.51 per share. There's a decent amount of noise in these results, which boosted the bottom line by $19 million or $0.07 per share in total. On a pretax basis, these items were $6 million of severance related to our prior CEO, the $25 million of restructuring- and acquisition-related expenses I just mentioned and a $62 million provision benefit. 
On the metrics, excluding the OptionsHouse accounts we acquired, we added 14,000 net new brokerage accounts during the quarter, and our attrition rate was a healthy 8%. Our brokerage account growth rate was 1.7% for the quarter, down from 2.8% in the prior quarter. We also added $1.7 billion in net new brokerage assets, excluding OptionsHouse assets, which compares to $1.6 billion in the prior quarter and $2.1 billion a year ago. We ended the quarter with $307 billion in total customer assets, including $24.4 billion in fee-based assets, which are predominantly mutual funds and managed products. We ended the quarter with $3.7 billion in managed product AUM, including $176 million in adaptive portfolio, our newly launched robo-solution. 
Our DARTs for the quarter were 152,000, flat with the prior quarter and down 3% year-over-year. Excluding OptionsHouse, our DARTs would have been 146,000 for the quarter, down 4% sequentially and down 6% year-over-year. The quarterly decline reflects some seasonality and a fairly quiet macro market environment. The year-over-year comparison is a tough one given the turmoil in global markets that led us to a single-day trading record in August of last year. Approximately 26% of our DARTs were in derivatives in Q3, which includes a 1.7 percentage point boost from OptionsHouse over the final 15 days of the quarter. Pro forma with OptionsHouse for the full quarter, derivatives would have been 30%. Our customer margin balance has ended the quarter at $6.8 billion, including approximately $300 million from OptionsHouse. 
In closing, we're working hard to align the organization and all of our efforts for growth, and I'm confident in our ability to achieve our goals. I hope my remarks serve to show that we mean business when it comes to growing our business. I look forward to delivering and to keeping you all apprized along the way. 
I'll now turn it over to our CFO, Mike Pizzi."

For the quarter, we reported net income of $139 million or $0.51 per share. This compares to net income of $133 million or $0.48 per share in the prior quarter. It also compares to adjusted net income of $96 million or $0.32 per share in",1311,"Thank you, Karl. For the quarter, we reported net income of $139 million or $0.51 per share. This compares to net income of $133 million or $0.48 per share in the prior quarter. It also compares to adjusted net income of $96 million or $0.32 per share in the year ago quarter, which excludes $430 million of pretax charges related to the termination of wholesale funding obligations. 
Revenues for the quarter were $486 million, up $8 million from the prior quarter, largely related to higher customer cash held by third parties and up $55 million on an adjusted basis from the year ago quarter, which is attributable to the benefits from our wholesale funding termination and the Fed rate hike. 
Net interest income was $287 million for the quarter, up $1 million from the prior quarter as a 5 basis point reduction in net interest margin was offset by a $1.1 billion larger average balance sheet. Our net interest margin of 259 basis points decreased primarily due to faster prepayment speed on the securities portfolio, continued runoff of higher yielding legacy loan -- of the legacy loan portfolio and an unfavorable shift in margin balances to lower-priced tiers. Our average reinvestment rate is now in the range of 175 to 200 basis points. We continue to expect our full year net interest margin to be 260 to 265 basis points with Q4 in the mid-250s. This also assumes no change in the Fed fund's rate and that margin balances remain constant with their current levels. 
Commissions, fees and service charges and other revenues were $185 million, up $7 million from the prior quarter and up $15 million versus the year-ago quarter. Compared to Q2, commissions revenue increased $1 million as DARTs were flat and average commission per trade increased $0.15 to $10.97. This was driven by higher options and stock plan mix. Relative to the year-ago quarter, commissions revenue decreased $1 million on lower trading activity, partially offset by a $0.10 increase in the average commission per trade also related to higher options and stock plan mix. Our DARTs, up 152,000 this quarter include 6,500 from OptionsHouse for the 15 trading days of the quarter that they were under our umbrella. 
Fees and service charges revenue increased relative to both the prior quarter and the year-ago quarter. We recorded a $3 million sequentially increase on customer cash held by third parties as off-balance sheet cash grew amidst customer net selling. Meanwhile, we had a marginally higher average yield on these balances following the conversion of $4 billion of money market funds into our Sweep Program in early September. The $16 million year-over-year change reflects higher yield on third-party customer cash as well as an increased asset -- as well as increased asset-based fee revenue. For some context, the average yield on customer cash held by third parties was 47 basis points, up 6 basis points from Q2 and up 29 basis points from Q3 of last year. We expect this rate to move in line with broader short-term benchmark rates. 
The fees and services -- the fees and service charges line also contains approximately $3 million from OptionsHouse, which includes revenue from their customer margin and cash balances. Once we convert their third-party clearing arrangements in Q3 of next year, we will capture this revenue through NII. 
Securities and other gains were $14 million, up $10 million from the prior quarter as we reposition portions of the portfolio around Brexit-driven market volatility. For Q4, we expect gains to return to the $10 million range. 
Noninterest expense for the quarter was $323 million, up $28 million sequentially, including the unique items Karl mentioned. Our adjusted operating margin, which excludes provision, was 34%. This was driven lower by approximately 6 percentage points related to CEO severance, restructuring and acquisition-related costs. For Q4, we expect our adjusted op margin to be approximately 35%, which reflects the full quarter impact of OptionsHouse. 
Moving to the provision line. We recorded the benefit of $62 million for the quarter. The allowance ended at $235 million, a reduction of $58 million in the quarter as net charge-offs were a recovery of $4 million. The current period provision benefit resulted primarily from updated performance expectations based on sustained outperformance of high-risk HELOCs. The current period also reflected recoveries in excess of prior expectations as well as payoffs on loans converting to amortizing. We are now 73% through the HELOC conversions, providing ample data on the performance of these loans. 
Additionally, the portfolio continues to reduce in size ending the quarter at just $4.1 billion, down $315 million from the prior quarter. Further, our allowance coverage ratio remains healthy at 6% of the total loan portfolio. 
Moving on to capital. We distributed $125 million up to the parent during the quarter, including $85 million from the brokers and $40 million from the bank, which was below Q2 bank net income of $106 million as we preserved capital at the banks to fund planned balance sheet growth. I'd note that with respect to brokerage distributions in connection with the merger of our clearing and securities entities, we intend to distribute approximately $100 million to the parent in Q4. In the future, brokerage distribution should be consistent with excess capital generation. As for the bank, we intend to utilize the majority of its capital generation to fuel our balance sheet growth, but plan to distribute $50 million to the parent this quarter. 
On assets, we ended the quarter at $49.2 billion and have our sights on crossing $50 billion in the first half of next year. With significant customer net selling of $2.4 billion in the quarter, the conversion of $4 billion of money market funds to our Sweep Program and the addition of OptionsHouse, off-balance sheet customer cash is $14 billion. With around $3 billion now available to bring on -- not available to bring on balance sheet on a pro forma basis, we have just shy of $11 billion of cash for balance sheet growth. 
On a related note, with work on the enhanced regulatory build-out well underway, we feel good about crossing $50 billion in the first half of next year and anticipate ending Q2 with total assets of approximately $56 billion. As for the cost of the build-out, we continue to expect $50 million over 2 years with $15 million in annual run rate expense. The costs we have incurred to date are minimal and are included in our adjusted operating margin guidance for 2016. 
The bank's leverage ratio of 8.5% implies about $180 million of capital above our current 8% target. We intend to seek regulatory approval to lower that target to 7.5% early next year, which would free up an additional $180 million. As for parent capital, we ended the quarter with Tier 1 leverage ratio of 7.3%, down from 7.5% last quarter, but above our floor of 7%. Corporate cash ended the quarter at $306 million, a decrease of $217 million from the prior quarter. We issued $400 million of 5 7/8 Tier 1 qualifying noncumulative perpetual preferred stock during the quarter to partially fund the purchase of OptionsHouse. The remainder of the $725 million purchase price was funded with cash, thus contributing to the decrease during the quarter. This was partially offset by $125 million of subsidiary dividends. Barring any other attractive uses for parent cash, we will be in a position to resume share repurchases in the second half of 2017. 
To briefly summarize, Q3 was a busy quarter. We completed a meaningful acquisition, made progress achieving our expense synergy targets, aligned the company through a focus on core growth, identified additional cost saves, positioned the balance sheet to deliver considerable incremental value, and continue to exhibit marked progress on reducing risk. 
And with that, operator, we will open the call for questions."

This is a very important question, a lot of people I'm sure are thinking of the same question. So thanks for asking it. In terms of my response, let me give you a little bit of context and I may answer this question slightly longer than normal. We picked the 18 to 24 months because, I think, we all thought that was an adequate time to really show the board and to show shareholders that we could get along the growth map that we described at the Barclays conference. Actually we talked, Rich, more about organic growth and it may well be that an inorganic opportunity comes along during that process. But just with 18- to 24-month period, we thought it was adequate time to show we could deliver. And I think from a board point of view, we need to feel very, very comfortable that we can continue to add shareholder value. So now let's go to the potential outcomes and to the heart of your question. Let's take a negative outlook first. What happens if we can't deliver? We conclude that we cannot get to those kind of growth rates and that we can't, therefore, continue to deliver shareholder value. And I think there are a series of options, more options than one might think. The one which obviously everyone goes to is a sale. But there may be other options in terms of partnerships; we have weaknesses, we note them in our business model. If we cannot correct them ourselves, it may be feasible to correct them with partners. But clearly, a sale, partnerships, there are a series of different scenarios which crop up. The only thing I would say, which is definitive is that the board will not allow loss of value. Now having said that, I looked at the positive side, let's assume we do deliver, which -- because it goes both ways and I recognize your question was what if we don't. Let's assume we do deliver, we actually at this moment in time really consider that is possible, wherein -- just speaking for myself, but I know I speak for Karl and Mike and Brett, we're very, very impressed with what's happening here. And there's a real commitment to deliver on the growth drivers that we talked about at the Barclays conference. There are a body of people at E*TRADE who really want to succeed and want to see the company succeed. So even though we're talking about what happens if we don't succeed, I think it's not out of order to say that we believe very strongly we will. Now having said that, I'm sure we have the odd cynic in the phone audience who would say that's just words, but it gives you a little reminder. I came on this board at the beginning of 2012, along with my board colleague, Betty Zager [ph], from Charles Schwab. And I remember at that time, Rich, a lot of doubts are being expressed on whether we could deliver on what I characterize as a low-hanging fruit, but it really was tough to achieve. A lot of doubts were being expressed then. Could we refinance that debt? Could we improve our funding cost? Was our portfolio going to drown us? What's going to happen to the HELOCs? Will we be able to get the benefit of our DTA given the fact that the DTA -- if you're not earning, how the hell can you use your DTA? And so -- and I think that doubt, by the way, wasn't my interpretation of body language, I mean the share price sucked; it was somewhere in middle or low single digits. And yet 4.5 years later, here we are. So I think at that time was real doubt as to whether the management team could deliver. Rich, I think we put our money where our mouth was and delivered. Good credit to them. So now, where do we go with the next 24 months, we will, as a board, seriously consider how we're doing and we'll consider all options. So this is not -- we usually out on anything, we will consider all options, we understand what our role is and the value we have to deliver. But I will say, again, given the kind of people we've got at E*TRADE, I think we believe that we could achieve the value goals we will set. And we clearly that will mean an improvement in shareholder value as we go forward. So I've given you a longer answer, Rich, than the question you asked. But I hope it at least illustrative of what our thinking is."

As we think about some of the best avenues for creating long-term shareholder value and you certainly framed it in that context in terms of how you're thinking about the long-term brokerage strategy, can you articulate specifically how improving the organic growth profile by 200 to 300 basis points would justify operating on a stand-alone basis and is maybe a better alternative or more accretive path versus a combination with one of your largest brokerage peers?"

I can't tell you what the precise algorithm is that says 2% to 3% equals an accessible level of shareholder appreciation. But what I would say that, that level of growth gets us to market standards because that's how far we're behind. It will run through -- assuming we acquire the types of accounts and the types of trading activity and the types of margin that all things you obviously are very well aware of. And we have absorbed this huge amount of fixed expense in the company over the course of the last 2 or 3 years. Remember, seeing some of the prepared remarks addressed the fact that we really have fixed the operating foundation, I think were the words we used, of the company. So I think the reality is that level of growth will get us to a rate of return, which I think is comparable to our competitors in terms of the organic growth. We did say 18 to 24 months. The world doesn't end at the end of 24 months, I think we'll be continuously reviewing that. We do have weaknesses in the business model, we recognize that. We would be happier if we have developed the RAA channel, we don't have it. Clearly, if we could have one acquired inorganically or at a sensible price, I think it will make us more competitive. But I think the 2% to 3% will deliver comparable rates of increased return. I think it also is a rallying cry for getting all the troops in the company to pursue what has to be done in order for us to be as competitive as we are. But having said all of the above, it's -- there really is never an end date. It's a continuous evolution, and we're going to have to keep evolving the company as we go forward."

We, as a company, as you're well aware, have had our distractions over the last 5 or 6 years, maybe that takes some of the emphasis off. But I think we have dropped the ball to a degree. And personally, I think we've taken -- as we ought to great credit for the fact that we have really fixed the foundations of the company as per my prepared remarks. And we've also generated the kind of financial returns, which I alluded to earlier when I said I think there were doubts, we could do it. I think all credit to Michael Pizzi and his predecessor, [indiscernible] and others, because they've really delivered. But I think during that phase, we may have taken our eye off some of the marketing endeavors and we thought that financial success was an end in its own right as opposed to a means to an end.
