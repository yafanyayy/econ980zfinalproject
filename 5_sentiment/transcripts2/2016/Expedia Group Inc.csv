Good afternoon, everybody, and welcome to Expedia Inc.'s conference call for the fourth quarter and full year 2015.
I'm pleased to be joined on the call today by Dara Khosrowshahi, Expedia's CEO and President; and Mark Okerstrom, CFO and EVP of Operations.
The following discussion, including responses to your questions, reflects management's views as of today, February 10, 2016, only. We do not undertake any obligation to update or revise this information.
As always, some of the statements made on today's call are forward-looking, typically preceded by words such as we expect, we believe, we anticipate or similar statements. Please refer to today's press release and the company's filings with the SEC for information about factors, which could cause our actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements.
You'll find reconciliations of our non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures discussed today in our earnings release, which is posted on the company's IR website at ir.expediainc.com. I encourage you to periodically visit our Investor Relations site for important content, including today's earnings release and an updated investor deck.
As a reminder, we sold our 62.4% ownership stake in eLong on May 22, 2015, which is previously a consolidated entity of Expedia, Inc. For GAAP accounting purposes, the results of eLong are included in our results through the date of the sale.  In order to allow investors to compare our current results on a like-for-like basis with our historical results, our commentary in the earnings release and on this call is principally focused on our results excluding eLong, which should be considered in addition to the GAAP results on a fully consolidated basis.
 Finally, unless otherwise stated, all references to cost of revenue, selling and marketing expense, general and administrative expense, and technology and content expense, also exclude stock-based compensation and depreciation expense. And all comparisons on this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2014.
And with that, let me turn the call over to Dara."

I wanted to start right upfront thanking our employees all over the world for another strong year for Expedia Inc. Mark, Alan and I get to tell you about it and take public credit for the success of our company, but it's amalgamation of ever",1109,"Thanks, Alan. I wanted to start right upfront thanking our employees all over the world for another strong year for Expedia Inc. Mark, Alan and I get to tell you about it and take public credit for the success of our company, but it's amalgamation of everyone's dedication and good work that adds up to the figures that we'll review today. And the figures tell a consistently strong story. Gross bookings for 2015, up 24% to $59.7 billion, and total revenue up 19% to $6.6 billion. Our customers bought 35% more airline tickets, 36% more room nights, totaling more than $200 million for the year and 37% more car days in 2015 versus 2014. We delivered nearly $1.2 billion of adjusted EBITDA for the year, impressive in its own right, but especially so we can consider the huge headwinds from foreign currency, the significant investments we're making and resetting our contracted margin structure with our hotel partners and the deal-related cost that we incurred in connection with our busy year of M&A activity.
Speaking of M&A, 2015 was an unprecedented year for Expedia as we completed over $6 billion of strategic acquisitions, which included Travelocity and a majority stake in our areas of joint venture, a significant minority investment in Decolar, Orbitz Worldwide and most recently, our largest acquisition ever in Home Away. These transactions have consolidated and scaled our U.S. operations, extended our international reach and have opened up a new leg of growth on the alternative accommodation sector. We also divested our stake in eLong for a nice profit and entered into a long-term alliance with Briefly on Orbitz, the integration is progressing well with nearly all of the direct type in traffic of Orbitz.com and Cheap Tickets already on the Brand Expedia platform. It's early but results so far look promising. The migration work will continue to the first half of 2016, followed by optimizing the sites and tuning their variable marketing channels post migration. We're also actively working on other parts of the Orbitz business, including ebookers, Hotel Club, Orbitz Partner Network and Orbitz for Business. Our goal is to migrate the vast majority of our Orbitz for Business clients onto the Egencia platform before year-end. We're also on active dialogue with our private label partners and expanding our relationship with them, and we see these efforts carrying through 2016 and into 2017 for partners.
Moving forward, we're planning to invest aggressively in our private label and partnership capabilities and consider this area highly strategic for our company. I'll also add that we're very pleased with the talent level and execution capability of our Orbitz teams all over the world. The people and the brands we've added to our family will play an important role in our future success.
It's very early but we're encouraged with the Home Away's Q4 performance coming in a bit ahead of our expectations and have been consistently impressed with the level of talent. They operated largely as a stand-alone business and will serve as the end-to-end vacation rental and home sharing platform for Expedia Inc. family. That said, we plan to be highly involved with the Home Away team, helping them expand aggressively and move from their traditional listings model to fully online transactional model. The team is beginning to introduce service fee to travelers, and we expect that it will be fully launched on as a U.S. vacation rental listings in the coming months slightly ahead of schedule. On the same time, we're rolling out supply commissions for paper bookings as well as a booklet confidence guarantee, which is designed to encourage travelers to book on Home Away and give them increased peace of mind when they do. We started an integrated marketing campaign in some of our major markets and intend to reinvest incremental upside from travel fees back into the business, particularly in product, technology and marketing. We remain confident in our estimate of $350 million in adjusted EBITDA for Home Away in 2018.
We continue to see strong growth for trivago in Q4 and, in fact, for all of 2015. We've had some investor questions in regards to trivago's core growth and profitability, and we'd like to share some numbers for European markets versus the rest of the world. To take out the noise created by foreign exchange fluctuations, the numbers here are stated hero. Trivago delivered 2015 stand-alone revenue of roughly EUR 490 million, up nearly 60% year-over-year with adjusted EBITDA of a few million euro. Now within these numbers, their most mature European markets collectively had revenue of over EUR 250 million, up 20% year-over-year and with the contribution margin after direct marketing cost of about 25%. trivago's rest of the world markets had revenue of EUR 235 million, up nearly 130% and a contribution margin just above breakeven. Note also that overhead cost for trivago had been running in the neighborhood of 10% of revenue. While we expect trivago to achieve healthy top and bottom line growth in 2016, we'll continue to reinvest profits from core markets to further scale expansion markets on a worldwide basis. The trivago team is first rate, and we believe the global growth run rate for this brand continues to be substantial.
Lastly, underpinning our active M&A strategy investment in high-growth businesses is a core organic business that has never been stronger. Brand Expedia, Hotels.com, our Expedia Affiliate Network business, all had terrific years delivering healthy adjusted EBITDA growth. Egencia, our corporate travel business had another excellent year, signing up over 1.1 billion of new client business and delivering 12% adjusted EBITDA growth. Supporting all of our brands, our lodging supply team is also firing on all cylinders, signing up nearly 60,000 new directly contracted hotel properties in 2015, up over 30% year-on-year.
Since I opened my remarks with our accomplishments as a company, I'll close with some thoughts about key challenges. Competition for consumer attention is as strong as ever as our competitors, and in some case, our partners, invest and innovate aggressively. We're also jumping into the alternative accommodations space where there's already a sizable competitor and where we have a significant business model transition to undertake at Home Away. And as I described, we have heavy integration work with Orbitz. These matters, along with a volatile global macroeconomic climate, together create a very dynamic and challenging environment to say the least. That said, our business and our teams are no strangers to these constant challenges. We're focused, we're hungry. We have an established execution and capital allocation record and you take these challenges head-on and with confidence.
With that, I'll hand it to Mark."

One quick reminder before I get started, as with the case last quarter, in order to help the comparability, our comments today are focused on Expedia results excluding eLong since we sold our 62% in eLong last May. Financial results for that",1440,"Thanks, Dara. One quick reminder before I get started, as with the case last quarter, in order to help the comparability, our comments today are focused on Expedia results excluding eLong since we sold our 62% in eLong last May. Financial results for that business are included in our GAAP results on a consolidated basis through the date of the sale. We were quite pleased with our financial performance in the fourth quarter and for the full year 2015, excluding an estimated headwind of $10 million to $15 million from the impact of the terrorist attacks in Paris and the negative impact of Home Away in the quarter not contemplated in our prior guidance. Our full year 2015 adjusted EBITDA growth exceeded the guidance we gave on our Q3 call. In the fourth quarter, top line growth was driven by solid unit growth across products, geographies and major brands but, first, we are getting a boost as we consolidate Orbitz. But despite the law of large numbers, our organic growth rates continue to be very healthy and comparable to the rates of growth we have seen for the last couple of years. In hotel, revenue grew 24% on room night growth of 39%. The inorganic contributions to hotel revenue and room night growth were 14 and 15 percentage points, respectively. We estimate the negative impact from Paris was around 300 basis points for both measures. Revenue per room night was 11% in Q4 and on a 5% decline in average daily rates. Note that the gap between revenue per room night and ADRs narrowed this quarter compared to Q3, principally on reduced foreign exchange impacts. We do expect to see continued year-over-year pressure on revenue per room night in 2016 as we create some of our unit economics to drive volume and global scale. Air revenue was up 61% on ticket growth of 70%, partially offset by decline in revenue per ticket of 5%. Brand Expedia continued to grow ticket volume at healthy organic rate along with sizable contributions from recently acquired companies. Excluding acquisitions, air revenue grew 6% on ticket growth of 22%. Key to our strategy is to grow additional travel products alongside air tickets and room nights. We are pleased to see some good examples of this in Q4, including 66% transaction growth for our local activities business and 43% revenue growth for insurance product. We also continue to see solid growth in our Advertising & Media business with trivago growing stand-alone revenue 27% or approximately 43% currency-neutral, fairly consistent with the year-over-year growth we saw in Q3. Media Solutions also grew revenue nicely with the boost from the addition of Orbitz. Home Away finished 2015 strongly and a bit ahead of their plans as measured on a stand-alone basis. For Expedia Inc., Home Away contributed revenue this quarter for approximately $20 million, which has been classified as other revenue in our product classification. We are breaking out Home Away as a separate segment, so you will be expected to see the stand-alone performance on an ongoing basis. Because Home Away is in the process of moving to an online booking model and a fair bit of the booking still occur outside of the platform, we are not planning to report gross bookings or unit growth for that business at this time. Although the seasonality of our business can cause the shape of our P&L to vary quarter-to-quarter, we continue to drive the results that use leverage achieved in key expense categories to fund aggressive selling and marketing investments around the world. In Q4, excluding the impact from Orbitz and Home Away, the P&L we delivered was largely consistent with this approach. Selling and marketing grew a bit faster than revenue, while cost of revenue and G&A grew slower, providing leverage. Our technology and content expense did grow faster than revenue and nearly 60 percentage points faster than Q3 on a combination of higher people cost along with lower capitalization rates. We continue to scale up our core infrastructure and Brand Expedia technology teams to support organic growth and to drive the integration of our annual OTA brands. And as such, we are expecting elevated technology and content expense growth at least for the first half of 2016. Importantly, our results for Q4 included the first full quarter of Orbitz and the layering in of the Home Away stand-alone financials for the 17 days of the quarter that we own the business. The operations of Orbitz for a full quarter along with deal-related and integration costs resulted in approximate breakeven adjusted EBITDA contribution for that business in Q4, which included a purchase accounting revenue headwind of approximately $27 million. Overall, the Orbitz results were a bit better than we had expected on a combination of lower integration costs and better overall performance. Home Away had a negative impact on adjusted EBITDA $14 million in Q4 not contemplated in the guidance we gave on our Q3 call. This included the results of the business, the negative impact of deal-related costs and a purchase accounting revenue headwind of approximately $6 million. Briefly, as we enter a new year, I'd like to remind folks of a few key aspects of how we manage the business. We are committed to striking the balance between delivering healthy profit growth in the near and midterm while making key investments in our business that will allow us to grow sustainably over many years to come. From a practical perspective, this means that when we see certain upside and/or outperformance for month-to-month to quarter-to-quarter, including from acquisitions, we have a bias to reinvest at least a portion of that upside back into the business. As part of this approach, we do not guide to quarterly results, and investors should not expect to see the full amount of organic overperformance or M&A-related windfalls drop immediately to the bottom line. This is an important tenet for how we are running our business, and we want investors to fully understand this approach.
Turning to our financial expectations for 2016. On a consolidated basis including all of the businesses we won today and excluding eLong, we are expecting full year adjusted EBITDA to grow in the range of 35% to 45% year-over-year. The contribution to this result from a full year of Orbitz and Home Away combined is expected to be in the range of $275 million to $325 million. In terms of the shape of the year, we are expecting particular pressure on Q1 adjusted EBITDA. Due to the seasonal nature of our business, back-end loading of adjusted EBITDA dollar growth is not unusual though we do expect the impact will be specially acute in 2016. This is due primarily to the integration of Orbitz and the timing of synergy realization, which will ramp in the back half of the year along with the transition of Home Away. As a further reminder, note that we lapped our acquisition of in the fourth quarter of 2015 and will lap both the Travelocity acquisition and the consolidation of the Air Asia Expedia joint venture in Q1, which will create tougher comps. Further, the rollout of TripAdvisor's Instant Book product will also likely continue to be a small headwind on room night growth in 2016 with an insignificant impact on profitability. From an expense standpoint, including Orbitz and Home Away, while we will see leverage and cost of revenue and general and administrative expenses in 2016, we expect technology and content expenses to grow faster than revenue, primarily driven by integration efforts and the inorganic impacts of our recent acquisitions. Regarding taxes, as you might imagine, there's lots of moving parts, especially related to newly acquired companies and our international versus domestic mix. However, we currently expect effective tax rates in the mid-20% range.
Finally, some directional color on our CapEx trends. In 2015, we saw significant capital growth with about half of the dollar growth attributable to the purchase of our future headquarters. Spending for real estate, in general, also was elevated as we continue to grow our market management team aggressively and built out new office space around the world. In addition, we invested heavily in servers and other hardware in anticipation of future organic growth and upcoming integrations. To a lesser extent, an increase in capitalized software development cost also contributed to year-over-year CapEx growth. For 2016, we expect a much more moderate pace of CapEx growth, most of which will be driven by the inorganic impact of recent acquisitions.
With that, let's move to Q&A. Operator, will you please remind participants how to queue up for questions?"

And as far as the macro environment goes, we listen to the same news that you do and certainly, the news suggests that the macro environment is pretty uncertain and the stock market downward scary. That said, when you look at the macro environment and how it affects our business, 1 important factor in our business is the air business. And air ticket prices are down pretty significantly year-on-year. It's obviously some of the savings of oil prices that are being passed on by the airlines to consumers, and that's an unambiguous positive for us. The more I -- the lower air ticket prices go, the more the leisure traveler tends to fly. And the more the leisure traveler tends to fly, as you know, we have a bit of what we think is a strategic investment, strategic advantage on the air side. And the more these travelers we have flying, the more opportunity we have to sell hotels and insurance and cars and everything else to that. So to some extent, we think some oil on the air side is a pretty big positive for us. On the hotel side, while we have seen ADRs weaken a bit between the beginning of the year and Q4, when we look at Q4 trends into January, we don't see anything of note one way or the other. There are some spot issues, obviously, Paris' week, which is perfectly explainable. New York ADRs continue to be down year-on-year over -- although they've improved over Q4, and that's European travelers really traveling into the U.S. and the effect of foreign exchange. In Asia, we see certain markets, like Hong Kong and Macao, down as far as ADRs go. But again, no significant shifts when you look at Q4 trends into January that are of note. So it's something that we'll watch. And to the extent that we see anything, we'll certainly share with our investors, but we're not seeing any material movement one way or the other right now."

It's a possible outcome, so I wouldn't put a lot of weight on that. That has been combined essentially with the Home Away projections and we did not, at that time, contribute to the combination of those results. So listen, I think you could look at it as a possible outcome, but it's certainly not something that I would use us guidance. And I think, as you know, we make discrete decisions from month-to-month, quarter-to-quarter, so there's a lot that can change between now and 2018, and we're just really focused on continuing to have a business where we can deliver consistently strong growth rates over a long period of time.

And then secondly, in terms of you guided for revenue continuing to come down in 15, and the question I want to ask is will it come down at the same pace, accelerated pace or less of a strong pace?

So just again on the $275 million to $325 million of adjusted EBITDA contribution for the 2 acquisitions combined, first of all, I would just remind people that on a stand-alone basis, we have said Orbitz was on track to around $135 million of adjusted EBITDA in 2015. It came in a little bit ahead of that, but I think that this as a decent base in Home Away a little bit better than $120 million in adjusted EBITDA from 2015. They will both have purchase accounting headwinds on them in 2016, both around $10 million each. So think about that as about $20 million combined. So take that as your base. And then the way that we get to, obviously, the higher number is synergies, and a lot of that is going to come from Orbitz and it's going to come in the back half of the year. In fact in the first part of the year, our going to be in a position not unlike where we were at what they've where, we were essentially carrying almost double costs we built up teams to support the integration of the Orbitz businesses onto the Brand Expedia platforms, for example, at the same time maintaining the Orbitz existing platforms and then it's really once we get the platform transition done, which is really happening in the first half of the year for the big consumer businesses, that's when you start to see synergy realization come in, and that's really starting again in the back half of the year. And we're hopeful that by the end of the year, we should be pretty close to a run rate number, but we're not going to be even close to that in the middle of the year, and we'll probably be subbed, and that will be a detriment in the first part of the year."

So there were a few headwinds for us in room night growth for the quarter. We had about 400 basis point harder call partially on the back of lapping some pretty strong growth in Travelocity with a commercial agreement implementation and then also what if, which we were lapping over in the quarter, we also had about 300 basis points of room night growth impact from the Paris attacks. We estimate that both of those are pretty significant headwinds for us. In terms of the Instant Book impact, I think if you thought about that in the 100 to 200 basis point range, that would be a good barometer. And then just in terms of expectations for 2016, we are expecting to see some deceleration in room night growth as we move through the year. We're also comping over acquisitions and consolidations again in 2016. Travelocity, for example, ramping up what if on variable marketing channels, the integration of Brand Expedia Asia, so just keep those in mind and then to the extent that TripAdvisor rules out, Instant Booking more broadly, which we currently do expect them to do and we continue to not participate in that, that could be an incremental headwind and think about of that is larger than 100 to 200 basis points, could be 200 to 300 basis points but again, insignificant from the perspective of profitability."

And then we will be launching other metrics such as the traffic to the site, the conversion rate of consumers coming look at listings, the renewal rate of our subscribers, so there are a host of other metrics that we're going to watch and meter in order to measure kind of what is a balanced approach which is we do think that we are under monetizing relative to our volume and making sure that as we move to call it market monetization rates, we are providing great experience for travelers who are coming and looking for a great place to stay at Home Away, and we are bringing great value to our supply as well. I will also remind you that the booking fee is something that has been widely accepted as far as Airbnb and TripAdvisor go. Airbnb has always had a booking fee. TripAdvisor introduced booking fees last year. Those transitions have gone very, very smoothly. Our pricing is going to be quite competitive, so this is something that has already been market tested, and we feel pretty good moving into this model based on the competition already being there."

So we don't anticipate any hiccups as it relates to Orbitz. You never know. And at least the, trends that are seeing early on are encouraging and things looked to be on track. Home Away as a very different animal, we is not an integration. The team is going to be largely independent, and the activity with Home Away has been to make sure, frankly that, that team is not distracted as being part of being Expedia. I think we'll free up a bunch of their time to focus from call it public company activity to value-added activity, building a great consumer experience, building a great subscriber experience. And because we're very, very familiar with this transactional model, our product and technology teams are already working with them to make sure that the road maps are what they should be and I think the second area where we can add value is making sure that as this volume comes on line are as these listings, online, we are not only pushing Home Away traffic to them but also Expedia and Hotels.com traffic to them, which I think is of significant value both for the Home Away subscriber base but also for the Expedia and Hotels.com consumer base as well."

I'd say Paris, in general, we saw immediately kind of an effect on broader European destinations. That effect looks like it's disappeared, but there certainly continues to be an effect in Paris getting better, but the trends in Paris are certainly poor compared to the trends that we have seen before Q4 of last year. So I think Paris is going to continue through the year. It was a horrific event, and I think it was the kind of event that stays in people's memories, so I think that there'll be some effect going into the balance of the year, and we're going to do our best to make up for that. We're going to do our best to work with our partners over there and really continue to promote Paris as a wonderful destination that it is. So hopefully, it won't last long, but my personal feeling is there'll be some effect going into the balance of the year. As far as the Trip and Instant Book and how we view that channel, we've been very consistent about how we view any variable channel, including Instant Booking, that we look at the economics of a channel based on, call it, the immediate transaction and then we look at the economics of the transaction based on the lifestyle value of the customer, both in terms of the customer repeat rate and the percentage of the time in which those customers repeat directly with us the second and third time around. Obviously, the latter is much, much more valuable. The initial, let's say, version of Instant Book was, I think, quite unsatisfactory as far as the branding, et cetera, and representation of where the customer was really transacting with. And the latest iterations that we've seen with Booking.com and with some of the supplier direct partners, for example, Marriott, look a lot better. They look much more clear. So I would say, at this point, Instant Book looks better to us than it did when Instant Book was initially launched, but we don't have any comment as to what the ultimate decision is going to be down the road."

These rollouts are live rollouts, and we don't want to come hard code a specific rollout cadence obviously want to roll it out as quickly as possible making sure that our customer experience and our subscriber experience is terrific. As far as the marketing approach for Home Away, we do plan a significant year-on-year increase in brand marketing and Home Away for 2016. That's included in the numbers of that Mark related to you. It's -- the marketing campaign has already started, and the early signs -- and we're about 5 markets and the early signs as far as visits to the Home Away sites look really good and were encouraged by the trends that we see. Once online booking really starts to expand, we will be able to throttle up variable marketing channels as we get kind of variable economics on the revenue side. One of the issues with the subscription listing product is that you don't earn money on every single transaction. You're earning money on a kind of annual subscription, so you can't necessarily bid for the incremental transaction. Once we have online booking expanded along with the traveler fee and volumes roll out there, we do think that we will be able to increase variable marketing channels, but we think that's something that's going to happen in the back half of the year as opposed to the front half of the year. And then on the question of the confidence in the $350 million EBITDA in 2018, we made those estimates based on a set of assumptions, early set of assumptions. And so far, in a couple of weeks that Home Away has been a part of the family, we are more impressed than we were when we made those assumptions. It's 2018, it's a long time from now, but I think what we wanted to communicate is that you kind of going to a company, you meet the people you take a look at the technology stack and the product road maps and either it's good news or bad news.

And also along with kind of bidding, you get the quality and content of the hotel, the -- how these hotels treat our customers, kind of the quality of service et cetera and user reviews, all mixing into a combination of the best hotel for the best customer and also economics that hoteliers want to bid at and, obviously, hopefully, economics that work out for us.

I think we have [Audio Gap] in the market. Obviously, we're very strong in leisure travel. Corporate travel we think is an enormous opportunity. It's a higher yield customers sat that our suppliers favor the demand patterns are quite complementary with leisure demand patterns and we want to get bigger. We want to scale and we see kind of growth ahead for Egencia that is a combination of organic as well as inorganic growth, and we think that's going to continue for some time going forward. And then we'll also look for kind of innovative new companies out there. Trivago, obviously, was a terrific one and it's a very

valuable part of the family. We made some investments in Alice, for example, on the supply technology front. So we will be opportunistic wings as far as transport goes. We'll continue to be opportunistic. We'll continue to kind of shoot bullets, so to speak, and see what opportunity is out there in the world. That said, the business throws off a lot of cash flow. And historically, I'd say, before the year, there is a fair amount of capital allocation going to buybacks. And to the extent that we don't see anything external and to the extent of that we like our own stock and typically, we have liked our own stock, we will look to allocate some capital internally as well. So it's kind of the world is our oyster, and we're throwing off a lot of cash, and we will try our best not to waste it. As far as the noise and the chatter with the change et cetera, listen, we continued to be strong partners with the hotels, in general. Our volumes with independents and chains have grown significantly, and our strategy with our chain partners is no different than our overall strategy, which is to lower our base commissions, so that there is a very little friction in working with us. And then, really, any hotel whether they're a chain or independent can compete in our marketplace for share. And this is a market -- it's a big marketplace the marketplace is only growing. And if you got competitive pricing and you've got great content and you treat our customers really well and you provide excellent availability along with margins, you will do well in the marketplace. So I think that the ultimate, call it, performance of the chains and the relationship with the chains and the volume that we do chains is really going to be based on kind of chain bidding in our marketplace against independents. And in general, we see our chain volumes for a number of years, and we expect to see them healthy on a go-forward basis."

And at this point, we are seeing kind of the growth of demand into the marketplace and the growth and supply be about right, so I would expect the same in 2016 and as we are adding more supply and as the new inventory contributes revenue into our marketplace we then go on a higher more market managers that we had in place for about 18 months, and I see no reason to change it. It certainly looks like it's working. As far as the kind of supply that we are adding, as we are adding more supply, we are tending to secondary and tertiary markets and the average number of rooms per hotel is going down. So when we look at contribution from new hotel adds, it's something we disclose it something we certainly look at internally the contribution for hotel add is going down, and it's going down because of the kind of supply that we're adding, and it's kind of working exactly to form so it's exactly what we would expect to see. As far as impacts from countries and the refugee crisis et cetera, we haven't seen significant impact other than travel to, I would say, broad areas that are affected by the refugee crisis or directly affected. It's obviously down. But we haven't seen kind of second-order stuff. So travel into Europe and general continues to be pretty healthy, and we're not seeing any significant step changes in demand patterns there."

As far as the corporate travel and the trends that we're seeing, listen, we've got some caution the teams are cautious about client sales in general because of the macroeconomic environment, the most clear trend that we can point to relating to oil prices is in terms of our business in the Nordics. As you know, we acquired VIA and integrated into a Egencia, and we do see volumes in the Nordic regions, in general, weak, and that is very much related to oil prices being down significantly on a year-on-year basis. In general, transactions, corporate transactions look good. We're not seeing, call it, very significant spend cuts like one way or the other like we saw couple of years back. We are seeing some trading down so the revenue for transactions or gross booking for a corporate transaction is down a bit, and we think that's just cautious practice from some corporations out there trading down, call it, from premium class to economy class or taking a train instead of taking a plane. But those are, I would say, on the edges. We're not seeing some big theme one way or the other as far as corporate travel changing significantly one way or the other. As far as the car rental and the impact of Uber, our car rental businesses we think very early in its development the volume in car is up very significantly on a year-on-year basis, over 30% on a year-on-year basis, and most of that business in the U.S. And we think that it's on potential as far as our car rental business in Europe goes. So I just think that we're on a growth path at this point that is not going to be affected by Uber. We're not going to feel kind of, call it, market numbers one way or the other just because the growth rates that we have are so high. If I were to generalize them, in Q4, other trends that we saw in the car business, on the hardware side, we saw a higher concentration of call it agency bookings versus bookings, we tend to make more money on Opie bookings, so that is 1 trend that we saw but otherwise nothing to say Uber was having a material effect on the business to speak."

Also add that Expedia has pretty significant loyalty program and I believe between Hotels.com Expedia and Orbitz, we are running pretty close to 40 million loyalty members on a global basis. And I would say, our appetite here is unlimited. And the way to explain to that is that the variable economics began these loyalty programs are all working. In other words, we look at the points cost, we look at the ultimate redemption value of those points a percentage of people who are using points, our customers who are using the points and when to use them. And then we look at the behavior of consumers and like-for-like consumers who are in the program versus the behavior of consumers who are not in the program and how that behavior changes in terms of repeat characteristics and in terms of channel mix. When you look at those factors and compare it to the point costs, these loyalty programs work. So as long as the factors are not changing, as long as these repeat characteristics aren't changing, the channel mix isn't changing and as long as the ultimate redemption value isn't changing, then we look to extend these loyalty programs as aggressively as we can on a global basis. There are some countries where the programs worked really, really well. For example, we've been pleasantly surprised and Asia Pacific regions where loyalty is really taking off and, for example, on our welcome rewards basis, it's got the highest penetration of welcome rewards or hotel rewards. It's got the highest hotel rewards bookings as a percentage of overall customer base, so we see some some customer base who love these programs in Asia Pacific regions. But in general, the variable economics look good, and we will continue aggressively on these programs a go forward basis. The other reminder that I will put forth is that the points cost that we take our upfront the benefits from these loyalty programs are trailing benefits, so to speak, because we get the repeat benefits you get the channel benefits down the line so as where growing these number basis typically were paying an upfront cost and we're building up a pretty substantial asset. We think this is a great competitive that we're building around our brands, and we intend to keep investing behind that level."

Listen, we are not seeing -- we don't see significant effective Airbnb on our business. I would relate the answer I would give a car. Our growth rates are substantially different from industry growth rates just because we don't see it that doesn't mean that that is not happening. We have said that Airbnb, in general, and Home Away are adding inventory in the marketplace, lodging inventory in the marketplace and is becoming more and more clear that a certain set of customers who sometimes will stay at hotels, sometimes will stay in an Airbnb or a Home Away home. So anytime you increased supply, you will put pressure on pricing. So we will -- we anticipate pressure on pricing. We do it sometimes during periods in which there's Super Bowl, let's say, or events happening in cities that use to sel lout. We have observed that it sometimes gets harder for hotels to yield up during those events and sometimes, whereas in the past, we would not have inventory for those events, we tend to have inventory for those events. So in some way, you could consider a positive as it relates to our marketplace. And then, finally, any time you have more supply, you put pressure on pricing, you as an intermediary, meaning us, want to have access to that supply. And whereas before, Home Away was part of the family, we didn't have significant access and that supply, and our goal is to build out that access to supply on our organic basis, now that Home Away's part of the family, we have access to that supply, and we will continue to build access to that supply on an organic basis. We think now that Home Away is part of the family the Airbnb effect is going to be a positive factor for us, but it's very early in kind of this evolution. And at this point, other than those circumstances when markets are kind of sold out because of big events, we're not seeing it affect our specific trends."

I'm pleased to be joined on the call today by Dara Khosrowshahi, Expedia's CEO and President; and Mark Okerstrom, our CFO and EVP, Operations.
The following discussion, including responses to your questions, reflects management's views as of today, February 10, 2016, only. We do not undertake any obligation to update or revise this information.
As always, some of the statements made on today's call are forward-looking, typically preceded by words such as we expect, we believe, we anticipate or similar statements. Please refer to today's press release and the company's filings with the SEC for information about factors, which could cause our actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements.
You'll find reconciliations of our non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures discussed today in our earnings release, which is posted on the company's IR website at ir.expediainc.com. I encourage you to periodically visit our Investor Relations site for important content, including today's earnings release and an updated investor deck.
As a reminder, we sold our 62.4% ownership stake in eLong on May 22, 2015, which was previously a consolidated entity of Expedia, Inc. For GAAP accounting purposes, the results of eLong are included in our results through the date of the sale. In order to allow investors to compare our current results on a like-for-like basis with our historical results, our commentary in the earnings release and on this call is principally focused on our results, excluding eLong, which should be considered in addition to the GAAP results on a fully consolidated basis.
Finally, unless otherwise stated, all references to cost of revenue, selling and marketing expense, general and administrative expense, and technology and content expense, also exclude stock-based compensation and depreciation expense. And all comparisons on this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2014.
And with that, let me turn the call over to Dara."

I wanted to start right upfront thanking our employees all over the world for another strong year for Expedia, Inc. Mark, Alan and I get to tell you about it and take public credit for the success of our company, but it's an amalgamation of everyone's dedication and good work that adds up to the figures that we'll review today. 
And the figures tell a consistently strong story. Gross bookings for 2015, up 24% to $59.7 billion, and total revenue, up 19% to $6.6 billion. Our customers bought 35% more airline tickets, 36% more room nights, totaling more than $200 million for the year and 37% more car days in 2015 versus 2014. We delivered nearly $1.2 billion of adjusted EBITDA for the year, impressive in its own right, but especially so when you consider the huge headwinds from foreign currency, the significant investments we're making in resetting our contracted margin structure with our hotel partners, and the deal-related costs that we incurred in connection with our busy year of M&A activity.
Speaking of M&A, 2015 was an unprecedented year for Expedia as we completed over $6 billion of strategic acquisitions, which included Travelocity, a majority stake in our AirAsia joint venture, a significant minority investment in Decolar, Orbitz Worldwide and most recently, our largest acquisition ever in HomeAway. These transactions have consolidated and scaled our U.S. operations, extended our international reach and have opened up a new leg of growth on the alternative accommodations sector. We also divested our stake in eLong for a nice profit and entered into a long-term alliance with Ctrip. 
Briefly on Orbitz, the integration is progressing well with nearly all of the direct type-in traffic of Orbitz.com and Cheap Tickets already on the Brand Expedia platform. It's early but results so far look promising. The migration work will continue through the first half of 2016, followed by optimizing the sites and tuning our variable marketing channels post migration. We're also actively working on other parts of the Orbitz business, including ebookers, Hotel Club, Orbitz Partner Network and Orbitz for Business. Our goal is to migrate the vast majority of our Orbitz for Business clients onto the Egencia platform before year-end. We're also on active dialogue with our OPN private-label partners on expanding our relationship with them, and we see these efforts carrying through 2016 and into 2017 for certain partners.
Moving forward, we're planning to invest aggressively in our private-label and partnership capabilities and consider this area highly strategic for our company. I'll also add that we're very pleased with the talent level and execution capability of our Orbitz teams all over the world. The people and the brands we've added to our family will play an important role in our future success.
It's very early but we're encouraged with HomeAway's Q4 performance coming in a bit ahead of our expectations and have been consistently impressed with the level of talent there. They operated largely as a stand-alone business and will serve as an end-to-end vacation rental and home-sharing platform for the Expedia, Inc. family. That said, we plan to be highly involved with the HomeAway team, helping them expand aggressively and move from their traditional listings model to a fully online transactional model. The team is beginning to introduce a service fee to travelers, and we expect that it will be fully launched on its U.S. vacation rental listings in the coming months, slightly ahead of schedule. 
Around the same time, we're rolling out lower supplier commissions for paper booking listing as well as a book with confidence guarantee, which is designed to encourage travelers to book on HomeAway and give them increased peace of mind when they do. We started an integrated marketing campaign in some of our major markets and intend to reinvest incremental upside from travel fees back into the business, particularly in product, technology and marketing. We remain confident in our estimate of $350 million in adjusted EBITDA for HomeAway in 2018.
We continue to see strong growth for trivago in Q4 and, in fact, for all of 2015. We've had some investor questions in regards to trivago's core growth and profitability, and we'd like to share some numbers for European markets versus the rest of the world. To take out the noise created by foreign exchange fluctuations, the numbers here are stated in euro. trivago delivered 2015 stand-alone revenue of roughly EUR 490 million, up nearly 60% year-over-year, with adjusted EBITDA of a few million euro. Now within these numbers, their most mature European markets collectively had revenue of over EUR 250 million, up 20% year-over-year, and with a contribution margin after direct marketing cost of about 25%. trivago's rest of the world markets had revenue of EUR 235 million, up nearly 130% and a contribution margin just above breakeven. Note also that overhead cost for trivago had been running in the neighborhood of 10% of revenue. While we expect trivago to achieve healthy top and bottom line growth in 2016, we'll continue to reinvest profits from core markets to further scale in expansion markets on a worldwide basis. The trivago team is first rate, and we believe that the global growth runway for this brand continues to be substantial.
Lastly, underpinning our active M&A strategy investment in high-growth businesses is a core organic business that has never been stronger. Brand Expedia, Hotels.com, our Expedia Affiliate Network business all had terrific years, delivering healthy room night and adjusted EBITDA growth. Egencia, our corporate travel business, had another excellent year, signing up over $1.1 billion of new client business and delivering 12% adjusted EBITDA growth. Supporting all of our brands, our lodging supply team is also firing on all cylinders, signing up nearly 60,000 new directly contracted hotel properties in 2015, up over 30% year-on-year.
Since I opened my remarks with our accomplishments as a company, I'll close with some thoughts about key challenges. Competition for consumer attention is as strong as ever as our competitors, and in some cases, our partners, invest and innovate aggressively. We're also jumping into the alternative accommodations space where there's already a sizable competitor and where we have a significant business model transition to undertake at HomeAway. And as I described, we have heavy integration work with Orbitz. 
These matters, along with a volatile global macroeconomic climate, together create a very dynamic and challenging environment, to say the least. That said, our businesses and our teams are no strangers to these kinds of challenges. We're focused. We're hungry. We have an established execution and capital allocation record, and we take these challenges head-on and with confidence.
With that, I'll hand it to Mark."

As with the case last quarter, in order to help with comparability, our comments today are focused on Expedia results, excluding eLong, since we sold our 62% in eLong last May. Financial results for that business are included in our GAAP results on a consolidated basis through the date of the sale. 
We are quite pleased with our financial performance in the fourth quarter and for the full year 2015. Excluding an estimated headwind of $10 million to $15 million from the impact of the terrorist attacks in Paris and the negative impact of HomeAway in the quarter not contemplated in our prior guidance, our full year 2015 adjusted EBITDA growth exceeded the guidance we gave on our Q3 call. In the fourth quarter, top line growth was driven by solid unit growth across products, geographies and major brands. Of course, we are getting a boost as we consolidate Orbitz. But despite the law of large numbers, our organic growth rates continue to be very healthy and comparable to the rates of growth we have seen for the last couple of years. 
In hotel, revenue grew 24% on room night growth of 39%. The inorganic contributions to hotel revenue and room night growth were 14 and 15 percentage points respectively. We estimate the negative impact from Paris was around 300 basis points for both measures. Revenue per room night was down 11% in Q4 on a 5% decline in average daily rates. Note that the gap between revenue per room night and ADRs narrowed this quarter compared to Q3, principally on reduced foreign exchange impacts. We do expect to see continued year-over-year pressure on revenue per room night in 2016, as we trade some of our unit economics to drive volume and global scale. 
Air revenue was up 61% on ticket growth of 70%, partially offset by a decline in revenue per ticket of 5%. Brand Expedia continued to grow ticket volume at healthy organic rate, along with the sizable contributions from recently acquired companies. Excluding acquisitions, air revenue grew 6% on ticket growth of 22%. 
Key to our strategy is to grow additional travel products alongside air tickets and room nights. We were pleased to see some good examples of this in Q4, including 66% transaction growth for our local activities business and 43% revenue growth for our insurance product. We also continue to see solid growth in our advertising and media business, with trivago growing stand-alone revenue, 27% or approximately 43% currency-neutral, fairly consistent with the year-over-year growth we saw in Q3. Media Solutions also grew revenue nicely with the boost from the addition of Orbitz. 
HomeAway finished 2015 strongly and a bit ahead of their plans as measured on a stand-alone basis. For Expedia, Inc., HomeAway contributed revenue this quarter of approximately $20 million, which has been classified as other revenue in our product classification. We are breaking out HomeAway as a separate segment, so you will be able to see their stand-alone performance on an ongoing basis. Because HomeAway is in the process of moving to an online booking model and a fair bit of the bookings still occur outside of the platform, we are not planning to report gross bookings or unit growth for that business at this time. 
Although the seasonality of our business can cause the shape of our P&L to vary quarter-to-quarter, we continue to drive to results that use leverage achieved in key expense categories to fund aggressive selling and marketing investments around the world. In Q4, excluding the impacts from Orbitz and HomeAway, the P&L we delivered was largely consistent with this approach. Selling and marketing grew a bit faster than revenue, while cost of revenue and G&A grew slower, providing leverage. Our technology and content expenses did grow faster than revenue and nearly 60 percentage points faster than Q3 on the combination of higher people cost, along with lower capitalization rates. We continue to scale up our core infrastructure and Brand Expedia technology teams to support organic growth and to drive the integration of our new OTA brands. And as such, we are expecting elevated technology and content expense growth, at least for the first half of 2016. 
Importantly, our results for Q4 included the first full quarter of Orbitz and the layering in of the HomeAway stand-alone financials for the 17 days of the quarter that we own the business. The operations of Orbitz for a full quarter, along with deal-related and integration costs, resulted in approximate breakeven adjusted EBITDA contribution for that business in Q4, which included a purchase accounting revenue headwind of approximately $27 million. Overall, the Orbitz results were a bit better than we had expected on a combination of lower integration costs and better overall performance. 
HomeAway had a negative impact on adjusted EBITDA of $14 million in Q4 not contemplated in the guidance we gave on our Q3 call. This included the results of the business, the negative impact of deal-related costs and a purchase accounting revenue headwind of approximately $6 million. 
Briefly, as we enter a new year, I'd like to remind folks of a few key aspects of how we manage the business. We are committed to striking a balance between delivering healthy profit growth in the near and midterm, while making key investments in our business that will allow us to grow sustainably over many years to come. From a practical perspective, this means that when we see certain upside and/or outperformance from month-to-month or quarter-to-quarter, including from acquisitions, we have a bias to reinvest at least a portion of that upside back into the business. As part of this approach, we do not guide to quarterly results, and investors should not expect to see the full amount of organic overperformance or M&A-related windfalls drop immediately to the bottom line. This is an important tenet for how we are running our business, and we want investors to fully understand this approach.
Turning to our financial expectations for 2016. On a consolidated basis, including all of the businesses we own today and excluding eLong, we are expecting full year adjusted EBITDA to grow in the range of 35% to 45% year-over-year. The contribution to this result from a full year of Orbitz and HomeAway combined is expected to be in the range of $275 million to $325 million. In terms of the shape of the year, we are expecting particular pressure on Q1 adjusted EBITDA. Due to the seasonal nature of our business, back-end loading of adjusted EBITDA dollar growth is not unusual, though we do expect the impact will be specially acute in 2016. This is due primarily to the integration of Orbitz and the timing of synergy realization, which will ramp in the back half of the year, along with the transition at HomeAway. 
As a further reminder, note that we lapped our acquisition of Wotif in the fourth quarter of 2015 and will lap both the Travelocity acquisition and the consolidation of the AirAsia Expedia joint venture in Q1, which will create tougher comps. Further, the rollout of TripAdvisor's Instant Book product will also likely continue to be a small headwind on room night growth in 2016, with an insignificant impact on profitability. 
From an expense standpoint, including Orbitz and HomeAway, while we will see leverage and cost of revenue and general and administrative expenses in 2016, we expect technology and content expenses to grow faster than revenue, primarily driven by integration efforts and the inorganic impacts of our recent acquisitions. Regarding taxes, as you might imagine, there's lots of moving parts, especially related to newly acquired companies and our international versus domestic mix. However, we currently expect effective tax rates in the mid-20% range.
Finally, some directional color on our CapEx trends. In 2015, we saw significant capital growth with about half of the dollar growth attributable to the purchase of our future headquarters. Spending for real estate, in general, also was elevated as we continued to grow our market management team aggressively and built out new office space around the world. In addition, we invested heavily in servers and other hardware in anticipation of future organic growth and upcoming integrations. To a lesser extent, an increase in capitalized software development cost also contributed to year-over-year CapEx growth. For 2016, we expect a much more moderate pace of CapEx growth, most of which will be driven by the inorganic impact of recent acquisitions.
With that, let's move to Q&A. Operator, will you please remind participants how to queue up for questions?"

Is that something -- a target or how you think about that number?

As far as the macro environment goes, listen, we listen to the same news that you do. And certainly, the news suggests that the macro environment is pretty uncertain, and the stock market downright scary. That said, when we look at the micro environment and how it affects our business, one important factor in our business is the air business. And air ticket prices are down pretty significantly year-on-year. It's obviously some of the savings of oil prices that are being passed on by the airlines to consumers, and that's an unambiguous positive for us. The more -- the lower air ticket prices go, the more the leisure traveler tends to fly. And the more the leisure traveler tends to fly, as you know, we have a bit of what we think is a strategic investment, a strategic advantage on the air side. And the more leisure travelers we have flying, the more opportunity we have to sell hotels and insurance and cars and everything else to them. So to some extent, weakness in oil on the air side is a pretty big positive for us. On the hotel side, while we have seen ADRs weaken a bit between, call it, the beginning of the year and Q4, when we look at Q4 trends into January, we don't see anything of note one way or the other. There are some spot issues, obviously. Paris is weak, which is perfectly explainable. New York ADRs continue to be down year-on-year over -- although they've improved over Q4, in that European travelers really traveling into the U.S. and the effect of foreign exchange. In Asia, we see certain markets, like Hong Kong and Macau, down as far as ADRs go. But again, no significant shifts when we look at Q4 trends into January that are of note. So it's something that we'll watch. And to the extent that we see anything, we'll certainly share with our investors. But we're not seeing any material movement one way or the other right now."

It did not account any upsides or any significant investments. It's a possible outcome, so I wouldn't put a lot of weight on that. That was then combined essentially with the HomeAway projections. And we did not, at that time, contribute to the combination of those results. So listen, I think you could look at it as a possible outcome, but it's certainly not something that I would use as guidance. And I think, as you know, we make discrete decisions from month-to-month, quarter-to-quarter, so there's a lot that can change between now and 2018, and we're just really focused on continuing to have a business where we can deliver consistently strong growth rates over a long period of time.

So it does sound like all-in, business conditions are getting stronger for Expedia, but I just want to make sure I'm interpreting the numbers and stating that right. And then secondly, in terms of the -- you guided for revenue per room night continuing to come down in '15. And the question I'd want to ask is, will it come down at the same pace, accelerated pace or less of a strong pace? In other words what we saw in the quarter was that 11% year-over-year decline was a little less than we'd seen in the last couple of quarters. Are we starting to see a fade down in that pressure you're seeing on revenue per room night?"

I think what you'll see in 2016 is you're going to continue to see that range of movement towards the back half. I think there is a possibility, as we start to comp over some of the margin reductions we did this year, that start to ease, and then I think you'll start to see, I would expect, some more easing in that as we move through 2017.

So just again on the $275 million to $325 million of adjusted EBITDA contribution for the 2 acquisitions combined, first of all, I would just remind people that on a stand-alone basis, we had said Orbitz was on track to around $135 million of adjusted EBITDA in 2015. It came in a little bit ahead of that, but I think that this is, as a decent base on HomeAway, a little bit better than $120 million in adjusted EBITDA from 2015. They will both have purchase accounting headwinds on them in 2016, both around $10 million each. So think about that as about $20 million combined. So take that as your base. And then the way that we get to -- obviously, the higher number is synergies. And a lot of that is going to come from Orbitz, and it's going to come in the back half of the year. In fact, in the first part of the year, we're going to be in a position, not unlike where we were at Wotif, where we were essentially carrying almost double cost. We built up teams to support the integration of the Orbitz businesses onto the Brand Expedia platforms, for example, at the same time as maintaining the Orbitz existing platforms. And then it's really -- once we get the platform transition done, which is really happening in the first half of the year for the big consumer businesses, that's when you start to see synergy realization come in. And that's really starting, again, in the back half of the year, and we're hopeful that by the end of the year, we should be pretty close to a run rate number. But we're not going to be even close to that in the middle of the year, and we will probably be sub that. It'll be a detriment in the first part of the year."

And that, along with the book with confidence guarantee for travelers, we think is going to be a win for travelers and is also going to be a win for our supply base as well. And that's really the focus of the business. We will try to, obviously, drive the online bookings volume. But that is really much more of a long-term goal for us as a company. And I think 2016 is going to be about kind of setting the base, making sure the technology infrastructure is right and making sure that we're taking any and all kinks out of the online booking process to make it incredibly easy for travelers and incredibly easy for our subscribers as well. We don't have a specific target for percentage of bookings going over the transom, so to speak, for 2016."

Could you maybe comment on what sort of headwind that was to room night growth in the quarter? And then just a follow-up on HomeAway and moving ahead with instituting this consumer booking fee. I guess, when HomeAway was independent, we could see how that extra margin would really help them. So the fee would be really helpful in terms of competing and investing against Airbnb. But now that it's part of a bigger Expedia, how do you guys sort of weight the benefit of that booking fee in terms of increased monetization versus the possibility that it negatively impacts kind of the consumer experience?"

So there were a few headwinds for us on room night growth in the quarter. We had about a 400 basis point harder comp, partially on the back of lapping over some pretty strong growth in Travelocity with the commercial agreement implementation, and then also, Wotif, which we were lapping over in the quarter. We also had about 300 basis points of room night growth impact from the Paris attacks we estimate. So both of those were pretty significant headwinds for us. In terms of the Instant Book impact, I think if you thought about that in the 100 to 200 basis point range, that would be a good barometer. And then just in terms of expectations for 2016, we are expecting to see some deceleration in room night growth as we move through the year. We're also comping over acquisitions and consolidations again in 2016: Travelocity, for example; ramping up Wotif on variable marketing channels; the integration of Brand Expedia Asia. So just keep those in mind. And then, to the extent that TripAdvisor rolls out Instant Booking more broadly, which we currently do expect them to do, and we continue to not participate in that, that could be an incremental headwind. And think about that as larger than 100 to 200 basis points. Could be 200 to 300 basis points but again, insignificant from the perspective of profitability."

And then we will be watching other metrics, such as the traffic to the site, the conversion rate of consumers coming and -- who look at listings, the renewal rate of our subscribers. So there are a host of other metrics that we are going to watch and meter in order to measure kind of what is a balanced approach, which is we do think that we are under-monetizing relative to our volume and making sure that, as we move to, call it, market monetization rates, we are providing a great experience for travelers who are coming and looking for a great place to stay on HomeAway. And we are bringing great value to our supply as well. I will also remind you that the booking fee is something that has been widely accepted as far as Airbnb and TripAdvisor go. Airbnb's always had a booking fee. TripAdvisor introduced booking fees last year. Those transitions have gone very, very smoothly. Our pricing is going to be quite competitive. So this is something that has already been market tested, and we feel pretty good moving into this model, based on the competition already being there."

They have an analytics team that is just excellent. So a number of the folks have been there with Orbitz, they understand these optimizations. This is something that they've done before. We're just hoping that as we move them over to our supply base and as we move our tech stack, they're just going to have a machine that kind of is much smoother and better than the machine that they had to work with in the past. So we don't anticipate any hiccups as it relates to Orbitz. You never know. And at least the trends that we're seeing early on are encouraging and things look to be on track. HomeAway as a very different animal. HomeAway is not an integration. That team is going to be largely independent, and the activity with HomeAway has been to make sure, frankly, that, that team is not distracted as being part of being Expedia. I think we're freeing up a bunch of their time to focus from, call it, public company activity to value-added activity, building a great consumer experience, building a great subscriber experience. And because we are very, very familiar with this transactional model, our product and technology teams are already working with them to make sure that the road maps are what they should be. And I think the second area where we can add value is making sure that as this volume comes online or as these listings come online, we're not only pushing HomeAway traffic to them but also Expedia and Hotels.com traffic to them, which, I think, is of significant value both for the HomeAway subscriber base but also for the Expedia and Hotels.com consumer base as well."

Orbitz for Business is another one. We're pretty excited about the speed at which we're going to be able to move that -- those clients over to the Egencia platform. But again, it is going to take a little bit longer and both of these transitions are new and that we haven't done a lot of these before unlike the core consumer business. So in terms of synergy realization, I would just keep in mind that until those businesses are migrated off, you don't get to see the full platform of retirement benefits that you would if it was only Orbitz Cheap Tickets and ebookers that we are transitioning over."

Historically, these kinds of attacks have resolved fairly quickly. I'd say Paris, in general, we saw immediately kind of an effect on broader European destinations, that effect looks like it's disappeared. But there certainly is -- continues to be an effect in Paris, it's getting better. But the trends in Paris are certainly poor compared to the trends that we have seen before Q4 of last year. So I think -- listen, Paris is going to continue through the year. It was a horrific event, and I think it was the kind of event that stays in people's memories, so I think that there'll be some effect going into the balance of the year, and we're going to do our best to make up for that. We're going to do our best to work with our partners over there and really continue to promote Paris as a wonderful destination that it is. So hopefully, it won't last long, but my personal feeling is that there'll be some effect going into the balance of the year. As far as the Trip and Instant Book and how we view that channel, we've been very consistent about how we view any variable channel, including Instant Booking, that -- we look at the economics of a channel based on, call it, the immediate transaction and then we look at the economics of the transaction based on the lifetime value of the customer, both in terms of the customer repeat rate and the percentage of the time in which those customers repeat directly with us the second and third time around. Obviously, the latter is much, much more valuable. The initial, let's say, version of Instant Book was, I think, quite unsatisfactory as far as the branding, et cetera, and representation of where the customer was really transacting with. And the latest iterations that we've seen with Booking.com and with some of the supplier direct partners, for example, Marriott, look a lot better. They look much more clear. So I would say, at this point, Instant Book looks better to us than it did when Instant Book was initially launched, but we don't have any comment as to what the ultimate decision is going to be down the road."

We will then -- once we're done with the U.S. or once we're well underway with the U.S, we'll look at the rest of the world. But listen, these rollouts are live rollouts, and we don't want to kind of hard code a specific rollout cadence. Obviously, we want to roll it out as quickly as possible, making sure that our customer experience and our subscriber experience is terrific. As far as the marketing approach for HomeAway, we do plan a significant year-on-year increase in brand marketing in HomeAway for 2016. That's included in the numbers that Mark related to you. It's -- the marketing campaign has already started, and the early signs -- and we're about five markets and the early signs, as far as visits to the HomeAway sites, look really good and were encouraged by the trends that we see. Once online booking really starts to expand, we will be able to throttle up variable marketing channels as we get kind of variable economics on the revenue side. One of the issues with the subscription listing product is that you don't earn money on every single transaction. You're earning money on a kind of annual subscription, so you can't necessarily bid for the incremental transaction. Once we have online booking expanded along with the traveler fee and volumes roll out there, we do think that we will be able to increase variable marketing channels, but we think that's something that's going to happen in the back half of the year as opposed to the front half of the year. And then, listen, on the question of the confidence in the $350 million EBITDA in 2018, we made those estimates based on a set of assumptions, early set of assumptions. And so far, in the couple of weeks that HomeAway has been a part of the family, we are more impressed than we were when we made those assumptions. It's 2018, it's a long time from now, but I think what we wanted to communicate is that you -- kind of going to a company, you meet the people, you take a look at the technology stack and the product road maps and either it's good news or bad news. And at this point, with HomeAway, it's good news for us."

The partners who have engaged with accelerator product are pretty darn happy, which is great. You want kind of clients who like a product and so we see accelerators starting to contribute to our overall numbers. In general, accelerator is a move in the direction of having much more of a marketplace model for our margins so that hoteliers can bid up when they need volume, they can go to base bid when they don't need volume. And also, along with kind of bidding, you get the quality of content of the hotel, the -- how these hotels treat our customers, kind of the quality of service, et cetera, and user reviews, all mixing into a combination of the best hotel for the best customer and also economics that hoteliers want to bid at and obviously, hopefully, economics that work out for us. So we are very early on this journey. The signs that we're seeing with accelerator so far are encouraging. We are not making aggressive assumptions in our 2016 plans for accelerator.

market. Obviously, we're very strong in leisure travel. Corporate travel, we think, is an enormous opportunity. It's a higher yield customer set that our suppliers favor. The demand patterns are quite complementary of leisure demand patterns and we want to get bigger. We want to scale. And we see kind of growth ahead for Egencia that is a combination of organic as well as inorganic growth, and we think that's going to continue for some time going forward. And then we'll also look for kind of innovative new companies out there. trivago, obviously, was a terrific one and it's a very, very valuable part of the family. We made some investments in ALICE, for example, on the supply technology front. So we will be opportunistic wings as far as transport goes. We'll continue to be opportunistic. We'll continue to kind of shoot bullets, so to speak, and see what opportunity is out there in the world. That said, the business throws off a lot of cash flow. And historically, I'd say, before this year, there was a fair amount of capital allocation going to buybacks. And -- to the extent that we don't see anything external and to the extent of that we like our own stock and typically, we have liked our own stock, we will look to allocate some capital internally as well. So it's kind of the world is our oyster, and we're throwing off a lot of cash, and we will try our best not to waste it. As far as the noise and the chatter with the chains, et cetera, listen, we continue to be strong partners with the hotels, in general. Our volumes with independents and chains have grown significantly, and our strategy with our chain partners is no different than our overall strategy, which is to lower base commissions, so that there is a very little friction in working with us. And then really, any hotel, whether they're a chain or an independent, can compete in our marketplace for share. And this is a market -- it's a big marketplace. The marketplace is only growing. And if you've got competitive pricing and you've got great content and you treat our customers really well and you provide excellent availability along with margins, you will do well in the marketplace. So I think that the ultimate, call it, performance of the chains and the relationship with the chains and the volume that we do with chains is really going to be based on kind of chain bidding in our marketplace against independents. And in general, we see our chain volumes, they've been healthy for a number of years, and we expect to see them healthy on a go forward basis."

Are these larger properties, smaller properties, and is the room count per property similar to what's already on the platform? And secondarily, I almost hate asking this question, but directionally, are you seeing any impact from steps on countries, maybe taking Europe to tighten their borders due to the refugee crisis?"

Higher penetration means that we're sending plenty of demand into a specific market, which means that we can't acquire more hotels. And at this point, we are seeing kind of the growth of demand into the marketplace and the growth of supply be about right. So I would expect the same in 2016 and as we are adding more supply and as the new inventory contributes revenue into our marketplace, we then go on and hire more market managers. It's a formula that we've had in place for about 18 months, and I see no reason to change it. It certainly looks like it's working. As far as the kind of supply that we are adding, as we are adding more supply, we are tending to add supply in secondary and tertiary markets. And the average number of rooms per hotel is going down. So when we look at contribution from new hotel adds, it's not something we disclose but it's something that we certainly look at internally. The contribution per hotel add is going down, and it's going down because of the kind of supply that we're adding, and it's kind of working exactly to formula, so it's exactly what we would expect to see. As far as the impacts from countries and the refugee crisis, et cetera, we haven't seen significant impact other than travel to, I would say, broad areas that are affected by the refugee crisis or directly affected. It's obviously down. But we haven't seen kind of second-order stuff. So travel into Europe, in general, is -- continues to be pretty healthy, and we're not seeing any significant step changes in demand patterns there."

As far as the corporate travel and the trends that we're seeing, listen, we're -- we got some caution. I would say that teams are cautious about client sales in general because of the macroeconomic environment. The most clear trend that we can point to relating to oil prices is in terms of our business in the Nordics. As you know, we acquired VIA and integrated into a Egencia, and we do see volumes in the Nordic regions, in general, weak, and that is very much related to oil prices being down significantly on a year-on-year basis. In general, transactions -- corporate transactions look good. We're not seeing, call it, very significant spend cuts one way or the other like we saw a couple of years back. We are seeing some trading down so the revenue per transactions or gross booking per corporate transaction is down a bit, and we think that's just cautious practice from some corporations out there trading down, call it, from premium class to economy class or taking a train instead of taking a plane. But those are, I would say, on the edges. We're not seeing some big theme one way or the other as far as corporate travel changing significantly one way or the other. As far as the car rental and the impact of Uber, our car rental business is we think very early in its development. The volume in car days is up very significantly on a year-on-year basis, over 30% on a year-on-year basis, and most of that business is in the U.S. And we think we have a ton of potential as far as our car rental business in Europe goes. So I just think that we're on a growth path at this point that is not going to be affected by Uber. We're not going to feel kind of, call it, market numbers one way or the other just because the growth rates that we have are so high. If I were to generalize then, in Q4, other trends that we saw in the car business, on the Hotwire side, we saw a higher concentration of, call it, agency bookings versus opaque bookings. We tend to make more money on opaque bookings. So that was one trend that we saw, but otherwise nothing to say, ""Hey, this is Uber who's having a material effect on the business."" to speak of. Mark, you want to talk to the other question?"

I'd also add that Expedia has pretty significant loyalty program and I think between Hotels.com, Expedia and Orbitz, we are running pretty close to 40 million loyalty members on a global basis. And I would say our appetite here is unlimited. And the way to explain to that is that the variable economics behind these loyalty programs are all working. In other words, we look at the points cost, we look at the ultimate redemption value of those points, the percentage of people who are using points, our customers who are using the points, and when to use them. And then we look at the behavior of consumers and like-for-like consumers who are in the program versus the behavior of consumers who are not in the program and how that behavior changes in terms of repeat characteristics and in terms of channel mix. When we look at those factors and compare it to the point cost, these loyalty programs work. So as long as the factors are not changing, as long as these repeat characteristics aren't changing, as long as the channel mix isn't changing, and as long as the ultimate redemption value isn't changing, then we look to extend these loyalty programs as aggressively as we can on a global basis. There are some countries where the programs work really, really well. For example, we've been pleasantly surprised in the Asia Pacific regions where loyalty has really taken off and for example, on our welcome rewards basis, it's got the highest penetration of, call it, welcome rewards -- or hotel rewards, excuse me. It's got the highest penetration of hotel rewards, bookings as a percentage of the overall customer base, so we see some customer bases who love these programs in the Asia Pacific regions. But in general, the variable economics look good, and we will continue to invest aggressively in these loyalty programs on a go forward basis. The other reminder that I will put forth is that the points cost that we take are upfront. The benefits from these loyalty programs are trailing benefits, so to speak because you get the repeat benefits, you get the channel benefits down the line. So as we're growing these member bases, typically were paying an upfront cost and we're building up a pretty substantial asset. We think this is a great competitive moat that we're building around our brands, and we intend to keep investing behind that moat."

Listen, we're not seeing -- we don't see significant effect of Airbnb on our business. I would relate it to the answer I gave with car. Our growth rates are substantially different from industry growth rates. So just because we don't see it, it doesn't mean that, that is not happening. We have said that Airbnb, in general, and HomeAway are adding inventory in the marketplace, lodging inventory in the marketplace and is becoming more and more clear that there's a certain set of customers who sometimes will stay at a hotel, sometimes will stay in an Airbnb or a HomeAway home. So anytime you increase supply, you will put pressure on pricing. So we will -- we anticipate pressure on pricing. We do it sometimes during periods in which there's Super Bowl, let's say, or events happening in cities that used to sellout. We have observed that it sometimes gets harder for hotels to yield up during those events and sometimes, whereas in the past, we would not have inventory for those events, we tend to have inventory for those events. So in some way, you could consider a positive as it relates to our marketplace. And then finally, anytime you have more supply, you put pressure on pricing, you, as an intermediary, meaning us, want to have access to that supply. And whereas before HomeAway was part of the family, we didn't have significant access to that supply, and our goal is to build out that access to supply on an organic basis, now that HomeAway's part of the family, we have access to that supply, and we will continue to build access to that supply on an organic basis. So we think now that HomeAway's part of the family, the Airbnb effect is going to be a positive factor for us. But it's very early in kind of this evolution. And at this point, other than those spot circumstances when markets are kind of sold out because of big events, we're not seeing it affect our specific trends."

The following discussion, including responses to your questions, reflects management's views as of today, February 10, 2016, only. We do not undertake any obligation to update or revise this information.
As always, some of the statements made on today's call are forward-looking, typically preceded by words such as we expect, we believe, we anticipate or similar statements. Please refer to today's press release and the company's filings with the SEC for information about factors which could cause our actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements.
You'll find reconciliations of our non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures discussed today in our earnings release, which is posted on the company's IR website at ir.expediainc.com. I encourage you to periodically visit our Investor Relations site for important content, including today's earnings release and an updated investor deck.
As a reminder, we sold our 62.4% ownership stake in eLong on May 22, 2015, which was previously a consolidated entity of Expedia, Inc. For GAAP accounting purposes, the results of eLong are included in our results through the date of the sale. But in order to allow investors to compare our current results on a like-for-like basis with our historical results, our commentary in the earnings release and on this call is principally focused on our results, excluding eLong, which should be considered in addition to the GAAP results on a fully consolidated basis.
Finally, unless otherwise stated, all references to cost of revenue, selling and marketing expense, general and administrative expense, and technology and content expense, also exclude stock-based compensation and depreciation expense. And all comparisons on this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2014.

I wanted to start right upfront thanking our employees all over the world for another strong year for Expedia, Inc. Mark, Alan and I get to tell you about it and take public credit for the success of our company, but it's an amalgamation of everyone's dedication and good work that adds up to the figures that we'll review today. 
And the figures tell a consistently strong story. Gross bookings for 2015, up 24% to $59.7 billion, and total revenue, up 19% to $6.6 billion. Our customers bought 35% more airline tickets, 36% more room nights, totaling more than $200 million for the year and 37% more car days in 2015 versus 2014. We delivered nearly $1.2 billion of adjusted EBITDA for the year, impressive in its own right, but especially so when you consider the huge headwinds from foreign currency, the significant investments we're making in resetting our contracted margin structure with our hotel partners, and the deal-related costs that we incurred in connection with our busy year of M&A activity.
Speaking of M&A, 2015 was an unprecedented year for Expedia as we completed over $6 billion of strategic acquisitions, which included Travelocity, a majority stake in our AirAsia joint venture, a significant minority investment in Decolar, Orbitz Worldwide and most recently, our largest acquisition ever in HomeAway. These transactions have consolidated and scaled our U.S. operations, extended our international reach and have opened up a new leg of growth in the alternative accommodations sector. We also divested our stake in eLong for a nice profit and entered into a long-term alliance with Ctrip. 
Briefly on Orbitz, the integration is progressing well with nearly all of the direct type-in traffic of Orbitz.com and Cheap Tickets already on the Brand Expedia platform. It's early but results so far look promising. The migration work will continue through the first half of 2016, followed by optimizing the sites and tuning our variable marketing channels, post migration. We're also actively working on other parts of the Orbitz business, including ebookers, Hotel Club, Orbitz Partner Network and Orbitz for Business. Our goal is to migrate the vast majority of our Orbitz for Business clients onto the Egencia platform before year-end. We're also in active dialogue with our OPN private-label partners on expanding our relationship with them, and we see these efforts carrying through 2016 and into 2017 for certain partners.
Moving forward, we're planning to invest aggressively in our private-label and partnership capabilities and consider this area highly strategic for our company. I'll also add that we're very pleased with the talent level and execution capability of our Orbitz teams all over the world. The people and the brands we've added to our family will play an important role in our future success.
It's very early but we're encouraged with HomeAway's Q4 performance coming in a bit ahead of our expectations and have been consistently impressed with the level of talent there. They operated largely as a stand-alone business and will serve as the end-to-end vacation rental and home-sharing platform for the Expedia, Inc. family. That said, we plan to be highly involved with the HomeAway team, helping them expand aggressively and move from their traditional listings model to a fully online transactional model. The team is beginning to introduce a service fee to travelers, and we expect that it will be fully launched on its U.S. vacation rental listings in the coming months, slightly ahead of schedule. 
Around the same time, we're rolling out lower supplier commissions for paper booking listings as well as a book with confidence guarantee, which is designed to encourage travelers to book on HomeAway and give them increased peace of mind when they do. We've started an integrated marketing campaign in some of our major markets and intend to reinvest incremental upside from traveler fees back into the business, particularly in product, technology and marketing. We remain confident in our estimate of $350 million in adjusted EBITDA for HomeAway in 2018.
We continue to see strong growth for trivago in Q4 and, in fact, for all of 2015. We've had some investor questions in regards to trivago's core growth and profitability, and we'd like to share some numbers for European markets versus the rest of the world. To take out the noise created by foreign exchange fluctuations, the numbers here are stated in euro. trivago delivered 2015 stand-alone revenue of roughly EUR 490 million, up nearly 60% year-over-year, with adjusted EBITDA of a few million euro. Now within these numbers, their most mature European markets collectively had revenue of over EUR 250 million, up 20% year-over-year, and with a contribution margin after direct marketing costs of about 25%. trivago's rest of the world markets had revenue of EUR 235 million, up nearly 130% and a contribution margin just above breakeven. Note also that overhead costs for trivago had been running in the neighborhood of 10% of revenue. While we expect trivago to achieve healthy top and bottom line growth in 2016, we'll continue to reinvest profits from core markets to further scale in expansion markets on a worldwide basis. The trivago team is first rate, and we believe that the global growth runway for this brand continues to be substantial.
Lastly, underpinning our active M&A strategy and investment in high-growth businesses is a core organic business that has never been stronger. Brand Expedia, Hotels.com, our Expedia Affiliate Network business all had terrific years, delivering healthy room night and adjusted EBITDA growth. Egencia, our corporate travel business, had another excellent year, signing up over $1.1 billion of new client business and delivering 12% adjusted EBITDA growth. Supporting all of our brands, our lodging supply team is also firing on all cylinders, signing up nearly 60,000 new directly contracted hotel properties in 2015, up over 30% year-on-year.
Since I opened my remarks with our accomplishments as a company, I'll close with some thoughts about key challenges. Competition for consumer attention is as strong as ever as our competitors, and in some cases, our partners, invest and innovate aggressively. We're also jumping into the alternative accommodations space where there's already a sizable competitor and where we have a significant business model transition to undertake at HomeAway. And as I described, we have heavy integration work with Orbitz. 
These matters, along with a volatile global macroeconomic climate, together create a very dynamic and challenging environment, to say the least. That said, our businesses and our teams are no strangers to these kinds of challenges. We're focused. We're hungry. We have an established execution and capital allocation record, and we take these challenges head-on and with confidence.
With that, I'll hand it to Mark."

As with the case last quarter, in order to help with comparability, our comments today are focused on Expedia results, excluding eLong, since we sold our 62% in eLong last May. Financial results for that business are included in our GAAP results on a consolidated basis through the date of the sale. 
We were quite pleased with our financial performance in the fourth quarter and for the full year 2015. Excluding an estimated headwind of $10 million to $15 million from the impact of the terrorist attacks in Paris and the negative impact of HomeAway in the quarter not contemplated in our prior guidance, our full year 2015 adjusted EBITDA growth exceeded the guidance we gave on our Q3 call. In the fourth quarter, top line growth was driven by solid unit growth across products, geographies and major brands. Of course, we are getting a boost as we consolidate Orbitz. But despite the law of large numbers, our organic growth rates continue to be very healthy and comparable to the rates of growth we have seen for the last couple of years. 
In hotel, revenue grew 24% on room night growth of 39%. The inorganic contributions to hotel revenue and room night growth were 14 and 15 percentage points respectively. We estimate the negative impact from Paris was around 300 basis points for both measures. Revenue per room night was down 11% in Q4 on a 5% decline in average daily rates. Note that the gap between revenue per room night and ADRs narrowed this quarter compared to Q3, principally on reduced foreign exchange impacts. We do expect to see continued year-over-year pressure on revenue per room night in 2016, as we trade some of our unit economics to drive volume and global scale. 
Air revenue was up 61% on ticket growth of 70%, partially offset by a decline in revenue per ticket of 5%. Brand Expedia continued to grow ticket volume at a healthy organic rate, along with the sizable contributions from recently acquired companies. Excluding acquisitions, air revenue grew 6% on ticket growth of 22%. 
Key to our strategy is to grow additional travel products alongside air tickets and room nights. We were pleased to see some good examples of this in Q4, including 66% transaction growth for our local activities business and 43% revenue growth for our insurance product. We also continue to see solid growth in our advertising and media business, with trivago growing stand-alone revenue, 27% or approximately 43% currency-neutral, fairly consistent with the year-over-year growth we saw in Q3. Media Solutions also grew revenue nicely with the boost from the addition of Orbitz. 
HomeAway finished 2015 strongly and a bit ahead of their plans as measured on a stand-alone basis. For Expedia, Inc., HomeAway contributed revenue this quarter of approximately $20 million, which has been classified as other revenue in our product classification. We are breaking out HomeAway as a separate segment, so you will be able to see their stand-alone performance on an ongoing basis. Because HomeAway is in the process of moving to an online booking model and a fair bit of the bookings still occur outside of the platform, we are not planning to report gross bookings or unit growth for that business at this time. 
Although the seasonality of our business can cause the shape of our P&L to vary quarter-to-quarter, we continue to drive to results that use leverage achieved in key expense categories to fund aggressive selling and marketing investments around the world. In Q4, excluding the impacts from Orbitz and HomeAway, the P&L we delivered was largely consistent with this approach. Selling and marketing grew a bit faster than revenue, while cost of revenue and G&A grew slower, providing leverage. Our technology and content expenses did grow faster than revenue and nearly 60 percentage points faster than Q3 on a combination of higher people costs, along with lower capitalization rates. We continue to scale up our core infrastructure and Brand Expedia technology teams to support organic growth and to drive the integration of our new OTA brands. And as such, we are expecting elevated technology and content expense growth, at least through the first half of 2016. 
Importantly, our results for Q4 included the first full quarter of Orbitz and the layering in of the HomeAway stand-alone financials for the 17 days of the quarter that we owned the business. The operations of Orbitz for a full quarter, along with deal-related and integration costs, resulted in an approximate breakeven adjusted EBITDA contribution for that business in Q4, which included a purchase accounting revenue headwind of approximately $27 million. Overall, the Orbitz results were a bit better than we had expected on a combination of lower integration costs and better overall performance. 
HomeAway had a negative impact on adjusted EBITDA of $14 million in Q4 not contemplated in the guidance we gave on our Q3 call. This included the results of the business, the negative impact of deal-related costs and a purchase accounting revenue headwind of approximately $6 million. 
Briefly, as we enter a new year, I'd like to remind folks of a few key aspects of how we manage the business. We are committed to striking a balance between delivering healthy profit growth in the near and midterm, while making key investments in our business that will allow us to grow sustainably over many years to come. From a practical perspective, this means that when we see certain upside and/or outperformance from month-to-month or quarter-to-quarter, including from acquisitions, we have a bias to reinvest at least a portion of that upside back into the business. As part of this approach, we do not guide to quarterly results, and investors should not expect to see the full amount of organic overperformance or M&A-related windfalls drop immediately to the bottom line. This is an important tenet for how we are running our business, and we want investors to fully understand this approach.
Turning to our financial expectations for 2016. On a consolidated basis, including all of the businesses we own today and excluding eLong, we are expecting full year adjusted EBITDA to grow in the range of 35% to 45% year-over-year. The contribution to this result from a full year of Orbitz and HomeAway combined is expected to be in the range of $275 million to $325 million. In terms of the shape of the year, we are expecting particular pressure on Q1 adjusted EBITDA. Due to the seasonal nature of our business, back-end loading of adjusted EBITDA dollar growth is not unusual, though we do expect the impact will be especially acute in 2016. This is due primarily to the integration of Orbitz and the timing of synergy realization, which will ramp in the back half of the year, along with the transition at HomeAway. 
As a further reminder, note that we lapped our acquisition of Wotif in the fourth quarter of 2015 and will lap both the Travelocity acquisition and the consolidation of the AirAsia Expedia joint venture in Q1, which will create tougher comps. Further, the rollout of TripAdvisor's Instant Book product will also likely continue to be a small headwind on room night growth in 2016, with an insignificant impact on profitability. 
From an expense standpoint, including Orbitz and HomeAway, while we will see leverage in cost of revenue and general and administrative expenses in 2016, we expect technology and content expenses to grow faster than revenue, primarily driven by integration efforts and the inorganic impacts of our recent acquisitions. Regarding taxes, as you might imagine, there's lots of moving parts, especially related to newly acquired companies and our international versus domestic mix. However, we currently expect effective tax rates in the mid-20% range.
Finally, some directional color on our CapEx trends. In 2015, we saw significant CapEx growth with about half of the dollar growth attributable to the purchase of our future headquarters. Spending for real estate, in general, also was elevated as we continued to grow our market management team aggressively and built out new office space around the world. In addition, we invested heavily in servers and other hardware in anticipation of future organic growth and upcoming integrations. To a lesser extent, an increase in capitalized software development costs also contributed to year-over-year CapEx growth. For 2016, we expect a much more moderate pace of CapEx growth, most of which will be driven by the inorganic impact of recent acquisitions.
With that, let's move to Q&A. Operator, will you please remind participants how to queue up for questions?"

As far as the macro environment goes, listen, we listen to the same news that you do. And certainly, the news suggests that the macro environment is pretty uncertain, and the stock market downright scary. That said, when we look at the micro environment and how it affects our business, one important factor in our business is the air business. And air ticket prices are down pretty significantly year-on-year. It's obviously some of the savings of oil prices that are being passed on by the airlines to consumers, and that's an unambiguous positive for us. The more -- the lower air ticket prices go, the more the leisure traveler tends to fly. And the more the leisure traveler tends to fly, as you know, we have a bit of what we think is a strategic investment, a strategic advantage on the air side. And the more leisure travelers we have flying, the more opportunity we have to sell hotels and insurance and cars and everything else to them. So to some extent, weakness in oil on the air side is a pretty big positive for us. On the hotel side, while we have seen ADRs weaken a bit between, call it, the beginning of the year and Q4, when we look at Q4 trends into January, we don't see anything of note one way or the other. There are some spot issues, obviously. Paris is weak, which is perfectly explainable. New York ADRs continue to be down year-on-year over -- although they've improved over Q4, in that European travelers really traveling into the U.S. and the effect of foreign exchange. In Asia, we see certain markets, like Hong Kong and Macau, down as far as ADRs go. But again, no significant shifts when we look at Q4 trends into January that are of note. So it's something that we'll watch. And to the extent that we see anything, we'll certainly share it with our investors. But we're not seeing any material movement one way or the other right now."

And we did not, at that time, contribute to the combination of those results. So listen, I think you could look at it as a possible outcome, but it's certainly not something that I would use as guidance. And I think, as you know, we make discrete decisions from month-to-month, quarter-to-quarter, so there's a lot that can change between now and 2018, and we're just really focused on continuing to have a business where we can deliver consistently strong growth rates over a long period of time.

I think it came in a little bit ahead of that, but I think that this is, as a decent base on HomeAway, a little bit better than $120 million in adjusted EBITDA from 2015. They will both have purchase accounting headwinds on them in 2016, both around $10 million each. So think about that as about a $20 million combined. So take that as your base. And then the way that we get to -- obviously, the higher number is synergies. And a lot of that is going to come from Orbitz, and it's going to come in the back half of the year. In fact, in the first part of the year, we're going to be in a position, not unlike where we were with Wotif, where we were essentially carrying almost double cost. We've built up teams to support the integration of the Orbitz businesses onto the Brand Expedia platforms, for example, at the same time as maintaining the Orbitz existing platforms. And then it's really -- once we get the platform transition done, which is really happening in the first half of the year for the big consumer businesses, that's when you start to see synergy realization come in. And that's really starting, again, in the back half of the year, and we're hopeful that by the end of the year, we should be pretty close to a run rate number. But we're not going to be even close to that in the middle of the year, and we will probably be sub that. There'll be a detriment in the first part of the year."

And that's really the focus of the business. We will try to, obviously, drive the online booking volume. But that is really much more of a long-term goal for us as a company. And I think 2016 is going to be about kind of setting the base, making sure the technology infrastructure is right and making sure that we're taking any and all kinks out of the online booking process to make it incredibly easy for travelers and incredibly easy for our subscribers as well. We don't have a specific target for percentage of bookings going over the transom, so to speak, for 2016."

Could you maybe comment on what sort of headwind that was to room night growth in the quarter? And then just a follow-up on HomeAway and moving ahead with instituting this consumer booking fee. I guess, when HomeAway was independent, we could see how that extra margin would really help them. From the fee, it would be really helpful in terms of competing and investing against Airbnb. But now that it's part of a bigger Expedia, how do you guys sort of weight the benefit of that booking fee in terms of increased monetization versus the possibility that it negatively impacts kind of the consumer experience?"

So there were a few headwinds for us on room night growth in the quarter. We had about a 400 basis point harder comp, partially on the back of lapping over some pretty strong growth in Travelocity with the commercial agreement implementation, and then also, Wotif, which we were lapping over in the quarter. We also had about 300 basis points of room night growth impact from the Paris attacks, we estimate. So both of those were pretty significant headwinds for us. In terms of the Instant Book impact, I think if you thought about that in the 100 to 200 basis point range, that would be a good barometer. And then just in terms of expectations for 2016, we are expecting to see some deceleration in room night growth as we move through the year. We're also comping over acquisitions and consolidations again in 2016: Travelocity, for example; ramping up Wotif on variable marketing channels; the integration of Brand Expedia Asia. So I would just keep those in mind. And then, to the extent that TripAdvisor rolls out Instant Booking more broadly, which we currently do expect them to do, and we continue to not participate in that, that could be an incremental headwind. And think about that as larger than 100 to 200 basis points. Could be 200 to 300 basis points, but again, insignificant from the perspective of profitability."

And then we will be watching other metrics, such as the traffic to the site, the conversion rate of consumers coming in who look at listings, the renewal rate of our subscribers. So there are a host of other metrics that we are going to watch and meter in order to measure kind of what is a balanced approach, which is we do think that we are under-monetizing relative to our volume and making sure that, as we move to, call it, market monetization rates, we are providing a great experience for travelers who are coming and looking for a great place to stay on HomeAway. And we are bringing great value to our supply as well. I will also remind you that the booking fee is something that has been widely accepted as far as Airbnb and TripAdvisor go. Airbnb's always had a booking fee. TripAdvisor introduced booking fees last year. Those transitions have gone very, very smoothly. Our pricing is going to be quite competitive. So this is something that has already been market tested, and we feel pretty good moving into this model, based on the competition already being there."

They have an analytics team that is just excellent. So a number of the folks have been there with Orbitz, they understand these optimizations. This is something that they've done before. We're just hoping that as we move them over to our supply base and as we move them over to our tech stack, they're just going to have a machine that kind of is much smoother and better than the machine that they had to work with in the past. So we don't anticipate any hiccups as it relates to Orbitz. You never know. And at least the trends that we're seeing early on are encouraging and things look to be on track. HomeAway as a very different animal. HomeAway is not an integration. That team is going to be largely independent, and the activity with HomeAway has been to make sure, frankly, that, that team is not distracted as being part of -- part of being Expedia. I think we're freeing up a bunch of their time to focus from, call it, public company activity to value-added activity, building a great consumer experience, building a great subscriber experience. And because we are very, very familiar with this transactional model, our product and technology teams are already working with them to make sure that the road maps are what they should be. And I think the second area where we can add value is making sure that as this volume comes online or as these listings come online, we're not only pushing HomeAway traffic to them but also Expedia and Hotels.com traffic to them, which, I think, is of significant value both for the HomeAway subscriber base but also for the Expedia and Hotels.com consumer base as well."

Orbitz for Business is another one. We're pretty excited about the speed at which we're going to be able to move that -- those clients over to the Egencia platform. But again, it is going to take a little bit longer and both of these transitions are new, in that we haven't done a lot of these before unlike the core consumer business. So in terms of synergy realization, I would just keep in mind that until those businesses are migrated off, you don't get to see the full platform retirement benefits that you would if it was only Orbitz Cheap Tickets and ebookers that we were transitioning over."

Historically, these kinds of attacks have resolved fairly quickly. I'd say Paris, in general, we saw immediately kind of an effect on broader European destinations, that effect looks like it's disappeared. But there certainly is -- continues to be an effect in Paris, it's getting better. But the trends in Paris are certainly poorer compared to the trends that we have seen before Q4 of last year. So I think -- listen, Paris is going to continue through the year. It was a horrific event, and I think it was the kind of event that stays in people's memories, so I think that there'll be some effect going into the balance of the year, and we're going to do our best to make up for that. We're going to do our best to work with our partners over there and really continue to promote Paris as the wonderful destination that it is. So hopefully, it won't last long, but my personal feeling is that there'll be some effect going into the balance of the year. As far as the Trip and Instant Book and how we view that channel, we've been very consistent about how we view any variable channel, including Instant Book, in that we look at the economics of a channel based on, call it, the immediate transaction and then we look at the economics of the transaction based on the lifetime value of the customer, both in terms of the customer repeat rate and the percentage of the time in which those customers repeat directly with us the second and third time around. Obviously, the latter is much, much more valuable. The initial, let's say, version of Instant Book was, I think, quite unsatisfactory as far as the branding, et cetera, and representation of where the customer was really transacting with. And the latest iterations that we've seen with Booking.com and with some of the supplier direct partners, for example, Marriott, look a lot better. They look much more clear. So I would say, at this point, Instant Book looks better to us than it did when Instant Book was initially launched, but we don't have any comment as to what the ultimate decision is going to be down the road."

We will then -- once we're done with the U.S. or once we're well underway with the U.S, we'll look at the rest of the world. But listen, these rollouts are live rollouts, and we don't want to kind of hard code a specific rollout cadence. Obviously, we want to roll it out as quickly as possible, making sure that our customer experience and our subscriber experience is terrific. As far as the marketing approach for HomeAway, we do plan a significant year-on-year increase in brand marketing in HomeAway for 2016. That's included in the numbers that Mark related to you. It's -- the marketing campaign has already started, and the early signs -- and we're about 5 markets and the early signs, as far as visits to the HomeAway sites, look really good and were encouraged by the trends that we see. Once online booking really starts to expand, we will be able to throttle up variable marketing channels as we get kind of variable economics on the revenue side. One of the issues with a subscription listing product is that you don't earn money on every single transaction. You're earning money on a kind of annual subscription, so you can't necessarily bid for the incremental transaction. Once we have online booking expanded along with the traveler fee and volumes roll out there, we do think that we will be able to increase variable marketing channels, but we think that's something that's going to happen in the back half of the year as opposed to the front half of the year. And then, listen, on the question of the confidence in the $350 million EBITDA in 2018, we made those estimates based on a set of assumptions -- early set of assumptions. And so far, in the couple of weeks that HomeAway has been a part of the family, we are more impressed than we were when we made those assumptions. It's 2018, it's a long time from now, but I think what we wanted to communicate is that you kind of going into a company, you meet the people, you take a look at the technology stack and the product road maps and either it's good news or bad news.

market. Obviously, we're very strong in leisure travel. Corporate travel, we think, is an enormous opportunity. It's a higher yield customer set that our suppliers favor. The demand patterns are quite complementary of leisure demand patterns and we want to get bigger. We want to scale. And we see kind of growth ahead for Egencia that is a combination of organic as well as inorganic growth, and we think that's going to continue for some time going forward. And then we'll also look for kind of innovative new companies out there. trivago, obviously, was a terrific one and it's a very, very valuable part of the family. We made some investments in ALICE, for example, on the supply technology front. So we will be opportunistic wings as far as transport goes. We'll continue to be opportunistic. We'll continue to kind of shoot bullets, so to speak, and see what opportunity is out there in the world. That said, the business throws off a lot of cash flow. And historically, I'd say, before this year, there was a fair amount of capital allocation going to buybacks. And -- to the extent that we don't see anything external and to the extent of that we like our own stock and typically, we have liked our own stock, we will look to allocate some capital internally as well. So it's kind of the world is our oyster, and we're throwing off a lot of cash, and we will try our best not to waste it. As far as the noise and the chatter with the chains, et cetera, listen, we continue to be strong partners with the hotels, in general. Our volumes with independents and chains have grown significantly, and our strategy with our chain partners is no different than our overall strategy, which is to lower our base commissions, so that there is very little friction in working with us. And then really, any hotel, whether they're a chain or an independent, can compete in our marketplace for share. And this is a market -- it's a big marketplace. The marketplace is only growing. And if you've got competitive pricing and you've got great content and you treat our customers really well and you provide excellent availability along with margins, you will do well in the marketplace. So I think that the ultimate, call it, performance of the chains and the relationship with the chains and the volume that we do with chains is really going to be based on kind of chain bidding in our marketplace against independents. And in general, we see our chain volumes, they've been healthy for a number of years, and we expect to see them healthy on a go forward basis."

Higher penetration means that we're sending plenty of demand into a specific market, which means that we can acquire more hotels. And at this point, we are seeing kind of the growth of demand into the marketplace and the growth of supply be about right. So I would expect the same in 2016 and as we are adding more supply and as the new inventory contributes revenue into our marketplace, we then go on and hire more market managers. It's a formula that we've had in place for about 18 months, and I see no reason to change it. It certainly looks like it's working. As far as the kind of supply that we are adding, as we are adding more supply, we are tending to add supply in secondary and tertiary markets. And the average number of rooms per hotel is going down. So when we look at contribution from new hotel adds, it's not something we disclose but it's something that we certainly look at internally. The contribution per hotel add is going down, and it's going down because of the kind of supply that we're adding, and it's kind of working exactly to formula, so it's exactly what we would expect to see. As far as the impact from countries and the refugee crisis, et cetera, we haven't seen significant impact other than travel to, I would say, broad areas that are affected by the refugee crisis or directly affected. It is obviously down. But we haven't seen kind of second-order stuff. So travel into Europe, in general, is -- continues to be pretty healthy, and we're not seeing any significant step changes in demand patterns there."

As far as the corporate travel and the trends that we're seeing, listen, we're -- we've got some caution. I would say that teams are cautious about client sales in general because of the macroeconomic environment. The most clear trend that we can point to relating to oil prices is in terms of our business in the Nordics. As you know, we acquired VIA and integrated it into a Egencia, and we do see volumes in the Nordic regions, in general, weak, and that is very much related to oil prices being down significantly on a year-on-year basis. In general, transactions, corporate transactions look good. We're not seeing, call it, very significant spend cuts one way or the other like we saw a couple of years back. We are seeing some trading down so the revenue per transactions or gross booking per corporate transaction is down a bit, and we think that's just cautious practice from some corporations out there trading down, call it, from premium class to economy class or taking a train instead of taking a plane. But those are, I would say, on the edges. We're not seeing some big theme one way or the other as far as corporate travel changing significantly one way or the other. As far as the car rental and the impact of Uber, our car rental business is, we think, very early in its development. The volume in car days is up very significantly on a year-on-year basis, over 30% on a year-on-year basis, and most of that business is in the U.S. And we think we have a ton of potential as far as our car rental business in Europe goes. So I just think that we're on a growth path at this point that is not going to be affected by Uber. We're not going to feel kind of, call it, market numbers one way or the other just because the growth rates that we have are so high. If I were to generalize, in Q4, other trends that we saw in the car business, on the Hotwire side, we saw a higher concentration of, call it, agency bookings versus opaque bookings. We tend to make more money on opaque bookings. So that was one trend that we saw, but otherwise nothing to say, ""Hey, this is Uber who's having a material effect on the business."" to speak of.

I'd also add that Expedia has a pretty significant loyalty program and I think between Hotels.com, Expedia and Orbitz, we are running pretty close to 40 million loyalty members on a global basis. And I would say our appetite here is unlimited. And the way to explain to that is that the variable economics behind these loyalty programs are all working. In other words, we look at the points cost, we look at the ultimate redemption value of those points, the percentage of people who are using the points -- customers who are using the points, and when to use them. And then we look at the behavior of consumers and like-for-like consumers who are in the program versus the behavior of consumers who are not in the program and how that behavior changes in terms of repeat characteristics and in terms of channel mix. When we look at those factors and compare it to the point cost, these loyalty programs work. So as long as the factors are not changing, as long as these repeat characteristics aren't changing, as long as the channel mix isn't changing, and as long as the ultimate redemption value isn't changing, then we will look to expand these loyalty programs as aggressively as we can on a global basis. There are some countries where the programs work really, really well. For example, we've been pleasantly surprised in the Asia Pacific regions where loyalty has really taken off and for example, on a Welcome Rewards basis, it's got the highest penetration of, call it, welcome rewards -- or hotel rewards, excuse me. It's got the highest penetration of hotel rewards bookings as a percentage of the overall customer base. So we see some customer bases who love these programs in the Asia Pacific regions. But in general, the variable economics look good, and we will continue to invest aggressively in these loyalty programs on a go forward basis. The other reminder that I would put forth is that the points costs that we take are upfront. The benefits from these loyalty programs are trailing benefits, so to speak because you get the repeat benefits, you get the channel benefits down the line. So as we're growing these member bases, typically we're paying an upfront cost and we're building out a pretty substantial asset. We think this is a great competitive moat that we're building around our brands, and we intend to keep investing behind that moat."

Listen, we're not seeing -- we don't see significant effect of Airbnb on our business. I would relate it to the answer I gave with car. Our growth rates are substantially different from industry growth rates. So just because we don't see it, it doesn't mean that it's not happening. We have said that Airbnb, in general, and HomeAway are adding inventory in the marketplace, lodging inventory in the marketplace and it's becoming more and more clear that there's a certain set of customers who sometimes will stay at a hotel, sometimes will stay in an Airbnb or a HomeAway home. So anytime you increase supply, you will put pressure on pricing. So we will -- we anticipate pressure on pricing. We do it sometimes during periods in which there's a Super Bowl, let's say, or events happening in cities that used to sell out. We have observed that it sometimes gets harder for hotels to yield up during those events and sometimes, whereas in the past, we would not have inventory for those events, we tend to have inventory for those events. So in some way, you could consider it a positive as it relates to our marketplace. And then finally, anytime you have more supply, you put pressure on pricing, you, as an intermediary, meaning us, want to have access to that supply. And whereas before HomeAway was part of the family, we didn't have significant access to that supply, and our goal was to build out that access to supply on an organic basis, now that HomeAway's part of the family, we have access to that supply, and we will continue to build access to that supply on an organic basis. So we think now that HomeAway's part of the family, the Airbnb effect is going to be a positive factor for us. But it's very early in kind of this evolution. And at this point, other than those spot circumstances when markets are kind of sold out because of big events, we're not seeing it affect our specific trends."

One is that, obviously, as we have built these big loyalty programs, both at Hotels.com and at Brand Expedia, and certainly, Orbitz has had this benefit as well with their Orbucks program, you do build on your direct business. That's one of the core strategies of having those loyalty programs. So as those programs mature and they are getting big, we do see an increasing amount of our bookings coming direct. So that's the first point I'd make. Secondly, is in our mature markets like the U.S., we do see a significant amount of our business coming to us direct, direct type-in, responding to email, using the app, for example. And in less mature markets where we don't have establishment, the vast majority of traffic actually comes to us from variable channels, and the goal is, over time, and we do this as we enter new markets and as they mature over time, is to acquire these new customers and have them turn into repeat customers and build a business in places like Vietnam and Korea, for example, that look a lot like the U.S. I think Dara had made some comments over the course of the last couple of quarter calls that one of the trends that we have seen is that the growth rates of our direct channels and the growth rates of bookings from our indirect or variable marketing channels were starting to get closer together, and I think that's a trend that we had continued to see, and we're hopeful that's something that can continue over a long period of time as we build these loyalty programs and as our international markets mature."

The following discussion, including responses to your questions, reflects management's views as of today, February 10, 2016, only. We do not undertake any obligation to update or revise this information.
As always, some of the statements made on today's call are forward-looking, typically preceded by words such as we expect, we believe, we anticipate or similar statements. Please refer to today's press release and the company's filings with the SEC for information about factors which could cause our actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements.
You'll find reconciliations of our non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures discussed today in our earnings release, which is posted on the company's IR website at ir.expediainc.com. I encourage you to periodically visit our Investor Relations site for important content, including today's earnings release and an updated investor deck.
As a reminder, we sold our 62.4% ownership stake in eLong on May 22, 2015, which was previously a consolidated entity of Expedia, Inc. For GAAP accounting purposes, the results of eLong are included in our results through the date of the sale. But in order to allow investors to compare our current results on a like-for-like basis with our historical results, our commentary in the earnings release and on this call is principally focused on our results, excluding eLong, which should be considered in addition to the GAAP results on a fully consolidated basis.
Finally, unless otherwise stated, all references to cost of revenue, selling and marketing expense, general and administrative expense, and technology and content expense, also exclude stock-based compensation and depreciation expense. And all comparisons on this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2014.

I wanted to start right upfront thanking our employees all over the world for another strong year for Expedia, Inc. Mark, Alan and I get to tell you about it and take public credit for the success of our company, but it's an amalgamation of everyone's dedication and good work that adds up to the figures that we'll review today. 
And the figures tell a consistently strong story. Gross bookings for 2015, up 24% to $59.7 billion, and total revenue, up 19% to $6.6 billion. Our customers bought 35% more airline tickets, 36% more room nights, totaling more than $200 million for the year and 37% more car days in 2015 versus 2014. We delivered nearly $1.2 billion of adjusted EBITDA for the year, impressive in its own right, but especially so when you consider the huge headwinds from foreign currency, the significant investments we're making in resetting our contracted margin structure with our hotel partners, and the deal-related costs that we incurred in connection with our busy year of M&A activity.
Speaking of M&A, 2015 was an unprecedented year for Expedia as we completed over $6 billion of strategic acquisitions, which included Travelocity, a majority stake in our AirAsia joint venture, a significant minority investment in Decolar, Orbitz Worldwide and most recently, our largest acquisition ever in HomeAway. These transactions have consolidated and scaled our U.S. operations, extended our international reach and have opened up a new leg of growth in the alternative accommodations sector. We also divested our stake in eLong for a nice profit and entered into a long-term alliance with Ctrip. 
Briefly on Orbitz, the integration is progressing well with nearly all of the direct type-in traffic of Orbitz.com and Cheap Tickets already on the Brand Expedia platform. It's early but results so far look promising. The migration work will continue through the first half of 2016, followed by optimizing the sites and tuning our variable marketing channels, post migration. We're also actively working on other parts of the Orbitz business, including ebookers, Hotel Club, Orbitz Partner Network and Orbitz for Business. Our goal is to migrate the vast majority of our Orbitz for Business clients onto the Egencia platform before year-end. We're also in active dialogue with our OPN private-label partners on expanding our relationship with them, and we see these efforts carrying through 2016 and into 2017 for certain partners.
Moving forward, we're planning to invest aggressively in our private-label and partnership capabilities and consider this area highly strategic for our company. I'll also add that we're very pleased with the talent level and execution capability of our Orbitz teams all over the world. The people and the brands we've added to our family will play an important role in our future success.
It's very early but we're encouraged with HomeAway's Q4 performance coming in a bit ahead of our expectations and have been consistently impressed with the level of talent there. They operated largely as a stand-alone business and will serve as the end-to-end vacation rental and home-sharing platform for the Expedia, Inc. family. That said, we plan to be highly involved with the HomeAway team, helping them expand aggressively and move from their traditional listings model to a fully online transactional model. The team is beginning to introduce a service fee to travelers, and we expect that it will be fully launched on its U.S. vacation rental listings in the coming months, slightly ahead of schedule. 
Around the same time, we're rolling out lower supplier commissions for paper booking listings as well as a book with confidence guarantee, which is designed to encourage travelers to book on HomeAway and give them increased peace of mind when they do. We've started an integrated marketing campaign in some of our major markets and intend to reinvest incremental upside from traveler fees back into the business, particularly in product, technology and marketing. We remain confident in our estimate of $350 million in adjusted EBITDA for HomeAway in 2018.
We continue to see strong growth for trivago in Q4 and, in fact, for all of 2015. We've had some investor questions in regards to trivago's core growth and profitability, and we'd like to share some numbers for European markets versus the rest of the world. To take out the noise created by foreign exchange fluctuations, the numbers here are stated in euro. trivago delivered 2015 stand-alone revenue of roughly EUR 490 million, up nearly 60% year-over-year, with adjusted EBITDA of a few million euro. Now within these numbers, their most mature European markets collectively had revenue of over EUR 250 million, up 20% year-over-year, and with a contribution margin after direct marketing costs of about 25%. trivago's rest of the world markets had revenue of EUR 235 million, up nearly 130% and a contribution margin just above breakeven. Note also that overhead costs for trivago had been running in the neighborhood of 10% of revenue. While we expect trivago to achieve healthy top and bottom line growth in 2016, we'll continue to reinvest profits from core markets to further scale in expansion markets on a worldwide basis. The trivago team is first rate, and we believe that the global growth runway for this brand continues to be substantial.
Lastly, underpinning our active M&A strategy and investment in high-growth businesses is a core organic business that has never been stronger. Brand Expedia, Hotels.com, our Expedia Affiliate Network business all had terrific years, delivering healthy room night and adjusted EBITDA growth. Egencia, our corporate travel business, had another excellent year, signing up over $1.1 billion of new client business and delivering 12% adjusted EBITDA growth. Supporting all of our brands, our lodging supply team is also firing on all cylinders, signing up nearly 60,000 new directly contracted hotel properties in 2015, up over 30% year-on-year.
Since I opened my remarks with our accomplishments as a company, I'll close with some thoughts about key challenges. Competition for consumer attention is as strong as ever as our competitors, and in some cases, our partners, invest and innovate aggressively. We're also jumping into the alternative accommodations space where there's already a sizable competitor and where we have a significant business model transition to undertake at HomeAway. And as I described, we have heavy integration work with Orbitz. 
These matters, along with a volatile global macroeconomic climate, together create a very dynamic and challenging environment, to say the least. That said, our businesses and our teams are no strangers to these kinds of challenges. We're focused. We're hungry. We have an established execution and capital allocation record, and we take these challenges head-on and with confidence.
With that, I'll hand it to Mark."

As with the case last quarter, in order to help with comparability, our comments today are focused on Expedia results, excluding eLong, since we sold our 62% in eLong last May. Financial results for that business are included in our GAAP results on a consolidated basis through the date of the sale. 
We were quite pleased with our financial performance in the fourth quarter and for the full year 2015. Excluding an estimated headwind of $10 million to $15 million from the impact of the terrorist attacks in Paris and the negative impact of HomeAway in the quarter not contemplated in our prior guidance, our full year 2015 adjusted EBITDA growth exceeded the guidance we gave on our Q3 call. In the fourth quarter, top line growth was driven by solid unit growth across products, geographies and major brands. Of course, we are getting a boost as we consolidate Orbitz. But despite the law of large numbers, our organic growth rates continue to be very healthy and comparable to the rates of growth we have seen for the last couple of years. 
In hotel, revenue grew 24% on room night growth of 39%. The inorganic contributions to hotel revenue and room night growth were 14 and 15 percentage points respectively. We estimate the negative impact from Paris was around 300 basis points for both measures. Revenue per room night was down 11% in Q4 on a 5% decline in average daily rates. Note that the gap between revenue per room night and ADRs narrowed this quarter compared to Q3, principally on reduced foreign exchange impacts. We do expect to see continued year-over-year pressure on revenue per room night in 2016, as we trade some of our unit economics to drive volume and global scale. 
Air revenue was up 61% on ticket growth of 70%, partially offset by a decline in revenue per ticket of 5%. Brand Expedia continued to grow ticket volume at a healthy organic rate, along with the sizable contributions from recently acquired companies. Excluding acquisitions, air revenue grew 6% on ticket growth of 22%. 
Key to our strategy is to grow additional travel products alongside air tickets and room nights. We were pleased to see some good examples of this in Q4, including 66% transaction growth for our local activities business and 43% revenue growth for our insurance product. We also continue to see solid growth in our advertising and media business, with trivago growing stand-alone revenue, 27% or approximately 43% currency-neutral, fairly consistent with the year-over-year growth we saw in Q3. Media Solutions also grew revenue nicely with the boost from the addition of Orbitz. 
HomeAway finished 2015 strongly and a bit ahead of their plans as measured on a stand-alone basis. For Expedia, Inc., HomeAway contributed revenue this quarter of approximately $20 million, which has been classified as other revenue in our product classification. We are breaking out HomeAway as a separate segment, so you will be able to see their stand-alone performance on an ongoing basis. Because HomeAway is in the process of moving to an online booking model and a fair bit of the bookings still occur outside of the platform, we are not planning to report gross bookings or unit growth for that business at this time. 
Although the seasonality of our business can cause the shape of our P&L to vary quarter-to-quarter, we continue to drive to results that use leverage achieved in key expense categories to fund aggressive selling and marketing investments around the world. In Q4, excluding the impacts from Orbitz and HomeAway, the P&L we delivered was largely consistent with this approach. Selling and marketing grew a bit faster than revenue, while cost of revenue and G&A grew slower, providing leverage. Our technology and content expenses did grow faster than revenue and nearly 60 percentage points faster than Q3 on a combination of higher people costs, along with lower capitalization rates. We continue to scale up our core infrastructure and Brand Expedia technology teams to support organic growth and to drive the integration of our new OTA brands. And as such, we are expecting elevated technology and content expense growth, at least through the first half of 2016. 
Importantly, our results for Q4 included the first full quarter of Orbitz and the layering in of the HomeAway stand-alone financials for the 17 days of the quarter that we owned the business. The operations of Orbitz for a full quarter, along with deal-related and integration costs, resulted in an approximate breakeven adjusted EBITDA contribution for that business in Q4, which included a purchase accounting revenue headwind of approximately $27 million. Overall, the Orbitz results were a bit better than we had expected on a combination of lower integration costs and better overall performance. 
HomeAway had a negative impact on adjusted EBITDA of $14 million in Q4 not contemplated in the guidance we gave on our Q3 call. This included the results of the business, the negative impact of deal-related costs and a purchase accounting revenue headwind of approximately $6 million. 
Briefly, as we enter a new year, I'd like to remind folks of a few key aspects of how we manage the business. We are committed to striking a balance between delivering healthy profit growth in the near and midterm, while making key investments in our business that will allow us to grow sustainably over many years to come. From a practical perspective, this means that when we see certain upside and/or outperformance from month-to-month or quarter-to-quarter, including from acquisitions, we have a bias to reinvest at least a portion of that upside back into the business. As part of this approach, we do not guide to quarterly results, and investors should not expect to see the full amount of organic overperformance or M&A-related windfalls drop immediately to the bottom line. This is an important tenet for how we are running our business, and we want investors to fully understand this approach.
Turning to our financial expectations for 2016. On a consolidated basis, including all of the businesses we own today and excluding eLong, we are expecting full year adjusted EBITDA to grow in the range of 35% to 45% year-over-year. The contribution to this result from a full year of Orbitz and HomeAway combined is expected to be in the range of $275 million to $325 million. In terms of the shape of the year, we are expecting particular pressure on Q1 adjusted EBITDA. Due to the seasonal nature of our business, back-end loading of adjusted EBITDA dollar growth is not unusual, though we do expect the impact will be especially acute in 2016. This is due primarily to the integration of Orbitz and the timing of synergy realization, which will ramp in the back half of the year, along with the transition at HomeAway. 
As a further reminder, note that we lapped our acquisition of Wotif in the fourth quarter of 2015 and will lap both the Travelocity acquisition and the consolidation of the AirAsia Expedia joint venture in Q1, which will create tougher comps. Further, the rollout of TripAdvisor's Instant Book product will also likely continue to be a small headwind on room night growth in 2016, with an insignificant impact on profitability. 
From an expense standpoint, including Orbitz and HomeAway, while we will see leverage in cost of revenue and general and administrative expenses in 2016, we expect technology and content expenses to grow faster than revenue, primarily driven by integration efforts and the inorganic impacts of our recent acquisitions. Regarding taxes, as you might imagine, there's lots of moving parts, especially related to newly acquired companies and our international versus domestic mix. However, we currently expect effective tax rates in the mid-20% range.
Finally, some directional color on our CapEx trends. In 2015, we saw significant CapEx growth with about half of the dollar growth attributable to the purchase of our future headquarters. Spending for real estate, in general, also was elevated as we continued to grow our market management team aggressively and built out new office space around the world. In addition, we invested heavily in servers and other hardware in anticipation of future organic growth and upcoming integrations. To a lesser extent, an increase in capitalized software development costs also contributed to year-over-year CapEx growth. For 2016, we expect a much more moderate pace of CapEx growth, most of which will be driven by the inorganic impact of recent acquisitions.
With that, let's move to Q&A. Operator, will you please remind participants how to queue up for questions?"

As far as the macro environment goes, listen, we listen to the same news that you do. And certainly, the news suggests that the macro environment is pretty uncertain, and the stock market downright scary. That said, when we look at the micro environment and how it affects our business, one important factor in our business is the air business. And air ticket prices are down pretty significantly year-on-year. It's obviously some of the savings of oil prices that are being passed on by the airlines to consumers, and that's an unambiguous positive for us. The more -- the lower air ticket prices go, the more the leisure traveler tends to fly. And the more the leisure traveler tends to fly, as you know, we have a bit of what we think is a strategic investment, a strategic advantage on the air side. And the more leisure travelers we have flying, the more opportunity we have to sell hotels and insurance and cars and everything else to them. So to some extent, weakness in oil on the air side is a pretty big positive for us. On the hotel side, while we have seen ADRs weaken a bit between, call it, the beginning of the year and Q4, when we look at Q4 trends into January, we don't see anything of note one way or the other. There are some spot issues, obviously. Paris is weak, which is perfectly explainable. New York ADRs continue to be down year-on-year over -- although they've improved over Q4, in that European travelers really traveling into the U.S. and the effect of foreign exchange. In Asia, we see certain markets, like Hong Kong and Macau, down as far as ADRs go. But again, no significant shifts when we look at Q4 trends into January that are of note. So it's something that we'll watch. And to the extent that we see anything, we'll certainly share it with our investors. But we're not seeing any material movement one way or the other right now."

And we did not, at that time, contribute to the combination of those results. So listen, I think you could look at it as a possible outcome, but it's certainly not something that I would use as guidance. And I think, as you know, we make discrete decisions from month-to-month, quarter-to-quarter, so there's a lot that can change between now and 2018, and we're just really focused on continuing to have a business where we can deliver consistently strong growth rates over a long period of time.

Are we starting to see a fade down in that pressure you're seeing on revenue per room night?"

I think there is a possibility, as we start to comp over some of the margin reductions we did this year, that start to ease, and then I think you'll start to see, I would expect, some more easing in that as we move through 2017.

But can you just talk about what kind of penetration rate you think you can reasonably get to by the end of this year in terms of the percentage of bookings happening online versus just enabling the bookings? And then, I had a follow-up on the guidance. So I think, Mark, you called out the contribution from the 2 acquisitions, Orbitz and HomeAway, to the EBITDA number. But I think previously, you've talked about Orbitz seeing synergies of up to -- or in excess of $75 million. Is there any update to that number?"

Why don't I take the last question first, and then Dara can chime in on HomeAway. So just again on the $275 million to $325 million of adjusted EBITDA contribution for the 2 acquisitions combined, first of all, I would just remind people that on a stand-alone basis, we had said Orbitz was on track to around $135 million of adjusted EBITDA in 2015. I think it came in a little bit ahead of that, but I think that this is, as a decent base on HomeAway, a little bit better than $120 million in adjusted EBITDA from 2015. They will both have purchase accounting headwinds on them in 2016, both around $10 million each. So think about that as about a $20 million combined. So take that as your base. And then the way that we get to -- obviously, the higher number is synergies. And a lot of that is going to come from Orbitz, and it's going to come in the back half of the year. In fact, in the first part of the year, we're going to be in a position, not unlike where we were with Wotif, where we were essentially carrying almost double cost. We've built up teams to support the integration of the Orbitz businesses onto the Brand Expedia platforms, for example, at the same time as maintaining the Orbitz existing platforms. And then it's really -- once we get the platform transition done, which is really happening in the first half of the year for the big consumer businesses, that's when you start to see synergy realization come in. And that's really starting, again, in the back half of the year, and we're hopeful that by the end of the year, we should be pretty close to a run rate number. But we're not going to be even close to that in the middle of the year, and we will probably be sub that. There'll be a detriment in the first part of the year."

So there were a few headwinds for us on room night growth in the quarter. We had about a 400 basis point harder comp, partially on the back of lapping over some pretty strong growth in Travelocity with the commercial agreement implementation, and then also, Wotif, which we were lapping over in the quarter. We also had about 300 basis points of room night growth impact from the Paris attacks, we estimate. So both of those were pretty significant headwinds for us. In terms of the Instant Book impact, I think if you thought about that in the 100 to 200 basis point range, that would be a good barometer. And then just in terms of expectations for 2016, we are expecting to see some deceleration in room night growth as we move through the year. We're also comping over acquisitions and consolidations again in 2016: Travelocity, for example; ramping up Wotif on variable marketing channels; the integration of Brand Expedia Asia. So I would just keep those in mind. And then, to the extent that TripAdvisor rolls out Instant Booking more broadly, which we currently do expect them to do, and we continue to not participate in that, that could be an incremental headwind. And think about that as larger than 100 to 200 basis points. Could be 200 to 300 basis points, but again, insignificant from the perspective of profitability."

And then we will be watching other metrics, such as the traffic to the site, the conversion rate of consumers coming in who look at listings, the renewal rate of our subscribers. So there are a host of other metrics that we are going to watch and meter in order to measure kind of what is a balanced approach, which is we do think that we are under-monetizing relative to our volume and making sure that, as we move to, call it, market monetization rates, we are providing a great experience for travelers who are coming and looking for a great place to stay on HomeAway. And we are bringing great value to our supply as well. I will also remind you that the booking fee is something that has been widely accepted as far as Airbnb and TripAdvisor go. Airbnb's always had a booking fee. TripAdvisor introduced booking fees last year. Those transitions have gone very, very smoothly. Our pricing is going to be quite competitive. So this is something that has already been market tested, and we feel pretty good moving into this model, based on the competition already being there."

They have an analytics team that is just excellent. So a number of the folks have been there with Orbitz, they understand these optimizations. This is something that they've done before. We're just hoping that as we move them over to our supply base and as we move them over to our tech stack, they're just going to have a machine that kind of is much smoother and better than the machine that they had to work with in the past. So we don't anticipate any hiccups as it relates to Orbitz. You never know. And at least the trends that we're seeing early on are encouraging and things look to be on track. HomeAway as a very different animal. HomeAway is not an integration. That team is going to be largely independent, and the activity with HomeAway has been to make sure, frankly, that, that team is not distracted as being part of -- part of being Expedia. I think we're freeing up a bunch of their time to focus from, call it, public company activity to value-added activity, building a great consumer experience, building a great subscriber experience. And because we are very, very familiar with this transactional model, our product and technology teams are already working with them to make sure that the road maps are what they should be. And I think the second area where we can add value is making sure that as this volume comes online or as these listings come online, we're not only pushing HomeAway traffic to them but also Expedia and Hotels.com traffic to them, which, I think, is of significant value both for the HomeAway subscriber base but also for the Expedia and Hotels.com consumer base as well."

Orbitz for Business is another one. We're pretty excited about the speed at which we're going to be able to move that -- those clients over to the Egencia platform. But again, it is going to take a little bit longer and both of these transitions are new, in that we haven't done a lot of these before unlike the core consumer business.

Historically, these kinds of attacks have resolved fairly quickly. I'd say Paris, in general, we saw immediately kind of an effect on broader European destinations, that effect looks like it's disappeared. But there certainly is -- continues to be an effect in Paris, it's getting better. But the trends in Paris are certainly poorer compared to the trends that we have seen before Q4 of last year. So I think -- listen, Paris is going to continue through the year. It was a horrific event, and I think it was the kind of event that stays in people's memories, so I think that there'll be some effect going into the balance of the year, and we're going to do our best to make up for that. We're going to do our best to work with our partners over there and really continue to promote Paris as the wonderful destination that it is. So hopefully, it won't last long, but my personal feeling is that there'll be some effect going into the balance of the year. As far as the Trip and Instant Book and how we view that channel, we've been very consistent about how we view any variable channel, including Instant Book, in that we look at the economics of a channel based on, call it, the immediate transaction and then we look at the economics of the transaction based on the lifetime value of the customer, both in terms of the customer repeat rate and the percentage of the time in which those customers repeat directly with us the second and third time around. Obviously, the latter is much, much more valuable. The initial, let's say, version of Instant Book was, I think, quite unsatisfactory as far as the branding, et cetera, and representation of where the customer was really transacting with. And the latest iterations that we've seen with Booking.com and with some of the supplier direct partners, for example, Marriott, look a lot better. They look much more clear. So I would say, at this point, Instant Book looks better to us than it did when Instant Book was initially launched, but we don't have any comment as to what the ultimate decision is going to be down the road."

Obviously, we want to roll it out as quickly as possible, making sure that our customer experience and our subscriber experience is terrific. As far as the marketing approach for HomeAway, we do plan a significant year-on-year increase in brand marketing in HomeAway for 2016. That's included in the numbers that Mark related to you. It's -- the marketing campaign has already started, and the early signs -- and we're about 5 markets and the early signs, as far as visits to the HomeAway sites, look really good and were encouraged by the trends that we see. Once online booking really starts to expand, we will be able to throttle up variable marketing channels as we get kind of variable economics on the revenue side. One of the issues with a subscription listing product is that you don't earn money on every single transaction. You're earning money on a kind of annual subscription, so you can't necessarily bid for the incremental transaction. Once we have online booking expanded along with the traveler fee and volumes roll out there, we do think that we will be able to increase variable marketing channels, but we think that's something that's going to happen in the back half of the year as opposed to the front half of the year. And then, listen, on the question of the confidence in the $350 million EBITDA in 2018, we made those estimates based on a set of assumptions -- early set of assumptions. And so far, in the couple of weeks that HomeAway has been a part of the family, we are more impressed than we were when we made those assumptions. It's 2018, it's a long time from now, but I think what we wanted to communicate is that you kind of going into a company, you meet the people, you take a look at the technology stack and the product road maps and either it's good news or bad news.

When we look at the portfolio of assets that we have, especially with HomeAway as part of our family, we feel like we have a full portfolio. We feel like we don't have any competitive holes, and if we don't engage in any M&A for the next 2, 3 years, we'd be perfectly happy. That said, we do want to extend our international coverage. I think we have are, in general, too U.S.-dependent.

market. Obviously, we're very strong in leisure travel. Corporate travel, we think, is an enormous opportunity. It's a higher yield customer set that our suppliers favor. The demand patterns are quite complementary of leisure demand patterns and we want to get bigger. We want to scale. And we see kind of growth ahead for Egencia that is a combination of organic as well as inorganic growth, and we think that's going to continue for some time going forward. And then we'll also look for kind of innovative new companies out there. trivago, obviously, was a terrific one and it's a very, very valuable part of the family. We made some investments in ALICE, for example, on the supply technology front. So we will be opportunistic wings as far as transport goes. We'll continue to be opportunistic. We'll continue to kind of shoot bullets, so to speak, and see what opportunity is out there in the world. That said, the business throws off a lot of cash flow. And historically, I'd say, before this year, there was a fair amount of capital allocation going to buybacks. And -- to the extent that we don't see anything external and to the extent of that we like our own stock and typically, we have liked our own stock, we will look to allocate some capital internally as well. So it's kind of the world is our oyster, and we're throwing off a lot of cash, and we will try our best not to waste it. As far as the noise and the chatter with the chains, et cetera, listen, we continue to be strong partners with the hotels, in general. Our volumes with independents and chains have grown significantly, and our strategy with our chain partners is no different than our overall strategy, which is to lower our base commissions, so that there is very little friction in working with us. And then really, any hotel, whether they're a chain or an independent, can compete in our marketplace for share. And this is a market -- it's a big marketplace. The marketplace is only growing. And if you've got competitive pricing and you've got great content and you treat our customers really well and you provide excellent availability along with margins, you will do well in the marketplace. So I think that the ultimate, call it, performance of the chains and the relationship with the chains and the volume that we do with chains is really going to be based on kind of chain bidding in our marketplace against independents. And in general, we see our chain volumes, they've been healthy for a number of years, and we expect to see them healthy on a go forward basis."

Higher penetration means that we're sending plenty of demand into a specific market, which means that we can acquire more hotels. And at this point, we are seeing kind of the growth of demand into the marketplace and the growth of supply be about right. So I would expect the same in 2016 and as we are adding more supply and as the new inventory contributes revenue into our marketplace, we then go on and hire more market managers. It's a formula that we've had in place for about 18 months, and I see no reason to change it. It certainly looks like it's working. As far as the kind of supply that we are adding, as we are adding more supply, we are tending to add supply in secondary and tertiary markets. And the average number of rooms per hotel is going down. So when we look at contribution from new hotel adds, it's not something we disclose but it's something that we certainly look at internally. The contribution per hotel add is going down, and it's going down because of the kind of supply that we're adding, and it's kind of working exactly to formula, so it's exactly what we would expect to see. As far as the impact from countries and the refugee crisis, et cetera, we haven't seen significant impact other than travel to, I would say, broad areas that are affected by the refugee crisis or directly affected. It is obviously down. But we haven't seen kind of second-order stuff. So travel into Europe, in general, is -- continues to be pretty healthy, and we're not seeing any significant step changes in demand patterns there."

As far as the corporate travel and the trends that we're seeing, listen, we're -- we've got some caution. I would say that teams are cautious about client sales in general because of the macroeconomic environment. The most clear trend that we can point to relating to oil prices is in terms of our business in the Nordics. As you know, we acquired VIA and integrated it into a Egencia, and we do see volumes in the Nordic regions, in general, weak, and that is very much related to oil prices being down significantly on a year-on-year basis. In general, transactions, corporate transactions look good. We're not seeing, call it, very significant spend cuts one way or the other like we saw a couple of years back. We are seeing some trading down so the revenue per transactions or gross booking per corporate transaction is down a bit, and we think that's just cautious practice from some corporations out there trading down, call it, from premium class to economy class or taking a train instead of taking a plane. But those are, I would say, on the edges. We're not seeing some big theme one way or the other as far as corporate travel changing significantly one way or the other. As far as the car rental and the impact of Uber, our car rental business is, we think, very early in its development. The volume in car days is up very significantly on a year-on-year basis, over 30% on a year-on-year basis, and most of that business is in the U.S. And we think we have a ton of potential as far as our car rental business in Europe goes. So I just think that we're on a growth path at this point that is not going to be affected by Uber. We're not going to feel kind of, call it, market numbers one way or the other just because the growth rates that we have are so high. If I were to generalize, in Q4, other trends that we saw in the car business, on the Hotwire side, we saw a higher concentration of, call it, agency bookings versus opaque bookings. We tend to make more money on opaque bookings. So that was one trend that we saw, but otherwise nothing to say, ""Hey, this is Uber who's having a material effect on the business."" to speak of.

I'd also add that Expedia has a pretty significant loyalty program and I think between Hotels.com, Expedia and Orbitz, we are running pretty close to 40 million loyalty members on a global basis. And I would say our appetite here is unlimited. And the way to explain to that is that the variable economics behind these loyalty programs are all working. In other words, we look at the points cost, we look at the ultimate redemption value of those points, the percentage of people who are using the points -- customers who are using the points, and when to use them. And then we look at the behavior of consumers and like-for-like consumers who are in the program versus the behavior of consumers who are not in the program and how that behavior changes in terms of repeat characteristics and in terms of channel mix. When we look at those factors and compare it to the point cost, these loyalty programs work. So as long as the factors are not changing, as long as these repeat characteristics aren't changing, as long as the channel mix isn't changing, and as long as the ultimate redemption value isn't changing, then we will look to expand these loyalty programs as aggressively as we can on a global basis. There are some countries where the programs work really, really well. For example, we've been pleasantly surprised in the Asia Pacific regions where loyalty has really taken off and for example, on a Welcome Rewards basis, it's got the highest penetration of, call it, welcome rewards -- or hotel rewards, excuse me. It's got the highest penetration of hotel rewards bookings as a percentage of the overall customer base. So we see some customer bases who love these programs in the Asia Pacific regions. But in general, the variable economics look good, and we will continue to invest aggressively in these loyalty programs on a go forward basis. The other reminder that I would put forth is that the points costs that we take are upfront. The benefits from these loyalty programs are trailing benefits, so to speak because you get the repeat benefits, you get the channel benefits down the line. So as we're growing these member bases, typically we're paying an upfront cost and we're building out a pretty substantial asset. We think this is a great competitive moat that we're building around our brands, and we intend to keep investing behind that moat."

Listen, we're not seeing -- we don't see significant effect of Airbnb on our business. I would relate it to the answer I gave with car. Our growth rates are substantially different from industry growth rates. So just because we don't see it, it doesn't mean that it's not happening. We have said that Airbnb, in general, and HomeAway are adding inventory in the marketplace, lodging inventory in the marketplace and it's becoming more and more clear that there's a certain set of customers who sometimes will stay at a hotel, sometimes will stay in an Airbnb or a HomeAway home. So anytime you increase supply, you will put pressure on pricing. So we will -- we anticipate pressure on pricing. We do it sometimes during periods in which there's a Super Bowl, let's say, or events happening in cities that used to sell out. We have observed that it sometimes gets harder for hotels to yield up during those events and sometimes, whereas in the past, we would not have inventory for those events, we tend to have inventory for those events. So in some way, you could consider it a positive as it relates to our marketplace. And then finally, anytime you have more supply, you put pressure on pricing, you, as an intermediary, meaning us, want to have access to that supply. And whereas before HomeAway was part of the family, we didn't have significant access to that supply, and our goal was to build out that access to supply on an organic basis, now that HomeAway's part of the family, we have access to that supply, and we will continue to build access to that supply on an organic basis. So we think now that HomeAway's part of the family, the Airbnb effect is going to be a positive factor for us. But it's very early in kind of this evolution. And at this point, other than those spot circumstances when markets are kind of sold out because of big events, we're not seeing it affect our specific trends."

Carefully guarded information, but I'll give you some directional color on it. One is that, obviously, as we have built these big loyalty programs, both at Hotels.com and at Brand Expedia, and certainly, Orbitz has had this benefit as well with their Orbucks program, you do build on your direct business. That's one of the core strategies of having those loyalty programs. So as those programs mature and they are getting big, we do see an increasing amount of our bookings coming direct. So that's the first point I'd make. Secondly, is in our mature markets like the U.S., we do see a significant amount of our business coming to us direct, direct type-in, responding to email, using the app, for example. And in less mature markets where we don't have establishment, the vast majority of traffic actually comes to us from variable channels, and the goal is, over time, and we do this as we enter new markets and as they mature over time, is to acquire these new customers and have them turn into repeat customers and build a business in places like Vietnam and Korea, for example, that look a lot like the U.S. I think Dara had made some comments over the course of the last couple of quarter calls that one of the trends that we have seen is that the growth rates of our direct channels and the growth rates of bookings from our indirect or variable marketing channels were starting to get closer together, and I think that's a trend that we had continued to see, and we're hopeful that's something that can continue over a long period of time as we build these loyalty programs and as our international markets mature."

The following discussion, including responses to your questions, reflects management's views as of today, April 28, 2016 only. We do not undertake any obligation to update or revise this information.
As always, some of the statements made on today's call are forward-looking, typically preceded by words such as we expect, we believe, we anticipate or similar statements. Please refer to today's press release and the company's filings with the SEC for information about factors which could cause our actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements.
You'll find reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures discussed today in our earnings release, which is posted on our IR website at ir.expediainc.com. I encourage you to periodically visit our Investor Relations site for important content, including today's earnings release.
As a reminder, we sold our 62.4% ownership stake in eLong on May 22, 2015, which was previously a consolidated entity of Expedia, Inc. For GAAP accounting purposes, the results of eLong are included in our results through the date of that sale. In order to allow investors to compare our current results on like-for-like basis with our historical results, the commentary in the earnings release and on this call is principally focused on our earnings -- results excluding eLong, which should be considered in addition to the GAAP results on a fully consolidated basis.
Finally, unless otherwise stated, all references to cost of revenue, selling and marketing expense, general and administrative expense, and technology and content expense, also exclude stock-based compensation and depreciation expense. And all comparisons on this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2015.

We're off to a solid start in 2016 with our financial performance coming in a bit better than expected pretty much across the board.

We're off to a solid start in 2016 with our financial performance coming in a bit better than expected pretty much across the board. This was underscored by continued strong momentum in unit growth with global room nights up 37%, air tickets up 52%, carnies up 48% and advertising in media revenue growing 44%. 
Results were strong Q1 across all of our major brands, resulting and organic room night growth of 24% consistent with last quarter despite about a 500 basis point harder comp. Brand Expedia and Hotels.com each saw healthy room night growth across all regions with Hotels.com accelerating in Q1 versus Q4. Expedia Affiliate Network delivered room night growth above 30% for the fourth consecutive quarter, continuing to gain share versus our competition. And Egencia transaction growth accelerated in Q1 compared to Q4, although we saw signs of corporate travel spend tightening in the form of lower average booking values per transaction. 
Going forward through 2016, we expect overall room night growth to moderate due to harder comps in the large numbers, largely offset by decreasing headwinds on revenue per room night. 
The Orbitz integration is going well with Orbitz.com and Cheap Tickets now in the brand Expedia platform. We're particularly please with hotel conversion and room night production on both websites, which are benefiting from the upgraded technology platform, along with the depth and breadth of our hotel inventory. We've completed the move of Hotel Club traffic in customers over the Hotels.com, and we expect the ebookers migration to be complete this summer. 
Integration efforts for Orbitz business and Orbitz Partner Network are on track and will take us through 2016 and beyond in certain cases. Today, we announced some significant changes at HomeAway, as we continue to accelerate the transition of our platform from advertising to transactions. 
In the U.S, we're moving to a single and simple subscription model of $349 annually for listings that are online bookable and $499 for those that aren't. This will allow us to begin to optimize to certain of properties consumer see by matching their unique travel preferences with the right listings, while driving booking volume for owner and manager community. 
With book transaction revenue up 170% year-over-year in the quarter, we took the opportunity to more than double our direct marketing investment in order to drive more traffic to our sites and partners, while also offsetting some weakness of that we're seeing in SEL -- Google SEO volumes for some of our brands. This model changes and marketing increases, along with investments in product and technology talent, will pave the way for an improved strategic and operational footprint in a category that's becoming more and more popular with travelers all around the world. 
We're also seeing encouraging volume trends in the alternative lodging category for Brand Expedia and Hotels.com, which bodes well for future state when we fully interweaves of supply and demand across all product categories within our global bludgeon marketplaces. 
Lastly, trivago is off to a terrific start in 2016. With stand-alone revenue of $176 million, up 48% year-over-year. trivago's core European markets grew revenue of 33% on a euro denominated basis and acceleration from the 20% we saw in 2015. While the top line for the rest of the world grew 69%. The team continues to refine and improve its marketing methods and product in a way that not only benefits advertisers, but should also improved trivago monetization and margins over the long term. Now I'll turn it over to Mark on the financials."

We saw solid execution across the board and also benefited from some timing differences. Easter shifted into the first quarter this year, and we will also differed some marketing spend planned for Q1 into Q2. 
Together, we estimate these factors shifted just over $20 million of adjusted EBITDA into the first quarter from the second quarter. Organic unit growth rates across our core brands were again healthy. And of a consolidated basis, the addition of Orbitz and HomeAway, along with the final quarter of inorganic contribution from the consolidation of the AirAsia Expedia joint venture, boosted total growth rates. 
In total, excluding eLong, adjusted EBITDA was up 31% year-over-year in Q1. Orbitz and HomeAway together contributed 35 percentage points or $44 million of growth. In line with the usual seasonality of our business, adjusted EBITDA for the rest of Expedia, Inc. was down 4% collectively, as our brands put marketing spend to work and incurred other variable costs to drive bookings ahead of the other travel season and for which revenue will be recognized in future quarters. 
The anticipated acceleration and the growth rate of technology and content expense did in fact materialized and was also a factor impacting the bottom line growth rate. 
In terms of product line performance, hotel revenue growth at 25% was driven by room night growth of 37%, partially offset by a decrease in revenue per room night of nearly 9%. Acquisitions added 13 percentage points of room night growth resulting in organic growth consistent with last quarter. The GAAP between an ADR decline of just over 3% and the decrease in revenue per room night was about 540 basis points and consistent with that of the fourth quarter. 
Ongoing reductions to our contracted hotel commission rates around the world, which are aimed at expanding the breadth of our global lodging inventory and the impact of our fast-growing and successful loyalty programs, continue to be the main drivers here. 
We continue to see solid performance in both our air and car products as well. Air revenue grew 54% year-over-year on 52% volume growth. Car revenue was up 39% on 48% growth in car days, partially offset by a 6% decline in revenue per day. Orbitz added about 34 percentage points and 27 percentage points to air and car volume growth, respectively. Added media revenue was up 44% year-over-year in Q1, driven by strong performance at trivago and good growth from our Media Solutions group. 
Orbitz added about 4 percentage points of total added media revenue growth. The overall shape of our P&L this quarter was generally consistent with our ongoing goal of using leverage into the expense categories to fund aggressive selling and marketing investments around the world. As I mentioned earlier, technology and content expense was an exception in Q1, growing quite a bit faster than recent trends on an organic basis. This faster rate of organic growth was driven by trivago, our e-commerce platform group and Brand Expedia, along with increased data center cost. 
Note that we continue to incur additional cost in our core business to support the integration of the Orbitz brands. Additionally, we were pleased to be able to fill a number of open technology roles in the core business with a talented teams from Orbitz as they are rolled off their Orbitz duties. This is a great outcome for the strategic an operational standpoint but did decelerate overall hiring into Q1, which otherwise would have occurred on a more metered basis throughout the year. Note that all of this is within our previously communicated expectations for our 2016 would likely play out, and we expect to see these elevated levels of tech and content expense growth through Q3 with growth in the fourth quarter moderating. 
Against the backdrop of a strong start to the year, I do want to remind you that we continue to strike a balance between delivery and healthy near term profit while also investing to position the business for continued medium and long-term growth. In that regard, when we our performance or wind falls, either from our organic business or from acquisitions, we have a biased to reinvest at least a portion of that back into the business. This is part of the reason that we do not guide to your place undue emphasis on one specific quarter's performance, and in this quarter is no exception. 
Turning to our financials expectations for 2016. We are reiterating the guidance we gave to you on our Q4 call. On a consolidated basis, including all of the businesses we own today and excluding eLong, we continue to expect full year adjusted EBITDA to grow in the range of 35% to 45% year-over-year. Included in that growth, we continue to expect that Orbitz and HomeAway combined will deliver adjusted EBITDA of $275 million to $325 million. 
I would also like to remind you about the relative shape of our year despite the strong Q1, we do expect to the vast majority of our adjusted EBITDA dollar growth will come in the back half of the year. And I would remind folks that certain tailwinds in Q1, such as the Easter shift, will be headwinds for Q2. 
As such, I would encourage you to take a close look at quarterly phasing with our Q1 beat largely unchanged first half guidance and completely unchanged full year guidance in mind. The usual seasonality of the organic business will be amplified by recent acquisitions with integration and transition investments for both Orbitz and HomeAway in the first half of the year expected to make way for synergy realization in the second half. 
Finally, in terms of capital allocation. We are pleased to repurchase 2.9 million shares for $312 million so far this year. We will continue to balance capital allocation between M&A, share repurchases and our dividend. Now let me hand it back to Dara for a few last comments and then we'll take your questions."

Just a few closing comments to frame where we are the bigger picture before moving to Q&A. Over the past several years, we positioned Expedia, Inc. to be the most comprehensive travel distribution platform that the world has ever seen. We've organically built unrivaled geographic reach and awareness for our flagship brands, Expedia and Hotels.com. We've invested billions of dollars in our technology platforms and established Expedia Inc. at the forefront of product and technology innovation in the travel industry, an advantage we'll continue to press for years to come. 
Like many industry disruptors, we've not only invested to creating all that would superior price transparency selection, ease-of-use and value for our travelers, but we've always been systematically reducing the cost of distribution for our travel supply partners. 
Lastly, with the additions of trivago, Travelocity, Orbitz and most recently, HomeAway, we've deployed capital to not only make ourselves strategically complete, but more broadly, to set up the opportunity for significant shareholder value creation over the coming years. 
Our teams are motivated, excited and hungry. And if we do our jobs, that you'll be very happy shareholders. All of us here at Expedia are absolutely up for the challenge and the journey. We hope you are too.

As far as alternative accommodations and the challenges there go, we're trying to actually not think too many big thoughts here. The main activity is behind HomeAway. And the HomeAway team has incredible knowledge of the homeowners and managers and what they need, and it's built up an incredible tool set there. And we want to combine that knowledge with the kind of knowledge that we have on the Hotels.com and Expedia side as far as what travelers want. And when you combine those 2, you can greater pretty powerful platform. We've obviously, done on Expedia and Hotels.com side, so we know what has to happen. And right now, the HomeAway team is heads down and really building up the infrastructure that you need in order to build a global transactional travel platform. 
And it's a bunch of technical work being done, design being -- work being done. But we've done it before. And actually, we have -- the HomeAway opportunity is so attractive that a fair bit of talent from the Expedia teams are -- have moved over to the HomeAway teams to help out one. And also because they features an enormous opportunity. So that is really is just the today execution of the HomeAway front. And then I think, on the hotels and Expedia front, once we get the HomeAway inventory, a higher percentage of the HomeAway inventory online bookable, once we feed it into Hotels.com and Expedia and Orbitz and Travelocity in an integrated manner, all signs point to that inventory producing very well. 
We have been adding some apartment inventory mostly in urban centers, et cetera, on Expedia and Hotels.com, and it is producing, and it's producing very well. And it's clearly kind of an inventory category that our users want. 
As to your search question. We are seeing some of the moves, I'd say, broadly from Google for example, there adding a fourth page search link move a higher proportion of traffic from free to paid. Fortunately, we are a company that has built up some pretty strong capabilities on the paid search side. So we're able to kind of being in the volume anyway. It is probably a net headwind for us on the margin side. But this is a headwind that we've been living with for a number of years. And it's a headwind that we've been able to grow through. And so its nothing new. We've seen this kind of -- we've heard this song before and we're up for the dance."

So you don't see the revenue coming yet. But we're very, very optimistic. Conversion in general has held up very well, actually better than we had planned. Listings growth is actually very healthy and certainly healthy compared to historical trends. And we are taking a very significant portion of our services of revenue and putting it either back to customers. So for example, with the guarantee or we are putting it in marketing money to make sure that we're driving traffic growth on a global basis.

And one of the reasons we feel pretty good about it is it's largely a cost story, which is we've got some pretty modest expectations on the top line and the organic business. Comps are going to get harder there. We're not expect seeing anything herculean. And really, what we're doing over the back part of this year is a couple of things. One is that we are going to see a ramp-up at HomeAway with the traveler fee, and that's just going to build as of the year goes on. We feel good about that. We already see progress. On Orbitz, we are getting that business onto the Expedia platform. We've already got Orbitz and Cheap Tickets on. The rest will come through most of this year with a few laggards. And once we get those businesses on, then we can start to shave off some of the excess cost that we've had in the first part of the year. So that's a cost story. And then, old also just go back and revisit some of the one-timers that we had in Q3. And then also, particularly in Q4, if you recall, we had some very significant purchase accounting impacts from Orbitz. We had some purchase impacts from HomeAway. And then in both cases, pretty significant deal in the integration costs in Q3 and Q4 that just aren't going to repeat themselves. So again, we feel pretty good about. It's a cost story.

And certainly, we saw that with Brussels in the form of higher cancellation rates, certainly, lower bookings into that region. Because we're such a big global business, though, on an overall basis, there is really no meaningful impact from the Brussels attack as far as we can see. And this was very different from paris. When the Paris attacks happen, what we saw was an overall tone of fear that not only hit Paris, but also had a number of other major international centers. We didn't see a similar thing with Brussels. And of course, Brussels as a destination is just significantly smaller than Paris. With respect to trivago, sorry, not as big as Paris, yes. With respect to trivago, the business is just performing really well.

But FX neutral, it did accelerate. And I'll just put it down to just strong execution. The business is doing well. They've been tuning their algorithms and really getting their marketplace tuned to ,atching what's best for the consumer, what's best to monetize for them, and it's working."

This last quarter wasn't any exception. I think that one new factor in Egencia's growth is that it is becoming a very, very credible choice for the largest up companies out there to use. So we've always been very strong in the small and medium business segment. That makes us quite attractive to our supply partners because a lot of, let's say, the big chains and some of the airlines have a hard time reaching into smaller medium businesses. But as Egencia has built out a more robust toolset for CFOs on the cost side, on the care side, you have some very big businesses, such as PNG, using its toolset. The volume goes online. Consumers love it compared to the traditional players out there. and it's a win-win. It's a cost win. It's a consumer win. And just kind of Egencia continues to march along. And you certainly see some of the pressure there. There's been a fair amount of leadership turnover in some of the competition. And Egencia team has been together for many years and they continue to execute on a consistent basis. And I do think that the product roadmap, the technology roadmap that Egencia looks better than it ever has. And I absolutely expect the pace of innovation there to accelerate, if nothing else. As far as the Orbitz for the OPM business or Orbitz for Business. To be clear, Orbitz for Business is going to be a part of Egencia, and we're going to be rolling over Orbitz for Business customers onto the Egencia platform throughout the year. We're off to a very, very good start there. The Orbitz Partner Network business is kind of a private label business. We've got some big clients such as American Express. That group is going to go into our Brand Expedia team and our Dinty Moore Expedia Affiliate Network based on the nature of those relationships. Those integrations take longer because they're quite -- they can be much more complex. And as a result, that integration work is going to go into kind of late this year and in some cases, even into 2017."

It's going to take some significant investments to build out a global transactional infrastructure. Second is marketing, both on the brand marketing side, but also building out a more robust variable marketing platform. Because HomeAway was -- HomeAway revenue was much more based on subscriptions and to some extent, not related to traffic and conversions, HomeAway couldn't bid on variable channels the way that some of our other brands can, more traffic means and higher conversions means, more transactions means you can bid more on variable channels. HomeAway didn't have the that factor. And any time you bid up onto variable channels, typically, your margins initially hard lower and then you optimize to get to a higher return place. So certainly, product. Certainly, marketing. We are going to reinvest the fair amount of the fees also to the consumer experience to make sure that they've got a great experience, to make sure that they get the home that they expect. So I'd say those are the 3 big factors. Another factor to be aware of, and it's the announcement that we made today, is that on a go-forward basis, we are going to simplify the subscription product, which is going to take away some of the premium tiers that we had sold previously. And that's going to be a revenue negative, which we do believe is going to be offset by transactional revenue. But we are taking some revenue out of the system, which then we have to replace through transactions."

One, just directly through bookings and also remember that they also gain audience share because they're higher up and the store order and they're often, consumers are kind of clicking from our results and going and checking out the hotel direct. So I think the players who are giving is the best inventory are getting both booking share and audience share within our marketplace.

And what's very, very clear as it relates to our travelers is that, they want and like online booking. So the subscription price for one of our partners, who is providing online bookings, is significantly lower than someone who is not online bookable, so to speak. And we think that kind of provides the right incentives in order to create a healthy marketplace that works for both sides. From a philosophical standpoint, we do want to build out toolsets that allow our supply partners, and this is at Expedia or Hotels.com or HomeAway, to have a very low entry base price. And then to be able to pay when they need the demand or when they want the demand. It's a very flexible model. It's easy to get into the marketplace. And then if you want to optimize to the marketplace, you can absolutely optimize to it. And those are tools that we built on Expedia and Hotels.com side and those are tools that we anticipate building out with HomeAway as well. And HomeAway being part of our family definitely gives us an advantage there because we've done it before. On the SEO side, I don't want to get into too many specifics. There are some SEO effects of that our structural such as, in general, some of the search results being moved down the page or the free search results being moved down a page. Some of the SEO results are results that we can optimize around and we can kind of built technology around. So I would say that the HomeAway team is definitely not standing still and we're hoping to improve the SEO trends.

I would say that the approach for trivago has been one in which it's not about keeping the consumer on the site, it's about optimizing the consumer experience based on however the consumer wants to book. If the consumer wants to stay on trivago, they can. If they want to go to a partner site, if they want to go to Booking.com or if they want to go to Hotels.com or Expedia, they can.

And listen, it was true that professional PMs an individual owners were buying different tiers of subscriptions, et cetera, and they were figuring out ways to play that marketplace. So I think that the rules of the marketplace are changing. They will be a bit more favorable to travelers and traveler preferences. So the owners who are updating their calendars, the owners who have great reviews, the owners who have terrific pictures and who put our pricing and our online bookable will tend to get more share in our marketplace. And we'll make sure that we're making tools available for individual owners to do it. We'll make sure we've got FAQs. We make sure that we're in contact with them.

We have been working with a number of our partners, chains, original chains, et cetera, to work on more flexible ways in which we can work with them. We're testing link-offs from our site onto the direct sight of some of our at direct partners. We are willing to test promotions, where we are -- where we will try to sign up loyalty members for them. Listen, we are very big new customer acquisition channel for our partners, and we want to help our partners, gain new customers. And we certainly want to arm of them that the whatever they need in order to bring in that customer, give them an incredible service and then, hopefully, get a customer for life because we don't think that one goes against the other necessarily. You've got services like TripAdvisor and trivago, who are linking off for a living and are growing incredibly well. And we are much more willing to be very flexible and in our business models.

Please refer to today's press release and the company's filings with the SEC for information about factors which could cause our actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements.
You'll find reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures discussed today in our earnings release, which is posted on our IR website at ir.expediainc.com. I encourage you to periodically visit our Investor Relations site for important content, including today's earnings release.
As a reminder, we sold our 62.4% ownership stake in eLong on May 22, 2015, which was previously a consolidated entity of Expedia, Inc. For GAAP accounting purposes, the results of eLong are included in our results through the date of that sale. In order to allow investors to compare our current results on a like-for-like basis with our historical results, the commentary in the earnings release and on this call is principally focused on our earnings -- our results excluding eLong, which should be considered in addition to the GAAP results on a fully consolidated basis.
Finally, unless otherwise stated, all references to cost of revenue, selling and marketing expense, general and administrative expense, and technology and content expense, also exclude stock-based compensation and depreciation expense. And all comparisons on this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2015.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Dara."

We're off to a solid start in 2016 with our financial performance coming in a bit better than expected pretty much across the board. This was underscored by continued strong momentum in unit growth with global room nights up 37%, air tickets",590,"Thanks, Alan. We're off to a solid start in 2016 with our financial performance coming in a bit better than expected pretty much across the board. This was underscored by continued strong momentum in unit growth with global room nights up 37%, air tickets up 52%, car days up 48% and advertising and media revenue growing 44%. 
Results were strong in Q1 across all of our major brands resulting in organic room night growth of 24%, consistent with last quarter despite about a 500 basis point harder comp. Brand Expedia and Hotels.com each saw healthy room night growth across all regions, with Hotels.com accelerating in Q1 versus Q4. Expedia Affiliate Network delivered room night growth above 30% for the fourth consecutive quarter, continuing to gain share versus our competition. And Egencia transaction growth accelerated in Q1 compared to Q4, although we saw signs of corporate travel spend tightening in the form of lower average booking values per transaction. 
Going forward through 2016, we expect overall room night growth to moderate due to harder comps in the large numbers, largely offset by decreasing headwinds on the revenue per room night. 
The Orbitz integration is going well, with Orbitz.com and CheapTickets now in the Brand Expedia platform. We're particularly pleased with hotel conversion and room night production on both websites, which are benefiting from the upgraded technology platform along with the depth and breadth of our hotel inventory. We've completed the move of Hotel Club traffic and customers over to Hotels.com, and we expect the ebookers migration to be complete this summer. 
Integration efforts for Orbitz for Business and Orbitz Partner Network are on track and will take us through 2016 and beyond in certain cases. Today, we announced some significant changes at HomeAway, as we continue to accelerate the transition of our platform from advertising to transactions. 
In the U.S., we're moving to a single and simple subscription model of $349 annually for listings that are online bookable and $499 for those that aren't. This will allow us to begin to optimize assort and the properties consumer see by matching their unique travel preferences with the right listings, while driving booking volume for owner and manager community. 
With book transactional revenue up 170% year-over-year in the quarter, we took the opportunity to more than double our direct marketing investment in order to drive more traffic to our sites and partners, while also offsetting some weakness that we're seeing in SEO -- Google SEO volumes for some of our brands. These model changes and marketing increases, along with investments in product and technology talent, will pave the way for an improved strategic and operational footprint in a category that's becoming more and more popular with travelers all around the world. 
We're also seeing encouraging volume trends in the alternative lodging category for Brand Expedia and Hotels.com, which bodes well for future a state when we fully interweave supply and demand across all product categories within our global lodging marketplaces. 
Lastly, trivago is off to a terrific start in 2016. With stand-alone revenue of $176 million, up 48% year-over-year. trivago's core European markets grew revenue 33% on a euro-denominated basis and acceleration from the 20% we saw in 2015, while the top line for the rest of the world grew 69%. The team continues to refine and improve its marketing methods and products in a way that not only benefits advertisers, but should also improve trivago monetization and margins over the long term. Now I'll turn it over to Mark on the financials."
25915843,325290149,966823,"Expedia Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2016",2016-04-28,"Earnings Calls","Expedia Group, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Dara. We were pleased with the results of this quarter that were a bit better than we expected. We saw solid execution across the board and also benefited from some timing differences.

We saw solid execution across the board and also benefited from some timing differences. Easter shifted into the first quarter this year, and we also differed some marketing spend planned for Q1 into Q2. 
Together, we estimate these factors shifted just over $20 million of adjusted EBITDA into the first quarter from the second quarter. Organic unit growth rates across our core brands were again healthy. And on a consolidated basis, the addition of Orbitz and HomeAway, along with the final quarter of inorganic contribution from the consolidation of the AirAsia Expedia joint venture, boosted total growth rates. 
In total, excluding eLong, adjusted EBITDA was up 31% year-over-year in Q1. Orbitz and HomeAway together contributed 35 percentage points or $44 million of growth. In line with the usual seasonality of our business, adjusted EBITDA for the rest of Expedia, Inc. was down 4% collectively, as our brands put marketing spend to work and incurred other variable costs to drive bookings ahead of the heavy travel season and for which revenue will be recognized in future quarters. 
The anticipated acceleration and the growth rate of technology and content expense did in fact materialize and was also a factor impacting the bottom line growth rate. 
In terms of product line performance, hotel revenue growth of 25% was driven by room night growth of 37%, partially offset by a decrease in revenue per room night of nearly 9%. Acquisitions added 13 percentage points of room night growth resulting in organic growth consistent with last quarter. The GAAP between an ADR decline of just over 3% and the decrease in revenue per room night was about 540 basis points and consistent with that of the fourth quarter. 
Ongoing reductions to our contracted hotel commission rates around the world, which are aimed at expanding the breadth of our global lodging inventory and the impact of our fast-growing and successful loyalty programs, continue to be the main drivers here. 
We continue to see solid performance in both our air and car products as well. Air revenue grew 54% year-over-year on 52% volume growth. Car revenue was up 39% and 48% growth in car days, partially offset by a 6% decline in revenue per day. Orbitz added about 34 percentage points and 27 percentage points to air and car volume growth, respectively. Ad and media revenue was up 44% year-over-year in Q1, driven by strong performance at trivago and good growth from our Media Solutions group. 
Orbitz added about 4 percentage points of total ad and media revenue growth. The overall shape of our P&L this quarter was generally consistent with our ongoing goal of using leverage in key expense categories to fund aggressive selling and marketing investments around the world. As I mentioned earlier, technology and content expense was an exception in Q1, growing quite a bit faster than recent trends on an organic basis. This faster rate of organic growth was driven by trivago, our e-commerce platform group and Brand Expedia along with increased data center costs. 
Note that we continue to incur additional costs in our core business to support the integration of the Orbitz brands. Additionally, we were pleased to be able to fill a number of open technology roles in the core business with talented teams from Orbitz as they rolled off their Orbitz duties. This is a great outcome from a strategic and operational standpoint but did decelerate overall hiring into Q1, which otherwise would have occurred on a more metered basis throughout the year. Note that all of this is within our previously communicated expectations for our 2016 would likely play out. And we expect to see these elevated levels of tech and content expense growth through Q3, with growth in the fourth quarter moderating. 
Against the backdrop of a strong start to the year, I do want to remind you that we continue to strike a balance between delivering healthy near-term profit, while also investing to position the business for continued medium and long-term growth. In that regard, when we see our performance or windfalls, either from our organic business or from acquisitions, we have a bias to reinvest at least a portion of that back into the business. This is part of the reason that we do not guide to or place undue emphasis on 1 specific quarter's performance. And this quarter is no exception. 
Turning to our financial expectations for 2016. We are reiterating the guidance we gave to you on our Q4 call. On a consolidated basis, including all of the businesses we own today and excluding eLong, we continue to expect full year adjusted EBITDA to grow in the range of 35% to 45% year-over-year. Included in that growth, we continue to expect that Orbitz and HomeAway combined will deliver adjusted EBITDA of $275 million to $325 million. 
I would also like to remind you about the relative shape of our year. Despite a strong Q1, we do expect the vast majority of our adjusted EBITDA dollar growth will come in the back half of the year. And I would remind folks that certain tailwinds in Q1, such as the Easter shift, will be headwinds for Q2. 
As such, I would encourage you to take a close look at quarterly phasing with our Q1 beat largely unchanged first half guidance and completely unchanged full year guidance in mind. The usual seasonality of the organic business will be amplified by recent acquisitions, with integration and transition investments for both Orbitz and HomeAway in the first half of the year expected to make way for synergy realization in the second half. 
Finally, in terms of capital allocation, we are pleased to repurchase 2.9 million shares for $312 million so far this year. We will continue to balance capital allocation between M&A, share repurchases and our dividend. Now let me hand it back to Dara for a few last comments, and then we'll take your questions."

Just a few closing comments to frame where we are in the bigger picture before moving to Q&A. Over the past several years, we positioned Expedia, Inc. to be the most comprehensive travel distribution platform that the world has ever seen. We've organically built unrivaled geographic reach and awareness for our flagship brands, Expedia and Hotels.com. We've invested billions of dollars in our technology platforms and established Expedia Inc. at the forefront of products and technology innovation in the travel industry, an advantage we'll continue to press for years to come. 
Like many industry disruptors, we've not only invested to creating all frame with superior price transparency selection, ease-of-use and value for our travelers, but we've always been systematically reducing the cost of distribution for our travel supply partners. 
Lastly, with additions of trivago, Travelocity, Orbitz and most recently HomeAway, we've deployed capital to not only make ourselves strategically complete, but more importantly, to set up the opportunity for significant shareholder value creation over the coming years. 
Our teams are motivated, excited and hungry. And if we do our jobs, I think you'll be very happy shareholders. All of us here at Expedia are absolutely up for the challenge and the journey. We hope you are too. 
With that, let's move to Q&A. Operator, will you remind participants how to queue up?"

And secondly, you made this comment about kind of moving away from organic search. Is that a reasonable way to think about how you're thinking about marketing in the future? It seems like what Google has done is kind of force people away from it and probably place some of your competencies, but just talk about the balance of organic versus paid search of your business going forward."

As far as alternative accommodations and the challenges there go, we're trying to actually not think too many big thoughts here. The main activity is behind HomeAway. And the HomeAway team has incredible knowledge of the homeowners and managers and what they need, and it's built up an incredible tool set there. And we want to combine that knowledge with the kind of knowledge that we have on the Hotels.com and Expedia side as far as what travelers want. And when you combine those 2, you can create a pretty powerful platform. We've obviously done on Expedia and Hotels.com side. So we know what has to happen. And right now, the HomeAway team is heads down and really building up the infrastructure that you need in order to build a global transactional travel platform. 
And it's a bunch of technical work being done, design being -- work being done. But we've done it before. And actually, we have -- the HomeAway opportunity is so attractive that a fair bit of talent from the Expedia teams are -- have moved over to the HomeAway teams to help out one and also because they features an enormous opportunity. So that is really is just day-to-day execution on the HomeAway front. And I think on the hotels and Expedia front, once we get the HomeAway inventory, a higher percentage of the HomeAway inventory online bookable, once we feed it into Hotels.com and Expedia and Orbitz and Travelocity in an integrated manner, all signs point to that inventory producing very well. 
We have been adding some apartment inventory, mostly in urban centers, et cetera, on Expedia and Hotels.com, and it is producing and is producing very well. And it's clearly kind of an inventory category that our users want. 
As to your search question. We are seeing some of the moves, I'd say, broadly from Google, for example, they're adding a fourth paid search link move a higher proportion of traffic from free to paid. Fortunately, we are a company that has built up some pretty strong capabilities on the paid search side. So we're able to kind of bring in the volume anyway. It is probably a net headwind for us on the margin side. But this is a headwind that we've been living with for a number of years. And it's a headwind that we've been able to grow through. And so it's nothing new. We've seen this kind of -- we've heard this song before and we're up for the dance."

Listen, the results that we've seen, the early results of the booking fee, as you know, we launched a booking fee a bit earlier than we had anticipated. The early results have been excellent and transactional booking growth is up very big, 170%. And that will be revenue that we've recognized kind of down the pike in Q2, Q3 based on stays. So you don't see that revenue coming yet. But we're very, very optimistic. Conversion in general has held up very well, actually better than we have planned. Listings growth is actually very healthy and certainly healthy compared to historical trends. And we are taking a very significant portion of our services revenue and putting it either back to customers. So for example, with a guarantee or we are putting it in marketing money to make sure that we're driving traffic growth on a global basis. So I'd say, at this point, while there's certainly going to be some questions for homeowners and the community, et cetera, I think the HomeAway team is executing very, very well in the plan.

So we feel pretty good about it. And one of the reasons we feel pretty good about it is it's largely a cost story, which is we've got some pretty modest expectations on the top line in the organic business. Comps are going to get harder there. We're not expecting anything herculean. And really what we're doing over the back part of this year is a couple of things. One is that we are going to see a ramp-up at HomeAway with the traveler fee and that's just going to build as the year goes on. We feel good about that. We already see progress. On Orbitz, we are getting that business onto the Expedia platform. We've already got Orbitz and CheapTickets on. The rest will come through most of this year with a few laggards. And once we get those businesses on, then we can start to shave off some of the excess cost that we've had in the first part of the year. So that's a cost story. And then, I would also just go back and revisit some of the one timers that we had in Q3. And then also, particularly in Q4, if you recall, we had some very significant purchase accounting impacts from Orbitz. We had some purchase impacts from HomeAway. And then in both cases, pretty significant deal in the integration costs in Q3 and Q4 that just aren't going to repeat themselves. So again, we feel pretty good about it. It's a cost story.

And certainly, we saw that with Brussels in the form of higher cancellation rates, certainly lower bookings into that region. Because we're such a big global business though on an overall basis, there was really no meaningful impact from the Brussels attack as far as we can see. And this is very different from Paris. When the Paris attack happened, what we saw was a overall tone of fear that not only hit Paris, but also hit a number of other major international centers. We didn't see a similar thing with Brussels. And of course, Brussels as a destination is just significantly smaller than Paris. With respect to trivago -- sorry, not as big as Paris. Yes. With respect to trivago, the business is just performing really well. One of the things to keep in mind when you're looking at the reported results is that foreign exchange is a big impact from trivago -- on trivago. That eased significantly this quarter. But FX neutral, it did accelerate. And I'll just put it down to just strong execution. The business is doing well. They've been tuning their algorithms and really getting their marketplace tuned to matching what's best for the consumer with what's best to monetize for them, and it's working."

This last quarter wasn't any exception. I think that 1 new factor in Egencia's growth is that it is becoming a very, very credible choice for the largest companies out there to use. So we've always been very strong in the small and medium business segment. That makes us quite attractive to our supply partners because a lot of, let's say, the big chains and some of the airlines have a hard time reaching into small and medium businesses. But as Egencia has built out a more robust toolset for CFOs on the cost side, on the care side, you'll have some very big businesses, such as P&G using its toolset. The volume goes online. Consumers love it compared to the traditional players out there. And it's a win-win. It's a cost win. It's a consumer win. And just kind of Egencia continues to march along. And you certainly see some of the pressure there. There's been a fair amount of leadership turnover in some of the competition. And Egencia team has been together for many years and they continue to execute on a consistent basis. And I do think that the product road map, the technology road map at Egencia looks better than it ever has. And I absolutely expect the pace of innovation there to accelerate, if nothing else. As far as the Orbitz for the OPN business or Orbitz for Business to be clear. Orbitz for Business is going to be a part of Egencia, and we're going to be rolling over Orbitz for Business customers onto the Egencia platform throughout the year. We're off to a very, very good start there. The Orbitz Partner Network business is kind of a private label business. We've got some big clients such as American Express.

It's going to take some significant investments to build out a global transactional infrastructure. Second is marketing, both on the brand marketing side, but also building out a more robust variable marketing platform. Because HomeAway was -- HomeAway revenue was much more based on subscriptions and to some extent, not related to traffic and conversions. HomeAway couldn't bid on variable channels the way that some of our other brands can. More traffic means and our conversion means, more transactions means, you can bid more on variable channels. HomeAway didn't have the that factor. And any time you bid up into variable channels, typically your margins initially are lower and then you optimize to get to a higher return place. So certainly product, certainly marketing. We are going to reinvest fair amount of the fees also to the consumer experience to make sure that they've got a great experience, to make sure that they get the home that they expect. So I'd say those are the 3 big factors. Another factor to be aware of and it's an announcement that we made today is that on a go-forward basis, we are going to simplify the subscription product, which is going to take away some of the premium tiers that we had sold previously. And that's going to be a revenue negative, which we do believe is going to be offset by transactional revenue. But we are taking some revenue out of the system, which then we have to replace through transactions."

Listen, I think it makes sense for any player out there, whether in the e-commerce sector or in the travel sector, to make sure that you have a balanced source of traffic and revenue. It is very early at this point, but we're not seeing any significant effect on our volumes. What we are seeing is that the hoteliers who provide us with the best pricing, with the best inventory, are gaining share on a relative basis in the marketplace. And they gain share 2 ways. One, just directly through bookings and also remember that they also gain audience share because they're higher up in the sort order and very often consumers are kind of clicking from our results and going and checking out the hotel direct. So I think the players who are giving us the best inventory are gaining both booking share and audience share within our marketplace. Our marketplace has been a marketplace that has been growing within the overall travel market. We have been gaining share for many years. I don't see that changing and the volume trends at this point don't suggest that that's changing. So listen, every player's going to make their own decision. And I think that the supply partners, who play well with us, who really provide a terrific experience for our customers over a long period of time, are going to gain share on our marketplace.

As far as HomeAway and the philosophy there goes is, listen, we want to create a marketplace that is flexible, but also provides right incentives. And what's very, very clear as it relates to travelers is that, they want and like online booking. So the subscription price for one of our partners, who is providing online bookings, is significantly lower than someone who is not online bookable, so to speak. And we think that kind of provides right incentives in order to create a healthy marketplace that works for both sides. From a philosophical standpoint, we do want to build out toolsets that allow our supply partners, and this is at Expedia or Hotels.com or HomeAway, to have a very low entry base price. And then, to be able to pay, when they need a bit demand or when they want the demand. It's a very flexible model. It's easy to get into the marketplace. And then, if you want to optimize to the marketplace, you can absolutely optimize to it. And those are tools that we built on Expedia and Hotels.com side and those are tools that we anticipate building out with HomeAway as well. And HomeAway being part of our family definitely gives us an advantage there because we've done it before. On the SEO side, I don't want to get into too many specifics. There are some SEO effects that are structural such as, in general, some of the search results being moved down the page or the free search results being moved down the page. Some of the SEO results are results that we can optimize around and we can kind of build technology around. So I would say that the HomeAway team is definitely not standing still, and we're hoping to improve the SEO trends. In the meantime, though, our direct traffic trends are super, super strong and the team is more than making up for it."

We -- based on the test, we expected to expand. I would say that the approach for trivago has been one in which it's not about keeping the consumer on the site, it's about optimizing the consumer experience based on however the consumer wants to book. If the consumer wants to stay on trivago, they can. If they want to go to a partner site, if they want to go to Booking.com or if they want to go to Hotels.com or Expedia, they can.

Again, all of this excluding Orbitz. I'd say I wouldn't expect a big trend there. We're hopeful that it will stabilize over time.

As always, some of the statements made on today's call are forward-looking, typically preceded by words such as we expect, we believe, we anticipate or similar statements. Please refer to today's press release and the company's filings with the SEC for information about factors which could cause our actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements.
You'll find reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures discussed today in our earnings release, which is posted on our IR website at ir.expediainc.com. I encourage you to periodically visit our Investor Relations site for important content, including today's earnings release.
As a reminder, we sold our 62.4% ownership stake in eLong on May 22, 2015, which was previously a consolidated entity of Expedia, Inc. For GAAP accounting purposes, the results of eLong are included in our results through the date of that sale. In order to allow investors to compare our current results on a like-for-like basis with our historical results, the commentary in the earnings release and on this call is principally focused on our earnings -- our results excluding eLong, which should be considered in addition to the GAAP results on a fully consolidated basis.
Finally, unless otherwise stated, all references to cost of revenue, selling and marketing expense, general and administrative expense, and technology and content expense, also exclude stock-based compensation and depreciation expense. And all comparisons on this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2015.

We're off to a solid start in 2016 with our financial performance coming in a bit better than expected pretty much across the board.

We're off to a solid start in 2016 with our financial performance coming in a bit better than expected pretty much across the board. This was underscored by continued strong momentum in unit growth with global room nights up 37%, air tickets up 52%, car days up 48% and advertising and media revenue growing 44%. 
Results were strong in Q1 across all of our major brands resulting in organic room night growth of 24%, consistent with last quarter despite about a 500 basis point harder comp. Brand Expedia and Hotels.com each saw healthy room night growth across all regions, with Hotels.com accelerating in Q1 versus Q4. Expedia Affiliate Network delivered room night growth above 30% for the fourth consecutive quarter, continuing to gain share versus our competition. And Egencia transaction growth accelerated in Q1 compared to Q4, although we saw signs of corporate travel spend tightening in the form of lower average booking values per transaction. 
Going forward through 2016, we expect overall room night growth to moderate due to harder comps and the large numbers, largely offset by decreasing headwinds on the revenue per room night. 
The Orbitz integration is going well, with Orbitz.com and CheapTickets now in the Brand Expedia platform. We're particularly pleased with hotel conversion and room night production on both websites, which are benefiting from the upgraded technology platform along with the depth and breadth of our hotel inventory. We've completed the move of Hotel Club traffic and customers over to Hotels.com, and we expect the ebookers migration to be complete this summer. 
Integration efforts for Orbitz for Business and Orbitz Partner Network are on track and will take us through 2016 and beyond in certain cases. Today, we announced some significant changes at HomeAway, as we continue to accelerate the transition of our platform from advertising to transactions. 
In the U.S., we're moving to a single and simple subscription model of $349 annually for listings that are online bookable and $499 for those that aren't. This will allow us to begin to optimize assort and the properties consumer see by matching their unique travel preferences with the right listings, while driving booking volume for owner and manager community. 
With book transactional revenue up 170% year-over-year in the quarter, we took the opportunity to more than double our direct marketing investment in order to drive more traffic to our sites and partners, while also offsetting some weakness that we're seeing in SEO -- Google SEO volumes for some of our brands. These model changes and marketing increases, along with investments in product and technology talent, will pave the way for an improved strategic and operational footprint in a category that's becoming more and more popular with travelers all around the world. 
We're also seeing encouraging volume trends in the alternative lodging category for Brand Expedia and Hotels.com, which bodes well for future estate [ph] when we fully interweave supply and demand across all product categories within our global lodging marketplaces. 
Lastly, trivago is off to a terrific start in 2016. With stand-alone revenue of $176 million, up 48% year-over-year. trivago's core European markets grew revenue 33% on a euro-denominated basis and acceleration from the 20% we saw in 2015, while the top line for the rest of the world grew 69%. The team continues to refine and improve its marketing methods and products in a way that not only benefits advertisers, but should also improve trivago monetization and margins over the long term. Now I'll turn it over to Mark on the financials."

We saw solid execution across the board and also benefited from some timing differences. Easter shifted into the first quarter this year, and we also differed some marketing spend planned for Q1 into Q2. 
Together, we estimate these factors shifted just over $20 million of adjusted EBITDA into the first quarter from the second quarter. Organic unit growth rates across our core brands were again healthy. And on a consolidated basis, the addition of Orbitz and HomeAway, along with the final quarter of inorganic contribution from the consolidation of the AirAsia Expedia joint venture, boosted total growth rates. 
In total, excluding eLong, adjusted EBITDA was up 31% year-over-year in Q1. Orbitz and HomeAway together contributed 35 percentage points or $44 million of growth. In line with the usual seasonality of our business, adjusted EBITDA for the rest of Expedia, Inc. was down 4% collectively, as our brands put marketing spend to work and incurred other variable costs to drive bookings ahead of the heavy travel season and for which revenue will be recognized in future quarters. 
The anticipated acceleration and the growth rate of technology and content expense did in fact materialize and was also a factor impacting the bottom line growth rate. 
In terms of product line performance, hotel revenue growth of 25% was driven by room night growth of 37%, partially offset by a decrease in revenue per room night of nearly 9%. Acquisitions added 13 percentage points of room night growth resulting in organic growth consistent with last quarter. The GAAP between an ADR decline of just over 3% and the decrease in revenue per room night was about 540 basis points and consistent with that of the fourth quarter. 
Ongoing reductions to our contracted hotel commission rates around the world, which are aimed at expanding the breadth of our global lodging inventory and the impact of our fast-growing and successful loyalty programs, continue to be the main drivers here. 
We continue to see solid performance in both our air and car products as well. Air revenue grew 54% year-over-year on 52% volume growth. Car revenue was up 39% and 48% growth in car days, partially offset by a 6% decline in revenue per day. Orbitz added about 34 percentage points and 27 percentage points to air and car volume growth, respectively. Ad and media revenue was up 44% year-over-year in Q1, driven by strong performance at trivago and good growth from our Media Solutions group. 
Orbitz added about 4 percentage points of total ad and media revenue growth. The overall shape of our P&L this quarter was generally consistent with our ongoing goal of using leverage in key expense categories to fund aggressive selling and marketing investments around the world. As I mentioned earlier, technology and content expense was an exception in Q1, growing quite a bit faster than recent trends on an organic basis. This faster rate of organic growth was driven by trivago, our e-commerce platform group and Brand Expedia along with increased data center costs. 
Note that we continue to incur additional costs in our core business to support the integration of the Orbitz brands. Additionally, we were pleased to be able to fill a number of open technology roles in the core business with talented teams from Orbitz as they rolled off their Orbitz duties. This is a great outcome from a strategic and operational standpoint but did accelerate overall hiring into Q1, which otherwise would have occurred on a more metered basis throughout the year. Note that all of this is within our previously communicated expectations for how 2016 would likely play out. And we expect to see these elevated levels of tech and content expense growth through Q3, with growth in the fourth quarter moderating. 
Against the backdrop of a strong start to the year, I do want to remind you that we continue to strike a balance between delivering healthy near-term profit, while also investing to position the business for continued medium and long-term growth. In that regard, when we see our performance or windfalls, either from our organic business or from acquisitions, we have a bias to reinvest at least a portion of that back into the business. This is part of the reason that we do not guide to or place undue emphasis on 1 specific quarter's performance. And this quarter is no exception. 
Turning to our financial expectations for 2016. We are reiterating the guidance we gave to you on our Q4 call. On a consolidated basis, including all of the businesses we own today and excluding eLong, we continue to expect full year adjusted EBITDA to grow in the range of 35% to 45% year-over-year. Included in that growth, we continue to expect that Orbitz and HomeAway combined will deliver adjusted EBITDA of $275 million to $325 million. 
I would also like to remind you about the relative shape of our year. Despite a strong Q1, we do expect the vast majority of our adjusted EBITDA dollar growth will come in the back half of the year. And I would remind folks that certain tailwinds in Q1, such as the Easter shift, will be headwinds for Q2. 
As such, I would encourage you to take a close look at quarterly phasing with our Q1 beat largely unchanged first half guidance and completely unchanged full year guidance in mind. The usual seasonality of the organic business will be amplified by recent acquisitions, with integration and transition investments for both Orbitz and HomeAway in the first half of the year expected to make way for synergy realization in the second half. 
Finally, in terms of capital allocation, we are pleased to repurchase 2.9 million shares for $312 million so far this year. We will continue to balance capital allocation between M&A, share repurchases and our dividend. Now let me hand it back to Dara for a few last comments, and then we'll take your questions."

Just a few closing comments to frame where we are in the bigger picture before moving to Q&A. Over the past several years, we positioned Expedia, Inc. to be the most comprehensive travel distribution platform that the world has ever seen. We've organically built unrivaled geographic reach and awareness for our flagship brands, Expedia and Hotels.com. We've invested billions of dollars in our technology platforms and established Expedia Inc. at the forefront of products and technology innovation in the travel industry, an advantage we'll continue to press for years to come. 
Like many industry disruptors, we've not only invested to create an offering with superior price transparency selection, ease-of-use and value for our travelers, but we've always been systematically reducing the cost of distribution for our travel supply partners. 
Lastly, with additions of trivago, Travelocity, Orbitz and most recently HomeAway, we've deployed capital to not only make ourselves strategically complete, but more importantly, to set up the opportunity for significant shareholder value creation over the coming years. 
Our teams are motivated, excited and hungry. And if we do our jobs, I think you'll be very happy shareholders. All of us here at Expedia are absolutely up for the challenge and the journey. We hope you are too. 
With that, let's move to Q&A. Operator, will you remind participants how to queue up?"

As far as alternative accommodations and the challenges there go, we're trying to actually not think too many big thoughts here. The main activity is behind HomeAway. And the HomeAway team has incredible knowledge of the homeowners and managers and what they need, and it's built up an incredible tool set there. And we want to combine that knowledge with the kind of knowledge that we have on the Hotels.com and Expedia side as far as what travelers want. And when you combine those 2, you can create a pretty powerful platform. We've obviously done on it Expedia and Hotels.com side. So we know what has to happen. And right now, the HomeAway team is heads down and really building up the infrastructure that you need in order to build a global transactional travel platform. 
And it's a bunch of technical work being done, design being -- work being done. But we've done it before. And actually, we have -- the HomeAway opportunity is so attractive that a fair bit of talent from the Expedia teams are -- have moved over to the HomeAway teams to help out one and also because they see just an enormous opportunity. So that is really is just day-to-day execution on the HomeAway front. And I think on the Hotels and Expedia front, once we get the HomeAway inventory, a higher percentage of the HomeAway inventory online bookable, once we feed it into Hotels.com and Expedia and Orbitz and Travelocity in an integrated manner, all signs point to that inventory producing very well. 
We have been adding some apartment inventory, mostly in urban centers, et cetera, on Expedia and Hotels.com, and it is producing and it's producing very well. And it's clearly kind of an inventory category that our users want. 
As to your search question. We are seeing some of the moves, I'd say, broadly from Google, for example, they're adding a fourth paid search link, move a higher proportion of traffic from free to paid. Fortunately, we are a company that has built up some pretty strong capabilities on the paid search side. So we're able to kind of bring in the volume anyway. It is probably a net headwind for us on the margin side. But this is a headwind that we've been living with for a number of years. And it's a headwind that we've been able to grow through. And so it's nothing new. We've seen this kind of -- we've heard this song before and we're up for the dance."

So you don't see that revenue coming yet. But we're very, very optimistic. Conversion in general has held up very well, actually better than we have planned. Listings growth is actually very healthy and certainly healthy compared to historical trends. And we are taking a very significant portion of our services revenue and putting it either back to customers. So for example, with a guarantee or we are putting it in marketing money to make sure that we're driving traffic growth on a global basis.

And one of the reasons we feel pretty good about it is it's largely a cost story, which is we've got some pretty modest expectations on the top line in the organic business. Comps are going to get harder there. We're not expecting anything herculean. And really what we're doing over the back part of this year is a couple of things. One is that we are going to see a ramp-up at HomeAway with the traveler fee and that's just going to build as the year goes on. We feel good about that. We already see progress. On Orbitz, we are getting that business onto the Expedia platform. We've already got Orbitz and CheapTickets on. The rest will come through most of this year with a few laggards. And once we get those businesses on, then we can start to shave off some of the excess cost that we've had in the first part of the year. So that's a cost story. And then, I would also just go back and revisit some of the one timers that we had in Q3. And then also, particularly in Q4, if you recall, we had some very significant purchase accounting impacts from Orbitz. We had some purchase impacts from HomeAway. And then in both cases, pretty significant deal and integration costs in Q3 and Q4 that just aren't going to repeat themselves. So again, we feel pretty good about it. It's a cost story.

And certainly, we saw that with Brussels in the form of higher cancellation rates, certainly lower bookings into that region. Because we're such a big global business though on an overall basis, there was really no meaningful impact from the Brussels attack as far as we can see. And this is very different from Paris. When the Paris attack happened, what we saw was a overall tone of fear that not only hit Paris, but also hit a number of other major international centers. We didn't see a similar thing with Brussels. And of course, Brussels as a destination is just significantly smaller than Paris. With respect to trivago -- sorry, not as big as Paris. Yes. With respect to trivago, the business is just performing really well. One of the things to keep in mind when you're looking at the reported results is that foreign exchange is a big impact from trivago -- on trivago. That eased significantly this quarter. But FX neutral, it did accelerate. And I'll just put it down to just strong execution. The business is doing well. They've been tuning their algorithms and really getting their marketplace tuned to matching what's best for the consumer with what's best to monetize for them, and it's working."

This last quarter wasn't any exception. I think that 1 new factor in Egencia's growth is that it is becoming a very, very credible choice for the largest companies out there to use. So we've always been very strong in the small and medium business segment. That makes us quite attractive to our supply partners because a lot of, let's say, the big chains and some of the airlines have a hard time reaching into small and medium businesses. But as Egencia has built out a more robust toolset for CFOs on the cost side, on the care side, you'll have some very big businesses, such as P&G using its toolset. The volume goes online. Consumers love it compared to the traditional players out there. And it's a win-win. It's a cost win. It's a consumer win. And just kind of Egencia continues to march along. And you certainly see some of the pressure there. There's been a fair amount of leadership turnover in some of the competition. And the Egencia team has been together for many years and they continue to execute on a consistent basis. And I do think that the product road map, the technology road map at Egencia looks better than it ever has. And I absolutely expect the pace of innovation there to accelerate, if nothing else. As far as the Orbitz for the OPN business or Orbitz for Business to be clear. Orbitz for Business is going to be a part of Egencia, and we're going to be rolling over Orbitz for Business customers onto the Egencia platform throughout the year. We're off to a very, very good start there. The Orbitz Partner Network business is kind of a private label business. We've got some big clients such as American Express. That group is going to go into our Brand Expedia team and our EAN team or Expedia Affiliate Network based on the nature of those relationships. Those integrations take longer because they're quite -- they can be much more complex.

It's going to take some significant investments to build out a global transactional infrastructure. Second is marketing, both on the brand marketing side, but also building out a more robust variable marketing platform. Because HomeAway was -- HomeAway revenue was much more based on subscriptions and to some extent, not related to traffic and conversions. HomeAway couldn't bid on variable channels the way that some of our other brands can. More traffic means and our conversion means, more transactions means, you can bid more on variable channels. HomeAway didn't have the that factor. And any time you bid up into variable channels, typically your margins initially are lower and then you optimize to get to a higher return place. So certainly product, certainly marketing. We are going to reinvest fair amount of the fees also to the consumer experience to make sure that they've got a great experience, to make sure that they get the home that they expect. So I'd say those are the 3 big factors. Another factor to be aware of and it's an announcement that we made today is that on a go-forward basis, we are going to simplify the subscription product, which is going to take away some of the premium tiers that we had sold previously. And that's going to be a revenue negative, which we do believe is going to be offset by transactional revenue.

What we are seeing is that the hoteliers who provide us with the best pricing, with the best inventory, are gaining share on a relative basis in the marketplace. And they gain share 2 ways. One, just directly through bookings and also remember that they also gain audience share because they're higher up in the sort order and very often consumers are kind of clicking from our results and going and checking out the hotel direct. So I think the players who are giving us the best inventory are gaining both booking share and audience share within our marketplace. Our marketplace has been a marketplace that has been growing within the overall travel market. We have been gaining share for many years. I don't see that changing and the volume trends at this point don't suggest that that's changing. So listen, every player's going to make their own decision. And I think that the supply partners, who play well with us, who really provide a terrific experience for our customers over a long period of time, are going to gain share on our marketplace. And we'll build a terrific partnership together over the long term."

First, just it looks like some of the changes you're not going to enforce the online bookability with one of the new subscription plans. And then, it looks like you're adopting almost an accelerator model for HomeAway. So hoping you can comment on the philosophy behind those 2 changes. And then second question on HomeAway, if I can. There's been some speculation in the industry that some of the changes in traffic have been the result of just SEO snafus at HomeAway blocking Google from crawling parts of the site, suggesting that when they're fixed, some of the traffic could come back quickly. But wondering if you can just give us some clarity and what some of those issues might be on the SEO side, how permanent are they internal kind of self-inflicted versus Google-driven?"

As far as HomeAway and the philosophy there goes is, listen, we want to create a marketplace that is flexible, but also provides right incentives. And what's very, very clear as it relates to travelers is that, they want and like online booking. So the subscription price for one of our partners, who is providing online bookings, is significantly lower than someone who is not online bookable, so to speak. And we think that kind of provides right incentives in order to create a healthy marketplace that works for both sides. From a philosophical standpoint, we do want to build out toolsets that allow our supply partners, and this is at Expedia or Hotels.com or HomeAway, to have a very low entry base price. And then, to be able to pay, when they need a bit demand or when they want the demand. It's a very flexible model. It's easy to get into the marketplace. And then, if you want to optimize to the marketplace, you can absolutely optimize to it. And those are tools that we built on Expedia and Hotels.com side and those are tools that we anticipate building out with HomeAway as well. And HomeAway being part of our family definitely gives us an advantage there because we've done it before. On the SEO side, I don't want to get into too many specifics. There are some SEO effects that are structural such as, in general, some of the search results being moved down the page or the free search results being moved down the page. Some of the SEO results are results that we can optimize around and we can kind of build technology around. So I would say that the HomeAway team is definitely not standing still, and we're hoping to improve the SEO trends. In the meantime, though, our direct traffic trends are super, super strong and the team is more than making up for it."

I mean, the business and the brands are growing incredibly fast. The trivago team is experimenting with assisted booking capability. They're testing it in Europe. We -- based on the test, we expected to expand. I would say that the approach for trivago has been one in which it's not about keeping the consumer on the site, it's about optimizing the consumer experience based on however the consumer wants to book. If the consumer wants to stay on trivago, they can. If they want to go to a partner site, if they want to go to Booking.com or if they want to go to Hotels.com or Expedia, they can. So it's much -- it's very customer-focused. And I really commend the trivago team to -- for they're always solving for the consumer first. And we'll see how the results go. They're very data-driven.

The following discussion, including responses to your questions, reflects management's views as of today, July 28, 2016, only. We do not undertake any obligation to update or revise this information.
As always, some of the statements made on today's call are forward-looking, typically preceded by words such as we expect, we believe, we anticipate or similar statements. Please refer to today's press release and the company's filings with the SEC for information about factors, which could cause our actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements.
You'll find reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures discussed today in our earnings release, which is posted on the company's IR website at ir.expediainc.com. I encourage you to periodically visit our Investor Relations site for important content, including today's earnings release.
As a reminder, we sold our 62.4% ownership stake in eLong on May 22, 2015, which was previously a consolidated entity of Expedia Inc. For GAAP accounting purposes, the results of eLong are included in our results through the date of the sale. In order to allow investors to compare our current results on a like-for-like basis with our historical results the commentary in the earnings release and on this call is principally focused on our results excluding eLong, which should be considered in addition to the GAAP results on a fully consolidated basis.
Finally, unless otherwise stated, all references to cost of revenue, selling and marketing expense, general and administrative expense and technology and content expense, also exclude stock-based compensation and depreciation expense. And all comparisons on this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2015.
With that, let me turn the call over to Dara."

Trivago continue to grow scale and gain share global travel advertising market. The HomeAway transition and the Orbitz migration each continue to progress well and deliver ahead of plan. Egencia continue to execute on its near-term objectives while remaining on track to deliver on sizable long-term potential. And although we delivered nice big profit objectives with adjusted EBITDA up [ph] 18% to $331 million, we did see room night growth deaccelerate more than we're satisfied with. I'll touch on each of these factors in a bit more detail.
Trivago topped $200 million in stand-alone revenue this quarter for growth of 41% or 38% currency neutral. On a trailing 12-month basis, trivago generated over $660 million of revenue and has become a leading scale player in the travel advertising space while building profitably. A little bit of perspective here. We've grown trivago revenue nearly sixfold since 2012 when we partnered out with the founding team. And today, trivago's TTM revenue is greater and growing faster than Trip Advisor's when we spun off that company. I'm sure investors are wondering about the call arrangement have in place with a trivago founders, so let me update you now. Neither Expedia nor the trivago founders exercise their option under the open put call window this year, and we instead agreed to explore the feasibility of an IPO of trivago shares with the preliminary and ambitious goal of completing the IPO before year-end. An IPO would allow investors to value trivago as a separate stand-alone company. Note that this is an IPO, not a spin-off. Expedia does not plan to sell any of our shares in IPO, and there are no guarantees than an IPO will ultimately be pursued or be successful. The put call window could reopen in March 2017 if an IPO is not completed by then. And due to legal limitations, our ability to comment further on an IPO or on future performance is extremely limited. Therefore, we'll not be updating or otherwise commenting on our outlook for trivago for this quarter or beyond or answering related questions on the call.
The HomeAway transition continues to go very well. We've now implemented the travel service fee in all major markets allowing us to increase investments in technology and product as well as marketing in order to build our brand globally. HomeAway Q2 revenue grew 36% year-on-year on a pro forma basis, driven by strength in both subscription and transactional revenue. And based on current trends, we expect revenue growth to accelerate in the second half of the year. Although this transition is not easy, we believe the pivot from classified advertising to a travel e-commerce business is a winning plan that will allow us to create better products for consumers and drive more bookings through our homeowner and property manager partners. In addition, as we move more of a HomeAway's business to online bookable, we'll be more aggressive in offering HomeAway inventory on our OTA brands, which will drive even more booking volume and will give our huge global customer base more places to stay. 
The Orbitz migration is running nicely ahead of planned time lines with Orbitz and cheap tickets and apps as well as the ebookers site and app now on the Expedia platform and the migration of the Orbitz for Business clients onto the Egencia platform complete. Although we still has a migration work to do with a number of Orbitz Partner Network customers, something that will continue into 2017, we're pleased that the heavy lifting of the Orbitz Worldwide integration is largely behind us. 
Orbitz generated a healthy $54 million in adjusted EBITDA, representing a margin of approximately 28%. Given the speed with which we've executed the integration, we're incrementally optimistic about the delivery of Orbitz-related synergies in the back half of the year. 
Now the good work on the Orbitz front did, however, come at an operational cost with the room night growth decelerating more than we planned. The wake of the Orbitz book of business combined with other recent acquisitions and organic growth in our core business strained our infrastructure and affected network quality and uptime. We've addressed the vast majority of these issues and believe that they are now largely behind us. In addition, given the shift of the team's focus towards integration, our testament philosophy was not very wanted to be and our conversion rate increases slowed on a year-on-year basis versus prior quarters. The result of this included a slowdown at the metasearch channel, not only due to continued weakness of TripAdvisor but partially due to Instant Book but also trivago where we saw our click share decrease. With the largest part of the Orbitz integration now complete, the teams are back to core execution mode with focus on regaining momentum on the conversion and marketing fronts. We're operating in a very dynamic and competitive market and are no strangers to speed bumps along the way, and we continue to expect to deliver a strong year for the company.
Now I'll turn it over to Mark on the financials."
25915843,332689818,1016132,"Expedia Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2016",2016-07-28,"Earnings Calls","Expedia Group, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Dara. The adjusted EBITDA of $331 million that we delivered in Q2 was a solid result. From a brands perspective, we saw good results relative to our expectations on Hotels.com, Egencia, Expedia Affiliate Network and Travelocity. And as Dara mentio",843,"Thanks, Dara. The adjusted EBITDA of $331 million that we delivered in Q2 was a solid result. From a brands perspective, we saw good results relative to our expectations on Hotels.com, Egencia, Expedia Affiliate Network and Travelocity. And as Dara mentioned, the profits delivered by the Orbitz brand so far in 2016 have been better than we'd expected. The HomeAway and trivago teams are also executing very well in delivering great results. Hotel revenue grew 14% in Q2 on room night growth of 20%. Orbitz contributed approximately 8 percentage points of room night growth for the quarter. In addition to the factors Dara described earlier, lower organic room night growth in Q2 compared to Q1 was also driven by the shift of Easter into the first quarter this year and a small impact from leap day in Q1, which if normalized would have reduced room night growth in Q1 by about 3 percentage points and increased Q2 by about 1 percentage point. There had been a number of terrorist attacks in recent geographies over the past months. When isolated events occur, we historically have seen an immediate reduction in bookings and an increase in cancellations the impact to destination. Typically, most of that demand gets diverted to other destinations. And over time, normal travel patterns seem to return we are hopeful to see the same patterns repeat themselves, the frequency of recent events is giving us reason to be incrementally cautious. This is something that we will continue to monitor as the year progresses. 
Average daily rates declined less than 1% in Q2, and revenue per room night decreased by about 5 percentage points. The gap between the 2 narrowed again this quarter down to 440 basis points compared to about 540 basis points in Q1. We saw a continued broad strength in other product lines with air tickets up 45% and rental car days up 36%. Note that Orbitz added 30 percentage points to ticket growth and 24 percentage points to rental car days in Q2. Our ad and media revenue grew 42% [ph] on solid performance for both trivago and our Media Solutions group. From an expense perspective, setting aside the inorganic components from HomeAway in the Orbitz, we saw leverage and cost of revenue again this quarter as the teams continue to drive efficiencies. You'll see that the year-over-year organic growth in direct and selling and marketing expenses was lower in Q2 than in Q1, partially in conjunction with the lower top line trends with variable performance-based marketing making up a large portion of this expense category. We did, however, see an elevated pace of growth in technology and content expenses as we had expected, driven by an increase in cost to support Orbitz integration efforts and growth in the core business, accelerated hiring as we brought Orbitz team members on to our Brand Expedia team early this year and expenses associated with the migration of certain functionality to the cloud. We expect the growth and technical content expense to remain elevated but to begin to moderate in the back half of the year. 
G&A expense grew a bit faster than revenue this quarter on some discrete legal and professional Note that we are expecting to see leverage and G&A expense in the back half of the year.
Turning to our financial expectations for 2016. On a consolidated basis, excluding eLong, we continue to expect full year adjusted EBITDA to grow 35% to 45% year-over-year. We do think that the contribution to full year adjusted EBITDA for Orbitz and HomeAway combined will be higher than our previous expectations with a relatively lower contribution from the rest of the business. Please note, however, that we are forecasting modestly improved organic room night growth in the back half of the year. And if that does not occur, we would likely see full year adjusted EBITDA growth closer to the lower end of the stated range. In terms of the shape of the back half of the year, I would just remind you of some discrete items that will favorably impact Q4 results. Orbitz synergies will be close to full run rate, and we'll get a the full quarter benefit from HomeAway in the fourth quarter. We will also be comping the Paris attack, significant deal-related cost and the purchase accounting impacts of deferred revenue for both Orbitz and HomeAway. 
Before closing, I do want to give a bit more color regarding the buildup of our new corporate headquarters slated to take place over the next 2 [ph] years. In March this year, we had indicated that capital outlay for the full buildout could run in the range of $1 billion to $1.2 billion. Since then, we have looked more closely at the design focus on budget and facing. And we now believe we can have the property ready for use in 2019 for something closer to half of the previous estimate. We expect to share more details as these plans are finalized. With that, let's open it up for some questions. Operator?"

Let me just kind of bridge you from the Q4 organic room night growth of 24% down to 12% and give you a sense of it. First of all, the time of our Q1 call, we were expecting a deceleration of somewhere between 500 and 700 basis points. Majority of that was coming from Easter as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, and we were also lapping over some significant ramp up in both of the what if and Travelocity businesses. Travelocity because we've taken over control of sales and marketing after the acquisition, and what if because we have them on the platform, and then the law of large numbers, et cetera. So that is what we have exact expected. We did -- I mentioned in a few investor conferences in may that we have seen some slowdown in signals we're seeing a little bit more. And really, the majority of that incremental slowdown, we believe, is self-inflicted. There were a couple of big drivers in there. One is we did have some network and infrastructure stability issues really focused in the first half of the quarter. A lot of this was driven by just organic growth in the business. But also, as we moved the Orbitz book of business on to our network infrastructure, it wobbled a little bit, and it took us well to get the stabilize. The good news is it is now stabilized, and the team has done a great job getting that back on track. The second self-inflicted wound, if you will, was the decision that we have made really to divert the vast majority of the Brand Expedia team tech and card resources towards the integration effort and to good results. We've actually got near bits brands onto the Expedia platform faster than we had expected, and we are seeing the financial benefit of that. The cost, however, was that our test and learn velocity in terms of the rate at which we were testing a releasing new features slower on the year-on-year basis than it would have been same time last year, and that has an impact on conversion. And when you impact your conversion it impacts not only the transactions that are coming to you directly but also in variable channels. And Dara mentioned the slowdown that we were seeing in the metasearch channel. So that was really the majority of that, call it, 500 to 700 basis points of incremental slowdown beyond that, which we had expected. The rest of it, I -- it's very difficult to pinpoint. Certainly, we do remain in an intensely competitive marketplace. And any time we stop the innovation pace, we have competitors that are very quick to respond and take share, and we certainly did see that in the metasearch channels. Also, it's really hard to read in use and see what's happening in the overall geopolitical environment, particularly the terrorist attacks and the frequency of the recent terrorist attacks in Europe. And even though we can't pinpoint an overall impact exactly on that, it wouldn't surprise us if that's having some impact as well."

We will have more to say about distribution on Expedia and Hotels.com and all of our other brands, so stay tuned there. And I think, in general, the theme that you should look for is a much deeper integration of the HomeAway inventory on to the Expedia platforms, in general. And prior, when we worked with HomeAway as partners before, the integration was more of a link-off experience. It was a little bit of a shock for users. And this HomeAway inventory is going to be fundamental to our product on a long-term basis, so we're making the cost of investments that we have to to make sure that the integration is perfect and our clients who are online bookable and especially instant bookable get plenty more traffic the way they want that traffic."

It looks like it's working, and we think that the momentum there will continue. You certainly see it in the Facebook results. As far as the Facebook messenger bot, I think it's too early to tell. It's a promising technology.

So -- I mean we expected to be bringing in a really strong company, and we wrote a big check to bring in HomeAway. And I'd say, so far, the results have been better than expected. So I think that this alternative lodging space is just a big space, and HomeAway is benefiting from that. And obviously, Airbnb, which is the other big player in the category, is clearly benefiting from it as well. The reaction when we did bring in the booking fees, et cetera, we did see a conversion decrease initially, but the great news is that the team, the HomeAway technology team, now they've got traffic, and they're able to optimize the site in a way that they weren't able to. So conversion is actually up on the year-on-year basis because of the optimization work because of the feature work that the teams are embarking on. And I think that, that momentum is going to continue for some period of time when we look at HomeAway conversion versus, let's say, Hotels.com or Expedia conversion and in light destinations, HomeAway conversion is far lower. So we think we've got plenty of work to do there, and we think that you got plenty of upside there. The other factor that we want to look at is subscription renewals and subscription renewal rates. And again it's -- things look good there. So I think anytime you change your model through some in the marketplace. You had to over communicate to our homeowners and our partners, but I think now we're settling down, and we can both build a great business together."

Are there markets where there may not be enough independent supply to backfill and kind of replace what the change you're doing? And I guess, as a follow-up to that, when you kind of take a step back and look at the magnitude of some of the discounting you're doing and you kind of listen to Marriott on their earnings call this morning talking about seeing net pressure on ADRs from what they're doing, like how do you guys think this plays out? Do they keep doing this at a net loss themselves? Or do you think, ultimately, they pull back on this perspective on that?"

These are really smart big companies, and they're making their own decision. I think the question that you asked about is affecting us is clearly a question that we asked ourselves because we saw slowdown in room nights, and we have 18,000 statisticians looking in every which way and every angle to see whether it's affected us. And the short answer is that we haven't seen any real correlation in our performance in chain-heavy markets versus chain-light markets. You would think that in a market that has lots of chains, you would see some conversion degradation or performance degradation to the extent that inventory is -- inventory quality is lessening, but we haven't seen any of that whatsoever. It may happen, it may not happen. But to date, we haven't seen any correlation at all. What we have seen is we have seen a shift of our bookings from some of the chains that are discounting to independents and/or chains that are not discounting. So there have been certainly a share shift and maybe that was affecting Marriott ADRs. And a share shift actually, in an interesting way, is giving us a margin upside. So from that standpoint, that does not that although, we're not necessarily managing from margin. I think the other perspective whether they're going to continue or not is we attract brand-diagnostic travelers as far as what hotel they're staying at or they're staying at. And actually, if you look at Hotels.com on a global basis, the biggest chains in the world the largest hotel chains get less than 0.5% of searches on the Hotels.com site. Just to make sure you understand that. Someone comes in Hotels.com, less than 0.5% of them are searching for specific large brand out there. So these are folks who want a great hotel in Paris, and it's a terrific opportunity for great hotels in Paris to stand up and to market themselves to someone who hasn't yet become loyal to a chain. And we have partners who are, at this point, standing up. The economy is a little bit weaker than it has been before, so we are seeing some promotional activity and discounting activity. And so far, we're satisfied with the quality of inventory. Now we'll watch this it's a big chance were marketing aggressively so as far as competitive brand marketing activity probably not good for us, but we haven't seen any direct effect as a result of their actions, and we'll work with them because we definitely want to grow with the chains. We think that's a positive way to grow volume going forward and we continue to have promising dialogue with them."

So we are expecting through the back part of this year work our way and clawback that piece of the business that was self-inflicted, both as network infrastructure issue, also as we ramp up test and learn velocity and get year-on-year conversion improvements back. Against that, I guess, plan if you will, that we're executing against things that in our control is this backdrop of just the increasing frequency of terrorism. And to put some numbers on it, historically, we have seen these destinations that experience these types of terrible things drop, and then they pop back in a matter of weeks, if not months. But if you take France as a destination, for example, which has had just a terrible go of it, room night growth pre the most recent Paris attacks was in and around the mid-20s. After the Paris attacks, it settled out into low single digits. As soon as Brussels happened, it hit negative single digits. And since Nice, it's been down double digits, like mid-20s. So we have not seen the recovery in France. So although we're hopeful that we will see a recovery, just the pace of this has got us into unchartered territory. Now the upside of this is that we are seeing places, particular places in Spain, Ireland, et cetera, we're seeing increasing volume there. Clearly, people are shifting the places of that you're traveling to, but we're cautious that this could just put a negative tone on just on the overall, at least European, travel trends. Just to touch on Brexit quickly, which is one of the other things you mentioned, the Brexit response was similar to what we see any time you see big currency moves, and it was really currency related. As soon as the pound devalued versus the U.S. dollar, we saw bookings, particularly into London out of the U.S. increase pretty significantly. But beyond that, we haven't seen a significant impact. And I think for now, we're not expecting to see one."

The simple answer for the first question is both HomeAway and trivago report into revenue and not into bookings. So you've got inorganic and HomeAway dropping directly into that and Trivago organic revenue growth, obviously very strong and faster than the overall business with no bookings to offset. So that's the big driver. In terms of gross bookings on the side and the impact of the booking fee, we generally are seeing very strong results of their. As a reminder, we now have 1 million online bookable properties, so more transactions are coming online. We -- last quarter, we actually reported a booked transactional revenue number just to give you a sense of it. And what that represented is, essentially, the revenue that HomeAway drives from bookings that happened online on a booked basis, recognition happens on stay. That number this quarter was well north of 200% [ph] year-over-year. So we're seeing really strong results there, and we're able to actually put that increased volume and increased revenue that HomeAway has back into the business. And one of the most significant investments that HomeAway has been making is not only in product and technology to make the experience better for both owners and managers as well as consumers, but they put a significant amount of money back into sales and marketing. In fact, the first half of this year, direct sales and marketing spend, up over 80% year-over-year. So we're really creating this flywheel. And it just seems the more volume we create, the more attractive online bookability becomes -- becomes for owners and managers, and we're starting to get real traction there that we're very pleased to see."

Historically, whenever we've seen something happen locally, there has been a reaction. There'd been significant cancellations, and then you have a couple of weeks of, call it, business being running below normal. And usually, you see that the patterns of travel kind of work around the uncertainty or the interruptions. So as an example, presently, we see Spain as a destination being incredibly strong. Why is that? It's obviously because France as a destination is weak. Turkey is weak. A bunch of other summer destinations that Europeans used to travel to are down. So Spain is really strong. Now with all the activity here, is it happening on an overall effect on the travel market? I can only say maybe. We don't see it in general. Historically, we've seen travel grow at GDP plus 3% to 4%, and we've seen online travel kind of grow faster than that. We've got exposure to Asia in some markets, which kind of make our growth rate even significantly higher than the overall travel growth rate. And I'd expect more the same. There may be a general slowdown. I wouldn't predict that because we haven't seen it before.

As far as Orbitz goes, the Orbitz integration was fundamentally different from Travelocity. Because if you remember, Travelocity initially was a technology integration as related to that asset which was owned by Sabre. So Sabre really had to work with a bunch of the -- had to do with the headcount issues, the employee issues, and we just had to deal with the technology integration. Orbitz coming in was not only integrating technology but also took, kind of, the efforts of lots and lots of people across the company because we're essentially bringing the company in. So that's one. The second is that Orbitz is a number brands. It's not just Orbitz, it's a ebookers brands. We closed down Hotel Club in Asia. We are integrating the Orbitz partner network and Orbitz for Business. So it is a substantially larger and more complex integration than the Travelocity integration. And I do think that another factor is that we brought in Travelocity, we brought in What If and we brought in Orbitz, I think I don't know what the total time between those 3 integrations were, but it's 3 integrations one after the other. And I think that probably each integration maybe knocked us back by 5% or 10%. And the 5% or 10% started adding up with the last integration, the Orbitz integration being the biggest one and the challenging one. Super, super prod of the company for getting it done. We knew that it was a challenge through the second quarter, and we said let's put our heads down, get it done, so we can get back to core execution, and we're there. And expectations for us internally are high. We think that we're going to execute, we have before, and I think we will again. As far as HomeAway inventory, adding inventory to the mix, we're looking at adding inventory all over. I do think that our strengths tend to be in the resort area as far as sun destinations, mountain destinations, et cetera, but we are adding urban listings as well. And I think that as we integrate more fundamentally with Hotels.com, Expedia, Travelocity, Orbitz, the pace of urban listing acquisition is going to increase."

So we're very pleased with it, and I think there's more to come. Not a big factor in the revenue per room night and ADR story at this point. The narrowing of the gap there is really largely due to the reasons that we predicted is that we are getting to the end of our margin reduction strategy here, and we are starting to see just better, better trends, and that's something we do expect to continue here over the next little while. And then the last thing that's helped that is something that Dara mentioned, which is we are seeing a mix of our business towards independent hotels that are taking advantage at our marketplace and taking advantage of, really, the less attractive pricing but in many cases some of the partners are providing to our consumers."

So the vast majority of our direct sales and marketing is variable to performance in nature. And in a sense, it's auto adjusting, which is when we have lower year-on-year conversion gains, as Dara mentioned, we have seen, particularly at Brand Expedia. We automatically essentially adjust and pull back a little bit because we're very focused on making sure that we maintain the appropriate profitability. And that said, those channels themselves are the least profitable channels that we have. And so when we do have a slowdown in conversion, it does translate into room night growth, and the first channels to go are the ones that are most expensive. So there's a natural offsetter or a natural hedge that we see in our P&L. With respect to macro and accounts we saw at metasearch and Europe and changes, I think the biggest changes that we are very focused on getting our year-on-year test and learn velocity right back up where it should be. We are hopeful that, that will improve conversion rates. And then we will hopefully see the exact reverse of what we saw in sign the second quarter, which is room night growth accelerating back up and sales and marketing going back up with it and hopefully a little bit less than room nights."

And probably during the summer, we're a little more focused on managing rates and managing inventory and managing promotions, so that we can deliver as much volume to our partners as we can.

We're really trying to offer the best hotel at the best rate to our consumers, and that's what we're solving for. Everything else kind of flows from there.

I'm pleased to be joined on the call today by Dara Khosrowshahi, Expedia's CEO and President; and Mark Okerstrom, our CFO and EVP of Operations.
The following discussion, including responses to your questions, reflects management's views as of today, July 28, 2016, only. We do not undertake any obligation to update or revise this information.
As always, some of the statements made on today's call are forward-looking, typically preceded by words such as we expect, we believe, we anticipate, or similar statements. Please refer to today's press release and the company's filings with the SEC for information about factors which could cause our actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements.
You'll find reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures discussed today in our earnings release, which is posted on the company's IR website at ir.expediainc.com. I encourage you to periodically visit our Investor Relations site for important content, including today's earnings release.
As a reminder, we sold our 62.4% ownership stake in eLong on May 22, 2015, which was previously a consolidated entity of Expedia Inc. For GAAP accounting purposes, the results of eLong are included in our results through the date of the sale. In order to allow investors to compare our current results on a like-for-like basis with our historical results, our commentary in the earnings release and on this call is principally focused on our results excluding eLong, which should be considered in addition to the GAAP results on a fully consolidated basis.
Finally, unless otherwise stated, all references to cost of revenue, selling and marketing expense, general and administrative expense and technology and content expense also exclude stock-based compensation and depreciation expense. And all comparisons on this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2015.

The second quarter was one on which the strength and breadth of the Expedia Inc. range of businesses really shone through. trivago continue to grow scale and gain share in the global travel advertising market. The HomeAway transition and the Orbitz migration each continue to progress well and deliver ahead of plan. Egencia continue to execute on its near-term objectives while remaining on track to deliver on sizable long-term potential. And although we delivered nicely against our profit objectives with adjusted EBITDA up 18% to $331 million, we did see room night growth deaccelerate more than we're satisfied with. I'll touch on each of these factors in a bit more detail.
trivago topped $200 million in stand-alone revenue this quarter for growth of 41% or 38% currency neutral. On a trailing 12-month basis, trivago generated over $660 million of revenue and has become a leading scale player in the travel advertising space while building profitably. 
A little bit of perspective here. We've grown trivago revenue nearly sixfold since 2012 when we partnered up with the founding team, and today, trivago's TTM revenue is greater and growing faster than TripAdvisor's when we spun off that company. 
I'm sure investors are wondering about the put-call arrangement that we have in place with the trivago founders, so let me update you now. Neither Expedia nor the trivago founders exercise their option under the open put-call window this year, and we've instead agreed to explore the feasibility of an IPO of trivago shares with the preliminary and ambitious goal of completing the IPO before year-end. An IPO would allow investors to value trivago as a separate stand-alone company. Note that this is an IPO, not a spin-off. Expedia does not plan to sell any of our shares in IPO, and there are no guarantees than an IPO will ultimately be pursued or be successful. The put-call window could reopen in March 2017 if an IPO is not completed by then. And due to legal limitations, our ability to comment further on an IPO or on future performance is extremely limited. Therefore, we'll not be updating or otherwise commenting on our outlook for trivago for this quarter or beyond, or answering related questions on the call.
The HomeAway transition continues to go very well. We've now implemented the traveler service fee in all major markets, allowing us to increase investments in technology and product as well as marketing in order to build our brand globally. 
HomeAway Q2 revenue grew 36% year-on-year on a pro forma basis, driven by strength in both subscription and transactional revenue. And based on current trends, we expect revenue growth to accelerate in the second half of the year. 
Although this transition is not easy, we believe the pivot from pure classified advertising to a travel e-commerce business is a winning plan that will allow us to create better products for consumers and drive more bookings through our homeowner and property manager partners. In addition, as we move more of HomeAway's business to online bookable, we'll be more aggressive in offering HomeAway inventory on our OTA brands, which will drive even more booking volume and will give our huge global customer base more places to stay. 
The Orbitz migration is running nicely ahead of planned time lines with Orbitz and CheapTickets apps as well as the ebookers site and app now on the Expedia platform and the migration of the Orbitz for business clients onto the Egencia platform complete. Although we still have some migration work to do with a number of Orbitz Partner Network customers, something that will continue into 2017, we're pleased that the heavy lifting of the Orbitz Worldwide integration is largely behind us. 
Orbitz generated a healthy $54 million in adjusted EBITDA, representing a margin of approximately 28%. Given the speed with which we've executed the integration, we're incrementally optimistic about the delivery of Orbitz-related synergies in the back half of the year. 
Now the good work on the Orbitz front did, however, come at an operational cost with our room night growth deaccelerating more than we planned. The weight of the Orbitz book of business, combined with other recent acquisitions and organic growth in our core business, strained our infrastructure and affected network quality and uptime. We've addressed the vast majority of these issues and believe that they're now largely behind us. 
In addition, given the shift of the team's focus towards integration, our test and learn velocity was not where we want it to be, and our conversion rate increases slowed on a year-on-year basis versus prior quarters. The result of this included a slowdown at the metasearch channel not only due to continued weakness at TripAdvisor, partially due to Instant Book, but also trivago, where we saw our click share decreased. With the largest part of the Orbitz integration now complete, the teams are back to core execution mode with focus on regaining momentum on the conversion and marketing fronts. 
We operate in a very dynamic and competitive market and are no strangers to speed bumps along the way, and we continue to expect to deliver a strong year for the company.
Now I'll turn it over to Mark on the financials."

The adjusted EBITDA of $331 million that we delivered in Q2 was a solid result. From a brand perspective, we saw good results relative to our expectations on Hotels.com, Egencia, Expedia Affiliate Network and Travelocity. And as Dara mentioned, the profits delivered by the Orbitz brand so far in 2016 have been better than we had expected. The HomeAway and trivago teams are also executing very well in delivering great results. 
Hotel revenue grew 14% in Q2 on room night growth of 20%. Orbitz contributed approximately 8 percentage points of room night growth for the quarter. In addition to the factors Dara described earlier, lower organic room night growth in Q2 compared to Q1 was also driven by the shift of Easter into the first quarter this year and a small impact from Leap Day in Q1, which, if normalized, would have reduced room night growth in Q1 by about 3 percentage points and increased Q2 by about 1 percentage point. 
There have been a number of terrorist attacks in recent geographies over the past months. When isolated events occur, we historically have seen an immediate reduction in bookings and an increase in cancellations for the impact to destination. Typically, most of that demand gets diverted to other destinations, and over time, normal travel patterns seem to return. Though, we are hopeful to see the same patterns repeat themselves. The frequency of recent events is giving us reason to be incrementally cautious. This is something that we will continue to monitor as the year progresses. 
Average daily rates declined less than 1% in Q2, and revenue per room night decreased by about 5 percentage points. The gap between the 2 narrowed again this quarter, down to 440 basis points compared to about 540 basis points in Q1. We saw a continued broad strength in other product lines with air tickets up 45% and rental car days up 36%. Note that Orbitz added 30 percentage points to ticket growth and 24 percentage points to rental car days in Q2. Our ad and media revenue grew 42% on solid performance for both trivago and our Media Solutions group. 
From an expense perspective, setting aside the inorganic components from HomeAway and Orbitz, we saw a leverage in cost of revenue again this quarter as the teams continue to drive efficiencies. You'll see that the year-over-year organic growth in direct and selling and marketing expenses was lower in Q2 than in Q1, partially in conjunction with the lower top line trends with variable performance-based marketing making up a large portion of this expense category. We did, however, see an elevated pace of growth in technology and content expenses as we had expected, driven by an increase in cost to support Orbitz integration efforts and growth in the core business, accelerated hiring as we brought Orbitz team members onto our Brand Expedia team early this year and expenses associated with the migration of certain functionality to the cloud. We expect the growth and technical content expense to remain elevated but to begin to moderate in the back half of the year. 
G&A expense grew a bit faster than revenue this quarter on some discrete legal and professional fees. Note that we are expecting to see leverage in G&A expense in the back half of the year.
Turning to our financial expectations for 2016. On a consolidated basis, excluding eLong, we continue to expect full year adjusted EBITDA to grow 35% to 45% year-over-year. We do think that the contribution to full year adjusted EBITDA for Orbitz and HomeAway combined will be higher than our previous expectations with a relatively lower contribution from the rest of the business. Please note, however, that we are forecasting modestly improved organic room night growths in the back half of the year. And if that does not occur, we would likely see full year adjusted EBITDA growth closer to the lower end of the stated range. 
In terms of the shape of the back half of the year, I would just remind you of some discrete items that will favorably impact Q4 results. Orbitz synergies will be close to full run rate, and we'll get a full quarter benefit from HomeAway in the fourth quarter. We will also be comping the Paris attack, significant deal-related cost and the purchase accounting impacts of deferred revenue for both Orbitz and HomeAway. 
Before closing, I did want to give a bit more color regarding the build-out of our new corporate headquarter slated to take place over the next years. In March this year, we had indicated that capital outlay for the full build-out could run in the range of $1 billion to $1.2 billion. Since then, we have looked more closely at the design with a focus on budget and phase-in. And we now believe we can have the property ready for use in 2019 for something closer to half of the previous estimate. We expect to share more details as those plans are finalized. 
With that, let's open it up for some questions. Operator?"

Let me just kind of bridge you from the Q4 organic room night growth of 24% down to 12% and give you a sense of that. First of all, the time of our Q1 call, we were expecting a deceleration of somewhere between 5",526,"Hey, Naved, it's Mark. I'll take this one. Let me just kind of bridge you from the Q4 organic room night growth of 24% down to 12% and give you a sense of that. First of all, the time of our Q1 call, we were expecting a deceleration of somewhere between 500 and 700 basis points. Majority of that was coming from Easter, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, and we were also lapping over some significant ramp-up in both the Wotif and Travelocity businesses. Travelocity, because we've taken over control of sales and marketing after the acquisition; and Wotif, because we have them on the platform; and then the law of large numbers; et cetera. So that was what we had expected. We did -- I mentioned in a few investor conferences in May that we had seen some slowdown and signal that we were seeing a little bit more. And really, the majority of that incremental slowdown, we believe, is self-inflicted. There were a couple of big drivers there. One is we did have some network and infrastructure stability issues really focused in the first half of the quarter. A lot of this was driven by just organic growth in the business. But also, as we moved the Orbitz book of business onto our network infrastructure, it wobbled a little bit, and it took us a while to get it stabilized. The good news is, is that it is now stabilized, and the team has done a great job getting that back on track. The second self-inflicted wound, if you will, was the decision that we had really to divert the vast majority of the Brand Expedia team tech and product resources towards the integration effort. And to good result, we've actually got the Orbitz brands onto the Expedia platform faster than we had expected, and we are seeing the financial benefit of that. The cost, however, was that our test and learn velocity in terms of the rate at which we were testing or releasing new features slower on a year-on-year basis than it would have been same time last year, and that has an impact on conversion. And when you impact your conversion, it impacts not only the transactions that are coming to you directly but also in variable channels. And Dara mentioned the slowdown that we were seeing in the metasearch channel. So that was really the majority of that, call it, 500 to 700 basis points of incremental slowdown beyond that, which we had expected. The rest of it, I -- it's very difficult to pinpoint. Certainly, we do remain in a intensely competitive marketplace. And any time we stop the innovation pace, we have competitors that are very quick to respond and take share, and we certainly did see that in the metasearch channels. Also, it's really hard to read the news and see what's happening in the overall geopolitical environment, particularly the terrorist attacks and the frequency of the recent terrorist attacks in Europe. And even though we can't pinpoint an overall impact exactly on that, it wouldn't surprise us if that's having some impact as well."

We will have more to say about distribution on Expedia and Hotels.com and all of our other brands, so stay tuned there. And I think, in general, the theme that you should look for is a much deeper integration of the HomeAway inventory onto the Expedia platforms, in general. In prior -- when we worked with HomeAway as partners before, the integration was more of a link-off experience. It was a little bit of a shock for users. And this HomeAway inventory is going to be fundamental to our product on a long-term basis, so we're making the kinds of investments that we have to make sure that the integration is perfect and our clients, who are online bookable and especially instant bookable, got -- get plenty more traffic the way they want that traffic."

So I think that this alternative lodging space is a -- it's just a big space, and HomeAway is benefiting from that. And obviously, Airbnb, which is the other big player in the category, is clearly benefiting from it as well. The reaction when we did bring in the booking fees, et cetera, we did see a conversion decrease initially, but the great news is that the team, the HomeAway technology team, now they've got traffic, and they're able to optimize the site in a way that they weren't able to. So conversion is actually up on a year-on-year basis because of the optimization work, because of the feature work that the teams are embarking on. And I think that, that momentum is going to continue for some period of time when we look at HomeAway conversion versus, let's say, Hotels.com or Expedia conversion. And in like destinations, HomeAway conversion is far lower. So we think we've got plenty of work to do there, and we think that we got plenty of upside there. The other factor that we want to look at is subscription renewals and subscription renewal rates. And again, it's -- things look good there. So I think, listen, any time you change your model, you introduce some uncertainty into the marketplace. We've had to overcommunicate to our homeowners and our partners, but I think now we're settling down, and we can both build a great business together."

Wondering if you can just attribute any of that organic slowdown in room night growth to the hotel efforts at loyalty pricing discounts and ad campaign supporting those.

I mean, these are really smart, big companies, and they're making their own decision. I think the question that you asked about is it affecting us is clearly a question that we asked ourselves because we saw a slowdown in room nights, and we have 18,000 statisticians looking in every which way and every angle to see whether it's affected us. And the short answer is that we haven't seen any real correlation in our performance in chain-heavy markets versus chain-light markets. You would think that in a market that has lots of chains, you would see some conversion degradation or performance degradation to the extent that inventory is -- inventory quality is lessening, but we haven't seen any of that whatsoever. It may happen. It may not happen. But to date, we haven't seen any correlation at all. What we have seen is we have seen a shift of our bookings from some of the chains that are discounting to independents and/or chains that are not discounting. So there has been certainly a share shift, and maybe that was affecting Marriott ADRs. And a share shift actually, in a interesting way, is giving us a margin upside. So from that standpoint, that has not been bad. Although, we're not necessarily managing for margin. I think the other perspective after whether they're going to continue or not is we attract brand-agnostic travelers as far as what hotel they're staying at or what chain they're staying at. And actually, like, if you look at Hotels.com on a global basis, the biggest chains in the world, the largest hotel chains get point -- less than 0.5% of searches on the Hotels.com site. Just to make sure you understand that. Someone comes on Hotels.com, less than 0.5% of them are searching for specific large brand out there. So these are folks who want a great hotel in Paris, and it's a terrific opportunity for great hotels in Paris to stand up and to market themselves to someone who hasn't yet become loyal to a chain. And we have partners who are, at this point, standing up. The economy is a little bit weaker than it has been before, so we are seeing some promotional activity and discounting activity. And so far, we're satisfied with the quality of inventory. Now we'll watch this. It's a big chance. We're marketing aggressively. So as far as competitive brand marketing activity, probably not good for us. But we haven't seen any direct effect as a result of their actions, and we'll work with them because we definitely want to grow with the chains. We think that's a positive way to grow volume forward, and we continue to have promising dialogue with them."

So with respect to the trajectory for room night growth, if you look at what I said around kind of the self-inflicted piece of what we saw in the second quarter, half of the, call it, 500 -- around half of the 500 to 700 basis points of decel that we have not anticipated is self-inflicted, and a chunk of that is related to the network and stability and infrastructure that we've now solved. So we are expecting to, through the back part of this year, work our way and claw back that piece of the business that was self-inflicted, both as network and infrastructure issue, also as we ramp-up test and learn velocity and get year-on-year conversion improvements back. Against that, I guess, plan, if you will, that we're executing against things that in our control is this backdrop of just the increasing frequency of terrorism. And to put some numbers on it, historically, we have seen these destinations that experience these types of terrible things drop, and then they pop back in a matter of weeks, if not months. But if you take France as a destination, for example, which has had just a terrible go of it, room night growth pre the most recent Paris attacks was in and around the mid-20s. After the Paris attacks, it settled out into low single digits. As soon as Brussels happened, it hit negative single digits. And since Nice, it's been down double digits, like mid-20s. So we have not seen the recovery in France. And so although we're hopeful that we will see a recovery, just the pace of this has got us into unchartered territory. Now the upside of this is that we are seeing places, particular places in Spain, Ireland, et cetera, we're seeing increasing volume there. Clearly, people are shifting the places that their traveling to, but we're cautious that this could just put a negative tone on -- just on the overall, at least European, travel trends. Just to touch on Brexit quickly, which is one of the other things you mentioned, the Brexit response was similar to what we see any time we see currency moves, and it was really currency-related. As soon as the pound devalued versus the U.S. dollar, we saw bookings, particularly into London out of the U.S., increased pretty significantly. But beyond that, we haven't seen a significant impact, and I think for now, we're not expecting to see one."

So the simple answer on the first question is both HomeAway and trivago report into revenue and not into bookings. So you've got inorganic and HomeAway dropping directly into that and then Trivago organic revenue growth, obviously very strong and faster than the overall business with no bookings offset. So that's the big driver. In terms of gross bookings on the side, and the impact of the booking fee, I mean, we generally are seeing very strong results there. As a reminder, we now have 1 million online bookable properties, so more transactions are coming online. We -- last quarter, we actually reported a booked transactional revenue number, just to give you a sense of it. And what that represented is, essentially, the revenue that HomeAway derives from bookings that happened online on a booked basis, recognition happens on stay. That number this quarter was well north of 200% year-over-year. So we're seeing really strong results there, and we're able to actually put that increased volume and increased revenue that HomeAway has back into the business. And one of the most significant investments that HomeAway has been making is not only in product and technology to make the experience better for both owners and managers as well as consumers, but they put a significant amount of money back into sales and marketing. And in fact, the first half of this year, direct sales and marketing spend, up over 80% year-over-year. So really creating this flywheel. And it just seems the more volume we create, the more attractive online bookability comes -- becomes for owners and managers. And we're starting to get real traction there that we're very pleased to see."

I guess what I would tell you is that this is an unusual time where uncertainty and the kind of terrorist activity that we're seeing is, it seems to be happening at a unprecedented rate. Historically, whenever we've seen something happen locally, there has been a reaction. There had been significant cancellations, and then you have a couple of weeks of, call it, business being -- running below normal. And usually, you see that the patterns of travel kind of work around the uncertainty or the interruptions. So as an example, presently, we see Spain as a destination, being incredibly strong. Why is that? It's obviously because France as a destination is weak. Turkey is weak. A bunch of other summer sun destinations that Europeans used to travel to are down. So Spain is really strong. Now with all the activity here, is it having an overall effect on the travel market? I can only say maybe. We don't see it in general. Historically, we've seen travel grow at GDP plus 3% to 4%, and we've seen online travel kind of grow faster than that. We've got exposure to Asia and some markets, which kind of make our growth rate even significantly higher than the overall travel growth rate. And I'd expect more of the same. There may be a general slowdown. I wouldn't predict it because we haven't seen it before. But even if there is, we think companies like ours, companies that are strong on the technology and customer and brand side, can grow through any kind of these interruptions."

Because if you remember, Travelocity initially was a technology integration asset related to that asset, which was owned by Sabre. So Sabre really had to work with a bunch of the -- had to deal with the headcount issues, the employee issues, and we just had to deal with the technology integration. Orbitz coming in was not only integrating technology but also took kind of the efforts of lots and lots of people across the company because we're essentially bringing the company in. So that's one. The second is that Orbitz is a number brands. It's not just Orbitz. It's a ebookers brands. We closed down Hotel Club in Asia. We are integrating the Orbit Partner Network (sic) [Orbitz Partner Network] and Orbitz for Business. So it is a substantially larger and more complex integration than the Travelocity integration. And I do think that another factor is that, listen, we brought in Travelocity, we brought in Wotif, and we brought in Orbitz. So I think I don't know what the total time between those 3 integrations were, but it's 3 integrations one after the other. And I think that, probably, each integration maybe knocked us back by 5% or 10%, and the 5% or 10% started adding up with the last integration, the Orbitz integration being the biggest one and the most challenging one. Super, super proud of the company for getting it done. We knew that it was a challenge through the second quarter, and we said, ""You know what, let's put our heads down, get it done, so we can get back to kind of core execution,"" and we're there. And expectations for us internally are high. We think that we're going to execute. We have before, and I think we will again. As far as HomeAway inventory, adding urban inventory to the mix, we're looking at adding inventory all over. I do think that our strengths tend to be in the resort area as far as sun destinations, mountain destinations, et cetera. But we are adding urban listings as well. And I think that as we integrate more fundamentally with Hotels.com, Expedia, Travelocity, Orbitz, the pace of urban listing acquisition is going to increase."

And that said, those channels themselves are the least profitable channels that we have. And so when we do have a slowdown in conversion, it does translate into room night growth, and the first channels to go are the ones that are most expensive. So there's a natural offsetter, a natural hedge that we see in our P&L. With respect to macro and the challenge we saw in metasearch in Europe and changes, listen, I think the biggest changes that we are very focused on, getting our year-on-year test and learn velocity right back up where it should be.

So we are watching with interest what's going on. Every single municipality is looking at this issue in a different way. We are working closely with those municipalities. And we think in the end, this is a product that consumers want. It attracts travelers to destinations. Travelers bring jobs. They bring money.

We really started investing in the sales team, and we continue to invest in that sales team, and they continue to deliver. If there's any seasonality, I'd say that we try to bring on a bunch of hotels prior to the big summer season when travelers are traveling. So usually, at the beginning of the year, Q1 and Q2, the team really tries to sign up as many hoteliers and partners as we can. And probably, during the summer, we're a little more focused on managing rates and managing inventory and managing promotions, so that we can deliver as much volume to our partners as we can. But I think you should take the 25,000 as nothing unusual. It's going to be business as usual. And I think every quarter, we're going to add some amount close to that number. Whether it's a little bit lower or a little bit higher really doesn't matter. I think from a long-term perspective, you should look at supply addition as being a growth factor for this business.

So we'll watch it. The margin improvements are probably going to be a financial positive, but it's not really an agenda on the margin side. We're really trying to offer the best hotel at the best rate to our consumers, and that's what we're solving for. Everything else kind of flows from there. I would say that in every market, we are making sure that we have a wide selection of hotels that are providing us the best inventory at the best price. So we do look at the market-by-market basis. Sometimes, we even look at neighborhood by neighborhood to make sure that, where there are neighborhoods that are specially popular, we have a wide selection of hotels.

The second quarter was one on which the strength and breadth of the Expedia Inc. range of businesses really shone through. trivago continued to grow scale and gain share in the global travel advertising market. The HomeAway transition and the Orbitz migration each continued to progress well and deliver ahead of plan. Egencia continued to execute on its near-term objectives while remaining on track to deliver on sizable long-term potential. And although we delivered nicely against our profit objectives with adjusted EBITDA up 18% to $331 million, we did see room night growth deaccelerate more than we're satisfied with. I'll touch on each of these factors in a bit more detail.
trivago topped $200 million in stand-alone revenue this quarter for growth of 41% or 38% currency neutral. On a trailing 12-month basis, trivago generated over $660 million of revenue and has become a leading scale player in the travel advertising space while building profitably. 
A little bit of perspective here. We've grown trivago revenue nearly sixfold since 2012 when we partnered up with the founding team, and today, trivago's TTM revenue is greater and growing faster than TripAdvisor's when we spun off that company. 
I'm sure investors are wondering about the put/call arrangement that we have in place with the trivago founders, so let me update you now. Neither Expedia nor the trivago founders exercise their option under the open put/call window this year, and we've instead agreed to explore the feasibility of an IPO of trivago shares with the preliminary and ambitious goal of completing the IPO before year-end. An IPO would allow investors to value trivago as a separate stand-alone company. Note that this is an IPO, not a spin-off. Expedia does not plan to sell any of our shares in IPO, and there are no guarantees that an IPO will ultimately be pursued or be successful. The put/call window could reopen in March 2017 if an IPO is not completed by then. And due to legal limitations, our ability to comment further on an IPO or on future performance is extremely limited. Therefore, we'll not be updating or otherwise commenting on our outlook for trivago for this quarter or beyond, or answering related questions on the call.
The HomeAway transition continues to go very well. We've now implemented the traveler service fee in all major markets, allowing us to increase investments in technology and product as well as marketing in order to build our brand globally. 
HomeAway Q2 revenue grew 36% year-on-year on a pro forma basis, driven by strength in both subscription and transactional revenue. And based on current trends, we expect revenue growth to accelerate in the second half of the year. 
Although this transition is not easy, we believe the pivot from pure classified advertising to a travel e-commerce business is a winning plan that will allow us to create better products for consumers and drive more bookings through our homeowner and property manager partners. In addition, as we move more of HomeAway's business to online bookable, we'll be more aggressive in offering HomeAway inventory on our OTA brands, which will drive even more booking volume and will give our huge global customer base more places to stay. 
The Orbitz migration is running nicely ahead of planned timelines with Orbitz and CheapTickets apps as well as the ebookers site and app now on the Expedia platform and the migration of the Orbitz for business clients onto the Egencia platform complete. Although we still have some migration work to do with a number of Orbitz Partner Network customers, something that will continue into 2017, we're pleased that the heavy lifting of the Orbitz Worldwide integration is largely behind us. 
Orbitz generated a healthy $54 million in adjusted EBITDA, representing a margin of approximately 28%. Given the speed with which we've executed the integration, we're incrementally optimistic about the delivery of Orbitz-related synergies in the back half of the year. 
Now the good work on the Orbitz front did, however, come at an operational cost with our room night growth deaccelerating more than we planned. The weight of the Orbitz book of business, combined with other recent acquisitions and organic growth in our core business, strained our infrastructure and affected network quality and uptime. We've addressed the vast majority of these issues and believe that they're now largely behind us. 
In addition, given the shift of the team's focus towards integration, our test and learn velocity was not where we want it to be, and our conversion rate increases slowed on a year-on-year basis versus prior quarters. The result of this included a slowdown at the metasearch channel not only due to continued weakness at TripAdvisor, partially due to Instant Book, but also trivago, where we saw our click share decrease. With the largest part of the Orbitz integration now complete, the teams are back to core execution mode with focus on regaining momentum on the conversion and marketing fronts. 
We operate in a very dynamic and competitive market and are no strangers to speed bumps along the way, and we continue to expect to deliver a strong year for the company.
Now I'll turn it over to Mark on the financials."
25915843,332689818,1016694,"Expedia Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2016",2016-07-28,"Earnings Calls","Expedia Group, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Dara. The adjusted EBITDA of $331 million that we delivered in Q2 was a solid result. From a brand perspective, we saw good results relative to our expectations on Hotels.com, Egencia, Expedia Affiliate Network and Travelocity. And as Dara menti",841,"Thanks, Dara. 
The adjusted EBITDA of $331 million that we delivered in Q2 was a solid result. From a brand perspective, we saw good results relative to our expectations on Hotels.com, Egencia, Expedia Affiliate Network and Travelocity. And as Dara mentioned, the profits delivered by the Orbitz brand so far in 2016 have been better than we had expected. The HomeAway and trivago teams are also executing very well in delivering great results. 
Hotel revenue grew 14% in Q2 on room night growth of 20%. Orbitz contributed approximately 8 percentage points of room night growth for the quarter. In addition to the factors Dara described earlier, lower organic room night growth in Q2 compared to Q1 was also driven by the shift of Easter into the first quarter this year and a small impact from Leap Day in Q1, which, if normalized, would have reduced room night growth in Q1 by about 3 percentage points and increased Q2 by about 1 percentage point. 
There have been a number of terrorist attacks in recent geographies over the past months. When isolated events occur, we historically have seen an immediate reduction in bookings and an increase in cancellations for the impacted destination. Typically, most of that demand gets diverted to other destinations, and over time, normal travel patterns seem to return. Though we are hopeful to see the same patterns repeat themselves, the frequency of recent events is giving us reason to be incrementally cautious. This is something that we'll continue to monitor as the year progresses. 
Average daily rates declined less than 1% in Q2, and revenue per room night decreased by about 5 percentage points. The gap between the 2 narrowed again this quarter, down to 440 basis points compared to about 540 basis points in Q1. We saw a continued broad strength in other product lines with air tickets up 45% and rental car days up 36%. Note that Orbitz added 30 percentage points to ticket growth and 24 percentage points to rental car days in Q2. Our ad and media revenue grew 42% on solid performance for both trivago and our Media Solutions group. 
From an expense perspective, setting aside the inorganic components from HomeAway and Orbitz, we saw leverage in cost of revenue again this quarter as the teams continue to drive efficiencies. You'll see that the year-over-year organic growth in direct and selling and marketing expenses was lower in Q2 than in Q1, partially in conjunction with the lower top line trends with variable performance-based marketing making up a large portion of this expense category. We did, however, see an elevated pace of growth in technology and content expenses as we had expected, driven by an increase in cost to support Orbitz integration efforts and growth in the core business, accelerated hiring as we brought Orbitz team members onto our Brand Expedia team early this year and expenses associated with the migration of certain functionality to the cloud. We expect the growth and technical content expense to remain elevated but to begin to moderate in the back half of the year. 
G&A expense grew a bit faster than revenue this quarter on some discrete legal and professional fees. Note that we are expecting to see leverage in G&A expense in the back half of the year.
Turning to our financial expectations for 2016. On a consolidated basis, excluding eLong, we continue to expect full year adjusted EBITDA to grow 35% to 45% year-over-year. We do think that the contribution to full year adjusted EBITDA for Orbitz and HomeAway combined will be higher than our previous expectations with a relatively lower contribution from the rest of the business. Please note, however, that we are forecasting modestly improved organic room night growths in the back half of the year. And if that does not occur, we would likely see full year adjusted EBITDA growth closer to the lower end of the stated range. 
In terms of the shape of the back half of the year, I would just remind you of some discrete items that will favorably impact Q4 results. Orbitz synergies will be close to full run rate, and we'll get a full quarter benefit from HomeAway in the fourth quarter. We will also be comping the Paris attack, significant deal-related costs and the purchase accounting impacts of deferred revenue for both Orbitz and HomeAway. 
Before closing, I did want to give a bit more color regarding the build-out of our new corporate headquarter slated to take place over the next years. In March this year, we had indicated that capital outlay for the full build-out could run in the range of $1 billion to $1.2 billion. Since then, we have looked more closely at the design with a focus on budget and phase-in. And we now believe we can have the property ready for use in 2019 for something closer to half of the previous estimate. We expect to share more details as those plans are finalized. 
With that, let's open it up for some questions. Operator?"

Let me just kind of bridge you from the Q4 organic room night growth of 24% down to 12% and give you a sense of it. First of all, the time of our Q1 call, we were expecting a deceleration of somewhere between 500",526,"Hey, Naved, it's Mark. I'll take this one. Let me just kind of bridge you from the Q4 organic room night growth of 24% down to 12% and give you a sense of it. First of all, the time of our Q1 call, we were expecting a deceleration of somewhere between 500 and 700 basis points. Majority of that was coming from Easter, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, and we were also lapping over some significant ramp-up in both the Wotif and Travelocity businesses. Travelocity, because we'd taken over control of sales and marketing after the acquisition; and Wotif, because we had them on the platform; and then the law of large numbers; et cetera. So that was what we had expected. We did -- I mentioned in a few investor conferences in May that we had seen some slowdown and signaled that we were seeing a little bit more. And really, the majority of that incremental slowdown, we believe, is self-inflicted. There were a couple of big drivers there. One is we did have some network and infrastructure stability issues really focused in the first half of the quarter. A lot of this was driven by just organic growth in the business. But also, as we moved the Orbitz book of business onto our network infrastructure, it wobbled a little bit, and it took us a while to get it stabilized. The good news is, is that it is now stabilized, and the team's done a great job getting that back on track. The second self-inflicted wound, if you will, was a decision that we had made really to divert the vast majority of the Brand Expedia team tech and product resources towards the integration effort. And to good result, we've actually got the Orbitz brands onto the Expedia platform faster than we had expected, and we are seeing the financial benefit of that. The cost, however, was that our test and learn velocity in terms of the rate at which we were testing or releasing new features slower on a year-on-year basis than it would have been same time last year, and that has an impact on conversion. And when you impact your conversion, it impacts not only the transactions that are coming to you directly but also in variable channels. And Dara mentioned the slowdown that we were seeing in the metasearch channel. So that was really the majority of that, call it, 500 to 700 basis points of incremental slowdown beyond that, which we had expected. The rest of it, I -- it's very difficult to pinpoint. Certainly, we do remain in a intensely competitive marketplace. And any time we stop the innovation pace, we have competitors that are very quick to respond and take share, and we certainly did see that in the metasearch channels. Also, it's really hard to read the news and see what's happening in the overall geopolitical environment, particularly the terrorist attacks and the frequency of the recent terrorist attacks in Europe. And even though we can't pinpoint an overall impact exactly on that, it wouldn't surprise us if that's having some impact as well."

We will have more to say about distribution on Expedia and Hotels.com and all of our other brands, so stay tuned there. And I think, in general, the theme that you should look for is a much deeper integration of the HomeAway inventory onto the Expedia platforms, in general. In prior -- when we worked with HomeAway as partners before, the integration was more of a link-off experience. It was a little bit of a shock for users. And this HomeAway inventory is going to be fundamental to our product on a long-term basis, so we're making the kinds of investments that we have to, to make sure that the integration is perfect and our clients who are online bookable and especially instant bookable, got -- get plenty more traffic the way they want that traffic."

It looks like it's working, and we think that the momentum there will continue, and you certainly see it in the Facebook results. As far as the Facebook messenger bot, I think it's too early to tell. It's a promising technology. I think messaging technology, in general, whether on Facebook or other platforms, is something that we're quite interested in, both in terms of messaging itself on the platform and in terms of AI and machine learning that we can build in behind it to radically improve customer experience.

So I mean, we expected to be bringing in a really strong company, and we wrote a big check to bring in HomeAway. And I'd say so far the results have been better than expected. So I think that this alternative lodging space is a -- it's just a big space, and HomeAway is benefiting from that. And obviously, Airbnb, which is the other big player in the category, is clearly benefiting from it as well. The reaction when we did bring in the booking fees, et cetera, we did see a conversion decrease initially, but the great news is that the team, the HomeAway technology team, now they've got traffic, and they're able to optimize the site in a way that they weren't able to. So conversion is actually up on a year-on-year basis because of the optimization work, because of the feature work that the teams are embarking on. And I think that, that momentum is going to continue for some period of time when we look at HomeAway conversion versus, let's say, Hotels.com or Expedia conversion. And in like destinations, HomeAway conversion is far lower. So we think we've got plenty of work to do there, and we think that we got plenty of upside there. The other factor that we want to look at is subscription renewals and subscription renewal rates. And again, it's -- things look good there. So I think, listen, any time you change your model, you introduce some uncertainty into the marketplace, we've had to overcommunicate to our homeowners and our partners, but I think now we're settling down, and we can both build a great business together."

I mean, these are really smart, big companies, and they're making their own decision. I think the question that you asked about is it affecting us is clearly a question that we asked ourselves because we saw a slowdown in room nights, and we have 18,000 statisticians looking in every which way and every angle to see whether it's affected us. And the short answer is that we haven't seen any real correlation in our performance in chain-heavy markets versus chain-light markets. You would think that in a market that has lots of chains, you would see some conversion degradation or performance degradation to the extent that inventory is -- inventory quality is lessening, but we haven't seen any of that whatsoever. It may happen. It may not happen. But to date, we haven't seen any correlation at all. What we have seen is we have seen a shift of our bookings from some of the chains that are discounting to independents and/or chains that are not discounting. So there has been certainly a share shift, and maybe that was affecting Marriott ADRs. And a share shift actually, in an interesting way, is giving us a margin upside. So from that standpoint, that has not been bad. Although, we're not necessarily managing for margin. I think the other perspective as to whether they're going to continue or not is we attract brand-agnostic travelers as far as what hotel they're staying at or what chain they're staying at. And actually, like if you look at Hotels.com on a global basis, the biggest chains in the world, the largest hotel chains get point -- less than 0.5% of searches on the Hotels.com site. Just to make sure you understand that. Someone comes on Hotels.com, less than 0.5% of them are searching for specific large brand out there. So these are folks who want a great hotel in Paris, and it's a terrific opportunity for great hotels in Paris to stand up and to market themselves to someone who hasn't yet become loyal to a chain. And we have partners who are, at this point, standing up. The economy is a little bit weaker than it has been before, so we are seeing some promotional activity and discount activity. And so far, we're satisfied with the quality of inventory. Now we'll watch this. The big chains are marketing aggressively. So as far as competitive brand marketing activity, probably not good for us. But we haven't seen any direct effect as a result of their actions, and we'll work with them because we definitely want to grow with the chains. We think that's a positive way to grow going forward, and we continue to have promising dialogue with them."

So with respect to the trajectory for room night growth, if you look at what I said around kind of the self-inflicted piece of what we saw in the second quarter, half of the, call it, 500 -- around half of the 500 to 700 basis points of decel that we have not anticipated is self-inflicted, and a chunk of that's related to the network instability and infrastructure that we've now solved. So we are expecting to, through the back part of this year, work our way and claw back that piece of the business that was self-inflicted, both as network and infrastructure issue, also as we ramp-up test and learn velocity and get year-on-year conversion improvements back. Against that, I guess, plan, if you will, that we're executing against things that in our control is this backdrop of just the increasing frequency of terrorism. And to put some numbers on it, historically, we have seen these destinations that experience these types of terrible things drop, and then they pop back in a matter of weeks, if not months. But if you take France as a destination, for example, which has had just a terrible go of it, room night growth pre the most recent Paris attacks was in and around the mid-20s. After the Paris attacks, it settled out into low single digits. As soon as Brussels happened, it hit negative single digits. And since Nice, it's been down double digits, like mid-20s. So we have not seen the recovery in France. And so although we're hopeful that we will see a recovery, just the pace of this has got us into uncharted territory. Now the upside of this is that we are seeing places, particular places in Spain, Ireland, et cetera, we're seeing increasing volume there. Clearly, people are shifting the places that they're traveling to, but we're cautious that this could just put a negative tone on -- just on the overall, at least European travel trends. Just to touch on Brexit quickly, which was one of the other things you mentioned, the Brexit response was similar to what we see any time we see currency moves, and it was really currency-related. As soon as the pound devalued versus the U.S. dollar, we saw bookings, particularly into London out of the U.S., increase pretty significantly. But beyond that, we haven't seen a significant impact, and I think for now, we're not expecting to see one."

So simple answer on the first question is both HomeAway and trivago report into revenue and not into bookings. So you've got inorganic and HomeAway dropping directly into that and then trivago organic revenue growth, obviously very strong and faster than the overall business with no bookings offset. So that's the big driver. In terms of gross bookings on the site, and the impact of the booking fee, I mean, we generally are seeing very strong results there. As a reminder, we now have 1 million online bookable properties, so more transactions are coming online. We -- last quarter, we actually reported a booked transactional revenue number, just to give you a sense of it. And what that represented is, essentially, the revenue that HomeAway derives from bookings that happened online on a booked basis, recognition happens on stay. That number this quarter was well north of 200% year-over-year. So we're seeing really strong results there, and we're able to actually put that increased volume and increased revenue that HomeAway has back into the business. And one of the most significant investments that HomeAway has been making is not only in product and technology to make the experience better for both owners and managers as well as consumers, but they put a significant amount of money back into sales and marketing. And in fact, the first half of this year, direct sales and marketing spend, up over 80% year-over-year. So really creating this flywheel. And it just seems the more volume we create, the more attractive online bookability comes -- becomes for owners and managers.

There have been significant cancellations, and then you have a couple of weeks of, call it, business being -- running below normal. And usually, you see that the patterns of travel kind of work around the uncertainty or the interruptions. So as an example, presently, we see Spain as a destination, being incredibly strong. Why is that? It's obviously because France as a destination is weak. Turkey is weak. A bunch of other summer sun destinations that Europeans used to travel to are down. So Spain is really strong. Now with all the activity here, is it having an overall effect on the travel market? I can only say maybe. We don't see it in general. Historically, we've seen travel grow at GDP plus 3% to 4%, and we've seen online travel kind of grow faster than that. We've got exposure to Asia in some markets which kind of make our growth rate even significantly higher than the overall travel growth rate. And I'd expect more of the same. There may be a general slowdown. I wouldn't predict it because we haven't seen it before. But even if there is, we think companies like ours, companies that are strong on the technology and customer and brand side, can grow through any kind of these interruptions."

As far as Orbitz goes, the Orbitz integration was fundamentally different from Travelocity. Because if you remember, Travelocity initially was a technology integration as it related to that asset which was owned by Sabre. So Sabre really had to work with a bunch of the -- had to deal with the headcount issues, the employee issues, and we just had to deal with the technology integration. Orbitz coming in was not only integrating technology but also took kind of the efforts of lots and lots of people across the company because we're essentially bringing the company in. So that's one. The second is that Orbitz is a number of brands. It's not just Orbitz. It's a ebookers brand. We closed down Hotel Club in Asia. We are integrating the Orbit Partner Network (sic) [Orbitz Partner Network] and Orbitz for Business. So it is a substantially larger and more complex integration than the Travelocity integration. And I do think that another factor is that, listen, we brought in Travelocity, we brought in Wotif, and we brought in Orbitz. So I think I don't know what the total time between those 3 integrations were, but it's 3 integrations one after the other. And I think that probably each integration maybe knocked us back by 5% or 10%, and the 5% or 10% started adding up with the last integration, the Orbitz integration being the biggest one and the most challenging one. Super, super proud of the company for getting it done. We knew that it was a challenge through the second quarter, and we said, ""You know what, let's put our heads down, get it done, so we can get back to kind of core execution,"" and we're there. And expectations for us internally are high. We think that we're going to execute. We have before, and I think we will again. As far as HomeAway inventory, adding urban inventory to the mix, we're looking at adding inventory all over. I do think that our strengths tend to be in the resort area as far as sun destinations, mountain destinations, et cetera. But we are adding urban listings as well. And I think that as we integrate more fundamentally with Hotels.com, Expedia, Travelocity, Orbitz, the pace of urban listing acquisition is going to increase."

So we're very pleased with it, and I think there's more to come. Not a big factor in the revenue per room night and ADR story at this point. The narrowing of the gap there is really largely due to the reasons that we predicted, is that we are getting to the end of our margin reduction strategy here. And we are starting to see just better, better trends there, and that's something that we do expect to continue here over the next little while. And then the last thing that's helped that is something that Dara mentioned, which is we are seeing a mix of our business towards independent hotels that are taking advantage of our marketplace and taking advantage of, really, the less attractive pricing that, in many cases, some of the big chain partners are providing to our consumers."

So the vast majority of our direct sales and marketing is variable to our performance in nature. And in a sense, it's auto adjusting, which is when we have lower year-on-year conversion gains, as Dara mentioned, we have seen, particularly at Brand Expedia, we automatically, essentially adjust and pull back a little bit because we're very focused on making sure that we maintain the appropriate profitability. And that said, those channels themselves are the least profitable channels that we have. And so when we do have a slowdown in conversion, it does translate into room night growth, and the first channels to go are the ones that are most expensive. So there's a natural offsetter, a natural hedge that we see in our P&L. With respect to macro and the challenge we saw in metasearch in Europe and changes, listen, I think the biggest change is that we are very focused on, getting our year-on-year test and learn velocity right back up where it should be. We are hopeful that, that will improve conversion rates. And then we will hopefully see the exact reverse of what we saw in the second quarter, which is room night growth accelerating back up and sales and marketing going back up with it, and hopefully, a little bit less than room nights."

So usually at the beginning of the year, Q1 and Q2, the team really tries to sign up as many hoteliers and partners as we can. And probably, during the summer, we're a little more focused on managing rates and managing inventory and managing promotions, so that we can deliver as much volume to our partners as we can.

So for us, it's about kind of rolling forward with the formula that we have in place, which is adding to supply, driving conversion improvements on the site, using those conversion improvements to fund additional marketing, and then keeping those new users in the marketplace through leading loyalty programs both at Hotels.com and Expedia. So we'll watch it. The margin improvements are probably going to be a financial positive, but there's not really an agenda on the margin side. We're really trying to offer the best hotel at the best rate to our consumers, and that's what we're solving for. Everything else kind of flows from there. I would say that in every market, we are making sure that we have a wide selection of hotels that are providing us the best inventory at the best price. So we do look at a market-by-market basis. Sometimes, we'll even look at neighborhood by neighborhood to make sure that, where there are neighborhoods that are especially popular, we have a wide selection of hotels. We work with those hotels on inventory and pricing and promotion and sort, et cetera. And so far, the results have been good, and it's something that we'll watch quite closely."

The following discussion, including responses to your questions, reflects management's views as of today, July 28, 2016, only. We do not undertake any obligation to update or revise this information.
As always, some of the statements made on today's call are forward-looking, typically preceded by words such as we expect, we believe, we anticipate, or similar statements. Please refer to today's press release and the company's filings with the SEC for information about factors which could cause our actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements.

I encourage you to periodically visit our Investor Relations site for important content, including today's earnings release.
As a reminder, we sold our 62.4% ownership stake in eLong on May 22, 2015, which was previously a consolidated entity of Expedia Inc. For GAAP accounting purposes, the results of eLong are included in our results through the date of the sale. In order to allow investors to compare our current results on a like-for-like basis with our historical results, our commentary in the earnings release and on this call is principally focused on our results excluding eLong, which should be considered in addition to the GAAP results on a fully consolidated basis.
Finally, unless otherwise stated, all references to cost of revenue, selling and marketing expense, general and administrative expense and technology and content expense also exclude stock-based compensation and depreciation expense.

The second quarter was one on which the strength and breadth of the Expedia Inc. range of businesses really shone through. trivago continued to grow scale and gain share in the global travel advertising market. The HomeAway transition and the Orbitz migration each continued to progress well and deliver ahead of plan. Egencia continued to execute on its near-term objectives while remaining on track to deliver on sizable long-term potential. And although we delivered nicely against our profit objectives with adjusted EBITDA up 18% to $331 million, we did see room night growth deaccelerate more than we're satisfied with. I'll touch on each of these factors in a bit more detail.
trivago topped $200 million in stand-alone revenue this quarter for growth of 41% or 38% currency neutral. On a trailing 12-month basis, trivago generated over $660 million of revenue and has become a leading scale player in the travel advertising space while building profitably. 
A little bit of perspective here. We've grown trivago revenue nearly sixfold since 2012 when we partnered up with the founding team, and today, trivago's TTM revenue is greater and growing faster than TripAdvisor's when we spun off that company. 
I'm sure investors are wondering about the put/call arrangement that we have in place with the trivago founders, so let me update you now. Neither Expedia nor the trivago founders exercise their option under the open put/call window this year, and we've instead agreed to explore the feasibility of an IPO of trivago shares with the preliminary and ambitious goal of completing the IPO before year-end. An IPO would allow investors to value trivago as a separate stand-alone company. Note that this is an IPO, not a spin-off. Expedia does not plan to sell any of our shares in IPO, and there are no guarantees that an IPO will ultimately be pursued or be successful. The put/call window could reopen in March 2017 if an IPO is not completed by then. And due to legal limitations, our ability to comment further on an IPO or on future performance is extremely limited. Therefore, we'll not be updating or otherwise commenting on our outlook for trivago for this quarter or beyond, or answering related questions on the call.
The HomeAway transition continues to go very well. We've now implemented the traveler service fee in all major markets, allowing us to increase investments in technology and product as well as marketing in order to build our brand globally. 
HomeAway Q2 revenue grew 36% year-on-year on a pro forma basis, driven by strength in both subscription and transactional revenue. And based on current trends, we expect revenue growth to accelerate in the second half of the year. 
Although this transition is not easy, we believe the pivot from pure classified advertising to a travel e-commerce business is a winning plan that will allow us to create better products for consumers and drive more bookings through our homeowner and property manager partners. In addition, as we move more of HomeAway's business to online bookable, we'll be more aggressive in offering HomeAway inventory on our OTA brands, which will drive even more booking volume and will give our huge global customer base more places to stay. 
The Orbitz migration is running nicely ahead of planned timelines with Orbitz and CheapTickets apps as well as the ebookers site and app now on the Expedia platform and the migration of the Orbitz for business clients onto the Egencia platform complete. Although we still have some migration work to do with a number of Orbitz Partner Network customers, something that will continue into 2017, we're pleased that the heavy lifting of the Orbitz Worldwide integration is largely behind us. 
Orbitz generated a healthy $54 million in adjusted EBITDA, representing a margin of approximately 28%. Given the speed with which we've executed the integration, we're incrementally optimistic about the delivery of Orbitz-related synergies in the back half of the year. 
Now the good work on the Orbitz front did, however, come at an operational cost with our room night growth deaccelerating more than we planned. The weight of the Orbitz book of business, combined with other recent acquisitions and organic growth in our core business, strained our infrastructure and affected network quality and uptime. We've addressed the vast majority of these issues and believe that they're now largely behind us. 
In addition, given the shift of the team's focus towards integration, our test and learn velocity was not where we want it to be, and our conversion rate increases slowed on a year-on-year basis versus prior quarters. The result of this included a slowdown at the metasearch channel not only due to continued weakness at TripAdvisor, partially due to Instant Book, but also trivago, where we saw our click share decrease. With the largest part of the Orbitz integration now complete, the teams are back to core execution mode with focus on regaining momentum on the conversion and marketing fronts. 
We operate in a very dynamic and competitive market and are no strangers to speed bumps along the way, and we continue to expect to deliver a strong year for the company.
Now I'll turn it over to Mark on the financials."
25915843,332689818,1017294,"Expedia Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2016",2016-07-28,"Earnings Calls","Expedia Group, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Dara. The adjusted EBITDA of $331 million that we delivered in Q2 was a solid result. From a brand perspective, we saw good results relative to our expectations on Hotels.com, Egencia, Expedia Affiliate Network and Travelocity. And as Dara menti",841,"Thanks, Dara. 
The adjusted EBITDA of $331 million that we delivered in Q2 was a solid result. From a brand perspective, we saw good results relative to our expectations on Hotels.com, Egencia, Expedia Affiliate Network and Travelocity. And as Dara mentioned, the profits delivered by the Orbitz brand so far in 2016 have been better than we had expected. The HomeAway and trivago teams are also executing very well in delivering great results. 
Hotel revenue grew 14% in Q2 on room night growth of 20%. Orbitz contributed approximately 8 percentage points of room night growth for the quarter. In addition to the factors Dara described earlier, lower organic room night growth in Q2 compared to Q1 was also driven by the shift of Easter into the first quarter this year and a small impact from Leap Day in Q1, which, if normalized, would have reduced room night growth in Q1 by about 3 percentage points and increased Q2 by about 1 percentage point. 
There have been a number of terrorist attacks in recent geographies over the past months. When isolated events occur, we historically have seen an immediate reduction in bookings and an increase in cancellations for the impacted destination. Typically, most of that demand gets diverted to other destinations, and over time, normal travel patterns seem to return. Though we are hopeful to see the same patterns repeat themselves, the frequency of recent events is giving us reason to be incrementally cautious. This is something that we'll continue to monitor as the year progresses. 
Average daily rates declined less than 1% in Q2, and revenue per room night decreased by about 5 percentage points. The gap between the 2 narrowed again this quarter, down to 440 basis points compared to about 540 basis points in Q1. We saw a continued broad strength in other product lines with air tickets up 45% and rental car days up 36%. Note that Orbitz added 30 percentage points to ticket growth and 24 percentage points to rental car days in Q2. Our ad and media revenue grew 42% on solid performance for both trivago and our Media Solutions group. 
From an expense perspective, setting aside the inorganic components from HomeAway and Orbitz, we saw leverage in cost of revenue again this quarter as the teams continue to drive efficiencies. You'll see that the year-over-year organic growth in direct and selling and marketing expenses was lower in Q2 than in Q1, partially in conjunction with the lower top line trends with variable performance-based marketing making up a large portion of this expense category. We did, however, see an elevated pace of growth in technology and content expenses as we had expected, driven by an increase in cost to support Orbitz integration efforts and growth in the core business, accelerated hiring as we brought Orbitz team members onto our Brand Expedia team early this year and expenses associated with the migration of certain functionality to the cloud. We expect the growth and technical content expense to remain elevated but to begin to moderate in the back half of the year. 
G&A expense grew a bit faster than revenue this quarter on some discrete legal and professional fees. Note that we are expecting to see leverage in G&A expense in the back half of the year.
Turning to our financial expectations for 2016. On a consolidated basis, excluding eLong, we continue to expect full year adjusted EBITDA to grow 35% to 45% year-over-year. We do think that the contribution to full year adjusted EBITDA for Orbitz and HomeAway combined will be higher than our previous expectations with a relatively lower contribution from the rest of the business. Please note, however, that we are forecasting modestly improved organic room night growths in the back half of the year. And if that does not occur, we would likely see full year adjusted EBITDA growth closer to the lower end of the stated range. 
In terms of the shape of the back half of the year, I would just remind you of some discrete items that will favorably impact Q4 results. Orbitz synergies will be close to full run rate, and we'll get a full quarter benefit from HomeAway in the fourth quarter. We will also be comping the Paris attack, significant deal-related costs and the purchase accounting impacts of deferred revenue for both Orbitz and HomeAway. 
Before closing, I did want to give a bit more color regarding the build-out of our new corporate headquarter slated to take place over the next years. In March this year, we had indicated that capital outlay for the full build-out could run in the range of $1 billion to $1.2 billion. Since then, we have looked more closely at the design with a focus on budget and phase-in. And we now believe we can have the property ready for use in 2019 for something closer to half of the previous estimate. We expect to share more details as those plans are finalized. 
With that, let's open it up for some questions. Operator?"

Let me just kind of bridge you from the Q4 organic room night growth of 24% down to 12% and give you a sense of it. First of all, the time of our Q1 call, we were expecting a deceleration of somewhere between 500 and 700 basis points. Majority of that was coming from Easter, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, and we were also lapping over some significant ramp-up in both the Wotif and Travelocity businesses. Travelocity, because we'd taken over control of sales and marketing after the acquisition; and Wotif, because we had them on the platform; and then the law of large numbers; et cetera. So that was what we had expected. We did -- I mentioned in a few investor conferences in May that we had seen some slowdown and signaled that we were seeing a little bit more. And really, the majority of that incremental slowdown, we believe, is self-inflicted. There were a couple of big drivers there. One is we did have some network and infrastructure stability issues really focused in the first half of the quarter. A lot of this was driven by just organic growth in the business. But also, as we moved the Orbitz book of business onto our network infrastructure, it wobbled a little bit, and it took us a while to get it stabilized. The good news is, is that it is now stabilized, and the team's done a great job getting that back on track. The second self-inflicted wound, if you will, was a decision that we had made really to divert the vast majority of the Brand Expedia team tech and product resources towards the integration effort. And to good result, we've actually got the Orbitz brands onto the Expedia platform faster than we had expected, and we are seeing the financial benefit of that. The cost, however, was that our test and learn velocity in terms of the rate at which we were testing or releasing new features slower on a year-on-year basis than it would have been same time last year, and that has an impact on conversion. And when you impact your conversion, it impacts not only the transactions that are coming to you directly but also in variable channels. And Dara mentioned the slowdown that we were seeing in the metasearch channel. So that was really the majority of that, call it, 500 to 700 basis points of incremental slowdown beyond that, which we had expected. The rest of it, I -- it's very difficult to pinpoint. Certainly, we do remain in a intensely competitive marketplace. And any time we stop the innovation pace, we have competitors that are very quick to respond and take share, and we certainly did see that in the metasearch channels. Also, it's really hard to read the news and see what's happening in the overall geopolitical environment, particularly the terrorist attacks and the frequency of the recent terrorist attacks in Europe. And even though we can't pinpoint an overall impact exactly on that, it wouldn't surprise us if that's having some impact as well."

And I think, in general, the theme that you should look for is a much deeper integration of the HomeAway inventory onto the Expedia platforms, in general. In prior -- when we worked with HomeAway as partners before, the integration was more of a link-off experience. It was a little bit of a shock for users. And this HomeAway inventory is going to be fundamental to our product on a long-term basis, so we're making the kinds of investments that we have to, to make sure that the integration is perfect and our clients who are online bookable and especially instant bookable, got -- get plenty more traffic the way they want that traffic."

So I mean, we expected to be bringing in a really strong company, and we wrote a big check to bring in HomeAway. And I'd say so far the results have been better than expected. So I think that this alternative lodging space is a -- it's just a big space, and HomeAway is benefiting from that. And obviously, Airbnb, which is the other big player in the category, is clearly benefiting from it as well. The reaction when we did bring in the booking fees, et cetera, we did see a conversion decrease initially, but the great news is that the team, the HomeAway technology team, now they've got traffic, and they're able to optimize the site in a way that they weren't able to. So conversion is actually up on a year-on-year basis because of the optimization work, because of the feature work that the teams are embarking on. And I think that, that momentum is going to continue for some period of time when we look at HomeAway conversion versus, let's say, Hotels.com or Expedia conversion. And in like destinations, HomeAway conversion is far lower. So we think we've got plenty of work to do there, and we think that we got plenty of upside there. The other factor that we want to look at is subscription renewals and subscription renewal rates. And again, it's -- things look good there. So I think, listen, any time you change your model, you introduce some uncertainty into the marketplace, we've had to overcommunicate to our homeowners and our partners, but I think now we're settling down, and we can both build a great business together."

I mean, these are really smart, big companies, and they're making their own decision. I think the question that you asked about is it affecting us is clearly a question that we asked ourselves because we saw a slowdown in room nights, and we have 18,000 statisticians looking in every which way and every angle to see whether it's affected us. And the short answer is that we haven't seen any real correlation in our performance in chain-heavy markets versus chain-light markets. You would think that in a market that has lots of chains, you would see some conversion degradation or performance degradation to the extent that inventory is -- inventory quality is lessening, but we haven't seen any of that whatsoever. It may happen. It may not happen. But to date, we haven't seen any correlation at all. What we have seen is we have seen a shift of our bookings from some of the chains that are discounting to independents and/or chains that are not discounting. So there has been certainly a share shift, and maybe that was affecting Marriott ADRs. And a share shift actually, in an interesting way, is giving us a margin upside. So from that standpoint, that has not been bad. Although, we're not necessarily managing for margin. I think the other perspective as to whether they're going to continue or not is we attract brand-agnostic travelers as far as what hotel they're staying at or what chain they're staying at. And actually, like if you look at Hotels.com on a global basis, the biggest chains in the world, the largest hotel chains get point -- less than 0.5% of searches on the Hotels.com site. Just to make sure you understand that. Someone comes on Hotels.com, less than 0.5% of them are searching for specific large brand out there. So these are folks who want a great hotel in Paris, and it's a terrific opportunity for great hotels in Paris to stand up and to market themselves to someone who hasn't yet become loyal to a chain. And we have partners who are, at this point, standing up. The economy is a little bit weaker than it has been before, so we are seeing some promotional activity and discount activity. And so far, we're satisfied with the quality of inventory. Now we'll watch this. The big chains are marketing aggressively. So as far as competitive brand marketing activity, probably not good for us. But we haven't seen any direct effect as a result of their actions, and we'll work with them because we definitely want to grow with the chains. We think that's a positive way to grow going forward, and we continue to have promising dialogue with them."

So with respect to the trajectory for room night growth, if you look at what I said around kind of the self-inflicted piece of what we saw in the second quarter, half of the, call it, 500 -- around half of the 500 to 700 basis points of decel that we have not anticipated is self-inflicted, and a chunk of that's related to the network instability and infrastructure that we've now solved. So we are expecting to, through the back part of this year, work our way and claw back that piece of the business that was self-inflicted, both as network and infrastructure issue, also as we ramp-up test and learn velocity and get year-on-year conversion improvements back. Against that, I guess, plan, if you will, that we're executing against things that in our control is this backdrop of just the increasing frequency of terrorism. And to put some numbers on it, historically, we have seen these destinations that experience these types of terrible things drop, and then they pop back in a matter of weeks, if not months. But if you take France as a destination, for example, which has had just a terrible go of it, room night growth pre the most recent Paris attacks was in and around the mid-20s. After the Paris attacks, it settled out into low single digits. As soon as Brussels happened, it hit negative single digits. And since Nice, it's been down double digits, like mid-20s. So we have not seen the recovery in France. And so although we're hopeful that we will see a recovery, just the pace of this has got us into uncharted territory. Now the upside of this is that we are seeing places, particular places in Spain, Ireland, et cetera, we're seeing increasing volume there. Clearly, people are shifting the places that they're traveling to, but we're cautious that this could just put a negative tone on -- just on the overall, at least European travel trends. Just to touch on Brexit quickly, which was one of the other things you mentioned, the Brexit response was similar to what we see any time we see currency moves, and it was really currency-related. As soon as the pound devalued versus the U.S. dollar, we saw bookings, particularly into London out of the U.S., increase pretty significantly. But beyond that, we haven't seen a significant impact, and I think for now, we're not expecting to see one."

So simple answer on the first question is both HomeAway and trivago report into revenue and not into bookings. So you've got inorganic and HomeAway dropping directly into that and then trivago organic revenue growth, obviously very strong and faster than the overall business with no bookings offset. So that's the big driver. In terms of gross bookings on the site, and the impact of the booking fee, I mean, we generally are seeing very strong results there. As a reminder, we now have 1 million online bookable properties, so more transactions are coming online. We -- last quarter, we actually reported a booked transactional revenue number, just to give you a sense of it. And what that represented is, essentially, the revenue that HomeAway derives from bookings that happened online on a booked basis, recognition happens on stay. That number this quarter was well north of 200% year-over-year. So we're seeing really strong results there, and we're able to actually put that increased volume and increased revenue that HomeAway has back into the business. And one of the most significant investments that HomeAway has been making is not only in product and technology to make the experience better for both owners and managers as well as consumers, but they put a significant amount of money back into sales and marketing. And in fact, the first half of this year, direct sales and marketing spend, up over 80% year-over-year. So really creating this flywheel. And it just seems the more volume we create, the more attractive online bookability comes -- becomes for owners and managers. And we're starting to get real traction there that we're very pleased to see."

I guess what I'd tell you is that this is an unusual time where uncertainty and the kind of terrorist activity that we're seeing is, it seems to be happening at a unprecedented rate. Historically, whenever we've seen something happen locally, there has been a reaction. There have been significant cancellations, and then you have a couple of weeks of, call it, business being -- running below normal. And usually, you see that the patterns of travel kind of work around the uncertainty or the interruptions. So as an example, presently, we see Spain as a destination, being incredibly strong. Why is that? It's obviously because France as a destination is weak. Turkey is weak. A bunch of other summer sun destinations that Europeans used to travel to are down. So Spain is really strong. Now with all the activity here, is it having an overall effect on the travel market? I can only say maybe. We don't see it in general. Historically, we've seen travel grow at GDP plus 3% to 4%, and we've seen online travel kind of grow faster than that. We've got exposure to Asia in some markets which kind of make our growth rate even significantly higher than the overall travel growth rate. And I'd expect more of the same. There may be a general slowdown. I wouldn't predict it because we haven't seen it before. But even if there is, we think companies like ours, companies that are strong on the technology and customer and brand side, can grow through any kind of these interruptions."

The second is that Orbitz is a number of brands. It's not just Orbitz. It's a ebookers brand. We closed down Hotel Club in Asia. We are integrating the Orbit Partner Network (sic) [Orbitz Partner Network] and Orbitz for Business. So it is a substantially larger and more complex integration than the Travelocity integration.

And expectations for us internally are high. We think that we're going to execute. We have before, and I think we will again. As far as HomeAway inventory, adding urban inventory to the mix, we're looking at adding inventory all over. I do think that our strengths tend to be in the resort area as far as sun destinations, mountain destinations, et cetera. But we are adding urban listings as well. And I think that as we integrate more fundamentally with Hotels.com, Expedia, Travelocity, Orbitz, the pace of urban listing acquisition is going to increase."

There's still a lot of training to do and a lot of behavior for hoteliers to learn, but we're seeing great uptick. I mean, we've got thousands of hotels that are actively using the tool, and we expect that it's going to go up significantly from there. The hotels that use it are finding exactly what they might expect, which is they're getting incremental volume when they need it at an overall yield, which is attractive to them. So we're very pleased with it, and I think there's more to come. Not a big factor in the revenue per room night and ADR story at this point. The narrowing of the gap there is really largely due to the reasons that we predicted, is that we are getting to the end of our margin reduction strategy here. And we are starting to see just better, better trends there, and that's something that we do expect to continue here over the next little while. And then the last thing that's helped that is something that Dara mentioned, which is we are seeing a mix of our business towards independent hotels that are taking advantage of our marketplace and taking advantage of, really, the less attractive pricing that, in many cases, some of the big chain partners are providing to our consumers."

And you also mentioned there were some room night growth deceleration around integration efforts.

So the vast majority of our direct sales and marketing is variable to our performance in nature. And in a sense, it's auto adjusting, which is when we have lower year-on-year conversion gains, as Dara mentioned, we have seen, particularly at Brand Expedia, we automatically, essentially adjust and pull back a little bit because we're very focused on making sure that we maintain the appropriate profitability. And that said, those channels themselves are the least profitable channels that we have. And so when we do have a slowdown in conversion, it does translate into room night growth, and the first channels to go are the ones that are most expensive. So there's a natural offsetter, a natural hedge that we see in our P&L. With respect to macro and the challenge we saw in metasearch in Europe and changes, listen, I think the biggest change is that we are very focused on, getting our year-on-year test and learn velocity right back up where it should be. We are hopeful that, that will improve conversion rates. And then we will hopefully see the exact reverse of what we saw in the second quarter, which is room night growth accelerating back up and sales and marketing going back up with it, and hopefully, a little bit less than room nights."

We really started investing in the sales team, and we continue to invest in that sales team, and they continue to deliver. If there's any seasonality, I'd say that we try to bring on a bunch of hotels prior to the big summer season when travelers are traveling. So usually at the beginning of the year, Q1 and Q2, the team really tries to sign up as many hoteliers and partners as we can. And probably, during the summer, we're a little more focused on managing rates and managing inventory and managing promotions, so that we can deliver as much volume to our partners as we can. But I think you should take the 25,000 as nothing unusual. It's going to be business as usual. And I think every quarter, we're going to add some amount close to that number. Whether it's a little bit lower or a little bit higher, really doesn't matter. I think from a long-term perspective, you should look at supply addition as being a growth factor for this business.

So we'll watch it. The margin improvements are probably going to be a financial positive, but there's not really an agenda on the margin side. We're really trying to offer the best hotel at the best rate to our consumers, and that's what we're solving for. Everything else kind of flows from there. I would say that in every market, we are making sure that we have a wide selection of hotels that are providing us the best inventory at the best price. So we do look at a market-by-market basis. Sometimes, we'll even look at neighborhood by neighborhood to make sure that, where there are neighborhoods that are especially popular, we have a wide selection of hotels.

Financial results for the third quarter were solid, with gross bookings up 21%, revenue up 33% and adjusted EBITDA up 42% year-on-year. Now that the Orbitz migration is largely complete, the focus of our core OTA segment has been squarely back to business as usual. As we mentioned on our last call, we weren't satisfied with our hotel volumes in Q2, and the teams have now been laser focused on driving core execution, product and conversion improvements, online and offline marketing and expansion of our supply footprint, all to drive stronger transactional growth. 
While you don't see the results yet in our Q3 stays, book to room night trends consistently improved throughout the quarter, especially with our global brands, Brand Expedia, Hotels.com and EAN, our private label business. Our regionally focused brands, however, are managing marketing spend more with an eye towards near-term profitability versus top line growth. While it's very early in Q4, October volumes continue to be healthy, and it feels good to be back to our operational formula.
Egencia is on track to deliver a solid year of growth and profitability as it continues to gain share on the managed corporate travel market, innovate and complete key technology projects to set the stage for its next phase of growth. Egencia has set an internal target to double its gross bookings by 2020 through organic as well as inorganic growth and is positioning itself as the most business traveler and product-centric company in corporate travel. We remain very optimistic about the prospects for substantial share gains for Egencia for many years to come.
Team trivago continues to gain share. Q3 revenue growth came in at a very strong 57% year-over-year, accelerating from an already strong Q2, while year-on-year profitability improved. trivago is seeing healthy growth in all regions, including its core European markets in the U.S., while reinvesting profits to scale up in major travel markets such as South Korea, Japan and others. 
Regarding the potential IPO for trivago, we're not going to be commenting on this call beyond our public statements, and we do not have any updated information to share on timing.
The HomeAway transition continued to progress nicely, with standalone revenue up 1% year-on-year and travel -- the traveler service fee now rolled out globally. 
A special thanks to cofounder Brian Sharples, who recently stepped away from his role as CEO while remaining Chairman of HomeAway to continue to help us navigate through a complex transformation. Brian and team created a terrific company that we plan to build on, with longtime Expedia executive John Kim who's been at HomeAway since early 2016 now stepping into the role of Company President. 
We're focused on hitting our long-term growth goals while aggressively ramping up our investment in product, technology, marketing and customer service to build the very best marketplace for homeowners, property managers and travelers alike. And though we're pleased with the progress, we're still early in HomeAway's transition into a scale global leader in the alternative accommodation market. 
In summary, while we never quite satisfied, overall results were solid and Q3 was most definitely a step in the right direction for our company. 
Now I'll turn it over to Mark."

The adjusted EBITDA of $667 million that we delivered in Q3 was a good result and broadly in line with our expectations for the quarter.

The adjusted EBITDA of $667 million that we delivered in Q3 was a good result and broadly in line with our expectations for the quarter. Better-than-expected results across most of our brands more than offset some bottom line weakness in Brand Expedia and Hotwire. HomeAway and Orbitz continued to perform well, and together, delivered a solid $150 million of adjusted EBITDA in the quarter. 
Hotel revenue grew 15% in Q3, slightly faster than in the second quarter on room night growth of 17%. Orbitz contributed approximately 6 percentage points of room night growth for the quarter. We are pleased to exit Q3 with stayed room night growth of 20% in September; 14%, excluding Orbitz. 
We are also pleased to see consistent acceleration in our book-to-room-night trends each month through the quarter, with strength continuing through October to date. 
Note, however, that as we improve execution, results are first being realized in the form of accelerating growth in the high-cost performance marketing channels such as metasearch and search engine marketing. We expect to invest some additional selling and marketing behind these positive trends, which could put incremental pressure on margins in the fourth quarter, a trade-up we're happy to make as we continue to rebuild momentum exiting the year. 
Average daily rates were up about 1% in Q3, while revenue per room night decreased by less than 2%. The gap between the 2 continued to narrow, down to about 280 basis points compared with 440 basis points in the second quarter. 
Pressure on room night economics have continued to abate as we lap over previous reductions in our hotel commission rates. 
We saw solid unit growth in our other product lines, with air tickets up 32% and rental car days up 34%. 
Note that Orbitz added 22 percentage points of inorganic ticket growth and 19 percentage points to rental car days in Q3. 
Revenue per ticket grew 15% in Q3 due in part to a onetime re-class of certain other revenue into air, favorable economics in a number of supply contracts and certain consumer fee tests. We expect revenue per ticket growth to return to a more normalized level in Q4. 
Our ad media revenue grew 50% on solid performance for both trivago and our Media Solutions group.
As you look at our top line growth expectations for Q4, please remember that we comped over the Orbitz acquisition at the end of the third quarter and, as such, all-in growth rates across our product lines will decelerate significantly beginning in Q4. 
Additionally, Orbitz growth bookings and revenue have been meaningfully down year-over-year on a standalone basis due to our discontinuation of certain brands and site functionality; our pulling back spend in certain marketing channels, with an eye to profit optimization; and some churn in Orbitz Partner Network and Orbitz for Business customers. This dynamic will put pressure on top line growth in Q4, with a more limited impact on profitability, given deal synergies and Orbitz' air-heavy product mix.
On a standalone basis, HomeAway revenue grew 61%, and adjusted EBITDA grew 85% in Q3. We were quite pleased with these results and, as such, continued ramping up investments and selling the marketing and in product and technology as we move forward into 2017.
Looking forward, these investments, combined with the phasing out of tiered subscription fees and the lapping the rollout of the consumer fee next year will result in slower adjusted EBITDA growth for HomeAway beginning in Q4 compared to what you saw here in Q3. Progress to date, combined with the investments we are making, give us continued confidence in our ability to deliver our targeted $350 million of adjusted EBITDA HomeAway in 2018.
From an expense perspective, on both an organic and all-in basis, we saw a nice leverage in cost of revenue, selling and marketing, people-related costs and G&A this quarter. Note that across all expense categories, year-over-year growth was partially offset by reduction of our incentive compensation accruals in Q3, given the relative underperformance in our core OTA business year-to-date. 
Technology and content expenses continued to grow faster than revenue, due in part to the year-over-year impact of hiring of talented tech teams earlier this year and our continued employment of transaction -- transitional resources in connection with the Orbitz integration. Looking forward, as we lap these additions and the remaining transitional resources roll off, on an all-in basis, we expect to see a further deceleration in the growth of technology and content expense to the high 20 to low 30 percentage range in the fourth quarter and further deceleration as we move into 2017.
I would note, however, that an additional driver to year-on-year growth in technology and content expense in the third quarter was the continuation of our -- our cloud migration efforts that we plan to operate our own data center footprint for core functionality for the foreseeable future, we have initiated a company-wide effort to migrate significant portions of our products and capabilities to the cloud computing environment over the next few years. 
The related expense for full year 2016 will be over $30 million, of which we have recognized approximately $20 million year-to-date. Current estimated expenditures on cloud for 2017 are more than double current year spending. While this represents an EBITDA headwind in the near term, we absolutely believe it's the right business decision, and we expect it to be nicely free cash flow positive over the medium to long term as we significantly reduce capital expenditures and other operating costs related to our own data centers over time.
Turning to our financial expectations for full year 2016, on a consolidated basis, excluding eLong, we're currently forecasting full year adjusted EBITDA growth approaching the midpoint of our 35% to 45% guidance range, with continued risk to the downside. We are pleased to see the improvement in recent room night growth trends and plan to invest behind it. This increase in marketing spend, coupled with the book-to-stay lag, may negatively impact Q4 profitability, which should set us up well as we move into 2017.
We expect the relative contributions of Orbitz and HomeAway versus our organic business to be broadly consistent with our guidance last quarter, better bottom line performance from these acquisitions, offsetting relative underperformance in the core business.
With that, let's open it up for some questions. Operator?"

And maybe you could expand on what's going on and what's kind of bring you out and was there a competitive shift.

And how do you think about the consumer fees offsetting some of the subscription revenues as we work into next year?"

As far as the volume trends and the execution of the base business, listen, it's just good to get back to execution on the core. There were a ton of people across the company focused in on the Orbitz integration. They did a terrific job. And note that, that acquisition integration came after Travelocity after Wotif. So I think the teams are -- there's a bit of relief for the teams to kind of get back to basics and get back to the business, and I think it's showing up in the numbers. You obviously don't see it in stays because there's a book-to-stay lag, but the business has been getting consistently stronger as we expected it to as Q3 progressed, and early Q4 looks really good. So I think -- listen, we expected it sometimes when you hit a speed bump, you wonder whether it's structural or whether it's temporal. I think this one is certainly proving out to be temporal. We don't take anything for granted. We are, as usual, when we kind of accelerate into certain markets, the variable channels tend to be very fast-twitch channels for us, so you may see some kind of sales and marketing pressure on that front. And then following the variable channels, you get some of the more direct channels. And so in general, I'd say the teams are not taking anything for granted. I think that Q2 taught us a little bit of a lesson in humility that, I think, everyone can use once in a while. But based on what we're seeing, the formula that we've established for the past 5 years still works, and there's no reason why it wouldn't work on a go-forward basis. And we're certainly seeing that in the results. As far as HomeAway goes, the transactional revenue has been very strong in Q3 as we've rolled it out on a global basis and as the teams now are optimizing much more aggressively on the conversion front. And so while the transactional fee initially caused a dip in conversion, the teams there are really building out their e-commerce capabilities and muscles, and conversion is a very nice positive factor for us. Traffic continues to build, although Google kind of free search continues to be kind of weak. But on balance, we like what we're seeing, and you see it in the results. I think that as you move into Q4, and especially next year, you're going to see some of the subscription premium revenue that we have stopped selling start coming down, so the transactional revenue essentially has to scale up faster in order to make up for some of the subscription revenue growth coming down. It's something that we expected. And then, of course, some of the investments that we're making in marketing and technology, et cetera, are also going to show. So I think -- team on HomeAway likes where we are, but we know that we've got a big lift ahead of us and kind of the slope is going to get a little tougher, but I think the teams are up for it."

It sounds like things are accelerating here but mostly in paid channels. I guess, I'm not sure I totally understand kind of why the direct traffic or the direct channel is sort of lagging kind of faster twitch paid channels. And then just on the HomeAway performance, strong quarter on EBITDA, was sort of in line-ish in terms of revenue for us. So can you just kind of remind us on that subscription revenue piece kind of how the renewals phase sort of through the year or kind of what percentage occur each quarter?"

So on the room night trends, basically what happens is when you start getting conversion back working -- if you can imagine everyone on your website right now has a higher probability of converting, and then the direct channel, that actually provides higher conversion rates and you get one benefit of that, and you also get it from those visitors that you brought via Google or metasearch. But then with that higher conversion rate, you actually adjust your bidding out rhythms to say I now expect a higher expected value from the traffic I'm getting from the variable channels on a go-forward basis. And at that point, you're allowed -- you're basically in a spot where you can take up your bids. And it adds an accelerator, if you will, in growth in those channels. So that's basically the impact. And then when you look at the impact of profitability, when you have that type of acceleration, what happens is, in the quarter where you're actually ramping up that spend, you only actually get to recognize a portion of the revenue because not all of the stays happen in that quarter, and we recognize revenue for our hotel business generally on the stay. With respect to HomeAway performance, listen, generally, the subscription renewals are spread throughout the year. As a reminder, we basically eliminated the tiers last quarter -- in the beginning of last quarter, grandfathering the number of the premium players. And those subscriptions that were at premium will essentially start rolling off here on a go-forward basis. And once they roll off, they will either reset at the close to $500-per-year subscription or the lower price we've set for online bookable properties. And so you'll essentially see the subscription revenue start to become a more negative headwind as we move through Q4 and in Q1 and Q2, and then you'll really start to annualize it in Q3 of next year. And then as a reminder, in terms of the traveler fee rollout, as you're thinking about next year, we launched the traveler fee just towards the very end of the first quarter last year in the U.S., and then Europe was towards the end of the second quarter."

There's a vacation rental tab on Expedia, for example, now, but that wasn't a full integration. That was essentially a link-off to HomeAway search results. And what we are talking about is a much more fundamental kind of integrated experience where someone who comes to an Expedia or Hotels.com and is searching for hotels, depending on length of stay, depending on weekday, weekend, et cetera, they are going to get a complementary mix of hotel search results and/or vacation rental results based on a number of different presentations and logic. We expect to be piloting that experience sometime in Q4. And based on the results of those pilots, I think we will be kind of making it a bigger part of our experience late this year and certainly going into next year. And I think it's a great benefit both for Expedia and Hotels.com consumers because they're going to get more breadth and depth of inventory in-market, especially in some of the markets where HomeAway is very strong. And then I think for HomeAway, our partners there, the homeowners, the property managers, they are going to get a significant boost of demand from these terrific travel brands, especially in urban destinations.

Listen, as far as other OTA or metasearch competition, I think every single call probably in the past 10 years we've referred to competition being tough. It's nothing new in this marketplace, and I think it's led to some of the consolidation that you've seen in the market more recently. There have been some players in Europe who were going out of business, so the competition is there. It is always difficult. The competitors are always getting better, and it's not good enough for a company to get better. You have get to get better faster. And I think we're on the good path now, and we expect our competitors to be as tough as they've always been. We've obviously seen some activity on the supplier kind of brand.com front as far as some of the kind of loyalty fares that have expanded now versus what we've seen in the past. We measure pretty carefully our performance in, call it, brand-heavy markets versus brand-light markets. We continue not to see any measurable difference between the 2, so it doesn't seem to be affecting our results. What it is doing is that it is shifting more share of our supply to independents who are growing faster than some of these brands, and also, too, there are some brands who are giving us kind of the best inventory. So in general, the players who are giving us the best inventory are growing faster on our marketplace, both in terms of direct bookings and then you would think as far as the traffic that they're acquiring. So -- and that shift actually is giving us some decent margin, call it relief versus what we've seen in the past. So you'll notice that revenue per room night trends are generally improving as the year has gone by, and some of it is due to the shift. So listen, we'll be watching it very closely. We obviously want to get the best inventory from all of our partners. The brands are very, very important partners of ours, and our goal is to build our business with them, not shrink our business with them. And we're investing in a number of new interaction methodologies, technologies to hopefully get there. As far as the markets -- the destination markets, I think in general, it was pretty solid across the board, and as we said, getting better. We did see some weakness in some markets in Florida relating to the Zika virus. There could be some offset in Mexico, for example. It's particularly strong now because Miami is weak. We don't exactly know. We were pleased to see Paris starting to grow again off of what was a pretty weak base. But it's great to see Paris now on the positive. The stay-in at Portugal were very strong this summer, both in terms of room nights as well as ADRs. And the U.K., funny enough, now with Brexit and the pound being weaker, London and the U.K. as a destination has become quite strong. So I'd say decent results, and the macro environment for us remains pretty good."

I believe Expedia+ is now close to 20 million if not over as far as our members go. And the members, both Hotels.com and Expedia+, as well as Orbitz, Orbucks members tend to come back to us. The repeat rates are significantly higher than nonmembers, and the direct to repeat rates or what we call organic repeat rates are significantly higher as well so you get higher spend and you get higher spend over more profitable channels. Now those behaviors tend to come over the lifetime of that member. So we pay for the member acquisition, and we pay for the points upfront, which is pressure on our P&L. You see some of that pressure in our revenue margins, and then we get the goodness as the member and the member base matures. The majority of our members at this point are in the U.S., but growth is very fast outside the U.S., especially in the Asia Pacific regions. We find that our APAC customers love a great deal. And the Hotels.com rewards program and Expedia rewards program, those are great deals. The other factor that's pretty interesting now is that we are getting more and more inventory through our hotel partners that is now available for members only. So these are discounts that are available only if you sign in so it's not a retail discount. It doesn't hurt ADR at all, but the hotels who are participating in these kinds of programs tend to gain share in our marketplace without giving up retail rate. So we think it's a win for our members, and it's certainly a win for hotel customers as well. We're in the tens of thousands of the hotels that are making these rates available so you can imagine it's very, very broad program, and it's attractive for our member base, and it's attractive for our partners."

So I think in terms of growth rates, we're looking at Q3 as kind of a high watermark, if you will. We're in this period where subscription revenue has not yet become a meaningful drag, and you have got very easy comps on the transactional revenue, and so you basically are dropping a lot of profit to the bottom line, and we haven't yet completely ramped up to full steam on sales and marketing and particularly, in technology and products. So those are 2 areas particularly where you'll see us start in Q4 and then particularly in through 2017, ramp investments aggressively. 2017, I will tell you is not a year where we will be as focused on adjusted EBITDA growth as we are in just building the capability, and that's for HomeAway specifically, and we expect that once we build up particularly the product and tech team to where the size we wanted to be, we'll be able to leverage of that nicely as revenue growth and ultimately marketing contribution growth continues into 2018. And again, we feel very comfortable with our $350 million adjusted EBITDA number for 2018, but the path there will be one of investment in '17 and realization in '18 from a bottom line perspective."

This is not kind of an incremental kind of our project for us. This is a big project for us. Hotel inventory is available very, very broadly all over the world. There are hundreds of agencies, travel agencies, distributors who have hotel inventory available, including these brands that have real scale. There are -- that kind of inventory, the alternative accommodations inventory is just not available as broadly, and for us to be able to build one of the count them in your hands numbers of scale players that are organizing this kind of inventory, which is very, very attractive to consumers all over the world, it's a very big opportunity so we're investing right behind that as such."

And the second question if I can, when you look at Orbitz on the hotel side as you get deeper into the integration of the core properties from Orbitz on the Expedia platform, are you guys seeing that traditional uptick in conversion rates that might allow you to step up spend in variable marketing channels around that brand or should we expect most of the synergy to come from the cost side there?

So on HomeAway, the $15 billion number that we put, we still feel comfortable with that number. To be honest we're not too focused on looking at what the total platform-derived bookings are at this point. What we're very focused on is taking the booking number that is actually happening on platform and growing it as fast as we possibly can. To do that, of course, we're getting properties online, and we're now well over 1 million properties that are online bookable. Then we're very much focused next and making sure that the online bookable listings are actually driving transactions on the platform as opposed to off the platform. And so far resulted in a good conversion rates are up pretty nicely year-over-year. Progress is pretty good. So again, I think there's a huge opportunity here. I think the total bogey of $15 billion growing nicely because the overall market is growing nicely is absolutely out there, but the way we're getting there is just really focusing on the online piece and driving that as hard as we can. With respect to the Orbitz integration, we're definitely seeing nice conversion results on the hotel product. I think converting that into stepping up in marketing is something that we're still playing with at this point. We've got 2 very strong global brands in Brand Expedia and Hotels.com. These are brands that we are investing in to build really for the long term. We think we've got a phenomenal brand also in Orbitz and in CheapTickets and ebookers and Wotif and Travelocity, but the brands that are more regional in nature, our approach thus far has been, yes, be players in this variable marketing channels where we can, but let's be a little bit more focused on profit as opposed to top line trend -- top line trends. So I think we're still evaluating our approach here. It's not set in stone, but generally, it's been a little bit more bottom line focused with the Orbitzes of the world versus top line-oriented."

You'll see it, for example, in our numbers as far as the intercompany spend with trivago has accelerated on a on a year-on-year basis Q3 compared to Q2 so you could see that on our numbers. And in general, the meta channels are improving. We still think we can do better so we're not satisfied there. As far as Instant Book goes, we continue to have constructive dialogue with TripAdvisor. No news to share at this point. I think the Instant Book marketplace, in general, is more mature now, kind of the brand representation is better than it was when that product was initially introduced. So in general, we are more favorably inclined to that product now than where we were before, but we haven't crossed the finish line at this point. We'll see where we wind up in the next couple of quarters. As far as the HomeAway goes, on the conversion front, you're right. We're improving it and we're on track. The marketing -- the variable marketing channels are going to be an increasing factor, but I wouldn't call them a substantial factor at this point for HomeAway. The teams, we actually brought a very, very talented executive from Hotels.com on to the HomeAway team. He had been running Hotels.com kind of online marketing for a while and did it very, very well, and so he has now joined the HomeAway team. So I think the HomeAway team is now building the muscle, conversion has gone in the right direction but really have to build the muscle to build a very, very strong variable marketing channel, and I think it's pretty early there. Also note that as we integrate the HomeAway inventory into Expedia and Hotels.com, Expedia and Hotels.com and Orbitz and Travelocity will also be able to bid more effectively for the vacation rental keywords as well. Who will be kind of the winner, will it be more efficient for HomeAway to bid on those keywords or Hotels.com? That remains to be seen, and we will be kind of testing and learning our way there, but I think it will be a bigger factor next year versus any time in the next couple of quarters."

As far as the reacceleration in Q4, listen, it's early, but we like the trends that we're seeing. There's no guarantee that those trends will continue so I don't want you to take too much confidence as far as how we're doing. We're just kind of reporting based on how we've done and what we're seeing so far. In general, as we look at the macro environment, I do think that some of the weakness that we saw as it related to our results in Q2 was self-inflicted. We were very open about that. The site's wasn't as stable as they needed to be, some of the experimentation wasn't as strong as they needed to be so we had to kind of get our own house in order. So I think it's difficult to compare our results and trends to macro trends because we went through a lot of changes here. We are seeing -- while domestic ADRs have been positive, when I look at kind of daily, weekly ADRs, they are weakening a little bit versus where they were in Q2 so that kind of agrees with some of the trends we're seeing. Our package inventory is in good shape. And again hoteliers kind of load in inventory into opaque channels such as packages and Hotwire and these Member Only Deals when they need a little more help, and it feels like some of the hoteliers need a little more help. On Egencia side, especially domestically, we're seeing a bit of caution as far as corporate travel spend goes. We don't see it in Europe, but we see it more domestically. So I'd say that on a macro basis, we're seeing some similar signs, which is a hint of weakness. We probably don't feel as much as some of the other folks just because this online channels growing channel, and we're riding that wave. And hopefully, the hotel partners who engage with us on the inventory front aggressively are going to ride with us and hopefully gain some share as we gain share. Mark, you want to talk mobile?"

Wotif, Hotwire that are bumping up against mid-40s to 50% range. Hotels.com is just behind them. And I think just the trend here is that we continue to see much faster growth in mobile than we do in desktop. Not surprisingly, we are seeing an increased shift of transactions in traffic to smartphone. Tablet is petering out. Mobile web is becoming more significant for us as we get much better hitting for mobile web traffic in variable channels. So hopefully, that will help you feel the trends that we're seeing."

As far as the opportunity and challenges around AI and VR, I think on the AI side, we're testing with some interesting technologies such as on the Facebook Messenger side, they're able to go back and forth with AI agents so to speak to book a hotel",400,"Sure. As far as the opportunity and challenges around AI and VR, I think on the AI side, we're testing with some interesting technologies such as on the Facebook Messenger side, they're able to go back and forth with AI agents so to speak to book a hotel on Expedia. It's pretty cool. You should try it out, and I think it's very, very -- it's a very, very early iteration of what a kind of consumer experience might look like. I personally think that the bigger, kind of the more significant opportunity in AI near to midterm is with highly repeatable, call it, simple tasks that consumers engage in. And if you combine kind of machine learning there with identity -- so for example, in Facebook Messenger, we have identity established, I think on the customer service side, you can have some pretty clean, great experiences. You're being able to messenger Expedia to change my Thursday night hotel booking to Friday or cancel my San Francisco hotel booking, et cetera, without having to call someone, without having to give an itinerary number, without having to really speak to anyone, just be able to message back and forth with essentially a bot to get your customer service requests done. Or for example, we're very, very -- we'd love to work with our hotel partners. Right now, you can message our hotels through some of our systems to be able to message a hotel and ask for a late checkout or early check-in, et cetera. Those, I think, are experiences where AI can service you because you've got high volumes, you've got repeatable tasks that a computer can kind of iterate against and learn from. So I think you'll see some of the sexy stuff on the bookings side, and then you'll see some of the unsexy stuff on the customer service side, and we plan to experiment with both of them. On the VR side, we are testing with kind of VR rigs as we speak. I think that the potential that we see with VR is to whet the appetite of someone looking at a destination, what experience they can have and/or a hotelier. So we want VR to be just good enough to make you want to go there but not good enough for you to avoid the trip, and I think we have plenty of time there."

And just as we are using the Expedia platform to power the Orbitz side with different experiences, power Wotif with different experiences, we will be able to extend that capability to a Marriott applications and other providers as well. We think that there are tons and tons of hotels out there and hotel chains out there, airlines out there who don't necessarily -- aren't necessarily able to keep investing and keep experimenting and keep optimizing leading sites that can accept payments in every single kind of payment plan known on earth. We can do that, and we can essentially extend our platform into the travel ecosystem, which is something that we're doing. And then on the supply inside, we're even tying in now supply from third parties where not only are we acquiring supply directly but we are piping in supply from other players, and we will kind of present the best choice for consumers based on what that best choice is, based on availability, based on pricing, et cetera. So it is a two-sided market place. We're very, very early in this. And then of course, we's have got a private label business, our EAN business that is actually one of the stars of the show. It's a business that's growing very, very quickly, especially in the Asia Pacific markets, and we're pretty optimistic about. And then lastly, Orbitz did have a very, very big private label business. It had, call it, more customization capability than what we have built on Expedia side where we have taken on that team, and they're very important part of our team now and they're building up, call it, the more the increased customization capability on top of the Expedia platform. So we're investing in this -- in this area. You're not done seeing, hopefully, surprising announcements in the future because I think our capabilities are going to get much, much better here."

And kind of every week, the numbers get better. It is still a new product, and it's not I would say significant driver of our overall results, but we do see it building, and we're quite pleased with the early signs so far. As far as Orbitz goes and one functionality, there was a number of, call it, packages-type functionality that we initially dropped off that we're going to be adding as time goes on. Ebookers in Europe had certain functionality what we call Sub Pop where they were they kind of price some airfare below published rates in order to go out and acquire customers. There was some fee technology that both Orbitz and ebookers have built variable fees, especially on the air side that we haven't carried through. At this point, these are all technologies that were actually pretty interesting but whenever you move on something from a technology side, you kind of introduce what we call on MVP, minimal viable product, and then you build on it. So some of this functionality may make its way back, some of it is very cool, but we wanted to move kind of Orbitz and ebookers over as quickly as possible. And I think the teams made the right trade of calls, and I think that they've executed quite well."

Financial results for the third quarter were solid, with gross bookings up 21%, revenue up 33% and adjusted EBITDA up 42% year-on-year. Now that the Orbitz migration is largely complete, the focus of our core OTA segment has been squarely back to business as usual. As we mentioned on our last call, we weren't satisfied with our hotel volumes in Q2, and the teams have now been laser focused on driving core execution, product and conversion improvements, online and offline marketing and expansion of our supply footprint, all to drive stronger transactional growth. 
While you don't see the results yet in our Q3 stays, book to room night trends consistently improved throughout the quarter, especially with our global brands, Brand Expedia, Hotels.com and EAN, our private label business. Our regionally focused brands, however, are managing marketing spend more with an eye towards near-term profitability versus top line growth. While it's very early in Q4, October volumes continue to be healthy, and it feels good to be back to our operational formula.
Egencia is on track to deliver a solid year of growth and profitability as it continues to gain share on the managed corporate travel market, innovate and complete key technology projects to set the stage for its next phase of growth. Egencia has set an internal target to double its gross bookings by 2020 through organic as well as inorganic growth and is positioning itself as the most business traveler and product-centric company in corporate travel. We remain very optimistic about the prospects for substantial share gains for Egencia for many years to come.
Team trivago continues to gain share. Q3 revenue growth came in at a very strong 57% year-over-year, accelerating from an already strong Q2, while year-on-year profitability improved. trivago is seeing healthy growth in all regions, including its core European markets in the U.S., while reinvesting profits to scale up in major travel markets such as South Korea, Japan and others. 
Regarding the potential IPO for trivago, we're not going to be commenting on this call beyond our public statements, and we do not have any updated information to share on timing.
The HomeAway transition continued to progress nicely, with standalone revenue up 1% year-on-year and travel -- the traveler service fee now rolled out globally. 
A special thanks to Co-Founder Brian Sharples, who recently stepped away from his role as CEO while remaining Chairman of HomeAway to continue to help us navigate through a complex transformation. Brian and team created a terrific company that we plan to build on, with longtime Expedia executive John Kim who's been at HomeAway since early 2016 now stepping into the role of Company President. 
We're focused on hitting our long-term growth goals while aggressively ramping up our investment in product, technology, marketing and customer service to build the very best marketplace for homeowners, property managers and travelers alike. And though we're pleased with the progress, we're still early in HomeAway's transition into a scale global leader in the alternative accommodation market. 
In summary, while we never quite satisfied, overall results were solid and Q3 was most definitely a step in the right direction for our company. 
Now I'll turn it over to Mark."

The adjusted EBITDA of $667 million that we delivered in Q3 was a good result and broadly in line with our expectations for the quarter. Better-than-expected results across most of our brands more than offset some bottom line weakness in Brand Expedia and Hotwire. HomeAway and Orbitz continued to perform well, and together, delivered a solid $150 million of adjusted EBITDA in the quarter. 
Hotel revenue grew 15% in Q3, slightly faster than in the second quarter on room night growth of 17%. Orbitz contributed approximately 6 percentage points of room night growth for the quarter. We are pleased to exit Q3 with stayed room night growth of 20% in September; 14%, excluding Orbitz. 
We are also pleased to see consistent acceleration in our book-to-room-night trends each month through the quarter, with strength continuing through October to date. 
Note, however, that as we improve execution, results are first being realized in the form of accelerating growth in the high-cost performance marketing channels such as metasearch and search engine marketing. We expect to invest some additional selling and marketing behind these positive trends, which could put incremental pressure on margins in the fourth quarter, a trade-up we're happy to make as we continue to rebuild momentum exiting the year. 
Average daily rates were up about 1% in Q3, while revenue per room night decreased by less than 2%. The gap between the 2 continued to narrow, down to about 280 basis points compared with 440 basis points in the second quarter. 
Pressure on room night economics have continued to abate as we lap over previous reductions in our hotel commission rates. 
We saw solid unit growth in our other product lines, with air tickets up 32% and rental car days up 34%. 
Note that Orbitz added 22 percentage points of inorganic ticket growth and 19 percentage points to rental car days in Q3. 
Revenue per ticket grew 15% in Q3 due in part to a onetime re-class of certain other revenue into air, favorable economics in a number of supply contracts and certain consumer fee tests. We expect revenue per ticket growth to return to a more normalized level in Q4. 
Our ad media revenue grew 50% on solid performance for both trivago and our Media Solutions group.
As you look at our top line growth expectations for Q4, please remember that we comped over the Orbitz acquisition at the end of the third quarter and, as such, all-in growth rates across our product lines will decelerate significantly beginning in Q4. 
Additionally, Orbitz growth bookings and revenue have been meaningfully down year-over-year on a standalone basis due to our discontinuation of certain brands and site functionality; our pulling back spend in certain marketing channels, with an eye to profit optimization; and some churn in Orbitz Partner Network and Orbitz for Business customers. This dynamic will put pressure on top line growth in Q4, with a more limited impact on profitability, given deal synergies and Orbitz' air-heavy product mix.
On a standalone basis, HomeAway revenue grew 61%, and adjusted EBITDA grew 85% in Q3. We were quite pleased with these results and, as such, continued ramping up investments and selling the marketing and in product and technology as we move forward into 2017.
Looking forward, these investments, combined with the phasing out of tiered subscription fees and the lapping the rollout of the consumer fee next year will result in slower adjusted EBITDA growth for HomeAway beginning in Q4 compared to what you saw here in Q3. Progress to date, combined with the investments we are making, give us continued confidence in our ability to deliver our targeted $350 million of adjusted EBITDA HomeAway in 2018.
From an expense perspective, on both an organic and all-in basis, we saw a nice leverage in cost of revenue, selling and marketing, people-related costs and G&A this quarter. Note that across all expense categories, year-over-year growth was partially offset by reduction of our incentive compensation accruals in Q3, given the relative underperformance in our core OTA business year-to-date. 
Technology and content expenses continued to grow faster than revenue, due in part to the year-over-year impact of hiring of talented tech teams earlier this year and our continued employment of transaction -- transitional resources in connection with the Orbitz integration. Looking forward, as we lap these additions and the remaining transitional resources roll off, on an all-in basis, we expect to see a further deceleration in the growth of technology and content expense to the high 20 to low 30 percentage range in the fourth quarter and further deceleration as we move into 2017.
I would note, however, that an additional driver to year-on-year growth in technology and content expense in the third quarter was the continuation of our -- our cloud migration efforts that we plan to operate our own data center footprint for core functionality for the foreseeable future, we have initiated a company-wide effort to migrate significant portions of our products and capabilities to the cloud computing environment over the next few years. 
The related expense for full year 2016 will be over $30 million, of which we have recognized approximately $20 million year-to-date. Current estimated expenditures on cloud for 2017 are more than double current year spending. While this represents an EBITDA headwind in the near term, we absolutely believe it's the right business decision, and we expect it to be nicely free cash flow positive over the medium to long term as we significantly reduce capital expenditures and other operating costs related to our own data centers over time.
Turning to our financial expectations for full year 2016, on a consolidated basis, excluding eLong, we're currently forecasting full year adjusted EBITDA growth approaching the midpoint of our 35% to 45% guidance range, with continued risk to the downside. We are pleased to see the improvement in recent room night growth trends and plan to invest behind it. This increase in marketing spend, coupled with the book-to-stay lag, may negatively impact Q4 profitability, which should set us up well as we move into 2017.
We expect the relative contributions of Orbitz and HomeAway versus our organic business to be broadly consistent with our guidance last quarter, better bottom line performance from these acquisitions, offsetting relative underperformance in the core business.
With that, let's open it up for some questions. Operator?"

As far as the volume trends and the execution of the base business, listen, it's just good to get back to execution on the core. There were a ton of people across the company focused in on the Orbitz integration. They did a terrific job. And note that, that acquisition integration came after Travelocity after Wotif. So I think the teams are -- there's a bit of relief for the teams to kind of get back to basics and get back to the business, and I think it's showing up in the numbers. You obviously don't see it in stays because there's a book-to-stay lag, but the business has been getting consistently stronger as we expected it to as Q3 progressed, and early Q4 looks really good. So I think -- listen, we expected it sometimes when you hit a speed bump, you wonder whether it's structural or whether it's temporal. I think this one is certainly proving out to be temporal. We don't take anything for granted. We are, as usual, when we kind of accelerate into certain markets, the variable channels tend to be very fast-twitch channels for us, so you may see some kind of sales and marketing pressure on that front. And then following the variable channels, you get some of the more direct channels. And so in general, I'd say the teams are not taking anything for granted. I think that Q2 taught us a little bit of a lesson in humility that, I think, everyone can use once in a while. But based on what we're seeing, the formula that we've established for the past 5 years still works, and there's no reason why it wouldn't work on a go-forward basis. And we're certainly seeing that in the results. As far as HomeAway goes, the transactional revenue has been very strong in Q3 as we've rolled it out on a global basis and as the teams now are optimizing much more aggressively on the conversion front. And so while the transactional fee initially caused a dip in conversion, the teams there are really building out their e-commerce capabilities and muscles, and conversion is a very nice positive factor for us. Traffic continues to build, although Google kind of free search continues to be kind of weak. But on balance, we like what we're seeing, and you see it in the results. I think that as you move into Q4, and especially next year, you're going to see some of the subscription premium revenue that we have stopped selling start coming down, so the transactional revenue essentially has to scale up faster in order to make up for some of the subscription revenue growth coming down. It's something that we expected. And then, of course, some of the investments that we're making in marketing and technology, et cetera, are also going to show.

And then just on the HomeAway performance, strong quarter on EBITDA, was sort of in line-ish in terms of revenue for us. So can you just kind of remind us on that subscription revenue piece kind of how the renewals phase sort of through the year or kind of what percentage occur each quarter?"

So on the room night trends, basically what happens is when you start getting conversion back working -- if you can imagine everyone on your website right now has a higher probability of converting, and then the direct channel, that actually provides higher conversion rates and you get one benefit of that, and you also get it from those visitors that you brought via Google or metasearch. But then with that higher conversion rate, you actually adjust your bidding out rhythms to say I now expect a higher expected value from the traffic I'm getting from the variable channels on a go-forward basis. And at that point, you're allowed -- you're basically in a spot where you can take up your bids. And it adds an accelerator, if you will, in growth in those channels. So that's basically the impact. And then when you look at the impact of profitability, when you have that type of acceleration, what happens is, in the quarter where you're actually ramping up that spend, you only actually get to recognize a portion of the revenue because not all of the stays happen in that quarter, and we recognize revenue for our hotel business generally on the stay. With respect to HomeAway performance, listen, generally, the subscription renewals are spread throughout the year. As a reminder, we basically eliminated the tiers last quarter -- in the beginning of last quarter, grandfathering the number of the premium players. And those subscriptions that were at premium will essentially start rolling off here on a go-forward basis. And once they roll off, they will either reset at the close to $500-per-year subscription or the lower price we've set for online bookable properties. And so you'll essentially see the subscription revenue start to become a more negative headwind as we move through Q4 and in Q1 and Q2, and then you'll really start to annualize it in Q3 of next year. And then as a reminder, in terms of the traveler fee rollout, as you're thinking about next year, we launched the traveler fee just towards the very end of the first quarter last year in the U.S., and then Europe was towards the end of the second quarter."

There's a vacation rental tab on Expedia, for example, now, but that wasn't a full integration. That was essentially a link-off to HomeAway search results. And what we are talking about is a much more fundamental kind of integrated experience where someone who comes to an Expedia or Hotels.com and is searching for hotels, depending on length of stay, depending on weekday, weekend, et cetera, they are going to get a complementary mix of hotel search results and/or vacation rental results based on a number of different presentations and logic. We expect to be piloting that experience sometime in Q4. And based on the results of those pilots, I think we will be kind of making it a bigger part of our experience late this year and certainly going into next year. And I think it's a great benefit both for Expedia and Hotels.com consumers because they're going to get more breadth and depth of inventory in-market, especially in some of the markets where HomeAway is very strong. And then I think for HomeAway, our partners there, the homeowners, the property managers, they are going to get a significant boost of demand from these terrific travel brands, especially in urban destinations.

Listen, as far as other OTA or metasearch competition, I think every single call probably in the past 10 years we've referred to competition being tough. It's nothing new in this marketplace, and I think it's led to some of the consolidation that you've seen in the market more recently. There have been some players in Europe who were going out of business, so the competition is there. It is always difficult. The competitors are always getting better, and it's not good enough for a company to get better. You have get to get better faster. And I think we're on the good path now, and we expect our competitors to be as tough as they've always been. We've obviously seen some activity on the supplier kind of brand.com front as far as some of the kind of loyalty fares that have expanded now versus what we've seen in the past. We measure pretty carefully our performance in, call it, brand-heavy markets versus brand-light markets. We continue not to see any measurable difference between the 2, so it doesn't seem to be affecting our results. What it is doing is that it is shifting more share of our supply to independents who are growing faster than some of these brands, and also, too, there are some brands who are giving us kind of the best inventory. So in general, the players who are giving us the best inventory are growing faster on our marketplace, both in terms of direct bookings and then you would think as far as the traffic that they're acquiring. So -- and that shift actually is giving us some decent margin, call it relief versus what we've seen in the past. So you'll notice that revenue per room night trends are generally improving as the year has gone by, and some of it is due to the shift. So listen, we'll be watching it very closely. We obviously want to get the best inventory from all of our partners. The brands are very, very important partners of ours, and our goal is to build our business with them, not shrink our business with them. And we're investing in a number of new interaction methodologies, technologies to hopefully get there. As far as the markets -- the destination markets, I think in general, it was pretty solid across the board, and as we said, getting better. We did see some weakness in some markets in Florida relating to the Zika virus. There could be some offset in Mexico, for example. It's particularly strong now because Miami is weak. We don't exactly know. We were pleased to see Paris starting to grow again off of what was a pretty weak base. But it's great to see Paris now on the positive. The stay-in at Portugal were very strong this summer, both in terms of room nights as well as ADRs. And the U.K., funny enough, now with Brexit and the pound being weaker, London and the U.K. as a destination has become quite strong. So I'd say decent results, and the macro environment for us remains pretty good."

And the members, both Hotels.com and Expedia+ as well as Orbitz, Orbucks members tend to come back to us. The repeat rates are significantly higher than nonmembers, and the direct-to-repeat rates or what we call organic repeat rates are significantly higher as well. So you get higher spend and you get higher spend over more profitable channels. Now those behaviors tend to come over the lifetime of that member. So we pay for the member acquisition and we pay for the points upfront, which is a pressure on our P&L. You see some of that pressure in our revenue margins. And then we get the goodness as the member and the member base matures. The majority of our members at this point are in the U.S., but growth is very fast outside the U.S., especially in the Asia Pacific regions. We find that our APAC customers love a great deal. And the Hotels.com rewards program and Expedia rewards program, those are great deals. The other factor that's pretty interesting now is that we are getting more and more inventory through our hotel partners that is now available for members only. So these are discounts that are available only if you sign in. So it's not a retail discount. It doesn't hurt ADR at all, but the hotels who are participating in these kinds of programs tend to gain share in our marketplace without giving up retail rate. So we think it's a win for our members, and it's certainly a win for hotel customers as well.

What we're very focused on is taking the booking number that is actually happening on platform and growing it as fast as we possibly can. To do that, of course, we're getting properties online, and we're now well over 1 million properties that are online bookable. Then we're very much focused next on making sure that the online bookable listings are actually driving transactions on the platform as opposed to off the platform. And so far, results have been good. Conversion rates are up pretty nicely year-over-year. Progress is pretty good. So again, I think there is a huge opportunity here. I think the total bogey of $15 billion growing nicely because the overall market is growing nicely is absolutely out there. But the way we're getting there is just really focusing on the online piece and driving that as hard as we can. With respect to the Orbitz integration, we're definitely seeing nice conversion results on the hotel product. I think converting that into stepping-up in marketing is something that we're still playing with at this point. We've got 2 very strong global brands in Brand Expedia and Hotels.com. These are brands that we are investing in to build really for the long term. We think we've got a phenomenal brand also in Orbitz and in CheapTickets and ebookers and Wotif and Travelocity. But the brands that are more regional in nature, our approach, thus far, has been, yes, be players in these variable marketing channels where we can, but let's be a little bit more focused on profit as opposed to top line trend -- top line trends. So I think we're still evaluating our approach here. It's not set in stone. But generally, we've been a little bit more bottom line focused with the Orbitzes of the world versus top line oriented."

So I think last quarter, you talked a bit about weakness in metasearch channels, and are you still seeing that? Or have you really seen improving trends there? And then also any update on partnering with Instant Book? Or do you feel like you're effectively driving leads through their meta product currently? And then just a second question on HomeAway. I know you're working to improve conversion there. And do you feel like you're on track such that you can really ramp-up spend and variable marketing there? I imagine the kind of competition with vacation rental keywords is fairly competitive, so just curious how that was trending."

As far as the meta channels, we have seen an improvement in the meta channels, definitely. You'll see it, for example, in our numbers as far as the intercompany spend with trivago has accelerated on a year-on-year basis Q3 compared to Q2, so you could see that on our numbers. And in general, the meta channels are improving. We still think we can do better, so we're not satisfied there. As far as Instant Book goes, we continue to have constructive dialogue with TripAdvisor. No news to share at this point. I think the Instant Book marketplace, in general, is more mature now, kind of the brand representation is better than it was when that product was initially introduced. So in general, we are more favorably inclined to that product now than where we were before, but we haven't crossed the finish line at this point. We'll see where we wind up in the next couple of quarters. As far as the HomeAway goes, on the conversion front, you're right. We're improving it and we're on track. The marketing -- the variable marketing channels are going to be an increasing factor, but I wouldn't call them a substantial factor at this point for HomeAway. The teams -- we actually brought a very, very talented executive from Hotels.com onto the HomeAway team. He had been running Hotels.com kind of online marketing for a while and did very, very well. And so he has now joined the HomeAway team. So I think the HomeAway team is now building the muscle. Conversion is going in the right direction, but really have to build the muscle to build a very, very strong variable marketing channel. And I think it's pretty early there. Also note that as we integrate the HomeAway inventory into Expedia and Hotels.com, Expedia and Hotels.com and Orbitz and Travelocity will also be able to bid more effectively for the vacation rental keywords as well. Who will be kind of the winner? Will it be more efficient for HomeAway to bid on those keywords or Hotels.com? That remains to be seen, and we will be kind of testing and learning our way there. But I think it will be a bigger factor next year versus anytime in the next couple of quarters."

As far as the re-acceleration in Q4, listen, it's early, but we like the trends that we're seeing. There's no guarantee that those trends will continue, so I don't want you to take too much confidence as far as how we're doing. We're just kind of reporting based on how we've done and what we're seeing so far. In general, as we look at the macro environment, I do think that some of the weakness that we saw, as it related to our results in Q2, was self-inflicted. We were very open about that. The sites weren't as stable as they needed to be, some of the experimentation wasn't as strong as they needed to be, so we had to kind of get our own house in order. So I think it's difficult to compare our results and trends to macro trends because we went through a lot of changes here. We are seeing -- while domestic ADRs have been positive, when I look at kind of daily, weekly ADRs, they are weakening a little bit versus where they were in Q2, so that kind of agrees with some of the trends we're seeing. Our package inventory is in good shape. And again, hoteliers kind of load in inventory into opaque channels such as packages and Hotwire and these member-only deals when they need a little more help, and it feels like some of the hoteliers need a little more help. On the Egencia side, especially domestically, we're seeing a bit of caution as far as corporate travel spend goes. We don't see it in Europe, but we see it more domestically. So I'd say that on a macro basis, we're seeing some similar signs, which is a hint of weakness. We probably don't feel as much as some of the other folks just because this online channel is a big, growing channel, and we're riding that wave. And hopefully, the hotel partners who engage with us on the inventory front aggressively are going to ride that wave with us, and hopefully, gain some share as we gain share. Mark, you want to talk mobile?"

Hotels.com is just behind them. And I think just the trend here is that we continue to see much faster growth in mobile than we do in desktop. Not surprisingly, we are seeing an increased shift of transactions and traffic to smartphone. Tablet is petering out. Mobile web is becoming more significant for us as we get much better at bidding for mobile web traffic in variable channels. So hopefully, that will help you feel the trends that we're seeing."

So I absolutely meant to say that top line growth rates will slow down from this point forward.

In terms of owners and managers adopting online bookings and online payments, listen, we're really happy with what we're seeing so far. We've got now nicely north of 1 million properties who are signed up and online bookable. A lot of them are taking advantage of the online payments platform that we've got. We're actually looking at ways that we can possibly leverage some of the payments capabilities that we have here at the mother ship of Expedia Inc., which could potentially add some more different payment options than they're offering right now.

As far as the opportunity and challenges around AI and VR, I think on the AI side, we're testing with some interesting technologies such as on the Facebook Messenger side, you're able to go back and forth with AI agents, so to speak, to book a hotel on Expedia. It's pretty cool. You should try it out. And I think it's very, very -- it's a very, very early iteration of what a kind of consumer experience might look like. I personally think that the bigger, kind of the more significant opportunity in AI near to midterm is with highly repeatable, call it, simple tasks that consumers engage in. And if you combine kind of machine learning there with identity -- so for example, on Facebook Messenger, we have identity established, I think on the customer service side, you can have some pretty clean, great experiences. You're being able to Messenger Expedia to ""Change my Thursday night hotel booking to Friday"" or ""Cancel my San Francisco hotel booking, et cetera,"" without having to call someone, without having to give an itinerary number, without having to really speak to anyone and just be able to message back and forth with essentially a bot to get your customer service requests done. Or for example, we're very, very -- we'd love to work with our hotel partners. Right now, you can message our hotels through some of our systems to be able to message our hotel and ask for late check-out or early check-in, et cetera. Those, I think, are experiences where AI can service you because you've got high volumes, you've got repeatable tasks that a computer can kind of iterate against and learn from. So I think you'll see some of the sexy stuff on the bookings side, and then you'll see some of the unsexy stuff on the customer service side, and we plan to experiment with both of them. On the VR side, we are testing with kind of VR rigs as we speak. I think that the potential that we see with VR is to whet the appetite of someone looking at a destination, what experience they can have, and/or a hotelier. So we want VR to be just good enough to make you want to go there, but not good enough for you to avoid the trip. And I think we have plenty of time there."

We can do that, and we can essentially extend our platform into the travel ecosystem, which is something that we're doing.

As far as Orbitz goes and what functionality, there was a number of, call it, packages-type functionality that we initially dropped off that we're going to be adding as time goes on. ebookers in Europe had a certain functionality, what we call sub-pub, where they were -- they kind of price some airfare below published rates in order to go out and acquire customers. There was some fee technology that both Orbitz and ebookers had built variable fees, especially on the air side, that we haven't carried through at this point. These are all technologies that were actually pretty interesting, but whenever you move on something from a technology side, you kind of introduce what we call an MVP, a minimum viable product, and then you build on it. So some of this functionality may make its way back, some of it is very, very cool, but we wanted to move kind of Orbitz and ebookers over as quickly as possible. And I think the teams made the right tradeoff calls, and I think that they've executed quite well."

Financial results for the third quarter were solid, with gross bookings up 21%, revenue up 33% and adjusted EBITDA up 42% year-on-year. Now that the Orbitz migration is largely complete, the focus of our core OTA segment has been squarely back to business as usual. As we mentioned on our last call, we weren't satisfied with our hotel volumes in Q2, and the teams have now been laser focused on driving core execution, product and conversion improvements, online and offline marketing and expansion of our supply footprint, all to drive stronger transactional growth. 
While you don't see the results yet in our Q3 stays, book to room night trends consistently improved throughout the quarter, especially with our global brands, Brand Expedia, Hotels.com and EAN, our private label business. Our regionally focused brands, however, are managing marketing spend more with an eye towards near-term profitability versus top line growth. While it's very early in Q4, October volumes continue to be healthy, and it feels good to be back to our operational formula.
Egencia is on track to deliver a solid year of growth and profitability as it continues to gain share on the managed corporate travel market, innovate and complete key technology projects to set the stage for its next phase of growth. Egencia has set an internal target to double its gross bookings by 2020 through organic as well as inorganic growth and is positioning itself as the most business traveler and product-centric company in corporate travel. We remain very optimistic about the prospects for substantial share gains for Egencia for many years to come.
Team trivago continues to gain share. Q3 revenue growth came in at a very strong 57% year-over-year, accelerating from an already strong Q2, while year-on-year profitability improved. trivago is seeing healthy growth in all regions, including its core European markets in the U.S., while reinvesting profits to scale up in major travel markets such as South Korea, Japan and others. 
Regarding the potential IPO for trivago, we're not going to be commenting on this call beyond our public statements, and we do not have any updated information to share on timing.
The HomeAway transition continued to progress nicely, with standalone revenue up 1% year-on-year and travel -- the traveler service fee now rolled out globally. 
A special thanks to Co-Founder Brian Sharples, who recently stepped away from his role as CEO while remaining Chairman of HomeAway to continue to help us navigate through a complex transformation. Brian and team created a terrific company that we plan to build on, with longtime Expedia executive John Kim who's been at HomeAway since early 2016 now stepping into the role of Company President. 
We're focused on hitting our long-term growth goals while aggressively ramping up our investment in product, technology, marketing and customer service to build the very best marketplace for homeowners, property managers and travelers alike. And though we're pleased with the progress, we're still early in HomeAway's transition into a scale global leader in the alternative accommodation market. 
In summary, while we're never quite satisfied, overall results were solid and Q3 was most definitely a step in the right direction for our company. 
Now I'll turn it over to Mark."

The adjusted EBITDA of $667 million that we delivered in Q3 was a good result and broadly in line with our expectations for the quarter.

The adjusted EBITDA of $667 million that we delivered in Q3 was a good result and broadly in line with our expectations for the quarter. Better-than-expected results across most of our brands more than offset some bottom line weakness in Brand Expedia and Hotwire. HomeAway and Orbitz continued to perform well, and together, delivered a solid $150 million of adjusted EBITDA in the quarter. 
Hotel revenue grew 15% in Q3, slightly faster than in the second quarter on room night growth of 17%. Orbitz contributed approximately 6 percentage points of room night growth for the quarter. We are pleased to exit Q3 with stayed room night growth of 20% in September; 14%, excluding Orbitz. 
We are also pleased to see consistent acceleration in our book-to-room-night trends each month through the quarter, with strength continuing through October to date. 
Note, however, that as we improve execution, results are first being realized in the form of accelerating growth in the high-cost performance marketing channels such as metasearch and search engine marketing. We expect to invest some additional selling and marketing behind these positive trends, which could put incremental pressure on margins in the fourth quarter, a trade-up we're happy to make as we continue to rebuild momentum exiting the year. 
Average daily rates were up about 1% in Q3, while revenue per room night decreased by less than 2%. The gap between the 2 continued to narrow, down to about 280 basis points compared with 440 basis points in the second quarter. 
Pressure on room night economics have continued to abate as we lap over previous reductions in our hotel commission rates. 
We saw solid unit growth in our other product lines, with air tickets up 32% and rental car days up 34%. 
Note that Orbitz added 22 percentage points of inorganic ticket growth and 19 percentage points to rental car days in Q3. 
Revenue per ticket grew 15% in Q3 due in part to a onetime re-class of certain other revenue into air, favorable economics in a number of supply contracts and certain consumer fee tests. We expect revenue per ticket growth to return to a more normalized level in Q4. 
Our ad media revenue grew 50% on solid performance for both trivago and our Media Solutions group.
As you look at your top line growth expectations for Q4, please remember that we comped over the Orbitz acquisition at the end of the third quarter and, as such, all-in growth rates across our product lines will decelerate significantly beginning in Q4. 
Additionally, Orbitz growth bookings and revenue have been meaningfully down year-over-year on a standalone basis due to our discontinuation of certain brands and site functionality; our pulling back spend in certain marketing channels, with an eye to profit optimization; and some churn in Orbitz Partner Network and Orbitz for Business customers. This dynamic will put pressure on top line growth in Q4, with a more limited impact on profitability, given deal synergies and Orbitz' air-heavy product mix.
On a standalone basis, HomeAway revenue grew 61%, and adjusted EBITDA grew 85% in Q3. We were quite pleased with these results and, as such, continue ramping up investments and selling the marketing and in product and technology as we move forward into 2017.
Looking forward, these investments, combined with the phasing out of tiered subscription fees and the lapping the rollout of the consumer fee next year will result in slower adjusted EBITDA growth for HomeAway beginning in Q4 compared to what you saw here in Q3. Progress to date, combined with the investments we are making, give us continued confidence in our ability to deliver our targeted $350 million of adjusted EBITDA at HomeAway in 2018.
From an expense perspective, on both an organic and all-in basis, we saw a nice leverage in cost of revenue, selling and marketing, people-related costs and G&A this quarter. Note that across all expense categories, year-over-year growth was partially offset by a reduction of our incentive compensation accruals in Q3, given the relative underperformance in our core OTA business year-to-date. 
Technology and content expenses continued to grow faster than revenue, due in part to the year-over-year impact of hiring of talented tech teams earlier this year and our continued employment of transaction -- transitional resources in connection with the Orbitz integration. Looking forward, as we lap these additions and the remaining transitional resources roll off, on an all-in basis, we expect to see a further deceleration in the growth of technology and content expense to the high 20 to low 30 percentage range in the fourth quarter and further deceleration as we move into 2017.
I would note, however, that an additional driver to year-on-year growth in technology and content expense in the third quarter was the continuation of our cloud migration efforts that we plan to operate our own data center footprint for core functionality for the foreseeable future. We have initiated a company-wide effort to migrate significant portions of our products and capabilities to the cloud computing environment over the next few years. 
The related expense for full year 2016 will be over $30 million, of which we have recognized approximately $20 million year-to-date. Current estimated expenditures on cloud for 2017 are more than double current year spending. While this represents an EBITDA headwind in the near term, we absolutely believe it's the right business decision, and we expect it to be nicely free cash flow positive over the medium to long term as we significantly reduce capital expenditures and other operating costs related to our own data centers over time.
Turning to our financial expectations for full year 2016, on a consolidated basis, excluding eLong, we're currently forecasting full year adjusted EBITDA growth approaching the midpoint of our 35% to 45% guidance range, with continued risk to the downside. We are pleased to see the improvement in recent room night growth trends and plan to invest behind it. This increase in marketing spend, coupled with the book-to-stay lag, may negatively impact Q4 profitability, which should set us up well as we move into 2017.
We expect the relative contributions of Orbitz and HomeAway versus our organic business to be broadly consistent with our guidance last quarter, better bottom line performance from these acquisitions, offsetting relative underperformance in the core business.
With that, let's open it up for some questions. Operator?"

As far as the volume trends and the execution of the base business, listen, it's just good to get back to execution on the core. There were a ton of people across the company focused in on the Orbitz integration. They did a terrific job. And note that, that acquisition integration came after Travelocity after Wotif. So I think the teams are -- there's a bit of relief for the teams to kind of get back to basics and get back to the business, and I think it's showing up in the numbers. You obviously don't see it in the stays because there's a book-to-stay lag, but the business has been getting consistently stronger as we expected it to as Q3 progressed, and early Q4 looks really good. So I think -- listen, we expected it sometimes when you hit a speed bump, you wonder whether it's structural or whether it's temporal. I think this one is certainly proving out to be temporal. We don't take anything for granted. We are, as usual, when we kind of accelerate into certain markets, the variable channels tend to be very fast-twitch channels for us, so you may see some kind of sales and marketing pressure on that front. And then following the variable channels, you get some of the more direct channels. And so in general, I'd say the teams are not taking anything for granted. I think that Q2 taught us a little bit of a lesson in humility that, I think, everyone can use once in a while. But based on what we're seeing, the formula that we've established for the past 5 years still works, and there's no reason why it wouldn't work on a go-forward basis. And we're certainly seeing that in the results. As far as HomeAway goes, the transactional revenue has been very strong in Q3 as we've rolled it out on a global basis and as the teams now are optimizing much more aggressively on the conversion front. And so while the transactional fee initially caused a dip in conversion, the teams there are really building out their e-commerce capabilities and muscles, and conversion is a very nice positive factor for us. Traffic continues to build, although Google kind of free search continues to be kind of weak. But on balance, we like what we're seeing, and you see it in the results. I think that as you move into Q4, and especially next year, you're going to see some of the subscription premium revenue that we have stopped selling start coming down, so the transactional revenue essentially has to scale up faster in order to make up for some of the subscription revenue growth coming down. It's something that we expected. And then, of course, some of the investments that we're making in marketing and technology, et cetera, are also going to show. So I think -- team on HomeAway likes where we are, but we know that we've got a big lift ahead of us and kind of the slope is going to get a little tougher, but I think the teams are up for it."

And then just on the HomeAway performance, strong quarter on EBITDA, was sort of in line-ish in terms of revenue for us. So can you just kind of remind us on that subscription revenue piece kind of how the renewals phase sort of through the year or kind of what percentage occur each quarter?"

So on the room night trends, basically what happens is when you start getting conversion back working -- if you can imagine everyone on your website right now has a higher probability of converting, and then the direct channel, that actually provides higher conversion rates and you get one benefit of that, and you also get it from those visitors that you brought via Google or metasearch. But then with that higher conversion rate, you actually adjust your bidding algorithms to say, I now expect a higher expected value from the traffic I'm getting from the variable channels on a go-forward basis. And at that point, you're allowed -- you're basically in a spot where you can take up your bids. And it adds an accelerator, if you will, in growth for those channels. So that's basically the impact. And then when you look at the impact of profitability, when you have that type of acceleration, what happens is, in the quarter where you're actually ramping up that spend, you only actually get to recognize a portion of the revenue because not all of the stays happen in that quarter, and we recognize revenue for our hotel business generally on the stay. With respect to HomeAway performance, listen, generally, the subscription renewals are spread throughout the year. As a reminder, we basically eliminated the tiers last quarter -- in the beginning of last quarter, grandfather in the number of the premium players. And those subscriptions that were at premium will essentially start rolling off here on a go-forward basis. And once they roll off, they will either reset at the close to $500-per-year subscription or the lower price we've set for online bookable properties. And so you'll essentially see the subscription revenue start to become a more negative headwind as we move through Q4 and in Q1 and Q2, and then you'll really start to annualize it in Q3 of next year. And then as a reminder, in terms of the traveler fee rollout, as you're thinking about next year, we launched the traveler fee just towards the very end of the first quarter last year in the U.S., and then Europe was towards the end of the second quarter."

We expect to be piloting that experience sometime in Q4. And based on the results of those pilots, I think we will be kind of making it a bigger part of our experience late this year and certainly going into next year. And I think it's a great benefit both for Expedia and Hotels.com consumers because they're going to get more breadth and depth of inventory in-market, especially in some of the markets where HomeAway is very strong.

Listen, as far as other OTA or metasearch competition, I think every single call probably in the past 10 years we've referred to competition being tough. It's nothing new in this marketplace, and I think it's led to some of the consolidation that you've seen in the market more recently. There have been some players in Europe who were going out of business, so the competition is there. It is always difficult. The competitors are always getting better, and it's not good enough for a company to get better. You have get to get better faster. And I think we're on a good path now, and we expect our competitors to be as tough as they've always been. We've obviously seen some activity on the supplier kind of brand.com front as far as some of the kind of loyalty fares that have expanded now versus what we've seen in the past. We measure pretty carefully our performance in, call it, brand-heavy markets versus brand-light markets. We continue not to see any measurable difference between the 2, so it doesn't seem to be affecting our results. What it is doing is that it is shifting more share of our supply to the independents who are growing faster than some of these brands, and also, too, there are some brands who are giving us kind of the best inventory. So in general, the players who are giving us the best inventory are growing faster in our marketplace, both in terms of direct bookings and then you would think as far as the traffic that they're acquiring. So -- and that shift actually is giving us some decent margin, call it relief versus what we've seen in the past. So you'll notice that revenue per room night trends are generally improving as the year has gone by, and some of it is due to the shift. So listen, we'll be watching it very closely. We obviously want to get the best inventory from all of our partners. The brands are very, very important partners of ours, and our goal is to build our business with them, not shrink our business with them. And we're investing in a number of new interaction methodologies, technologies, to hopefully get there. As far as the markets -- the destination markets, I think in general, it was pretty solid across the board, and as we said, getting better. We did see some weakness in some markets in Florida relating to the Zika virus. There could be some offset in Mexico, for example. It's particularly strong as ever because Miami's weak. We don't exactly know. We were pleased to see Paris starting to grow again off of what was a pretty weak base. But it's great to see Paris now in the positive. The stay-in at Portugal were very strong this summer, both in terms of room nights as well as ADRs. And the U.K., funny enough, now with Brexit and the pound being weaker, London and the U.K. as a destination has become quite strong. So I'd say decent results, and the macro environment for us remains pretty good."

And the members, both Hotels.com and Expedia+ as well as Orbitz, Orbucks members tend to come back to us. The repeat rates are significantly higher than nonmembers, and the direct repeat rates or what we call organic repeat rates are significantly higher as well. So you get higher spend and you get higher spend over more profitable channels. Now those behaviors tend to come over the lifetime of that member. So we pay for the member acquisition and we pay for the points upfront, which is a pressure on our P&L. You see some of that pressure in our revenue margins. And then we get the goodness as the member and the member base matures. The majority of our members at this point are in the U.S., but growth is very fast outside the U.S., especially in the Asia Pacific regions. We find that our APAC customers love a great deal. And the Hotels.com rewards program and Expedia rewards program, those are great deals. The other factor that's pretty interesting now is that we are getting more and more inventory through our hotel partners that is now available for members only. So these are discounts that are available only if you sign in. So it's not a retail discount. It doesn't hurt ADR at all, but the hotels who are participating in these kinds of programs tend to gain share in our marketplace without giving up retail rate. So we think it's a win for our members, and it's certainly a win for hotel customers as well. We're in the tens of thousands of the hotels that are making these rates available, so you can imagine it's a very, very broad program, and it's attractive for our member base, and it's attractive for our partners."

And so you basically are dropping a lot of profit to the bottom line, and we haven't yet completely ramped up to full steam on sales and marketing and, particularly, in technology and products. So those are 2 areas, particularly, where you'll see us start in Q4, and then particularly in through 2017, ramp investments aggressively. 2017, I will just tell you, is not a year where we will be as focused on adjusted EBITDA growth as we are in just building the capability, and that's for HomeAway, specifically. And we expect that once we build up, particularly the product and tech team, to where the size we want it to be, we'll be able to leverage that nicely as revenue growth, and ultimately, marketing contribution growth continues into 2018. And again, we feel very comfortable with our $350 million adjusted EBITDA number for 2018, but the path there will be one of investment in '17 and realization in '18 from a bottom line perspective."

And the second question, if I can, when you look at Orbitz on the hotel side, as you get deeper into the integration of the core properties from Orbitz onto the Expedia platform, are you guys seeing that traditional uptick in conversion rates that might allow you to step-up spending in variable marketing channels around that brand?

So on HomeAway, the $15 billion number that we quoted, we still feel comfortable with that number. To be honest, we're not too focused on looking at what the total platform-derived bookings are at this point. What we're very focused on is taking the booking number that is actually happening on platform and growing it as fast as we possibly can. To do that, of course, we're getting properties online, and we're now well over 1 million properties that are online bookable. Then we're very much focused next on making sure that the online bookable listings are actually driving transactions on the platform as opposed to off the platform. And so far, results have been very good. Conversion rates are up pretty nicely year-over-year. Progress is pretty good. So again, I think there is a huge opportunity here. I think the total bogey of $15 billion growing nicely because the overall market is growing nicely is absolutely out there. But the way we're getting there is just really focusing on the online piece and driving that as hard as we can. With respect to the Orbitz integration, we're definitely seeing nice conversion results on the hotel product. I think converting that into stepping-up in marketing is something that we're still playing with at this point. We've got 2 very strong global brands in Brand Expedia and Hotels.com. These are brands that we are investing in to build really for the long term. We think we've got a phenomenal brand also in Orbitz and in CheapTickets and in ebookers and Wotif and Travelocity. But the brands that are more regional in nature, our approach thus far has been, yes, be players in these variable marketing channels where we can, but let's be a little bit more focused on profit as opposed to top line trend -- top line trends. So I think we're still evaluating our approach here. It's not set in stone. But generally, we've been a little bit more bottom line focused with the Orbitzes of the world versus top line oriented."

And in general, the meta channels are improving. We still think we can do better, so we're not satisfied there. As far as Instant Book goes, we continue to have a constructive dialogue with TripAdvisor. No news to share at this point. I think the Instant Book marketplace, in general, is more mature now, kind of the brand representation is better than it was when that product was initially introduced. So in general, we are more favorably inclined to that product now than where we were before, but we haven't crossed the finish line at this point. We'll see where we wind up in the next couple of quarters. As far as the HomeAway goes, on the conversion front, you're right. We're improving it and we're on track. The marketing -- the variable marketing channels are going to be an increasing factor, but I wouldn't call them a substantial factor at this point for HomeAway. The teams -- we actually brought a very, very talented executive from Hotels.com onto the HomeAway team. He had been running Hotels.com kind of online marketing for a while and did very, very well. And so he has now joined the HomeAway team. So I think the HomeAway team is now building the muscle. Conversion is going in the right direction, but really has to build the muscle to build a very, very strong variable marketing channel. And I think it's pretty early there. Also note that as we integrate the HomeAway inventory into Expedia and Hotels.com, Expedia and Hotels.com and Orbitz and Travelocity will also be able to bid more effectively for the vacation rental keywords as well. Who will be kind of the winner? Will it be more efficient for HomeAway to bid on those keywords or Hotels.com? That remains to be seen, and we will be kind of testing and learning our way there. But I think it will be a bigger factor next year versus anytime in the next couple of quarters."

There's no guarantee that those trends will continue, so I don't want you to take too much confidence as far as how we're doing. We're just kind of reporting based on how we've done and what we're seeing so far. In general, as we look at the macro environment, I do think that some of the weakness that we saw, as it related to our results in Q2, was self-inflicted. We were very open about that. The sites weren't as stable as they needed to be, some of the experimentation wasn't as strong as they needed to be, so we had to kind of get our own house in order. So I think it's difficult to compare our results and trends to macro trends because we went through a lot of changes here. We are seeing -- while domestic ADRs have been positive, when I look at kind of daily, weekly ADRs, they are weakening a little bit versus where they were in Q2, so that kind of agrees with some of the trends we're seeing. Our package inventory is in good shape. And again, hoteliers kind of load in inventory into opaque channels such as packages and Hotwire and these member-only deals when they need a little more help, and it feels like some of the hoteliers need a little more help. On the Egencia side, especially domestically, we're seeing a bit of caution as far as corporate travel spend goes. We don't see it in Europe, but we see it more domestically. So I'd say that on a macro basis, we're seeing some similar signs, which is a hint of weakness. We probably don't feel as much as some of the other folks just because this online channel is a big, growing channel, and we're riding that wave. And hopefully, the hotel partners who engage with us on the inventory front aggressively are going to ride that wave with us, and hopefully, gain some share as we gain share.

So if you were shooting for 50%, we're probably right in that zone. And then in terms of actual bookings that are happening on mobile devices, we've got certain brands, Wotif, Hotwire, at times, that are bumping up against the mid-40s to 50% range. Hotels.com is just behind them. And I think just the trend here is that we continue to see much faster growth in mobile than we do in desktop. Not surprisingly, we are seeing an increased shift of transactions and traffic to smartphone. Tablet is petering out. Mobile web is becoming more significant for us as we get much better at bidding for mobile web traffic in variable channels. So hopefully, that will help you feel the trends that we're seeing."

There are always tactical ups and downs that are going to happen as we move forward, so it may -- we may never be the end, we may never have complete stabilization.

So I absolutely meant to say that top line growth rates will slow down from this point forward. And really, the driver here, particularly in Q4, is that the subscription revenue will start to be a drag as, essentially, the monetization model shifts over to either paper booking or online booking fees and also as we start to roll off some of the premium-tiered subscription revenue. And then there will be additional factors that'll kick in towards the end of Q1, and then again, at the end of Q2 as we lap over the -- of next year, as we lap over the booking fee implementation that we had this year. In terms of owners and managers adopting online bookings and online payments, listen, we're really happy with what we're seeing so far. We've got now nicely north of 1 million properties who are signed up and online bookable. A lot of them are taking advantage of the online payments platform that we've got. We're actually looking at ways that we can possibly leverage some of the payments capabilities that we have here at the mother ship of Expedia Inc., which could potentially add some more different payment options than they're offering right now. So, so far, we're happy with the traction. Again, it's still early, and there's lots of work to do. But so far, so good."

As far as the opportunity and challenges around AI and VR, I think on the AI side, we're testing with some interesting technologies such as on the Facebook Messenger side, you're able to go back and forth with AI agents, so to speak, to book a hotel on Expedia. It's pretty cool. You should try it out. And I think it's very, very -- it's a very, very early iteration of what a kind of a consumer experience might look like. I personally think that the bigger, kind of the more significant opportunity in AI near to midterm is with highly repeatable, call it, simple tasks that consumers engage in. And if you combine kind of machine learning there with identity -- so for example, on Facebook Messenger, we have identity established, I think on the customer service side, you can have some pretty clean, great experiences. You're being able to Messenger Expedia to ""Change my Thursday night hotel booking to Friday"" or ""Cancel my San Francisco hotel booking, et cetera,"" without having to call someone, without having to give an itinerary number, without having to really speak to anyone and just be able to message back and forth with essentially a bot to get your customer service requests done. Or for example, we're very, very -- we'd love to work with our hotel partners. Right now, you can message our hotels through some of our systems to be able to message our hotel and ask for late check-out or early check-in, et cetera. Those, I think, are experiences where AI can service you because you've got high volumes, you've got repeatable tasks that a computer can kind of iterate against and learn from. So I think you'll see some of the sexy stuff on the bookings side, and then you'll see some of the unsexy stuff on the customer service side, and we plan to experiment with both of them. On the VR side, we are testing with kind of VR rigs as we speak. I think that the potential that we see with VR is to whet the appetite of someone looking at a destination, what experience they can have, and/or a hotelier. So we want VR to be just good enough to make you want to go there, but not good enough for you to avoid the trip. And I think we have plenty of time there."

And the -- just as we are using the Expedia platform to power the Orbitz side with different experiences, power Wotif with different experiences, we will be able to extend that capability to a Marriott Vacations and other providers as well. We think that there are tons and tons of hotels out there and hotel chains out there, airlines out there, who don't necessarily -- aren't necessarily able to keep investing and keep experimenting and keep optimizing leading sites that can accept payments in every single kind of payment plan known on earth. We can do that, and we can essentially extend our platform into the travel ecosystem, which is something that we're doing. And then on the supply side, we're even tying in now supply from third parties, where, not only are we acquiring supply directly, but we are piping in supply from other players, and we will kind of present the best choice for consumers based on what that best choice is, based on availability, based on pricing, et cetera. So it is a 2-sided marketplace. We're very, very early in this. And then, of course, we've got a private label business, our EAN business, that is actually one of the stars of the show. It's a business that's growing very, very quickly, especially in the Asia Pacific markets, and we're pretty optimistic about. And then lastly, Orbitz did have a very, very big private label business. It had, call it, more customization capability than what we had built on the Expedia side, where we have taken on that team, and they're a very important part of our team now, and we're building up, call it, the more -- the increased customization capability on top of the Expedia platform. So we're investing in this area. You're not done seeing, hopefully, surprising announcements in the future because I think our capabilities are going to get much, much better here."

So Accelerator -- kind of the number of hotels that are engaging and the Accelerator product continues to increase. The bidding activity continues to increase as well.

And kind of every week, the numbers get better. It is still a new product, and it's not a, I would say, significant driver of our overall results, but we do see it building, and we're quite pleased with the early signs so far. As far as Orbitz goes and what functionality, there was a number of, call it, packages-type functionality that we initially dropped off that we're going to be adding as time goes on. ebookers in Europe had a certain functionality, what we call sub-pub, where they were -- they kind of price some airfare below published rates in order to go out and acquire customers. There was some fee technology that both Orbitz and ebookers had built variable fees, especially on the air side, that we haven't carried through at this point. These are all technologies that were actually pretty interesting, but whenever you move on something from a technology side, you kind of introduce what we call an MVP, a minimum viable product, and then you build on it. So some of this functionality may make its way back, some of it is very, very cool, but we wanted to move kind of Orbitz and ebookers over as quickly as possible. And I think the teams made the right tradeoff calls, and I think that they've executed quite well."

Financial results for the third quarter were solid, with gross bookings up 21%, revenue up 33% and adjusted EBITDA up 42% year-on-year. Now that the Orbitz migration is largely complete, the focus of our core OTA segment has been squarely back to business as usual. As we mentioned on our last call, we weren't satisfied with our hotel volumes in Q2, and the teams have now been laser focused on driving core execution, product and conversion improvements, online and offline marketing and expansion of our supply footprint, all to drive stronger transactional growth. 
While you don't see the results yet in our Q3 stays, book to room night trends consistently improved throughout the quarter, especially with our global brands, Brand Expedia, Hotels.com and EAN, our private label business. Our regionally focused brands, however, are managing marketing spend more with an eye towards near-term profitability versus top line growth. While it's very early in Q4, October volumes continue to be healthy, and it feels good to be back to our operational formula.
Egencia is on track to deliver a solid year of growth and profitability as it continues to gain share on the managed corporate travel market, innovate and complete key technology projects to set the stage for its next phase of growth. Egencia has set an internal target to double its gross bookings by 2020 through organic as well as inorganic growth and is positioning itself as the most business traveler and product-centric company in corporate travel. We remain very optimistic about the prospects for substantial share gains for Egencia for many years to come.
Team trivago continues to gain share. Q3 revenue growth came in at a very strong 57% year-over-year, accelerating from an already strong Q2, while year-on-year profitability improved. trivago is seeing healthy growth in all regions, including its core European markets in the U.S., while reinvesting profits to scale up in major travel markets such as South Korea, Japan and others. 
Regarding the potential IPO for trivago, we're not going to be commenting on this call beyond our public statements, and we do not have any updated information to share on timing.
The HomeAway transition continued to progress nicely, with standalone revenue up 1% year-on-year and travel -- the traveler service fee now rolled out globally. 
A special thanks to Co-Founder Brian Sharples, who recently stepped away from his role as CEO while remaining Chairman of HomeAway to continue to help us navigate through a complex transformation. Brian and team created a terrific company that we plan to build on, with longtime Expedia executive John Kim who's been at HomeAway since early 2016 now stepping into the role of Company President. 
We're focused on hitting our long-term growth goals while aggressively ramping up our investment in product, technology, marketing and customer service to build the very best marketplace for homeowners, property managers and travelers alike. And though we're pleased with the progress, we're still early in HomeAway's transition into a scale global leader in the alternative accommodation market. 
In summary, while we're never quite satisfied, overall results were solid and Q3 was most definitely a step in the right direction for our company.

The adjusted EBITDA of $667 million that we delivered in Q3 was a good result and broadly in line with our expectations for the quarter. Better-than-expected results across most of our brands more than offset some bottom line weakness in Bra",1060,"Thanks, Dara. The adjusted EBITDA of $667 million that we delivered in Q3 was a good result and broadly in line with our expectations for the quarter. Better-than-expected results across most of our brands more than offset some bottom line weakness in Brand Expedia and Hotwire. HomeAway and Orbitz continued to perform well, and together, delivered a solid $150 million of adjusted EBITDA in the quarter. 
Hotel revenue grew 15% in Q3, slightly faster than in the second quarter on room night growth of 17%. Orbitz contributed approximately 6 percentage points of room night growth for the quarter. We are pleased to exit Q3 with stayed room night growth of 20% in September; 14%, excluding Orbitz. 
We are also pleased to see consistent acceleration in our book-to-room-night trends each month through the quarter, with strength continuing through October to date. 
Note, however, that as we improve execution, results are first being realized in the form of accelerating growth in the high-cost performance marketing channels such as metasearch and search engine marketing. We expect to invest some additional selling and marketing behind these positive trends, which could put incremental pressure on margins in the fourth quarter, a trade-up we're happy to make as we continue to rebuild momentum exiting the year. 
Average daily rates were up about 1% in Q3, while revenue per room night decreased by less than 2%. The gap between the 2 continued to narrow, down to about 280 basis points compared with 440 basis points in the second quarter. 
Pressure on room night economics have continued to abate as we lap over previous reductions in our hotel commission rates. 
We saw solid unit growth in our other product lines, with air tickets up 32% and rental car days up 34%. 
Note that Orbitz added 22 percentage points of inorganic ticket growth and 19 percentage points to rental car days in Q3. 
Revenue per ticket grew 15% in Q3 due in part to a onetime re-class of certain other revenue into air, favorable economics in a number of supply contracts and certain consumer fee tests. We expect revenue per ticket growth to return to a more normalized level in Q4. 
Our ad media revenue grew 50% on solid performance for both trivago and our Media Solutions group.
As you look at your top line growth expectations for Q4, please remember that we comped over the Orbitz acquisition at the end of the third quarter and, as such, all-in growth rates across our product lines will decelerate significantly beginning in Q4. 
Additionally, Orbitz growth bookings and revenue have been meaningfully down year-over-year on a standalone basis due to our discontinuation of certain brands and site functionality; our pulling back spend in certain marketing channels, with an eye to profit optimization; and some churn in Orbitz Partner Network and Orbitz for Business customers. This dynamic will put pressure on top line growth in Q4, with a more limited impact on profitability, given deal synergies and Orbitz' air-heavy product mix.
On a standalone basis, HomeAway revenue grew 61%, and adjusted EBITDA grew 85% in Q3. We were quite pleased with these results and, as such, continue ramping up investments and selling the marketing and in product and technology as we move forward into 2017.
Looking forward, these investments, combined with the phasing out of tiered subscription fees and the lapping the rollout of the consumer fee next year will result in slower adjusted EBITDA growth for HomeAway beginning in Q4 compared to what you saw here in Q3. Progress to date, combined with the investments we are making, give us continued confidence in our ability to deliver our targeted $350 million of adjusted EBITDA at HomeAway in 2018.
From an expense perspective, on both an organic and all-in basis, we saw a nice leverage in cost of revenue, selling and marketing, people-related costs and G&A this quarter. Note that across all expense categories, year-over-year growth was partially offset by a reduction of our incentive compensation accruals in Q3, given the relative underperformance in our core OTA business year-to-date. 
Technology and content expenses continued to grow faster than revenue, due in part to the year-over-year impact of hiring of talented tech teams earlier this year and our continued employment of transaction -- transitional resources in connection with the Orbitz integration. Looking forward, as we lap these additions and the remaining transitional resources roll off, on an all-in basis, we expect to see a further deceleration in the growth of technology and content expense to the high 20 to low 30 percentage range in the fourth quarter and further deceleration as we move into 2017.
I would note, however, that an additional driver to year-on-year growth in technology and content expense in the third quarter was the continuation of our cloud migration efforts that we plan to operate our own data center footprint for core functionality for the foreseeable future. We have initiated a company-wide effort to migrate significant portions of our products and capabilities to the cloud computing environment over the next few years. 
The related expense for full year 2016 will be over $30 million, of which we have recognized approximately $20 million year-to-date. Current estimated expenditures on cloud for 2017 are more than double current year spending. While this represents an EBITDA headwind in the near term, we absolutely believe it's the right business decision, and we expect it to be nicely free cash flow positive over the medium to long term as we significantly reduce capital expenditures and other operating costs related to our own data centers over time.
Turning to our financial expectations for full year 2016, on a consolidated basis, excluding eLong, we're currently forecasting full year adjusted EBITDA growth approaching the midpoint of our 35% to 45% guidance range, with continued risk to the downside. We are pleased to see the improvement in recent room night growth trends and plan to invest behind it. This increase in marketing spend, coupled with the book-to-stay lag, may negatively impact Q4 profitability, which should set us up well as we move into 2017.
We expect the relative contributions of Orbitz and HomeAway versus our organic business to be broadly consistent with our guidance last quarter, better bottom line performance from these acquisitions, offsetting relative underperformance in the core business.
With that, let's open it up for some questions. Operator?"

As far as the volume trends and the execution of the base business, listen, it's just good to get back to execution on the core. There were a ton of people across the company focused in on the Orbitz integration. They did a terrific job. And note that, that acquisition integration came after Travelocity after Wotif. So I think the teams are -- there's a bit of relief for the teams to kind of get back to basics and get back to the business, and I think it's showing up in the numbers. You obviously don't see it in the stays because there's a book-to-stay lag, but the business has been getting consistently stronger as we expected it to as Q3 progressed, and early Q4 looks really good. So I think -- listen, we expected it sometimes when you hit a speed bump, you wonder whether it's structural or whether it's temporal. I think this one is certainly proving out to be temporal. We don't take anything for granted. We are, as usual, when we kind of accelerate into certain markets, the variable channels tend to be very fast-twitch channels for us, so you may see some kind of sales and marketing pressure on that front. And then following the variable channels, you get some of the more direct channels. And so in general, I'd say the teams are not taking anything for granted. I think that Q2 taught us a little bit of a lesson in humility that, I think, everyone can use once in a while. But based on what we're seeing, the formula that we've established for the past 5 years still works, and there's no reason why it wouldn't work on a go-forward basis. And we're certainly seeing that in the results. As far as HomeAway goes, the transactional revenue has been very strong in Q3 as we've rolled it out on a global basis and as the teams now are optimizing much more aggressively on the conversion front. And so while the transactional fee initially caused a dip in conversion, the teams there are really building out their e-commerce capabilities and muscles, and conversion is a very nice positive factor for us. Traffic continues to build, although Google kind of free search continues to be kind of weak. But on balance, we like what we're seeing, and you see it in the results. I think that as you move into Q4, and especially next year, you're going to see some of the subscription premium revenue that we have stopped selling start coming down, so the transactional revenue essentially has to scale up faster in order to make up for some of the subscription revenue growth coming down. It's something that we expected. And then, of course, some of the investments that we're making in marketing and technology, et cetera, are also going to show. So I think -- team on HomeAway likes where we are, but we know that we've got a big lift ahead of us and kind of the slope is going to get a little tougher, but I think the teams are up for it."

It sounds like things are accelerating here but mostly in paid channels. I guess, I'm not sure I totally understand kind of why the direct traffic or the direct channel is sort of lagging kind of the faster twitch paid channels. And then just on the HomeAway performance, strong quarter on EBITDA, was sort of in line-ish in terms of revenue for us. So can you just kind of remind us on that subscription revenue piece kind of how the renewals phase sort of through the year or kind of what percentage occur each quarter?"

So on the room night trends, basically what happens is when you start getting conversion back working -- if you can imagine everyone on your website right now has a higher probability of converting, and then the direct channel, that actually provides higher conversion rates and you get one benefit of that, and you also get it from those visitors that you brought via Google or metasearch. But then with that higher conversion rate, you actually adjust your bidding algorithms to say, I now expect a higher expected value from the traffic I'm getting from the variable channels on a go-forward basis. And at that point, you're allowed -- you're basically in a spot where you can take up your bids. And it adds an accelerator, if you will, in growth for those channels. So that's basically the impact. And then when you look at the impact of profitability, when you have that type of acceleration, what happens is, in the quarter where you're actually ramping up that spend, you only actually get to recognize a portion of the revenue because not all of the stays happen in that quarter, and we recognize revenue for our hotel business generally on the stay. With respect to HomeAway performance, listen, generally, the subscription renewals are spread throughout the year. As a reminder, we basically eliminated the tiers last quarter -- in the beginning of last quarter, grandfather in the number of the premium players. And those subscriptions that were at premium will essentially start rolling off here on a go-forward basis. And once they roll off, they will either reset at the close to $500-per-year subscription or the lower price we've set for online bookable properties. And so you'll essentially see the subscription revenue start to become a more negative headwind as we move through Q4 and in Q1 and Q2, and then you'll really start to annualize it in Q3 of next year. And then as a reminder, in terms of the traveler fee rollout, as you're thinking about next year, we launched the traveler fee just towards the very end of the first quarter last year in the U.S., and then Europe was towards the end of the second quarter."

We expect to be piloting that experience sometime in Q4. And based on the results of those pilots, I think we will be kind of making it a bigger part of our experience late this year and certainly going into next year. And I think it's a great benefit both for Expedia and Hotels.com consumers because they're going to get more breadth and depth of inventory in-market, especially in some of the markets where HomeAway is very strong. And then I think for HomeAway, our partners there, the homeowners, the property managers, they are going to get a significant boost of demand from these terrific travel brands, especially in urban destinations.

It's nothing new in this marketplace, and I think it's led to some of the consolidation that you've seen in the market more recently. There have been some players in Europe who were going out of business, so the competition is there. It is always difficult. The competitors are always getting better, and it's not good enough for a company to get better. You have get to get better faster. And I think we're on a good path now, and we expect our competitors to be as tough as they've always been. We've obviously seen some activity on the supplier kind of brand.com front as far as some of the kind of loyalty fares that have expanded now versus what we've seen in the past. We measure pretty carefully our performance in, call it, brand-heavy markets versus brand-light markets. We continue not to see any measurable difference between the 2, so it doesn't seem to be affecting our results. What it is doing is that it is shifting more share of our supply to the independents who are growing faster than some of these brands, and also, too, there are some brands who are giving us kind of the best inventory. So in general, the players who are giving us the best inventory are growing faster in our marketplace, both in terms of direct bookings and then you would think as far as the traffic that they're acquiring. So -- and that shift actually is giving us some decent margin, call it relief versus what we've seen in the past. So you'll notice that revenue per room night trends are generally improving as the year has gone by, and some of it is due to the shift. So listen, we'll be watching it very closely. We obviously want to get the best inventory from all of our partners. The brands are very, very important partners of ours, and our goal is to build our business with them, not shrink our business with them. And we're investing in a number of new interaction methodologies, technologies, to hopefully get there. As far as the markets -- the destination markets, I think in general, it was pretty solid across the board, and as we said, getting better. We did see some weakness in some markets in Florida relating to the Zika virus. There could be some offset in Mexico, for example. It's particularly strong as ever because Miami's weak. We don't exactly know. We were pleased to see Paris starting to grow again off of what was a pretty weak base. But it's great to see Paris now in the positive. The stay-in at Portugal were very strong this summer, both in terms of room nights as well as ADRs. And the U.K., funny enough, now with Brexit and the pound being weaker, London and the U.K. as a destination has become quite strong. So I'd say decent results, and the macro environment for us remains pretty good."

We'd call out South Korea and Japan as particularly promising markets, too. These are big markets where trivago is starting to scale up."

Well, we believe they're definitely working for us. We've got over 25 million Hotels.com rewards members, and it's -- the base is growing by over 30% a year.

We've got over 25 million Hotels.com rewards members, and it's -- the base is growing by over 30% a year. I believe Expedia+ is now close to 20 million, if not over, as far as our members go. And the members, both Hotels.com and Expedia+ as well as Orbitz, Orbucks members tend to come back to us. The repeat rates are significantly higher than nonmembers, and the direct repeat rates or what we call organic repeat rates are significantly higher as well. So you get higher spend and you get higher spend over more profitable channels. Now those behaviors tend to come over the lifetime of that member. So we pay for the member acquisition and we pay for the points upfront, which is a pressure on our P&L. You see some of that pressure in our revenue margins. And then we get the goodness as the member and the member base matures. The majority of our members at this point are in the U.S., but growth is very fast outside the U.S., especially in the Asia Pacific regions. We find that our APAC customers love a great deal. And the Hotels.com rewards program and Expedia rewards program, those are great deals. The other factor that's pretty interesting now is that we are getting more and more inventory through our hotel partners that is now available for members only. So these are discounts that are available only if you sign in. So it's not a retail discount. It doesn't hurt ADR at all, but the hotels who are participating in these kinds of programs tend to gain share in our marketplace without giving up retail rate. So we think it's a win for our members, and it's certainly a win for hotel customers as well. We're in the tens of thousands of the hotels that are making these rates available, so you can imagine it's a very, very broad program, and it's attractive for our member base, and it's attractive for our partners."

So I think in terms of growth rates, we're looking at Q3 as kind of a high watermark, if you will. We're in this period where subscription revenue has not yet become a meaningful drag, and you have got very easy comps on the transactional revenue. And so you basically are dropping a lot of profit to the bottom line, and we haven't yet completely ramped up to full steam on sales and marketing and, particularly, in technology and products. So those are 2 areas, particularly, where you'll see us start in Q4, and then particularly in through 2017, ramp investments aggressively. 2017, I will just tell you, is not a year where we will be as focused on adjusted EBITDA growth as we are in just building the capability, and that's for HomeAway, specifically. And we expect that once we build up, particularly the product and tech team, to where the size we want it to be, we'll be able to leverage that nicely as revenue growth, and ultimately, marketing contribution growth continues into 2018. And again, we feel very comfortable with our $350 million adjusted EBITDA number for 2018, but the path there will be one of investment in '17 and realization in '18 from a bottom line perspective."

There are hundreds of agencies, travel agencies, distributors, who have hotel inventory available, including these brands that have real scale.

And the second question, if I can, when you look at Orbitz on the hotel side, as you get deeper into the integration of the core properties from Orbitz onto the Expedia platform, are you guys seeing that traditional uptick in conversion rates that might allow you to step-up spending in variable marketing channels around that brand?

So on HomeAway, the $15 billion number that we quoted, we still feel comfortable with that number. To be honest, we're not too focused on looking at what the total platform-derived bookings are at this point. What we're very focused on is taking the booking number that is actually happening on platform and growing it as fast as we possibly can. To do that, of course, we're getting properties online, and we're now well over 1 million properties that are online bookable. Then we're very much focused next on making sure that the online bookable listings are actually driving transactions on the platform as opposed to off the platform. And so far, results have been very good. Conversion rates are up pretty nicely year-over-year. Progress is pretty good. So again, I think there is a huge opportunity here. I think the total bogey of $15 billion growing nicely because the overall market is growing nicely is absolutely out there. But the way we're getting there is just really focusing on the online piece and driving that as hard as we can. With respect to the Orbitz integration, we're definitely seeing nice conversion results on the hotel product. I think converting that into stepping-up in marketing is something that we're still playing with at this point. We've got 2 very strong global brands in Brand Expedia and Hotels.com. These are brands that we are investing in to build really for the long term. We think we've got a phenomenal brand also in Orbitz and in CheapTickets and in ebookers and Wotif and Travelocity. But the brands that are more regional in nature, our approach thus far has been, yes, be players in these variable marketing channels where we can, but let's be a little bit more focused on profit as opposed to top line trend -- top line trends. So I think we're still evaluating our approach here. It's not set in stone. But generally, we've been a little bit more bottom line focused with the Orbitzes of the world versus top line oriented."

You'll see it, for example, in our numbers as far as the intercompany spend with trivago has accelerated on a year-on-year basis, Q3 compared to Q2, so you could see that in our numbers. And in general, the meta channels are improving. We still think we can do better, so we're not satisfied there. As far as Instant Book goes, we continue to have a constructive dialogue with TripAdvisor. No news to share at this point. I think the Instant Book marketplace, in general, is more mature now, kind of the brand representation is better than it was when that product was initially introduced. So in general, we are more favorably inclined to that product now than where we were before, but we haven't crossed the finish line at this point. We'll see where we wind up in the next couple of quarters. As far as the HomeAway goes, on the conversion front, you're right. We're improving it and we're on track. The marketing -- the variable marketing channels are going to be an increasing factor, but I wouldn't call them a substantial factor at this point for HomeAway. The teams -- we actually brought a very, very talented executive from Hotels.com onto the HomeAway team. He had been running Hotels.com kind of online marketing for a while and did very, very well. And so he has now joined the HomeAway team. So I think the HomeAway team is now building the muscle. Conversion is going in the right direction, but really has to build the muscle to build a very, very strong variable marketing channel. And I think it's pretty early there. Also note that as we integrate the HomeAway inventory into Expedia and Hotels.com, Expedia and Hotels.com and Orbitz and Travelocity will also be able to bid more effectively for the vacation rental keywords as well. Who will be kind of the winner? Will it be more efficient for HomeAway to bid on those keywords or Hotels.com? That remains to be seen, and we will be kind of testing and learning our way there. But I think it will be a bigger factor next year versus anytime in the next couple of quarters."

There's no guarantee that those trends will continue, so I don't want you to take too much confidence as far as how we're doing. We're just kind of reporting based on how we've done and what we're seeing so far. In general, as we look at the macro environment, I do think that some of the weakness that we saw, as it related to our results in Q2, was self-inflicted. We were very open about that. The sites weren't as stable as they needed to be, some of the experimentation wasn't as strong as they needed to be, so we had to kind of get our own house in order. So I think it's difficult to compare our results and trends to macro trends because we went through a lot of changes here. We are seeing -- while domestic ADRs have been positive, when I look at kind of daily, weekly ADRs, they are weakening a little bit versus where they were in Q2, so that kind of agrees with some of the trends we're seeing. Our package inventory is in good shape. And again, hoteliers kind of load in inventory into opaque channels such as packages and Hotwire and these member-only deals when they need a little more help, and it feels like some of the hoteliers need a little more help. On the Egencia side, especially domestically, we're seeing a bit of caution as far as corporate travel spend goes. We don't see it in Europe, but we see it more domestically. So I'd say that on a macro basis, we're seeing some similar signs, which is a hint of weakness. We probably don't feel as much as some of the other folks just because this online channel is a big, growing channel, and we're riding that wave. And hopefully, the hotel partners who engage with us on the inventory front aggressively are going to ride that wave with us, and hopefully, gain some share as we gain share.

Not surprisingly, we are seeing an increased shift of transactions and traffic to smartphone. Tablet is petering out. Mobile web is becoming more significant for us as we get much better at bidding for mobile web traffic in variable channels. So hopefully, that will help you feel the trends that we're seeing."

As far as the opportunity and challenges around AI and VR, I think on the AI side, we're testing with some interesting technologies such as on the Facebook Messenger side, you're able to go back and forth with AI agents, so to speak, to book a hotel",401,"Sure. As far as the opportunity and challenges around AI and VR, I think on the AI side, we're testing with some interesting technologies such as on the Facebook Messenger side, you're able to go back and forth with AI agents, so to speak, to book a hotel on Expedia. It's pretty cool. You should try it out. And I think it's very, very -- it's a very, very early iteration of what a kind of a consumer experience might look like. I personally think that the bigger, kind of the more significant opportunity in AI near to midterm is with highly repeatable, call it, simple tasks that consumers engage in. And if you combine kind of machine learning there with identity -- so for example, on Facebook Messenger, we have identity established, I think on the customer service side, you can have some pretty clean, great experiences. You're being able to Messenger Expedia to ""Change my Thursday night hotel booking to Friday"" or ""Cancel my San Francisco hotel booking, et cetera,"" without having to call someone, without having to give an itinerary number, without having to really speak to anyone and just be able to message back and forth with essentially a bot to get your customer service requests done. Or for example, we're very, very -- we'd love to work with our hotel partners. Right now, you can message our hotels through some of our systems to be able to message our hotel and ask for late check-out or early check-in, et cetera. Those, I think, are experiences where AI can service you because you've got high volumes, you've got repeatable tasks that a computer can kind of iterate against and learn from. So I think you'll see some of the sexy stuff on the bookings side, and then you'll see some of the unsexy stuff on the customer service side, and we plan to experiment with both of them. On the VR side, we are testing with kind of VR rigs as we speak. I think that the potential that we see with VR is to whet the appetite of someone looking at a destination, what experience they can have, and/or a hotelier. So we want VR to be just good enough to make you want to go there, but not good enough for you to avoid the trip. And I think we have plenty of time there."

One of the announcements that took us a little bit by surprise in the quarter was the Marriott-Expedia, with respect to Expedia being the technology platform partnering Vacations by Marriott. Wanted to understand a little bit of the genesis of how that came to be. And Dara, we've talked a lot over the years on these calls about the technology investments Expedia is making about how that puts you on the front foot after a number of years to be a broader technology platform for the travel industry. Is this the forerunner for things we could see over the next couple of years? And how might that impact the business model?"

Listen, the platform that we built, both on the Expedia side and on the Hotels.com side, have the capability to be extensible. And the -- just as we are using the Expedia platform to power the Orbitz side with different experiences, power Wotif with different experiences, we will be able to extend that capability to a Marriott Vacations and other providers as well. We think that there are tons and tons of hotels out there and hotel chains out there, airlines out there, who don't necessarily -- aren't necessarily able to keep investing and keep experimenting and keep optimizing leading sites that can accept payments in every single kind of payment plan known on earth. We can do that, and we can essentially extend our platform into the travel ecosystem, which is something that we're doing. And then on the supply side, we're even tying in now supply from third parties, where, not only are we acquiring supply directly, but we are piping in supply from other players, and we will kind of present the best choice for consumers based on what that best choice is, based on availability, based on pricing, et cetera. So it is a 2-sided marketplace. We're very, very early in this. And then, of course, we've got a private label business, our EAN business, that is actually one of the stars of the show. It's a business that's growing very, very quickly, especially in the Asia Pacific markets, and we're pretty optimistic about. And then lastly, Orbitz did have a very, very big private label business. It had, call it, more customization capability than what we had built on the Expedia side, where we have taken on that team, and they're a very important part of our team now, and we're building up, call it, the more -- the increased customization capability on top of the Expedia platform. So we're investing in this area. You're not done seeing, hopefully, surprising announcements in the future because I think our capabilities are going to get much, much better here."

So Accelerator -- kind of the number of hotels that are engaging and the Accelerator product continues to increase. The bidding activity continues to increase as well. We're seeing less engagement from some of our -- the big brands out there. So smaller hotels tend to engage in Accelerator more aggressively, but we're very, very pleased with the results. And kind of every week, the numbers get better. It is still a new product, and it's not a, I would say, significant driver of our overall results, but we do see it building, and we're quite pleased with the early signs so far. As far as Orbitz goes and what functionality, there was a number of, call it, packages-type functionality that we initially dropped off that we're going to be adding as time goes on. ebookers in Europe had a certain functionality, what we call sub-pub, where they were -- they kind of price some airfare below published rates in order to go out and acquire customers. There was some fee technology that both Orbitz and ebookers had built variable fees, especially on the air side, that we haven't carried through at this point. These are all technologies that were actually pretty interesting, but whenever you move on something from a technology side, you kind of introduce what we call an MVP, a minimum viable product, and then you build on it. So some of this functionality may make its way back, some of it is very, very cool, but we wanted to move kind of Orbitz and ebookers over as quickly as possible. And I think the teams made the right tradeoff calls, and I think that they've executed quite well."
