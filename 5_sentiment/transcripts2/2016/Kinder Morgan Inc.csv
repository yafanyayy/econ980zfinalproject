Before I turn the meeting over to Steve Kean and Kim Dang to review the fourth quarter 2015 financial results and other important developments during this period, I'd like to talk a bit about the future of the company. We will be delving into the 2016 outlook in more detail at our upcoming investor meeting next week but I believe it's important to focus on a few key points. KMI's underlying business remains strong even in this challenging environment. Our year-end results turned out very consistent with what we projected to you in our third quarter call both from a DCF standpoint and a debt-to-EBITDA standpoint. This has to mean that our fundamental businesses are doing well, notwithstanding the current weakness in our industry. Fundamentals don't seem to matter in this chicken little disguise following market, but they should to prudent long-term investors. We are generator of a tremendous amount of free cash flow, about $5 billion per year, and that's after we pay all of our operating costs, our interest expense and our sustaining CapEx. Now there are several ways we can utilize that cash flow. We can delever the balance sheet, internally fund our growth capital needs and/or return cash to our shareholders through either increasing the dividend and/or buying back shares. We have significantly reduced our anticipated capital expansion expenditures for 2016. You will hear more details on that from Steve today and at our investor conference. And that's a trend you can expect to continue as we high grade our capital investments and selectively joint venture projects where appropriate. As we reduce those expenditures, we will obviously have more cash to continue to strengthen our balance sheet and return to our shareholders. Reducing the dividend was not an easy decision, but given the strength and sustainability of our business and the cash generated thereby, I believe is the largest shareholder you will see KMI emerge as a stronger company with a strengthened balance sheet, higher coverage on the dividends we pay and with no need to access equity markets for the foreseeable future. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Steve."

First is the performance of our business in these challenging times. Second is our counterparty credit risk. And third, our growth capital, and I'll do some segment highlights. 
So looking at full year 2015 compared to 2014, here's the summary. On an earnings before DD&A basis, 3 of our 5 business segments grew year-over-year. Gas was up 1%, Terminals was up 8% and Products was up 27%. Kinder Morgan Canada would have been up year-over-year, but for the effect of the weakening Canadian dollar. And no surprise, CO2 was down 22% as a result of lower commodity prices. To put this performance in context, this performance was against the backdrop of a very negative environment for the entire energy sector. On a full year basis, 2014 -- or 2015 to 2014, oil prices were down 49%. Of course, down further still from there and gas was down 40%. Oil and gas commodity prices directly affect the portion of EBITDA, which we quantify each year, but the larger driver of our business is the demand for what we actually sell, energy transportation and storage services. That's the primary business we're in. Let's look at those numbers. 
In the gas business, which provides more than 50% of our segment earnings before DD&A, our transport volumes were up 5% year-over-year and sales and gathering were up 4% each on a full year basis. Our products pipeline volumes were up 3% on refined products and up 15% on total liquids transported, and that concludes crude, condensate and NGLs, and those were driven by expansions and the Hiland acquisition. While most of what we handle in our liquids businesses is made up of refined products and other liquids, not crude, crude is in the nudes. So let's look at our crude transportation asset. Our Trans Mountain system is prorated. That means there's not enough capacity to serve the available demand. KMCC, Kinder Morgan Crude and Condensate, our Eagle Ford Pipeline, it's volumes have been growing through the year with our expansions. We have good contracts. We're in a resilient location in the Eagle Ford and we have great downstream connectivity to end-use markets and storage and dock capacity. In this business, especially now, contracts matter, location matters and connectivity matters and we have all of that with the KMCC system. July, first half of the year, July year-to-date numbers were about 193,000 barrels a day transported. December was just under 240,000. So much smaller piece of the overall picture, but our pipeline, in West Texas is moving record volumes. So even our crude transport assets are doing pretty well under those circumstances. Finally, the liquids part of our Terminal segment, which is now 74% of the earnings before DD&A of that segment, saw volumes increased 18.7% for the full year and 11.3% in the fourth quarter. Now granted for all of these businesses, our contracts in many cases call for us to get paid whether the capacity is used or not, which is a good thing, by the way. So volume is not always a perfect driver of margin, but it is a good indicator that notwithstanding drastically lower commodity prices, the demand for our specific midstream assets is really quite good. Commodity prices do directly affect us in the CO2 business and a subpart of our midstream business, we also suffered in our bug terminals business in coal and steel and especially from the bankruptcy of 2 of our important coal customers. And those things absolutely pulled back our performance without a doubt, but it's important to remember, particularly in times like these, that our primary business is the transportation and storage of energy commodities for a fee and that the commodities that we handle the most are natural gas and refined products. So notwithstanding the headwinds we faced in our business, we believe that once again, we demonstrated that our large diversified portfolio of fee-based assets can produce stable results even in extremely tumultuous market conditions. 
All right now, let's talk about counterparty credit risks just briefly. We're going to talk more about this in the conference next week. We continue to monitor closely our counterparty credit risk as we always have. Fortunately, we're a large and very diverse company with operations across a number of sectors and across the spectrum within those sectors. We have a large customer base with only about 20 customers accounting for more than 1% of our annual revenues and the great majority of our customers remain solidly investment grade. The largest of those 20 customers is about 5% of our revenue and that customer is rated AA minus. We estimate that our top 25 customer constitute about 44% of our revenue and just over 80% of the revenue from that top 25 is coming from investment grade rated entities. We'll provide you some more detail and more refined analysis on our customer base next week -- at next week's conference, but those are some high-level indication. Now just once again, 20 customers, only 20 customers account for more than 1%. The largest of those is just under 5% and is rated AA minus. Our top 25 constitute 44% of the revenue and 80% of that is from investment grade sources. Thirdly, we also were charges this last quarter on securing on our investment-grade debt metrics for 2016 and beyond and ensuring that we can continue to invest in high-quality opportunities that allow us to grow value per share. We high graded our backlog to focus on the highest return opportunities. We're aiming to reduce spend, improve returns and selectively joint venture projects where appropriate. We reduced our 2016 spend that we initially announced to you by an additional $900 million. That's off the $4.2 billion we said in December. And we reduced our backlog by $3.1 billion from the third quarter of 2015, and that's just under $1 billion of the projects placed in-service during the quarter. That action, along with retaining the cash above our $0.50 annual dividend obviates the needs for us access capital markets showers our investment-grade debt metrics and both of those things add stability to our outlook in difficult times while enable us to continue to grow our value over time. 
Now just a few segment highlights and Kim will cover all the financial details here. Again, just some operational things, natural gas, as I said, volumes were up 5% compared to the fourth quarter. That's higher volume soon Texas states because of exports to Mexico, higher throughput on, also on Mexico and power generation load. 
And looking at those 2 sectors of demand for just a minute, so our power demand on our systems was up 10% on a full year basis year-over-year -- I'm sorry, 10% for the fourth quarter and 16% for a full year basis compared to 2014. And throughput to Mexico was up 22% on a year-over-year full year basis across our systems and is now about 2.4 -- 2.3 to 2.4 Bcf a day on average. Also worth reminding you, over the last 2 years, the gas group has entered into new and pending from transport capacity commitments totaling 8.5 Bcf a day and about 1.6 Bcf of that was previously unsold capacity. We now estimate that of the natural gas consumed in the United States, about 38% moves in our pipes. Now some of that is moving on other pipes together into hours or delivered off of ours, but 38% of the gas consumed is moving at some point on KMI pipelines. And we believe that the combination of power demand, LNG exports, exports to Mexico and additional pet chem and industrial demand on the Gulf Coast create a bright outlook for our gas transportation and storage assets. 
Products Pipelines, as I mentioned, refined products up 3% compared to 2014 and this demonstrates the upside of lower commodity prices in at least some parts of our business. And as I said earlier, total volumes were up 15% with the effects of the acquisitions and expansions in our liquids business. 
CO2, sacra generated record annual gross oil production during the full year up 2% compared to 2014. It was down 11% quarter-to-quarter in the fourth quarter versus a record Q4 of 2014. Combined oil production across all of our fields is up 2% compared to 2014. Net NGL sales volumes were up 3% compared to 2014. And we kept a close eye on costs and produced cost savings in OpEx and sustaining capital of roughly 25% off of our 2015 budget. The Terminals business was up 8% year-over-year on segment earnings before DD&A. This continues to be the tail of 2 businesses with the strong performance, very strong performance in our liquids business, which is now roughly 3/4 of this segment offset by continuing -- continued weakness in our bulk terminals driven again by weakness in coal and steel volumes and compounded, of course, with the bankruptcy of our 2 coal customers. The strength of our liquids performance is driven by several organic growth projects, our Jones Act vessel additions, the Vopak terminals acquisition and channel. And we continue to have a very strong outlook for the demand for our capacity in the significant positions that we have built in refined products in the Houston Ship Channel and in oil in Edmonton. 
Finally, an update on Kinder Morgan Canada and Trans Mountain in particular. This expansion, as I will remind you, is in the long-term contracts with customers who want to see that project built. The 3 key areas of focus for us now are the recommended order, consultation and the combination with the First Nations and the satisfaction of the BC governments 5 condition. We're making progress in all 3 though not as quickly as we like. With respect to the NEB, we received our draft conditions in August. We think they are manageable. So we did see important changes especially around the time required for approval specific portions of the project. We're waiting to see a further process will be required by the new federal government and remain hopeful that all the work that we've done today, both inside and outside the NAV process to address stakeholder concerns, will be taken into account. We're currently scheduled to receive the NAV recommended order in May and the order in council process to follow. We continue to make good progress in meeting the consultation in the combination we have with First Nations. We've added several benefit agreements, which bring actual support for the project from majority of the banks that are most directly affected by the project. On the BC 5 conditions, BC government has made clear that we are not there yet, but have clearly left the door open to closing the gap, which we are working to do. We have this project in the backlog, and we're aiming for third quarter of 2019 completion. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Kim."

Now we ended the year with almost $1.2 billion in coverage, as I",1785,"Thanks, Steve. Let me start with comparing against what we said last quarter, which was that we expect to end the year with approximately $300 million in coverage and debt-to-EBITDA of 5.6x. Now we ended the year with almost $1.2 billion in coverage, as I will take you through in a moment, that's not an apples-to-apples comparison due to the change in our dividend policy. If you adjust the fourth quarter dividend to the $0.52 per share that we expected to pay prior to the decision to reduce the dividend, we would've ended the year with approximately $297 million in coverage. And that includes absorbing over a $40 million reduction in our fourth quarter results that we did not anticipate as of the end of the third quarter to account for the Arch bankruptcy. On the debt-to-EBITDA side, we ended the year at 5.6 as expected, and I'll take you through the details of the balance sheet in a moment. 
On the face of the GAAP income statement, you will see that revenue is down, both for the quarter and the full year, compared to the corresponding period in 2014 year. This quarter, we've added a line to break out cost of goods sold, which you can see is down more than the decrease in revenues. As I've said over the last 3 quarters, change in revenue is not a good predictor of our performance as we have some businesses where revenues and expense fluctuate with commodity prices that the margin generally does not. We believe that the best indicator of our performance is the cash we generate or DCF per share. However, for those of you who need adjusted EPS for your models, adjusted EPS without certain items is about $0.21 in the quarter, which is slightly above consensus. 
DCF, on the second page of the numbers on the press release, we calculate free distributable cash flow. We generated DCF for the quarter of $1.233 billion and $4.699 billion for the year. For the quarter, DCF is down approximately $45 million versus the fourth quarter of 2014. For the full year, DCF is up $2.1 billion. The increase in the full year is largely the result of the acquisition by KMI of KMP and EPB that was completed in the fourth quarter of 2014. And so a lot of the benefits to DCF is due to the fact that the MLPs are no longer outstanding, and you can see that benefit in the line of our DCF calculation entitled MLP Declared Distributions. For the quarter, the 4% reduction is primarily the result of our CO2 segment, which was down about $77 million. Our Terminal segment, down about $20 million primarily as a result of the Arch bankruptcy, and increased interest expense and preferred interest payments. Although we're not happy to be down 4% in light of the overall circumstances and the energy and capital markets, as Rich and Steve have both said, we believe this performance is very strong and demonstrates the stability of our assets. For the full year, DCF per share is probably the best way to look at our results because it takes into account the benefit the DCF at the merger transaction as well as the cost of the approximately 1.1 billion shares that we issued to purchase the MLPs. For the full year, the DCF per share is $2.14 or an increase of approximately 7% over the $2 per share in 2014. For the quarter, DCF per share is down approximately 8% for the reasons I mentioned a moment ago with respect to DCF plus incremental shares issued to finance our project and to reduce leverage. The $0.55 in DCF per share for the quarter and the $2.14 per share for the year results in coverage for the quarter of about $950 million and year-to-date coverage of $1.18 billion. As I said a few minutes ago, if we have paid a dividend of $0.52 in the fourth quarter, coverage would have been around $300 million just under versus our budget of $654 million. So let me give you the major components of the $350 million change versus our budget. 
If you utilize the commodity sensitivity metric that we gave you last January of $10 million change in DCF for every $1 change in crude and $3 million change in DCF for every $0.10 change in natural gas, the impact of our full year results is approximately $246 million. We have additional commodity price impact of a little bit over $20 million, most of which is due to deterioration in crude to NGL ratio, meaning the NGL prices deteriorated more than crude prices and we budgeted for our constant racial. Indirectly, commodity prices have impacted us by another $117 million due to 3 primary things: lower CO2 sales volumes, lower gathering and processing volumes in our Midstream natural gas segments and a weaker Canadian dollar, so the FX impact, impacting our Terminal segment and our Kinder Morgan segment. Coal bankruptcies impacted us by over $65 million, which was Arch and Alpha. So you take those items that I just went through, that accounts for about four -- over $450 million, so well more than the total variance of about $350 million. There are lots of other moving pieces, both positive and negative, but the primary offset to the $450 million were lower interest expense and CO2 and other cost savings. 
Now let me give you a little more granularity on where we ended up in segments versus our budgets. Natural gas pipelines ended up about 1% above its budget as the positive impact of the Hiland transaction better performance on the Texas Intrastates, SMG and TGP were largely offset by the impact in our Midstream group of lower commodity prices and lower gathering and processing volumes. CO2 ended the year approximately 15% below its budget as we projected last quarter. This, as we have discussed, is more than our commodity price sensitivity would indicate and it's driven by lower crude oil volumes, lower CO2 volumes and lower capitalized overhead as reduced -- as a result of reduced expansion spending, offset by over $40 million in cost savings. Terminals ended the year approximately 10% below its budget versus the 6% we discussed last quarter with the primary variance being the Arch -- the impact of the Arch bankruptcy. The Terminal segment was negatively impacted in its budget by lower coal and steel volumes, again, the largest piece being the Alpha and Arch bankruptcies and also the FX impact of the weaker Canadian dollar. Products ended the year approximately 2% below its budget. The positive impact of the Double H Pipeline, which was acquired in the Hiland acquisition, is slightly more than offset by approximately $24 million of commodity price segregation consistent with the sensitivity, lower volumes on our KMCC pipe than we budgeted and lower margins in our Transmix business. Finally, as we discussed last quarter, KMC was below its budget for the year by approximately $20 million due to FX. 
On the expense side, interest, cash taxes and sustaining CapEx all gain in lower-than-expected therefore, positive variance versus our budget, and that was somewhat offset by higher G&A. The negative variance in G&A is driven by the Hiland acquisition and lower capitalized overhead as a result of lower expansion capital spending. On interest, the incremental interest is associated with the financing the Hiland transaction was more than offset by lower balance than our budget and lower rates when you take out the impact of the Hiland transaction. Finally, we expect cash taxes and sustaining CapEx, they came in lower than our budget or they were, said another way, they were favorable variance. 
There are a couple of certain items in the quarter that I actually want to highlight for you. One, we reported an estimated $1.15 billion noncash goodwill impairment on our Midstream natural gas assets. We also recorded approximately $284 million in impairment on other assets primarily in our CO2 segment. These impairments were driven by the lower commodity price environment and also by lower stock prices. 
Let me give you this warning. If commodity and equity prices continue to fall, then there is --  then we may have impairments in future quarters. We also recorded as a certain item in this quarter a $200 million benefit associated with the contract payment that we received on Kinder Morgan Louisiana pipeline. And with that, I'll turn to the balance sheet. 
On the balance sheet, we ended the fourth quarter with debt -- net debt of $41.2 billion based on $7.37 billion of EBITDA that gives us a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 5.6x, again, consistent with where we thought we would end. The $41.2 billion is an increase in debt of $610 million for the full year, and it's a decrease in debt of $1.235 billion for the quarter. So let me reconcile first the quarter. $1.235 billion decrease in debt. We spent about a little under $940 million on acquisitions, expansion CapEx and contributions to equity investments. We issued equity of about $1.58 billion. The contract buyout that we received on KMLA was $200 million and we received an income tax refund of a little over $150 million. And then working capital and other items were a source of cash of about over $240 million. 
Now let me say that here you would expect, I talked about coverage in the quarter being $950 million. That coverage is based on the $0.125 dividend, the 953. What we actually paid in the fourth quarter was the dividend that we declared in the third quarter. So the $0.51. And so when reconciling the debt, the $0.51 dividend is what was paid in the quarter and the cash that went out the door. So you do not see the benefit in the fourth quarter yet of the reduced dividend. You will see that going forward beginning in the first quarter. For the year, debt -- the change in debt was an increase of $610 million. We spent about $6.9 billion in cash on acquisitions, expansion CapEx and contributions to equity investment. Hiland was $3.06 billion and then we spent about $3.4 billion in expansion CapEx. Those are the major components of the $6.9 billion. We made pension contribution of $50 million. We issued equity, including the preferred $5.4 billion. The contract buyout on KMLA was 200. We received $347 million in income tax refund. And then we had about $400 million of coverage and other working capital items over the course of the cash. And that gets you to the $610 million increase in debt. 
And so with that, I'll turn it back to Rich."

And I would tell you exactly what that is, but I think a reasonable benchmark is think of mid-teens returns after-tax, okay? And what we're trying to do is really make sure that we're investing capital on the highest return opportunities that we have, make sure that we're fulfilling our commitments and delaying spend where it can be delayed or deferred and taking on partners where it makes sense for us to take on partners. And I think what we've been able to do successfully over the years is originate really good returning midstream energy projects. And so because we're able to do that even though we're doing our capital is quite finite, there are people out there who are happy to participate with us as partners, and we're exploring those opportunities where those makes sense. So we think our returns are adequate on separable projects that could be joint ventured. They're quite good and we think people will be interested in joining us in those projects. We would continue to build it, own it, operate it, et cetera, but it gives us an opportunity to free up capital, to deploy higher return opportunities or to use with the balance sheet or to ultimately, in the longer term, return cash or increased dividends, just depending on what the circumstances -- what appears to be most rewarded at the time. So it's really doing economically rational things like deferring spend where you can. We fleshed out some scope changes, cost savings, other things that are real improvements to the economics, finding joint venture partners where those things make sense and channeling the capital that we have to the highest returns that are in the backlog right now and potentially to some new projects. So that will be in our capitals constraint for that."

But I think looking at where we are today, I mean, I'm obviously very disappointed, as you would expect, where the KMI stock price is and the way the market has treated us post to dividend. We thought we took a great deal of uncertainty out of the equation. And as I said, the key fundamental thing is the amount of distributable cash flow we produced. And of course, valuation 101 which say that regardless of what you do with your free cash flow, your distributive cash flow, whether you dividend it out, put it in new projects, as long as those are good new projects and ours are, or buy back stock or pay down debt, really should make no difference from a valuation standpoint. But clearly, parts of the market are not on that same page. I believe the long term, the fact that we have no need to access equity markets, not just for '16 but for the foreseeable future, and that we will self-fund, our capital expenditures, our growth capital, should, in the long run, I think be a very solid underpinning to this company and we're going to be able to return a lot more money to our shareholders in the long-term as well as delever the balance sheet. I think as far as the overall market is concerned, I said in the opening remarks, it seems like a chicken little disguise falling market where there seems to be no discrimination among based on quality or based on virtually anything. It's just if oil prices go down, sell everything in the energy sector, I think that's a very wrong headed short-term view, but the market is what the market is and obviously, we believe we're tremendously under priced. If you look here's a company that can have close to $5 billion of free cash flow in the total market cap, but this level is $27 billion, $28 billion, I'm afraid if you computed it, it upsets me so much. But that's my feeling on it probably more than you wanted to hear, but as a larger shareholder, I can tell you, it's a very frustrating."

So CO2 has been a multi-part capital review because we've been keeping up with commodity prices as they come down. And so what we're spending money on, when we put incremental capital into CO2, what we're looking at is getting a very good return, an upper teens or plus -- 20 plus percent after-tax unlevered return incrementally, meaning for the oil that particular program or that particular development is going to produce at the current forward curve. And then we also look at, when we're doing the evaluation, we look what an NPV 15 breakeven price is for crude so that we can kind of see how much, if you will, headroom or how much room we have to have that be a successful program if we proceed with it. So we've been, as prices have been coming down, we've been bringing the CapEx down and we've been eliminating programs. It still makes sense to invest in some programs, but you're going to see a lower CapEx number for CO2 for 2016 than probably we've ever, but still some pretty decent production with that plan. So we keep bringing it down and we look at the price in those 2 ways. And the third thing I would say about the way we evaluate it is that these are programs spends, right? So what you're doing is you say, okay, we're going to do this many insults in SACROC, okay? So we're going to go out and do infills. The infills produce oil. It tends to be front-end loaded. But if they're not performing the way we think they should or the prices that we think it needs to be, and I'm just picking out infills is probably a pretty high return, high-end project for us, but just to use it it as an example, we have the flexibility to scale that program back and not deploy that capital. So we have high graded the CO2 capital, kept up-to-date with what commodity prices are. Although as you know, as you can see from today, that's a day-to-day exercise, but we also have flexibility in the spend when we do deploy it."

The gathering and processing part of our business, that really has 2 parts to it. I mean, there's a piece of that business that is secured under transport agreements with minimum take that looks something like what you would see in a gathering agreement or a fee-based processing arrangement, which looks something like you would see in the rest of our business. The second part of that business is percentage of proceeds kinds of business where we are more exposed to commodity price. We picked up some of that with coconut and some of that with the Hiland acquisition says well, and so you have to kind of break it apart, and we're talking about see if we can break that out further, quantify that further so that people could see those 2 parts of that business. What we're trying to do on the percentage of proceeds part is to try to migrate that more to fee-based. So we're kind of in the start of that process right now, but we do have exposure there. So then that becomes commodity price assumption-driven. What do you commodity prices are going to be. What do you think processing spreads are going to be. And we made some high-level assumptions in the budget, including a NGL price deck that we used. And so we think we've calibrated that reasonably well, but there is certainly variability in part 2 of that business as I've mentioned it. Tom, anything more?"

So it's not like we're going to look for a JV partner on them. And in many cases, like where it's building out connections or adding some capability in a terminal or something like that, it's really not -- it's not separable and we can do it and we can get relatively quick and early returns in general, very good returns for it. And then there are projects maybe at the other end where they're quite attractive for a market return. They're probably less of a return than what we are looking for on an incremental investment basis and they are separable or identifiable separate from the rest of our network, and those would be obvious JV candidates for us. But look, what we're trying to mainly do here is we're trying to make sure that, first and foremost, defend our debt-to-EBITDA metrics and maintain a secure investment-grade rating. And the CapEx that we spend in 2016 drives that. So we're going to be very mindful and we're going to treat it as finite and precious and allocate to the highest available returns that we have. But there are going to be projects that we'll have the opportunity to do, and we're going to continue to do those, and we're going to JV the ones that are, if you will, amenable to being JV-ed where we continue to build a project operated and known significant interest in it where we maybe bring third-party capital and in order to help cover some of that cost.

But just very simplistically, and we outlined this in the release today, even after we have done a revised budget, reducing a major bleed, the commodity assumptions and raising the interest rates projection in accordance with the forward curve, we do all that and we still have $4.9 billion of DCF for the equity holders. You deduct the roughly $150 million in preferred dividends, we see about $4.7 million available to the common. You pay $1.1 billion in the reduced dividends, that leaves a $3.6 billion. And as we've said, we reduced our capital expenditure program to a little less than $3.3 billion. Now there's a heck of a lot of moving parts in that but you just look at very simplistically the ability to fund the capital project program, we can do that. Now to the extent that that $3.3 billion is something less than that, that would free up more money to either further delever the balance sheet or return to shareholders through 1 of the 2 methods that we talked about. So I think the real message here, guys, is we are self-funding now, okay? And I got to tell you, that -- to me, that's a big relief. Nobody's affected anymore than I was by the dividend cut, okay? But the point is we are building a very solid, stable balance sheet with the ability to return an awful lot of cash to our shareholders over the next few years."

So the question is with all these moving parts that you've described and you've went through a description before about the balancing act between the capital spending and the growth, now just doing a little back of the envelope arithmetic here, if you'd kept to the 10% dividend increase that you'd promised originally, if there had been no trouble in the credit markets the way there was, you would have had something like $3 dividend or $3.20 dividend 5 years down the road, which would have produced about an 8% yield on the $40 stock that you then had. Now you've got a stock roughly 25% of that 40. If you look out, I know you can't be too specific, but in terms of having a basis to buy the stock here, obviously, the dividend in future, 3 to 5 years down the road, is going to be the crucial determinant as the capital spending starts to fade away. So is there any kind of guidance that you can give numerically about that balancing act so that the person who says I'm going to buy a $12 stock today, obviously, if you stop all capital spending today, you'd have a 20% return with a $2 dividend if you restored it. So the balance between the capital spending and the growth that you're going to develop for that is crucial to getting some handle on the ultimate investment return here. So it would be very powerful useful to have a little more definitive color on that balancing average in terms of the 5-year outlook. I mean, what can we as shareholders paying $12 today look for in terms of a dividend 5 years down the road as the capital spending may face down?"

It has nothing to do with our base business, but you will get a sense for how much distributable cash flow we think will be produced from that backlog and then people can make with tears whatever assumptions they want to make about what happens with the base business and how -- where exactly we take the balance sheet and how we return capital at some point to people, whether that's share repurchase or dividends or otherwise.

If the best way is to delever the balance sheet, that's what we're going to do. It's a combination of all these factors and in this hectic market, it's just very difficult to give you some specific number you can rely on in 2020 or 2021. But I appreciate your concern and certainly, we agree with you. And the largest shareholder. I won a see all kinds of value derived by the common shareholders of this company."

Before I turn the meeting over to Steve Kean and Kim Dang to review the fourth quarter 2015 financial results and other important developments during this period, I'd like to talk a bit about the future of the company. We will be delving into the 2016 outlook in more detail at our upcoming investor meeting next week, but I believe it's important to focus on a few key points. 
KMI's underlying business remains strong even in this challenging environment. Our year-end results turned out very consistent with what we projected to you in our third quarter call, both from a DCF standpoint and a debt-to-EBITDA standpoint. This says to me that our fundamental businesses are doing well, notwithstanding the current weakness in our industry. Fundamentals don't seem to matter in this chicken-little-disguise-falling [ph] market, but they should to prudent long-term investors. 
We are a generator of a tremendous amount of free cash flow, about $5 billion per year, and that's after we pay all of our operating costs, our interest expense and our sustaining CapEx. Now there are several ways we can utilize that cash flow. We can delever the balance sheet, internally fund our growth capital needs and/or return cash to our shareholders through either increasing the dividend and/or buying back shares. We have significantly reduced our anticipated capital expansion expenditures for 2016. You will hear more details on that from Steve today and at our investor conference. And that's a trend you can expect to continue as we high grade our capital investments and selectively joint venture projects where appropriate. As we reduce those expenditures, we will obviously have more cash to continue to strengthen our balance sheet and return to our shareholders. Reducing the dividend was not an easy decision, but given the strength and sustainability of our business and the cash generated thereby, I believe is the largest shareholder you will see KMI emerge as a stronger company with a strengthened balance sheet, higher coverage on the dividends we pay, and with no need to access to equity markets for the foreseeable future. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Steve."

So I'm going to cover 3 topics before hitting on some -- a few segment highlights. First is the performance of our business in these challenging times. Second is our counterparty credit risk. And third, our growth capital, and the",1867,"All right, thanks, Rich. So I'm going to cover 3 topics before hitting on some -- a few segment highlights. First is the performance of our business in these challenging times. Second is our counterparty credit risk. And third, our growth capital, and then I'll do some segment highlights. 
So looking at full year 2015 compared to 2014, here's the summary. On an earnings before DD&A basis, 3 of our 5 business segments grew year-over-year. Gas was up 1%, Terminals was up 8% and Products was up 27%. Kinder Morgan Canada would have been up year-over-year, but for the effect of a weakening Canadian dollar. And no surprise, CO2 was down 22% as a result of lower commodity prices. To put this performance in context, this performance was against the backdrop of a very negative environment for the entire energy sector. On a full year basis, 2014 -- or 2015 to 2014, oil prices were down 49%. Of course, they're down further still from there and gas was down 40%. Oil and gas commodity prices directly affect the portion of our EBITDA, which we quantify each year, but the larger driver of our business is the demand for what we actually sell, energy transportation and storage services. That's the primary business we're in. Let's look at those numbers. 
In the gas business, which provides more than 50% of our segment earnings before DD&A, our transport volumes were up 5% year-over-year and sales and gathering were up 4% each on a full year basis. Our products pipeline volumes were up 3% on refined products and up 15% on total liquids transported, and that concludes crude, condensate and NGLs, and those were driven by expansions and the Hiland acquisition. While most of what we handle in our liquids businesses is made up of refined products and other liquids, not crude. Crude is in the news. So let's look at our crude transportation asset. 
Our Trans Mountain system is prorated. That means there's not enough capacity to serve the available demand. KMCC, Kinder Morgan Crude and Condensate, our Eagle Ford Pipeline, it's volumes have been growing through the year with our expansions. We have good contracts. We're in a resilient location in the Eagle Ford, and we have great downstream connectivity to end-use markets and storage and dock capacity. 
In this business, especially now, contracts matter, location matters and connectivity matters, and we have all of that with the KMCC system. July -- first half of the year, July year-to-date numbers were about 193,000 barrels a day transported. December was just under 240,000. It's a much smaller piece of the overall picture, but our Wink Pipeline, in West Texas is moving record volumes. So even our crude transport assets are doing pretty well under those circumstances. 
Finally, the liquids part of our Terminal segment, which is now 74% of the earnings before DD&A of that segment, so volumes increased 18.7% for the full year and 11.3% in the fourth quarter. Now granted for all of these businesses, our contracts in many cases call for us to get paid whether the capacity is used or not, which is a good thing, by the way. So volume is not always a perfect driver of margin, but it is a good indicator that notwithstanding drastically lower commodity prices, the demand for our specific midstream assets is really quite good. Commodity prices do directly affect us in the CO2 business and a subpart of our midstream business. We also suffered in our bulk Terminals business in coal and steel, and especially from the bankruptcy of 2 of our important coal customers. And those things absolutely pulled back our performance without a doubt, but it's important to remember, particularly in times like these, that our primary business is the transportation and storage of energy commodities for a fee and that the commodities that we handle the most are natural gas and refined products. So notwithstanding all the headwinds we faced in our business, we believe that once again, we demonstrated that our large diversified portfolio of fee-based assets can produce stable results even in extremely tumultuous market conditions. 
All right. Now let's talk about counterparty credit risks just briefly. We're going to talk more about this in the conference next week. We continue to monitor closely our counterparty credit risk as we always have. Fortunately, we're a large and very diverse company with operations across a number of sectors and across the spectrum within those sectors. We have a large customer base with only about 20 customers accounting for more than 1% of our annual revenues and the great majority of our customers remain solidly investment grade. The largest of those 20 customers is about 5% of our revenue and that customer is rated AA-. 
We estimate that our top 25 customer constitute about 44% of our revenue and just over 80% of the revenue from that top 25 is coming from investment-grade-rated entities. We'll provide you with some more detail and more refined analysis on our customer base next week -- at next week's conference, but those are some high-level indication. And just once again, 20 customers, only 20 customers account for more than 1%. The largest of those is just under 5% and is rated AA-. Our top 25 constitute 44% of the revenue and 80% of that is from investment-grade sources. 
Thirdly, we also worked hard this last quarter on securing our investment-grade debt metrics for 2016 and beyond, and ensuring that we can continue to invest in high-quality opportunities that allow us to grow value per share. We high graded our backlog to focus on the highest return opportunities. We're aiming to reduce spend, improve returns and selectively joint venture projects where appropriate. We reduced our 2016 spend that we initially announced to you by an additional $900 million. That's off the $4.2 billion we said in December. And we've reduced our backlog by $3.1 billion from the third quarter of 2015, and that's were just under $1 billion of the projects placed in service during the quarter. That action, along with retaining the cash above our $0.50 annual dividend obviates the needs for us to access the capital markets, shores up our investment-grade debt metrics and both of those things add stability to our outlook in difficult times while enable us to continue to grow our value over time. 
Now just a few segment highlights and Kim will cover all the financial details here. Again, just some operational things, natural gas, as I said, volumes were up 5% compared to the fourth quarter. That's higher volume on a Texas Intrastate because of exports to Mexico, higher throughput on EPNG, also Mexico and power generation load. 
And looking at those 2 sectors of demand for just a minute, so our power demand on our systems was up 10% on a full year basis year-over-year -- I'm sorry, 10% for the fourth quarter and 16% for a full year basis compared to 2014. And throughput to Mexico was up 22% on a year-over-year full year basis across our systems and is now about 2.4 -- 2.3 to 2.4 Bcf a day on average. Also worth reminding you, over the last 2 years, the gas group has entered into new and pending firm transport capacity commitments totaling 8.5 Bcf a day and about 1.6 Bcf of that was previously unsold capacity. We now estimate that of the natural gas consumed in the United States, about 38% moves in our pipes. Now some of that is moving on other pipes, too, gathered into ours or delivered off of ours, but 38% of the gas consumed is moving at some point on KMI pipelines. And we believe that the combination of power demand, LNG exports, exports to Mexico and additional pet chem and industrial demand on the Gulf Coast create a bright outlook for our gas transportation and storage assets. 
Products Pipelines, as I mentioned, refined products up 3% compared to 2014, and this demonstrates the upside of lower commodity prices in at least some parts of our business. And as I said earlier, total volumes were up 15% with the effects of the acquisitions and expansions in our liquids business. 
CO2, SACROC generated record annual gross oil production during the full year, up 2% compared to 2014. It was down 11% quarter-to-quarter in the fourth quarter versus a record Q4 of 2014. Combined oil production across all of our fields is up 2% compared to 2014. Net NGL sales volumes were up 3% compared to 2014. And we kept a close eye on costs and produced cost savings in OpEx and sustaining capital of roughly 25% off of our 2015 budget. 
The Terminals business was up 8% year-over-year on segment earnings before DD&A. This continues to be the tale of 2 businesses with the strong performance, very strong performance in our liquids business, which is now roughly 3/4 of this segment offset by continuing -- continued weakness in our bulk terminals, driven again by weakness in coal and steel volumes and compounded, of course, with the bankruptcy of our 2 coal customers. The strength of our liquids performance is driven by several organic growth projects, our Jones Act vessel additions, the Vopak terminals acquisition and the Houston Ship Channel. And we continue to have a very strong outlook for the demand for our capacity in the significant positions that we have built and refined products in the Houston Ship Channel and in oil in Edmonton. 
Finally, an update on Kinder Morgan Canada and Trans Mountain in particular. This expansion, as I will remind you, is under long-term contracts with customers who want to see that project built. Now the 3 key areas of focus for us now are the NEB recommended order, consultation and the combination with the First Nations and the satisfaction of the B.C. government's 5 conditions. We're making progress in all 3, though not as quickly as we like. 
With respect to the NEB, we received our draft conditions in August. We think they're manageable. So we did see important [ph] changes, especially around the time required to approve specific portions of the project. We're waiting to see a further process will be required by the new federal government and remain hopeful that all the work that we've done today, both inside and outside the NEB process to address stakeholder concerns, will be taken into account. We're currently scheduled to receive the NEB recommended order in May and the order in council process to follow. We continue to make good progress in meeting the consultation and the combination obligations we have with First Nations. We've added several mutual benefit agreements, which bring actual support for the project from a majority of the bands that are most directly affected by the project. On the B.C. 5 conditions, the B.C. government has made clear that we are not there yet, but have clearly left the door open to closing the gap, which we are working to do. We have this project in the backlog, and we're aiming for a third quarter of 2019 completion. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Kim."

Let me start with comparing against what we said last quarter, which was that we expect to end the year with approximately $300 million in coverage and debt-to-EBITDA of 5.6x. Now we ended the year with almost $1.2 billion in coverage",1796,"Okay. Thanks, Steve. Let me start with comparing against what we said last quarter, which was that we expect to end the year with approximately $300 million in coverage and debt-to-EBITDA of 5.6x. Now we ended the year with almost $1.2 billion in coverage, as I will take you through in a moment, that's not an apples-to-apples comparison due to the change in our dividend policy. If you adjust the fourth quarter dividend to the $0.52 per share that we expected to pay prior to the decision to reduce the dividend, we would have ended the year with approximately $297 million in coverage. And that includes absorbing over a $40 million reduction in our fourth quarter results that we did not anticipate as of the end of the third quarter to account for the Arch bankruptcy. On the debt-to-EBITDA side, we ended the year at 5.6 as expected, and I'll take you through the details of the balance sheet in a moment. 
On the face of the GAAP income statement, you will see that revenue is down, both for the quarter and the full year, compared to the corresponding period in 2014. This quarter, we've added a line to break out cost of goods sold, which you can see is down more than the decrease in revenues. 
As I've said, the last 3 quarters change in revenue is not a good predictor of our performance, as we have some businesses where revenues and expense fluctuate with commodity prices that the margin generally does not. We believe that the best indicator of our performance is the cash we generate or DCF per share. However, for those of you who need adjusted EPS for your models, adjusted EPS without certain items is about $0.21 in the quarter, which is slightly above consensus. 
DCF, on the second page of the numbers on the press release, we calculate free distributable cash flow. We generated DCF for the quarter of $1.233 billion and $4.699 billion for the year. For the quarter, DCF is down approximately $45 million versus the fourth quarter of 2014. For the full year, DCF is up $2.1 billion. The increase in the full year is largely the result of the acquisition by KMI, of KMP and EPB that was completed in the fourth quarter of 2014. And so a lot of the benefits to DCF is due to the fact that the MLPs are no longer outstanding, and you can see that benefit in the line of our DCF calculation entitled MLP declared distributions. 
For the quarter, the 4% reduction is primarily the result of our CO2 segment, which was down about $77 million. Our Terminal segment, down about $20 million, primarily as a result of the Arch bankruptcy, and increased interest expense and preferred interest payments. Although we're not happy to be down 4% in light of the overall circumstances and the energy and capital markets, as Rich and Steve have both said, we believe this performance is very strong and demonstrates the stability of our assets. 
For the full year, DCF per share is probably the best way to look at our results because it takes into account the benefit the DCF of the merger transaction as well as the cost of the approximately 1.1 billion shares that we issued to purchase the MLPs. For the full year, DCF per share is $2.14 or an increase of approximately 7% over the $2 per share in 2014. For the quarter, DCF per share is down approximately 8% for the reasons I mentioned a moment ago with respect to DCF plus incremental shares issued to finance our project and to reduce leverage. The $0.55 in DCF per share for the quarter and the $2.14 per share for the year results in coverage for the quarter of about $950 million and year-to-date coverage of $1.18 billion. As I said a few minutes ago, if we have paid a dividend of $0.52 in the fourth quarter, coverage would have been around $300 million just under versus our budget of $654 million. So let me give you the major components of the $350 million change versus our budget. 
If you utilize the commodity sensitivity metric that we gave you last January of $10 million change in DCF for every $1 change in crude and $3 million change in DCF for every $0.10 change in natural gas, the impact of our full year results is approximately $246 million. We have additional commodity price impact of a little bit over $20 million, most of which is due to deterioration in the crude-to-NGL ratio, meaning the NGL prices deteriorated more than crude prices, and we budgeted for our constant ratio. 
Indirectly, commodity prices have impacted us by another $117 million due to 3 primary things: lower CO2 sales volumes, lower gathering and processing volumes in our Midstream natural gas segments and a weaker Canadian dollar, so the FX impact, impacting our Terminal segment and our Kinder Morgan Canada segment. Coal bankruptcies impacted us by over $65 million, which was Arch and Alpha. So if you take those items that I just went through, that accounts for about four -- over $450 million, so well more than the total variance of about $350 million. There are lots of other moving pieces, both positive and negative, but the primary offsets to the $450 million were lower interest expense and CO2 and other cost savings. 
Now let me give you a little more granularity on where we ended up in the segments versus our budget. Natural gas pipelines ended up about 1% above its budget as the positive impact of the Hiland transaction better performance on the Texas Intrastates, SNG and TGP were largely offset by the impact in our Midstream group of lower commodity prices and lower gathering and processing volumes. CO2 ended the year approximately 15% below its budget as we projected last quarter. This, as we have discussed, is more than our commodity price sensitivity would indicate, and it's driven by lower crude oil volumes, lower CO2 volumes and lower capitalized overhead as reduced -- as a result of reduced expansion spending, offset by over $40 million in cost savings. 
Terminals ended the year approximately 10% below its budget versus the 6% we discussed last quarter with the primary variance being the Arch -- the impact of the Arch bankruptcy. The Terminal segment was negatively impacted in its budget by lower coal and steel volumes, again, the largest piece being the Alpha and Arch bankruptcies and also the FX impact of the weaker Canadian dollar. Products ended the year approximately 2% below its budget. The positive impact of the Double H Pipeline, which was acquired in the Hiland acquisition, is slightly more than offset by approximately $24 million of commodity price segregation consistent with the sensitivity, lower volumes on our KMCC pipe than we budgeted and lower margins in our transmix business. Finally, as we discussed last quarter, KMC was below its budget for the year by approximately $20 million due to FX 
On the expense side, interest, cash taxes and sustaining CapEx all came in lower than expected, therefore, positive variance versus our budget, and that was somewhat offset by higher G&A. The negative variance in G&A is driven by the Hiland acquisition and lower capitalized overhead as a result of lower expansion capital spending. 
On interest, the incremental interest is associated with financing the Hiland transaction was more than offset by lower balance than our budget and lower rates when you take out the impact of the Hiland transaction. Finally, we expect cash taxes and sustaining CapEx, they came in lower than our budget or they were -- said another way, they were favorable variance. 
There are a couple of certain items in the quarter that I actually want to highlight for you. One, we reported an estimated $1.15 billion noncash goodwill impairment on our Midstream natural gas assets. We also recorded approximately $284 million in impairment on other assets, primarily in our CO2 segment. These impairments were driven by lower commodity -- by the lower commodity price environment and also by lower stock prices. 
Let me give you this warning. If commodity and equity prices continue to fall, then there is --  then we may have impairments in future quarters. We also recorded as a certain item in this quarter a $200 million benefit associated with the contract buyout payment that we received on Kinder Morgan Louisiana pipeline. And with that, I'll turn to the balance sheet. 
On the balance sheet, we ended the fourth quarter with debt -- net debt of $41.2 billion based on $7.37 billion of EBITDA that gives us a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 5.6x, again, consistent with where we thought we would end. The $41.2 billion is an increase in debt of $610 million for the full year, and it's a decrease in debt of $1.235 billion for the quarter. 
So let me reconcile first the quarter. $1.235 billion decrease in debt. We spent about a little under $940 million on acquisitions, expansion CapEx and contributions to equity investments. We issued equity of about $1.58 billion. The contract buyout that we received on KMLA was $200 million and we received an income tax refund of a little over $150 million. And then working capital and other items were a source of cash of about over $240 million. 
Now let me say that here you would expect, I talked about coverage in the quarter being $950 million. But that coverage is based on the $0.125 dividend, the 953. What we actually paid in the fourth quarter was the dividend that we declared in the third quarter. So the $0.51. And so when I'm reconciling the debt, the $0.51 dividend is what was paid in the quarter and the cash that went out the door. So you do not see the benefit in the fourth quarter yet of the reduced dividend. You will see that going forward beginning in the first quarter. 
For the year, debt -- the change in debt was an increase of $610 million. We spent about $6.9 billion in cash on acquisitions, expansion CapEx and contributions to equity investment. Hiland was $3.06 billion and then we spent about $3.4 billion in expansion CapEx. Those are the major components of the $6.9 billion. We made pension contribution of $50 million. We issued equity, including the preferred $5.4 billion. The contract buyout on KMLA was 200. We received $347 million in income tax refund. And then we had about $400 million of coverage and other working capital items. That was, of course, of the cash. And that gets you to the $610 million increase in debt. 
And so with that, I'll turn it back to Rich."

And I would tell you exactly what that is, but I think a reasonable benchmark is think of mid-teens returns after-tax, okay? And what we're trying to do is really make sure that we're investing capital on the highest-return opportunities that we have, make sure that we're fulfilling our commitments and delaying spend where it can be delayed or deferred and taking on partners where it makes sense for us to take on partners. And I think what we've been able to do successfully over the years is originate really good returning midstream energy projects. And so because we're able to do that even though we're viewing our capital is quite finite, there are people out there who are happy to participate with us as partners, and we're exploring those opportunities where those makes sense. So we think our returns are adequate on separable projects that could be joint ventured. They're quite good, and we think people will be interested in joining us in those projects. We would continue to build it, own it, operate it, et cetera, but it gives us an opportunity to free up capital, to deploy in higher-return opportunities or to use with the balance sheet or to ultimately, in the longer term, return cash or increased dividends, just depending on what the circumstances -- what appears to be most rewarded at the time. So it's really doing economically rational things like deferring spend where you can. We fleshed out some scope changes, cost savings, other things that are real improvements to the economics, finding joint venture partners where those things make sense and channeling the capital that we have to the highest returns that are in the backlog right now and potentially to some new projects. So again, our capital is constraint for that."

Well, I'm good at pontification as long as I follow Mark Twain's old saying making predictions is difficult, particularly when they concern the future. But I think looking at where we are today, I mean, I'm obviously very disappointed, as you would expect, where the KMI stock price is and the way the market has treated us, post the dividend. We thought we took a great deal of uncertainty out of the equation. And as I said, the key fundamental thing is the amount of distributable cash flow we produced. And of course, valuation 101 would say that regardless of what you do with your free cash flow, your distributable cash flow, whether you dividend it out, put it in new projects, as long as those are good new projects and ours are, or buy back stock or pay down debt, really should make no difference from a valuation standpoint. But clearly, parts of the market are not on that same page. I believe that long term, the fact that we have no need to access equity markets, not just for '16 but for the foreseeable future, and that we will self-fund our capital expenditures, our growth capital, should, in the long run, I think be a very solid underpinning to this company, and we're going to be able to return a lot more money to our shareholders in the long term as well as delever the balance sheet. I think as far as the overall market is concerned, I said in the opening remarks, it seems like a chicken-little-disguise-falling [ph] market where there seems to be no discrimination among based on quality or based on virtually anything. It's just if oil prices go down, sell everything in the energy sector, I think that's a very wrong headed short-term view, but the market is what the market is and obviously, we believe we're tremendously under priced. If you look here's a company that can have close to $5 billion of free cash flow in the total market cap, but this level is $27 billion, $28 billion. I'm afraid even if you computed it, it upsets me so much. But that's my feeling on it, probably more than you wanted to hear, but as a larger shareholder, I can tell you, it's a very frustrating."

And so what we're spending money on, when we put incremental capital into CO2. What we're looking at is getting a very good return, an upper teens or plus -- 20-plus percent after-tax unlevered return incrementally, meaning for the oil that particular program or that particular development is going to produce at the current forward curve. And then we also look at, when we're doing the evaluation, we look what an NPV 15 breakeven price is for crude so that we can kind of see how much, if you will, headroom or how much room we have to have that be a successful program if we proceed with it. So we've been, as prices have been coming down, we have been bringing the CapEx down and we've been eliminating programs. It still makes sense to invest in some programs, but you're going to see a lower CapEx number for CO2 for 2016 than probably we've ever had, but still some pretty decent production with that plan. So we keep bringing it down and we look at the price, those 2 ways. And the third thing I would say about the way we evaluate it is that these are program spends, right? So what you're doing is you say, okay, we're going to do this many infills in SACROC, okay? So we're going to go out and do infills. The infills produce oil that tends to be front-end loaded. But if they're not performing the way we think they should or the price isn't where we think it needs to be. And I'm just picking out infills as probably a pretty high return, high-end project for us, but just to use it as an example. We have the flexibility to scale that program back and not deploy that capital. So we have high graded the CO2 capital, kept up-to-date with what commodity prices are. Although as you know and as you can see from today, that's a day-to-day exercise, but we also have flexibility in the spend when we do deploy it."

The gathering and processing part of our business, that really has 2 parts to it. I mean, there is a piece of that business that is secured under transport agreements with minimum takes that look something like what you would see in a gathering agreement or a fee-based processing arrangement, which looks something like you would see in the rest of our business. The second part of that business is percentage of proceeds, kinds of business where we are more exposed to commodity price. We picked up some of that with Copano and some of that with the Hiland acquisitions as well. And so you have to kind of break it apart, and we're talking about seeing if we can break that out further, quantify that further so that people can see the 2 parts of that business. What we're trying to do on the percentage of proceeds part is to try to migrate that more to fee-based. So we're kind of in the start of that process right now, but we do have exposure there. So then that becomes commodity price assumption-driven -- what do you think commodity prices are going to be, what do you think processing spreads are going to be.

And in many cases, like where it's building out connections or adding some capability in a terminal or something like that, it's really not -- it's not separable and we can do it and we can get relatively quick and early returns and generally very good returns for it. And then there are projects maybe at the other end where they're quite attractive for a market return. They're probably less of a return than what we are looking for on an incremental investment basis and they are separable or identifiable separate from the rest of our network, and those would be obvious JV candidates for us. But look, what we're trying to mainly do here is we're trying to make sure that we first and foremost defend our debt-to-EBITDA metrics and maintain a secure investment-grade rating. And the CapEx that we spend in 2016 drives that. So we're going to be very mindful and we're going to treat it as finite and precious and we're going to allocate it to the highest available returns that we have. But there are going to be projects that we're going to have the opportunity to do, and we're going to continue to do those. And we're going to JV the ones that are, if you will, amenable to being JV-ed, where we continue to build a project, operate it and own a significant interest in it, where we may be bringing third-party capital in, in order to help cover some of that cost. So I mean broadly, that's how we're looking at these things going forward."

Obviously, in today's market, if something happened, we'd love to be buying stock at this kind of ridiculous level. But that may not be the case a year or 2 years from now. If the market is more rational, we might use that to increase the dividend. We're certainly going to be continuously mindful, as Steve said, of keeping our investment-grade rating and maintaining a real solid balance sheet. But just very simplistically, and we outlined this in the release today, even after we have done a revised budget, reducing measurably the commodity assumptions and raising the interest rates projection in accordance with the forward curve, we do all that and we still have $4.9 billion of DCF for the equity holders. You deduct the roughly $150 million in preferred dividends. We will see about $4.7 million available to the common. You pay $1.1 billion in the reduced dividends. That leaves you $3.6 billion. And as we've said, we've reduced our capital expenditure program to a little less than $3.3 billion. Now there's a heck of a lot of other moving parts in that. But when you just look at very simplistically the ability to fund the capital project program, we can do that. Now to the extent that, that $3.3 billion is something less than that, that would free up more money to either further delever the balance sheet or return to shareholders through 1 of the 2 methods that we've talked about. So I think the real message here, guys, is we are self-funding now, okay? And I've got to tell you that to me, that's a big relief. Nobody is affected anymore than I was by the dividend cut, okay? But the point is we are building a very solid, stable balance sheet with the ability to return an awful lot of cash to our shareholders over the next few years."

And the stock seems to be, as you've indicated, ridiculously cheap, but it's a dividend orientation, return of capital dividend orientation. So the question is, with all these moving parts that you've described and you went through a description before about the balancing act between the capital spending and the growth. And I'm just doing a little back-of-the-envelope arithmetic here. If you'd kept to the 10% dividend increase that you'd promised originally, if there had been no trouble in the credit markets the way there was, you would have had something like $3 dividend or $3.20 dividend 5 years down the road, which would have produced about an 8% yield on the $40 stock that you then had. Now you've got a stock roughly 25% of that 40. If you look out, I know you can't be too specific, but in terms of having a basis to buy the stock here. Obviously, the dividend in the future, 3 to 5 years down the road, is going to be the crucial determinant as the capital spending starts to fade away. So is there any kind of guidance that you can give numerically about that balancing act so that the person who says I'm going to buy a $12 stock today, obviously, if you stop all capital spending today, you'd have a 20% return with a $2 dividend if you restored it. So the balance between the capital spending and the growth that you're going to develop for that is crucial here to getting some handle on the ultimate investment return here. So it would be very powerful useful to have a little more definitive color on that balancing average in terms of the 5-year outlook. I mean, what can we as shareholders paying $12 today look for in terms of a dividend 5 years down the road as the capital spending may face down?"

But you will get a sense for how much distributable cash flow we think will be produced from that backlog. And then, people can make whatever assumptions they want to make about what happens with the base business and how -- where exactly we take the balance sheet and how we return capital at some point to people, whether that's share repurchase or dividends or otherwise. But I think there is very good financial theory that says whether a company pays a dividend or doesn't pay a dividend does not -- it does not impact the value of the firm.

Otherwise, you've got a $12 stock here, which is a disaster as we all agree. So the market isn't following your line of thinking. That's the problem. The market isn't looking at the valuation of the company the way you would like it to. It's because you converted from an MLP and there is a tremendous focus on dividend.

And what we're trying to just tell you is we've got a lot of cash flow. We're going to do that. We're going to use that in the way that makes the most sense for the company and its shareholders. And if that involves buying back shares or increasing the dividends to a level, that's what we're going to do. We're not going to waste the dollars. And the backup to that is, just what Steve talked about, is we're high grading. We reduced the backlog by $3.1 billion. To the extent we reduce it further or joint venture more of the backlog, that is going to free up more cash earlier. On the other hand, it is going to, in the long run, depreciate somewhat the amount of cash we have coming out of those additional investments as a result of the backlog. So this is what we're committed to. We showed you what we generated. We're going to generate -- we generated $2.14 last year. And that we think is going to continue to grow very nicely over the years."

It's just that the numbers have changed for all the reasons we know. But as far as the basic business is concerned, which is what I'm hanging my hat on because I haven't sold a share either, is whether to buy more shares based on the idea that, that original promise that you made is still pretty much intact. And the way that promise is going to come to fruition is in the year 2021, let's say, we won't have the CapEx and we'll be able to start distributing huge amounts of money to shareholders.

Before I turn the meeting over to Steve Kean and Kim Dang to review the fourth quarter of 2015 financial results and other important developments during this period, I'd like to talk a bit about the future of the company. We will be delving into the 2016 outlook in more detail at our upcoming investor meeting next week, but I believe it's important to focus on a few key points. 
KMI's underlying business remains strong even in this challenging environment. Our year-end results turned out very consistent with what we projected to you in our third quarter call, both from a DCF standpoint and a debt-to-EBITDA standpoint. This says to me that our fundamental businesses are doing well, notwithstanding the current weakness in our industry. Fundamentals don't seem to matter in this ""Chicken Little the sky is falling"" market, but they should to prudent long-term investors. 
We are a generator of a tremendous amount of free cash flow, about $5 billion per year, and that's after we pay all of our operating costs, our interest expense and our sustaining CapEx. Now there are several ways we can utilize that cash flow. We can delever the balance sheet, internally fund our growth capital needs and/or return cash to our shareholders through either increasing the dividend and/or buying back shares. We have significantly reduced our anticipated capital expansion expenditures for 2016. You will hear more details on that from Steve today and at our investor conference. And that's a trend you can expect to continue as we high grade our capital investments and selectively joint venture projects where appropriate. As we reduce those expenditures, we will obviously have more cash to continue to strengthen our balance sheet and return to our shareholders. Reducing the dividend was not an easy decision, but given the strength and sustainability of our business and the cash generated thereby, I believe, as the largest shareholder, you will see KMI emerge as a stronger company with a strengthened balance sheet, higher coverage on the dividends we pay, and with no need to access the equity markets for the foreseeable future. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Steve."

So I'm going to cover 3 topics before hitting on some -- a few segment highlights. First is the performance of our business in these challenging times. Second is our counterparty credit risk.

First is the performance of our business in these challenging times. Second is our counterparty credit risk. And third, our growth capital, and then I'll do some segment highlights. 
So looking at full year 2015 compared to 2014, here's the summary. On an earnings before DD&A basis, 3 of our 5 business segments grew year-over-year. Gas was up 1%, Terminals was up 8% and Products was up 27%. Kinder Morgan Canada would have been up year-over-year, but for the effect of a weakening Canadian dollar. And no surprise, CO2 was down 22% as a result of lower commodity prices. To put this performance in context, this performance was against the backdrop of a very negative environment for the entire energy sector. On a full year basis, 2014 -- or 2015 to 2014, oil prices were down 49%. Of course, they're down further still from there and gas was down 40%. Oil and gas commodity prices directly affect the portion of our EBITDA, which we quantify each year, but the larger driver of our business is the demand for what we actually sell, energy transportation and storage services. That's the primary business we're in. Let's look at those numbers. 
In the gas business, which provides more than 50% of our segment earnings before DD&A, our transport volumes were up 5% year-over-year and sales and gathering were up 4% each on a full year basis. Our products pipeline volumes were up 3% on refined products and up 15% on total liquids transported, and that concludes crude, condensate and NGLs, and those were driven by expansions and the Hiland acquisition. While most of what we handle in our liquids businesses is made up of refined products and other liquids, not crude. Crude is in the news. So let's look at our crude transportation asset. 
Our Trans Mountain system is prorated. That means there's not enough capacity to serve the available demand. KMCC, Kinder Morgan Crude and Condensate, our Eagle Ford Pipeline, its volumes have been growing through the year with our expansions. We have good contracts. We're in a resilient location in the Eagle Ford, and we have great downstream connectivity to end-use markets and storage and dock capacity. 
In this business, especially now, contracts matter, location matters and connectivity matters, and we have all of that with the KMCC system. July -- first half of the year, July year-to-date numbers were about 193,000 barrels a day transported. December was just under 240,000. It's a much smaller piece of the overall picture, but our Wink Pipeline, in West Texas is moving record volumes. So even our crude transport assets are doing pretty well under the circumstances. 
Finally, the liquids part of our Terminal segment, which is now 74% of the earnings before DD&A of that segment, so volumes increased 18.7% for the full year and 11.3% in the fourth quarter. Now granted for all of these businesses, our contracts in many cases call for us to get paid whether the capacity is used or not, which is a good thing, by the way. So volume is not always a perfect driver of margin, but it is a good indicator that notwithstanding drastically lower commodity prices, the demand for our specific midstream assets is really quite good. Commodity prices do directly affect us in the CO2 business and a subpart of our midstream business. We also suffered in our bulk Terminals business in coal and steel, and especially from the bankruptcy of 2 of our important coal customers. And those things absolutely pulled back our performance without a doubt, but it's important to remember, particularly in times like these, that our primary business is the transportation and storage of energy commodities for a fee and that the commodities that we handle the most are natural gas and refined products. So notwithstanding all the headwinds we faced in our business, we believe that once again, we demonstrated that our large diversified portfolio of fee-based assets can produce stable results even in extremely tumultuous market conditions. 
All right. Now let's talk about counterparty credit risks just briefly. We're going to talk more about this at the conference next week. We continue to monitor closely our counterparty credit risk, as we always have. Fortunately, we're a large and very diverse company with operations across a number of sectors and across the spectrum within those sectors. We have a large customer base with only about 20 customers accounting for more than 1% of our annual revenues, and the great majority of our customers remain solidly investment grade. The largest of those 20 customers is about 5% of our revenue, and that customer is rated AA-. 
We estimate that our top 25 customers constitute about 44% of our revenue and just over 80% of the revenue from that top 25 is coming from investment-grade-rated entities. We'll provide you with some more detail and more refined analysis on our customer base next week -- at next week's conference, but those are some high-level indication. And just once again, 20 customers, only 20 customers account for more than 1%. The largest of those is just under 5% and is rated AA-. Our top 25 constitute 44% of the revenue and 80% of that is from investment-grade sources. 
Thirdly, we also worked hard this last quarter on securing our investment-grade debt metrics for 2016 and beyond, and ensuring that we can continue to invest in high-quality opportunities that allow us to grow value per share. We high graded our backlog to focus on the highest return opportunities. We're aiming to reduce spend, improve returns and selectively joint venture projects where appropriate. We reduced our 2016 spend that we initially announced to you by an additional $900 million. That's off the $4.2 billion we said in December. And we've reduced our backlog by $3.1 billion from the third quarter of 2015, and that's with just under $1 billion worth of projects placed in service during the quarter. That action, along with retaining the cash above our $0.50 annual dividend obviates the needs for us to access the capital markets, shores up our investment-grade debt metrics and both of those things add stability to our outlook in difficult times while enable us to continue to grow our value over time. 
Now just a few segment highlights, and Kim will cover all the financial details here. Again, just some operational things, natural gas, as I said, volumes were up 5% compared to the fourth quarter. That's higher volumes on a Texas Intrastate because of exports to Mexico, higher throughput on EPNG, also Mexico and power generation load. 
And looking at those 2 sectors of demand for just a minute, so our power demand on our systems was up 10% on a full year basis year-over-year -- I'm sorry, 10% for the fourth quarter and 16% for a full year basis compared to 2014. And throughput to Mexico was up 22% on a year-over-year full year basis across our systems and is now about 2.4 -- 2.3 to 2.4 Bcf a day on average. Also worth reminding you, over the last 2 years, the gas group has entered into new and pending firm transport capacity commitments totaling 8.5 Bcf a day and about 1.6 Bcf of that was previously unsold capacity. We now estimate that of the natural gas consumed in the United States, about 38% moves in our pipes. Now some of that is moving on other pipes, too, gathered into ours or delivered off of ours, but 38% of the gas consumed is moving at some point on KMI pipelines. And we believe that the combination of power demand, LNG exports, exports to Mexico and additional pet chem and industrial demand on the Gulf Coast create a bright outlook for our gas transportation and storage assets. 
Products Pipelines, as I mentioned, refined products up 3% compared to 2014, and this demonstrates the upside of lower commodity prices in at least some parts of our business. And as I said earlier, total volumes were up 15% with the effects of the acquisitions and expansions in our liquids business. 
CO2, SACROC generated record annual gross oil production during the full year, up 2% compared to 2014. It was down 11% quarter-to-quarter in the fourth quarter versus a record Q4 of 2014. Combined oil production across all of our fields is up 2% compared to 2014. Net NGL sales volumes were up 3% compared to 2014. And we kept a close eye on costs and produced cost savings in OpEx and sustaining capital of roughly 25% off of our 2015 budget. 
The Terminals business was up 8% year-over-year on segment earnings before DD&A. This continues to be the tale of 2 businesses with the strong performance, very strong performance in our liquids business, which is now roughly 3/4 of this segment offset by continuing -- continued weakness in our bulk terminals, driven again by weakness in coal and steel volumes and compounded, of course, with the bankruptcy of our 2 coal customers. The strength of our liquids performance is driven by several organic growth projects, our Jones Act vessel additions, the Vopak terminals acquisition and the Houston Ship Channel. And we continue to have a very strong outlook for the demand for our capacity in the significant positions that we have built and refined products in the Houston Ship Channel and in oil in Edmonton. 
Finally, an update on Kinder Morgan Canada and Trans Mountain in particular. This expansion, as I will remind you, is under long-term contracts with customers who want to see the project built. Now the 3 key areas of focus for us now are the NEB recommended order, consultation and the combination with the First Nations and the satisfaction of the B.C. government's 5 conditions. We're making progress in all 3, though not as quickly as we like. 
With respect to the NEB, we received our draft conditions in August. We think they're manageable. Though we did see important [ph] changes, especially around the time required to approve specific portions of the project. We're waiting to see if further process will be required by the new federal government and remain hopeful that all the work that we've done to date, both inside and outside the NEB process to address stakeholder concerns, will be taken into account. We're currently scheduled to receive the NEB recommended order in May and the order in council process to follow. We continue to make good progress in meeting the consultation and the combination obligations we have with First Nations. We've added several mutual benefit agreements, which bring actual support for the project from a majority of the bands that are most directly affected by the project. On the B.C. 5 conditions, the B.C. government has made clear that we are not there yet, but have clearly left the door open to closing the gap, which we are working to do. We have this project in the backlog, and we're aiming for a third quarter of 2019 completion. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Kim."

Now we ended the year with almost $1.2 billion in covera",1800,"Okay. Thanks, Steve. Let me start with comparing against what we said last quarter, which was that we expected to end the year with approximately $300 million in coverage and debt-to-EBITDA of 5.6x. Now we ended the year with almost $1.2 billion in coverage, as I will take you through in a moment, that's not an apples-to-apples comparison due to the change in our dividend policy. If you adjust the fourth quarter dividend to the $0.52 per share that we expected to pay prior to the decision to reduce the dividend, we would have ended the year with approximately $297 million in coverage. And that includes absorbing over a $40 million reduction in our fourth quarter results that we did not anticipate as of the end of the third quarter to account for the Arch bankruptcy. On the debt-to-EBITDA side, we ended the year at 5.6 as expected, and I'll take you through the details of the balance sheet in a moment. 
On the face of the GAAP income statement, you will see that revenue is down, both for the quarter and the full year, compared to the corresponding period in 2014. This quarter, we've added a line to break out cost of goods sold, which you can see is down more than the decrease in revenues. 
As I've said, the last 3 quarters change in revenue is not a good predictor of our performance, as we have some businesses where revenues and expense fluctuate with commodity prices, but the margin generally does not. We believe that the best indicator of our performance is the cash we generate or DCF per share. However, for those of you who need adjusted EPS for your models, adjusted EPS without certain items is about $0.21 in the quarter, which is slightly above consensus. 
DCF, on the second page of the numbers on the press release, we calculate free distributable cash flow. We generated DCF for the quarter of $1.233 billion and $4.699 billion for the year. For the quarter, DCF is down approximately $45 million versus the fourth quarter of 2014. For the full year, DCF is up $2.1 billion. The increase in the full year is largely the result of the acquisition by KMI, of KMP and EPB that was completed in the fourth quarter of 2014. And so a lot of the benefits to DCF is due to the fact that the MLPs are no longer outstanding, and you can see that benefit in the line of our DCF calculation entitled MLP declared distributions. 
For the quarter, the 4% reduction is primarily the result of our CO2 segment, which was down about $77 million. Our Terminal segment, down about $20 million, primarily as a result of the Arch bankruptcy, and increased interest expense and preferred interest payments. Although we're not happy to be down 4% in light of the overall circumstances and the energy and capital markets, as Rich and Steve have both said, we believe this performance is very strong and demonstrates the stability of our assets. 
For the full year, DCF per share is probably the best way to look at our results because it takes into account the benefit the DCF of the merger transaction as well as the cost of the approximately 1.1 billion shares that we issued to purchase the MLPs. For the full year, DCF per share is $2.14 or an increase of approximately 7% over the $2 per share in 2014. For the quarter, DCF per share is down approximately 8% for the reasons I mentioned a moment ago with respect to DCF, plus incremental shares issued to finance our projects and to reduce leverage. The $0.55 in DCF per share for the quarter and the $2.14 per share for the year results in coverage for the quarter of about $950 million and year-to-date coverage of $1.18 billion. As I said a few minutes ago, if we have paid a dividend of $0.52 in the fourth quarter, coverage would have been around $300 million just under versus our budget of $654 million. So let me give you the major components of the $350 million change versus our budget. 
If you utilize the commodity sensitivity metric that we gave you last January of $10 million change in DCF for every $1 change in crude and $3 million change in DCF for every $0.10 change in natural gas, the impact to our full year results is approximately $246 million. We have additional commodity price impact of a little bit over $20 million, most of which is due to deterioration in the crude-to-NGL ratio, meaning the NGL prices deteriorated more than crude prices, and we budgeted for a constant ratio. 
Indirectly, commodity prices have impacted us by another $117 million due to 3 primary things: lower CO2 sales volumes, lower gathering and processing volumes in our Midstream natural gas segments and a weaker Canadian dollar, so the FX impact, impacting our Terminal segment and our Kinder Morgan Canada segment. Coal bankruptcies impacted us by over $65 million, which was Arch and Alpha. So if you take those items that I just went through, that accounts for about four -- over $450 million, so well more than the total variance of about $350 million. There are lots of other moving pieces, both positive and negative, but the primary offsets to the $450 million were lower interest expense and CO2 and other cost savings. 
Now let me give you a little more granularity on where we ended up in the segments versus our budget. Natural gas pipelines ended up about 1% above its budget, as the positive impacts of the Hiland transaction, better performance on the Texas Intrastates, SNG and TGP were largely offset by the impact in our Midstream group of lower commodity prices and lower gathering and processing volumes. CO2 ended the year approximately 15% below its budget as we projected last quarter. This, as we have discussed, is more than our commodity price sensitivity would indicate, and it's driven by lower crude oil volumes, lower CO2 volumes and lower capitalized overhead as reduced -- as a result of reduced expansion spending, offset by over $40 million in cost savings. 
Terminals ended the year approximately 10% below its budget versus the 6% we discussed last quarter with the primary variance being the Arch -- the impact of the Arch bankruptcy. The Terminals segment was negatively impacted in its budget by lower coal and steel volumes, again, the largest piece being the Alpha and Arch bankruptcies and also the FX impact of the weaker Canadian dollar. Products ended the year approximately 2% below its budget. The positive impact of the Double H Pipeline, which was acquired in the Hiland acquisition, is slightly more than offset by approximately $24 million of commodity price segregation consistent with the sensitivity, lower volumes on our KMCC pipe than we budgeted and lower margins in our transmix business. Finally, as we discussed last quarter, KMC was below its budget for the year by approximately $20 million due to FX 
On the expense side, interest, cash taxes and sustaining CapEx all came in lower than expected, therefore, positive variance versus our budget, and that was somewhat offset by higher G&A. The negative variance in G&A is driven by the Hiland acquisition and lower capitalized overhead as a result of lower expansion capital spending. 
On interest, the incremental interest is associated with financing the Hiland transaction was more than offset by lower balance than our budget and lower rates when you take out the impact of the Hiland transaction. Finally, we expect cash taxes and sustaining CapEx, they came in lower than our budget or they were -- said another way, they were a favorable variance. 
There are a couple of certain items in the quarter that I actually want to highlight for you. One, we reported an estimated $1.15 billion noncash goodwill impairment on our Midstream natural gas assets. We also recorded approximately $284 million in impairment on other assets, primarily in our CO2 segment. These impairments were driven by lower commodity -- by the lower commodity price environment and also by lower stock prices. 
Let me give you this warning. If commodity and equity prices continue to fall, then there is --  then we may have impairments in future quarters. We also recorded as a certain item in this quarter a $200 million benefit associated with the contract buyout payment that we received on Kinder Morgan Louisiana pipeline. And with that, I'll turn to the balance sheet. 
On the balance sheet, we ended the fourth quarter with debt -- net debt of $41.2 billion. Based on $7.37 billion of EBITDA that gives us a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 5.6x, again, consistent with where we thought we would end. The $41.2 billion is an increase in debt of $610 million for the full year, and it's a decrease in debt of $1.235 billion for the quarter. 
So let me reconcile first the quarter. $1.235 billion decrease in debt. We spent about a little under $940 million on acquisitions, expansion CapEx and contributions to equity investments. We issued equity of about $1.58 billion. The contract buyout that we received on KMLA was $200 million, and we received an income tax refund of a little over $150 million. And then working capital and other items were a source of cash of about over $240 million. 
Now let me say that here you would expect, I talked about coverage in the quarter being $950 million. But that coverage is based on the $0.125 dividend, the 953. What we actually paid in the fourth quarter was the dividend that we declared in the third quarter. So the $0.51. And so when I'm reconciling the debt, the $0.51 dividend is what was paid in the quarter and the cash that went out the door. So you do not see the benefit in the fourth quarter yet of the reduced dividend. You will see that going forward beginning in the first quarter. 
For the year, debt -- the change in debt was an increase of $610 million. We spent about $6.9 billion in cash on acquisitions, expansion CapEx and contributions to equity investment. Hiland was $3.06 billion, and then we spent about $3.4 billion in expansion CapEx. Those are the major components of the $6.9 billion. We made a pension contribution of $50 million. We issued equity, including the preferred of $5.4 billion. The contract buyout on KMLA was $200 million. We received $347 million in income tax refunds. And then we had about $400 million of coverage and other working capital items. That was, of course, of the cash. And that gets you to the $610 million increase in debt. 
And so with that, I'll turn it back to Rich."

And I would tell you exactly what that is, but I think a reasonable benchmark is think of mid-teens returns after-tax, okay? And what we're trying to do is really make sure that we're investing capital on the highest-return opportunities that we have, make sure that we're fulfilling our commitments and delaying spend where it can be delayed or deferred and taking on partners where it makes sense for us to take on partners. And I think what we've been able to do successfully over the years is originate really good returning midstream energy projects. And so because we're able to do that even though we're viewing our capital as quite finite, there are people out there who are happy to participate with us as partners, and we're exploring those opportunities where those makes sense. So we think our returns are adequate on separable projects that could be joint ventured. They're quite good, and we think people will be interested in joining us on those projects. We would continue to build it, own it, operate it, et cetera, but it gives us an opportunity to free up capital, to deploy in higher-return opportunities or to use with the balance sheet or to ultimately, in the longer term, return cash or increase dividends, just depending on what the circumstances -- what appears to be most rewarded at the time. So it's really doing economically rational things like deferring spend where you can. We fleshed out some scope changes, cost savings, other things that are real improvements to the economics, finding joint venture partners where those things make sense and channeling the capital that we have to the highest returns that are in the backlog right now and potentially to some new projects. So again, our capital is constrained for that."

Well, I'm good at pontification as long as I follow Mark Twain's old saying that making predictions is difficult, particularly when they concern the future. But I think looking at where we are today, I mean, I'm obviously very disappointed, as you would expect, at where the KMI stock price is and the way the market has treated us, post the dividend. We thought we took a great deal of uncertainty out of the equation. And as I said, the key fundamental thing is the amount of distributable cash flow we produce. And of course, valuation 101 would say that regardless of what you do with your free cash flow, your distributable cash flow, whether you dividend it out, put it in new projects, as long as those are good new projects and ours are, or buy back stock or pay down debt, really should make no difference from a valuation standpoint. But clearly, parts of the market are not on that same page. I believe that long term, the fact that we have no need to access the equity markets, not just for '16 but for the foreseeable future, and that we will self-fund our capital expenditures, our growth capital, should, in the long run, I think be a very solid underpinning to this company, and we're going to be able to return a lot more money to our shareholders in the long term as well as delever the balance sheet. I think as far as the overall market is concerned, I said in the opening remarks, it seems like a ""Chicken Little the sky is falling""  market where there seems to be no discrimination among based on quality or based on virtually anything. It's just if oil prices go down, sell everything in the energy sector. And I think that's a very wrong headed short-term view, but the market is what the market is and obviously, we believe we're tremendously underpriced. If you look here's a company that can have close to $5 billion of free cash flow in the total market cap, but this level is $27 billion, $28 billion. I'm afraid even if you computed it, it upsets me so much. But that's my feeling on it, probably more than you wanted to hear, but as the largest shareholder, I can tell you, it's very frustrating."

And so what we're spending money on, when we put incremental capital into CO2. What we're looking at is getting a very good return, an upper teens or plus -- 20-plus percent after-tax unlevered return incrementally, meaning for the oil that, that particular program or that particular development is going to produce at the current forward curve. And then we also look at, when we're doing the evaluation, we look what an NPV 15 breakeven price is for crude so that we can kind of see how much, if you will, headroom or how much room we have to have that be a successful program if we proceed with it. So we've been, as prices have been coming down, we've been bringing the CapEx down and we've been eliminating programs. It still makes sense to invest in some programs, but you're going to see a lower CapEx number for CO2 for 2016 than probably we've ever had, but still some pretty decent production with that plan. So we keep bringing it down and we look at the price, those 2 ways. And the third thing I would say about the way we evaluate it is that these are program spends, right? So what you're doing is you say, okay, we're going to do this many infills in SACROC, okay? So we're going to go out and do infills. The infills produce oil that tends to be front-end loaded. But if they're not performing the way we think they should or the price isn't where we think it needs to be. And I'm just picking out infills as probably a pretty high return, high-end project for us, but just to use it as an example. We have the flexibility to scale that program back and not deploy that capital. So we have high graded the CO2 capital, kept up-to-date with what commodity prices are. Although as you know and as you can see from today, that's a day-to-day exercise, but we also have flexibility in the spend when we do deploy it."

The gathering and processing part of our business, that really has 2 parts to it. I mean, there is a piece of that business that is secured under transport agreements with minimum takes that look something like what you would see in a gathering agreement or a fee-based processing arrangement, which looks something like you would see in the rest of our business. The second part of that business is percentage of proceeds, kinds of business where we are more exposed to commodity price. We picked up some of that with Copano and some of that with the Hiland acquisitions as well. And so you have to kind of break it apart, and we're talking about seeing if we can break that out further, quantify that further so that people can see the 2 parts of that business. What we're trying to do on the percentage of proceeds part is to try to migrate that more to fee-based. So we're kind of in the start of that process right now, but we do have exposure there. So then that becomes commodity price assumption-driven -- what do you think commodity prices are going to be, what do you think processing spreads are going to be.

And so we think we've calibrated that reasonably well, but there is certainly variability in part 2 of that business, as I've mentioned it. Tom, anything more?"

To the point of what was raised by Steve that you definitely kind of view a limited amount of potential spend to be had, and hence, looking for third-party capital or JV relationships. Is there particular absolute or proportion of DCF that on average in annual spend you kind of see as your sweet spot?"

If you look at some of the capital projects that we do that are, if you will, build-outs of our existing network, those things are very high returning projects and they're on our network. So it's not like we're going to look for a JV partner on them. And in many cases, like where it's building out connections or adding some capability in a terminal or something like that, it's really not -- it's not separable and we can do it and we can get relatively quick and early returns and generally very good returns for it. And then there are projects maybe at the other end where they're quite attractive for a market return. They're probably less of a return than what we are looking for on an incremental investment basis and they are separable or identifiable separate from the rest of our network, and those would be obvious JV candidates for us. But look, what we're trying to mainly do here is we're trying to make sure that we first and foremost defend our debt-to-EBITDA metrics and maintain a secure investment-grade rating. And the CapEx that we spend in 2016 drives that. So we're going to be very mindful and we're going to treat it as finite and precious and we're going to allocate it to the highest available returns that we have. But there are going to be projects that we're going to have the opportunity to do, and we're going to continue to do those. And we're going to JV the ones that are, if you will, amenable to being JV-ed, where we continue to build a project, operate it and own a significant interest in it, where we maybe bring third-party capital in, in order to help cover some of that cost. So I mean broadly, that's how we're looking at these things going forward."

Obviously, in today's market, if something happened, we'd love to be buying stock at this kind of ridiculous level. But that may not be the case a year or 2 years from now. If the market's more rational, we might use that to increase the dividend. We're certainly going to be continuously mindful, as Steve said, of keeping our investment-grade rating and maintaining a real solid balance sheet. But just very simplistically, and we outlined this in the release today, even after we have done a revised budget, reducing measurably the commodity assumptions and raising the interest rates' projection in accordance with the forward curve, we do all that and we still have $4.9 billion of DCF for the equity holders. You deduct the roughly $150 million in preferred dividends. We will see about $4.7 million available to the common. You pay $1.1 billion in the reduced dividends. That leaves you $3.6 billion. And as we've said, we've reduced our capital expenditure program to a little less than $3.3 billion. Now there's a heck of a lot of other moving parts in that. But when you just look at very simplistically the ability to fund the capital project program, we can do that. Now to the extent that, that $3.3 billion is something less than that, that would free up more money to either further delever the balance sheet or return to shareholders through 1 of the 2 methods that we've talked about. So I think the real message here, guys, is we are self-funding now, okay? And I've got to tell you that to me, that's a big relief. Nobody is affected any more than I was by the dividend cut, okay? But the point is we are building a very solid, stable balance sheet with the ability to return an awful lot of cash to our shareholders over the next few years."

And the stock seems to be, as you've indicated, ridiculously cheap, but it's a dividend orientation, return of capital dividend orientation. So the question is, with all these moving parts that you've described and you went through a description before about the balancing act between the capital spending and the growth. And I'm just doing a little back-of-the-envelope arithmetic here. If you'd kept to the 10% dividend increase that you'd promised originally, if there had been no trouble in the credit markets the way there was, you would have had something like $3 dividend or a $3.20 dividend 5 years down the road, which would have produced about an 8% yield on the $40 stock that you then had. Now you've got a stock roughly 25% of that $40. If you look out, I know you can't be too specific, but in terms of having a basis to buy the stock here. Obviously, the dividend in the future, 3 to 5 years down the road, is going to be the crucial determinant as the capital spending starts to fade away. So is there any kind of guidance that you can give numerically about that balancing act so that the person who says I'm going to buy a $12 stock today, obviously, if you stopped all capital spending today, you'd have a 20% return with a $2 dividend if you restored it? So the balance between the capital spending and the growth that you're going to develop for that is crucial here to getting some handle on the ultimate investment return here. So it would be very powerful, useful to have a little more definitive color on that balancing average in terms of the 5-year outlook. I mean, what can we as shareholders paying $12 today look for in terms of a dividend 5 years down the road as the capital spending may phase down?"

We're going to give you an approximate multiple that we expect to earn on that. And so you'd be -- that is just the backlog. It has nothing to do with our base business. But you will get a sense for how much distributable cash flow we think will be produced from that backlog. And then, people can make whatever assumptions they want to make about what happens with the base business and how -- where exactly we take the balance sheet and how we return capital at some point to people, whether that's share repurchase or dividends or otherwise. But as I think there is very good financial theory that says whether a company pays a dividend or doesn't pay a dividend does not -- it does not impact the value of the firm. So we can tell you how much cash that we're going to produce from these investments, and then I think from that, you can come up with what you think the value of the stock is worth."

Otherwise, you've got a $12 stock here, which is a disaster as we all agree. So the market isn't following your line of thinking. That's the problem. The market isn't looking at the valuation of the company the way you would like it to. It's because you converted from an MLP, and there is a tremendous focus on dividend. And now there's the fear that, that dividend isn't even secure, not so much for you guys, but for other people, because of the way -- of the problem with the debt and the problem with availability of financing given the challenges. So the question is that's the game here. It's a numbers game. And the question is how are those numbers going to play out? Do we have a $6.4 billion DCF in the future, which will be available for payment. That's the key, isn't it? Tell me if I'm wrong."

To the extent we reduce it further or joint venture more of the backlog, that is going to free up more cash earlier.

I'll start the call and before I turn it over to our CEO Steve Kean and our CFO Kim Dang, I'd like to give you a quick overview of our strategy at KMI. The first point I would make is that this quarter's results again demonstrate that we remain a strong generator of cash even in these chaotic times for the energy sector. Second, as we've said previously and at our meeting in January, we do not anticipate any requirement to access the equity markets for the foreseeable future. We also do not see any requirement to access the debt markets for the foreseeable future, except for rollovers in years subsequent to 2016. We've again reduced our expansion CapEx. Steve will take you through that for 2016 and we expect that trend to continue in subsequent years through both high grading our projects and entering into selective joint ventures. We expect to fund the necessary CapEx out of our cash flow and continue to improve our debt-to-EBITDA ratio thereby preserving and strengthening our investment-grade balance sheet. As our cash flow achieves those objectives funding our CapEx and strengthening our balance sheet, we will obviously, have excess cash, which we will then use to either raise our dividend, purchase our shares, offer new projects and/or acquisitions but only if they are solidly accretive to our distributable cash flow per share.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Steve."

I'm going to hit on 3 topics before giving you some segment highlights for the quarter. First, an update to our capital projects and our expected growth spend for 2016 and update on our outlook for the balance of 2016 and some thoughts",2509,"Okay. Thanks, Rich. I'm going to hit on 3 topics before giving you some segment highlights for the quarter. First, an update to our capital projects and our expected growth spend for 2016 and update on our outlook for the balance of 2016 and some thoughts on our counterparty credit risk.
With respect to the capital update, we announced today reduction in our project backlog of $4.1 billion. So from $18.2 billion down to $14.1 billion. The 2 biggest adjustments are the removal of Palmetto Pipeline project, which is a reduction of $550 million and the market portion of the NED project, which is a reduction of $3.1 billion. With respect to NED, we worked very hard, this is our Northeast Direct project serving -- that would have served New England markets. We worked very hard to get customer commitments on the project and while many of our LDC customers did sign-up, we did not receive enough contractual commitments from electric customers to make the project viable. So we will fulfill our obligation to consult with our customers over the next 30 days or so but this project is not economic so we're moving it from the backlog. In both cases NED and Palmetto, based on all the facts we believe, this is the right outcome for our investors. To be specific, the return on the NED Project, at the level of commitments that we have, would be less than 6% unlevered after-tax. That's clearly not viable and we are far better off having that cash available for other uses whether that's continued and even accelerated delevering, other investment opportunities or returning value to shareholders. We value our New England customers and continue to believe, along with many others, that additional capacity is needed in the region but we'll have to look for other ways to serve some part of those needs. We did get there on this one and the action we're taking is undeniably the right call for our investors. We previously wrote off, I'll remind you, our NED supply project and we never had that one in the backlog.
On the Palmetto Pipeline. Essentially, the Georgia legislature prevented us from getting imminent domain and also prevented us from getting other state permits. We were making good progress with land acquisition even without imminent domain but we needed other permits, which Georgia has now put a moratorium on. We needed environmental permits for example, which they've now put a moratorium on until mid-2017. So as a result, we are not moving forward with Palmetto. We have some other small adjustments to the backlog, including putting about $160 million for the projects in service during the quarter. We had some cost changes, which netted to a reduction of $254 million in the overall backlog and we have some other scope additions and removals, which essentially offset each other.
So looking at the bigger picture on our capital projects spend, we continue to high grade our capital investments to ensure that we're securing our investment-grade credit metrics and maximizing the returns we get for the capital that we do deploy. We're aiming to reduce spend, improve returns and selectively joint venture projects where that makes sense. We reduced our expected 2016 spend by an additional $400 million to $2.9 billion. So that compares to the $3.3 million that we projected in January for 2016, which in turn was $900 million down from the $4.2 billion that we projected in our preliminary 2016 guidance, which we sent out last December. So we continue to work through our backlog and high-grade where we're spending our capital.
With respect to joint ventures. As we discussed at the January conference, we'd be pursuing these where they made sense. That is, where we can share the capital spending obligation on a particular project with a third-party, get paid a reasonable value for having originated the opportunity, et cetera. Those processes are competitive and confidential so if we're only going to be able to give you limited details but the summary is that the process is going well and we currently expect to achieve results -- the results that we built in to our plan. We're also taking care to not be dependent on any 1 transaction. These processes can be unpredictable and we will be in a position to back away from a given transaction if acceptable value does not materialize.
Overall, as we complete projects and further high-grade the backlog, as Rich mentioned, we will free up cash that we can use to reduce debt, return cash to investors in the form of buybacks and dividends or invest in attractive projects or acquisition or some combination of those.
Now for the 2016 outlook update. We have looked at the potential impacts for the remainder of 2016 due to continued weakness in the sector. We now estimate on a full-year basis for 2016 a negative impact of about 3% to the EBITDA that we showed in January but because of our ongoing efforts to high grade our capital spend and to pursue the joint ventures where it makes sense, we expect to meet our investment-grade credit metrics notwithstanding the 3% reduction. That 3% EBITDA reduction translates into a 4% reduction in DCF. Yes, as the year goes on, we will try to mitigate that negative but we are not assuming in this outlook any dramatic turnaround for our producer customers by the end of the year as some analysts have predicted.
Now we're not happy about any negative to plan but I think when you put this in the context of a dramatic production declines particularly in the Eagle Ford, which is down 28% on oil from its peak and 15% on gas and credit weaknesses, our business is really diversified and insulated from the full brunt of the weakness in the producing sector.
So here are the 2 main contributors. A little under half of the deterioration is attributable to lower Eagle Ford volumes and those flow through both our Midstream group in the gas business unit and also in our products group. And again, what this is all comparing to our original outlook. So this is not a year-over-year look. This is a -- versus our January outlook that we presented at the conference. So a little under half attributable to the Eagle Ford, another 20% is attributable to the coal customer bankruptcies. So there is -- there are a lot of other pieces and Kim will take you through some additional details, but those are the 2 big chunks contributing to the degradation of the forecast.
So while the current year outlook for North American engine production is experiencing weakness, we're still bullish on the longer-term. We believe that we'll continue to see more of our North American energy needs, met by North American energy production that will grow our exports. We've already been growing refined products, natural gas to Mexico. I think we'll continue to see growth in natural gas and natural gas liquids exports. And those long-term trends are good for North American energy midstream companies like Kinder Morgan.
Okay, the third general topic is counterparty credit. We've been monitoring counterparty credit very closely, but beyond monitoring we've been taking action. We've been calling on collateral, putting other credits quarter arrangements in place. A few points about our particular circumstances. Given our diverse business mix, we've got a very broad and diverse customer base. We've got producer customers, of course, but we also have integrated energy companies, gas and electric utilities and industrial users of our services. We're not exposed to any single sector, commodity or service. That diversified our exposure, which reduces our risk. Our Top 25 customers constitute 44% of our revenue and of that revenue, 85% is investment-grade. Of our total revenue, about 75% is investment-grade or has substantial credit support and 86% is rated B or better. In our business, real exposure is more complicated than simply looking at our customers ratings. In many cases, the rights our customers hold are valuable to third parties or essential to the revenue-generating activities of those customers and therefore, will be needed on an ongoing basis by the customer or in the worst case, a debtor in possession of bankruptcy or a subsequent purchaser. We analyze all of those factors in mitigation to get to our credit concern list. Our identified credit concern list amounts to about 5% of revenue and about half of that is mitigated by credit support or underlying resale value of the capacity that the customers hold. And those numbers, that 5% and that half of 5% include Peabody, the Peabody bankruptcy which we're now reflecting. So the going forward number is less than that. We're reflecting Peabody -- the Peabody bankruptcy in our forecast update.
So the segments -- a few highlights looking at the first quarter of 2016 to Q1 of 2015. The overall summary is this: on an earnings before DD&A and certain items basis, 3 of our 5 units basis grew year-over-year; gas was up 4%; Products Pipelines was up 17%; Terminals was up 2%; Kinder Morgan Canada would have been up year-over-year but for the effect of the weakening Canadian dollar and CO2 was down 21% as a result of lower commodity prices and some lower production.
On Natural Gas Pipelines. We had very strong performance on TGP and the contributions from our Hiland Midstream acquisition. So we split the Hiland acquisition between our Midstream business units in gas and our Products Pipelines for the Double H pipeline. So contributions from really, really strong performance on TGP and the contribution from our Hiland midstream acquisition that we made in the first quarter of last year. Those 2 things more than offset weakness in our Midstream assets and in our Western pipelines. The Midstream weakness is largely gathering the processing in the Eagle Ford and on a year-over-year basis, gathering in the Haynesville.
In the West, year-over-year growth on our EPNG system was more than offset by weakness in Cheyenne Plains, WIC, CIG and Trans Colorado as the fundamentals for basis pipes out of the Rockies continues to degrade.
Natural gas needs for transportation and storage services we believe should grow over the medium and long-term as power generation exports, including LNG and exports to Mexico and pet-chem and industrial demand continue to grow. Over the last 2 years, the gas group has entered into new and firm -- new and pending firm transport capacity commitments totaling 8.2 Bcf and I think importantly about 1.8 Bcf that was existing previously unsold capacity. And we currently estimate that we move about 38% of the natural gas consumed in the United States on our pipelines.
Moving to the Products segment. The 17% year-over-year growth in segment earnings was driven by growth in KMCC. That's our crude and condensate pipeline on the Eagle Ford and the full quarter operation of the splitter, the first splitter in the Houston ship channel. We also saw a good refined products transportation growth 2.3% increase year-over-year. And while Eagle Ford volumes have declined over all and we are projecting some decline on our assets as we look forward, we have seen the volumes grow on our KMCC pipeline as projects have come on and we think that's due to the pipes in a great position. It's serving a great part of that market. It has good upstream and downstream connectivity and good contracts. Now we think we've just started to see some flattening in that pipeline but if you think about what's happening in the Eagle Ford overall, what we've done on this pipe is essentially dramatically grow our market share out of the basin on that pipe.
CO2. We saw earnings before DD&A declined 20% year-over-year to $223 million for the quarter. Production net to our interest was down 7% and I will point out, SACROC was down but Jesse, you can confirm this, but I think we had our highest quarter probably in the fourth quarter of 2014 at SACROC and then our next highest was the first quarter of 2015. So very strong quarter in 2015 that we're comparing to our 2016 performance.
The CO2 group has -- well, I'll also mention price. The weighted average realized price has declined about 18% year-over-year, and of course, that's a big part of the explanation for the downturn on a year-over-year basis. The CO2, on the bright side, CO2 group has been very diligent at reducing costs and husbanding our capital to the very highest available return opportunities. And I will say perhaps somewhat counterintuitively, third-party demand for CO2 under our arrangements with them has stayed strong. We're roughly flat year-over-year on CO2, notwithstanding the deterioration in commodity prices.
Moving to Terminals. Terminals was up 2% year-over-year. Growth in this business came from expansions and acquisitions, which slightly more than offset the weakness in our bulk business and that being driven primarily by bankruptcies of our coal customers. Most of our liquids terminal businesses and refined projects and we've continued to see high utilization and generally good pricing on rollovers and renewals there. And we continue to have a very strong outlook for the great liquids terminals positions that we built in the Houston Ship Channel and Edmonton.
Kinder Morgan Canada. The Trans Mountain expansion project. So again, this is under long-term contracts with customers. The 3-key areas of focus for us remain getting the NEB recommended order and the cabinet level ordering counsel from the federal process, consultation and accommodation with First Nations and thirdly, satisfaction of the B.C. government's 5 conditions. We're making progress on all 3. With respect to the NEB, we got our draft additions last August. We believe that they're manageable but we did seek some important changes, particularly around the time required to approve certain portions of the build. We now have the outline of the further process to be conducted by the federal government during the order and Council process, which is expected to result in a final order. They've scheduled the final order for December 20 of this year. We're making good progress in meeting the consultation and accommodation obligations we have at the First Nations and we've added mutual benefit agreements that bring us to a number -- a majority of the bands that are most directly affected by the project actually supporting the project.
On the 5 conditions. We're still working on those. We are engaged actively with the B.C. government on those. The B.C. government is also going to be conducting an environmental review under their provincial process. We expect that both of those things will be concluded within the same time frame of the federal process. Maybe not the same day, but within the same general time frame and we have this project in the backlog and we are aiming for a 2019 completion -- end of 2019 completion.
And that's it for the segment updates. With that, I'll turn it over to Kim."

But most importantly, we generated $954 million of DCF in excess of our dividend, which as",1676,"Okay. Thanks, Steve. Today, we're declaring a dividend of $0.125 per share. That's consistent with our budget and the guidance we gave you at December of last year. But most importantly, we generated $954 million of DCF in excess of our dividend, which as Steve and Rich pointed out, insulates us from the challenging Capital Markets and significantly enhances our credit profile.
Now let me explain what I mean when we say significantly enhances our credit profile. If you compare our coverage ratio, and that's DCF divided by the dividend, in the first quarter of last year, which was 1.2x versus the 4.4x in the first quarter of this year, we have significantly more retained cash flow, approximately $750 million. And therefore, we have no Capital Markets risk to getting equity raised. In addition, our previous funding policy was to fund our expansion CapEx, 50% equity and 50% debt. Now we're using 100% retained cash flow. And therefore, our balance metrics will improve more quickly than under our prior funding model.
Before we get to DCF, let me point out a couple of things on our GAAP income statement. You will see that revenues, net income available to common shareholders and earnings per share are down. As I say many quarters, we do not believe that these measures or changes in these measures are necessarily a good predictor of our performance. We have some businesses where revenues and expenses fluctuate with commodity prices but margin generally does not. In addition, these numbers can be impacted by noncash, nonrecurring accounting issues or what we call certain items. For example, if you look at revenues. Revenues are down $402 million or 11%. However, if you strip out the certain items with the primary certain item impacting revenues being the CO2 and the mark-to-market on our other hedges, revenues would be down $316 million. When you compare the $316 million to the $359 million reduction in cost of goods sold, gross margin is actually up. And again, that's largely because we have some businesses where both revenues and expenses fluctuate with commodity prices.
With respect to net income. If you strip out the certain items, and I'll go through those with you in a minute, net income before certain items was $446 million compared to $445 million for the same period in 2015 or essentially flat. EPS before certain items, and here when you do EPS, earnings is defined as net income to common shareholders, so after the payment of the preferred, EPS before certain items was $0.18 versus the $0.12 that you see on the page for the first quarter of 2016 compared to $0.20 in the first quarter of 2015. So while stripping out certain items from earnings does help, we still believe that the best indicator of our performance is the cash we generate, which we measure as distributable cash flow and distributable cash flow per share.
So let's turn to the second page of the financials, which I really will give you a clear picture of our performance. We generated total DCF for the quarter of $1.233 billion versus the $1.242 billion for the comparable period in 2015. Therefore, total DCF was down approximately $9 million. So essentially flat between the 2 periods. The segments were up by $28 million, as Steve mentioned, or 1% with the increases in natural gas and products, which combined for an increase of $85 million, slightly offsetting the $58 million reduction in CO2, which was driven largely by lower crude price. The $28 million increase in the segment was offset by a $39 million increase in our preferred stock dividends. If you remember, we issue the preferred stock in the fourth quarter of last year. Now there are other moving parts but if you take the $28 million from the segments, offset by the $39 million, that gives you a decrease of $11 million versus the decrease in DCF that I mentioned of $9 million. So that gets you almost all of the change.
DCF per share in the quarter was $0.55 versus $0.58 for the first quarter of last year. DCF per share was down slightly due to the additional shares we issued during 2015 to finance our growth projects and maintain our balance sheet. Therefore, despite an almost 30% decline in commodity prices versus the first quarter of last year, our performance was relatively flat and we believe that this demonstrates the resiliency of our cash flows generated by a large diversified platform of primarily fee-based assets.
There are a couple of certain items in the quarter that I want to highlight for you. Certain items in the quarter totaled $235 million loss on a pretax basis but $132 million loss on an after-tax basis. $170 million of the pre-taxed loss was driven by the write-off of costs associated with the NED market and the Palmetto Projects, which as Steve mentioned, have also been removed from the backlog. $85 million was associated with losses on asset disposals and impairments in 4 of our business segments with the most significant items being in CO2 and Terminal. And CO2 was primarily associated with the write-off of the CO2 recapture plan due to the lack of expected volumes. And in Terminals, it was due to lost business at 3 of our bulk terminals. We also -- there's certain tax benefit of $103 million and that's primarily just the tax impact of the certain items at approximately 35%.
As Steve mentioned in his comments, we currently expect EBITDA for the year to be approximately 3% below our budget and DCF to be approximately 4% below. Now for the first quarter, we did better than that with EBITDA about 2% below our budget and DCF about 1% below our budget but we believe our outlook is consistent with the current environment and produce our decisions and we are not assuming any improvement.
Now let me give you a little more granularity on expected segment performance for the full year versus our budget. We expect Natural Gas Pipelines to come in approximately 2% below its budget, primarily as a result of lower volumes mainly in the Eagle Ford. The other factor impacting our Natural Gas for the full year is delay on our EEC SNG pipeline expansion project as a result, of the FERC certificate being about 3 months later than we anticipated. CO2 is expected to end the year on its budget. We expect prices to be essentially in line with our $38 per barrel on our budget and cost savings to offset any weakness in oil production or CO2 volume.
We expect Terminals to end the year approximately 4% below its budget, primarily due to the impact of the Peabody bankruptcy. We currently expect products to be about 6% below its budget primarily due to lower crude and condensate volumes on KMCC, Double H and Double Eagle. Right now, we are projecting KMC to be slightly below its budget for the full year due to higher book taxes. But remember the book taxes, while they impact the segment, have no impact on EBITDA or DCF.
With respect to interest, cash taxes, G&A and sustaining CapEx. Now on a combined basis, those items are expected to come in slightly positive to budget or said another way, generate a favorable variance. With the positive interest and sustaining CapEx more than offsetting the negatives on G&A and cash taxes. The negative variance on G&A is driven by lower capitalized overhead as a result of the lower expansion capital that Steve mentioned and interest expense expected to be lower than budget due to lower LIBOR rates.
And with that, I'll move to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with debt of $41.555 billion and EBITDA for the trailing 12 months was about $7.4 billion, which results in a debt-to-EBITDA of about 5.6x, consistent with where we ended the year last year. And as Steve mentioned, we still expect to end 2016 at 5.5x consistent with our budget. That was up in the quarter, an increase in debt of about $330 million since the end of last year. So let me reconcile that for you.
We generated DCF in the quarter, as I mentioned 1 minute ago, of $1.233 billion. We spent about $700 million in CapEx. We spent about $245 million roughly on acquisitions, with almost all of that being associated with the BP acquisition; and we contributed about $44 million to equity investments. So about $900 million -- a little -- $990 million roughly attributable to our expansion CapEx program.
We paid dividends of $279 million and then there were working capital and other items that were used at roughly $300 million. When you look at the use of working capital, about -- over $150 million of that was associated with accrued interest. Now when I give you the DCF figure of $1.233 million, that has 3 months of accrued interest in it but we make interest payments twice a year. We make them primarily in the first quarter -- in the third quarter, and so we make cash interest payments in the first quarter attributable to 6 months. So you have a working capital use associated with that incremental 6 months of cash going out the door, which is different from the 3 months of accrual within DCF.
The other working capital use in the quarter was primarily associated with property tax and there's probably about $100 million associated with that. Again, we have about 3 months of property tax accrual in the quarter. By the time you get to the end of the year, you have 12 months of accrual but a lot of our property tax payments are made for the full year in January. And therefore, relative to DCF, you have a working capital use in the quarter. In future quarters, you'll have a working capital source. And that gets you to about the $330 million increase in debt.
And so with that, I'll turn it back to Rich."

I mean, I'll start with the 2 big pieces and then Kim has some additional detail. But as I said, about -- just a little under half of it, a little under 50% of the reduction is attributable to lower Eagle Ford volumes than what we had in the plan. So as I talked about volumes been up year-over-year but versus what we had in the plan, we had lower Eagle Ford volumes. And that impact -- that's trying to sum up everything. So that is on our Eagle Ford gathering system itself, on our DK, Heather line and the processing facility. It's also volumes that we're entering into our taxes Intrastate system that we expected to be able to move on that system and collect transport fees. So it's kind of end to end almost on the Eagle Ford volumes through our Texas assets. The other place where we had exposure to the Eagle Ford volumes is in our projects pipelines where we have the KMCC pipe line and the splitter. And we expected the splitter in our plan to run a little bit above its contract minimums. We have good contracts with good protection there. It's running -- we're expecting to just kind of to run at the minimum, which are pretty good. It's a pretty high percentage of the capacity of the facility but we have budgeted a little bit more there. And KMCC, we expect we're now going to start to see some volume metric decline on that. Again, that's all versus planned. So that's a little -- if you just say -- and look there are a lots of different ways to rack up these numbers. But that's -- those factors, the Eagle Ford volumes as they impact 2 of our business units, amount to about half, a little less than half of the adjustment. The other -- another 20% is attributable to the coal company bankruptcy. So those are the 2 very big pieces."

So on the first point and I want to separate that a little bit from the high-grade discussion because look we did it all on NED. We pursued customers hard. We pursued accruals hard. In the end, the customer commitments just weren't there. Now that makes the project economic not surprisingly and that's why I wanted to specify the return for you. It's apparent. It's objectively apparent that the project is not economically viable project at that customer sign-up level. So we said at the conference we're going to make a big push in the first quarter to try to get customer commitments in and sell-down some of the equity to customers. Not a lot of takers at that return as you might expect and so we put on a hard push to try to get done and it's just not forthcoming. We had 1 significant perspective customer who determined to put their volume someplace else. And that was a significant negative for the project. So that's how we got to that decision in the time that we're talking about now. But I want to go back and underscore again from an investor standpoint, in light of that return, we are a lot better off with that $3.1 billion back in our pockets and being put to some other use. The project wasn't going to produce a return that would be required to make it viable because again, the contracts weren't there were better off having the money back I think if you look through the rest of the backlog, my guess is we'll find some bits and pieces there that will either save some money on or we may change the timing of a little bit. Still think those are high probability projects though and ones that you want to build-out and do and they contribute to our DCF per share growth that we're aiming to achieve by building it out."

So long-term contracts and look, the overall picture, I mean, it's -- the overall picture in Canada is notwithstanding very, very difficult netbacks out there right. They're taking a very long view and their finishing out projects that there well into and the oil stands become a very stable source of production. It's not like the shales where it ramps -- you get a high ramp up in the beginning and then it falls off so there's an actual projection of increase in production in Canada. At the same time, that the transport options outside of Canada are becoming more limited. So our customer still want to do this project and we do too and the returns are good. Switching to the, I guess, public opinion or the governmental outlook, I would say just very broadly that the tone of the comments in the public arena up there are improving. I think that there is a recognition that getting the Canadian national resources to points where they can be extra ported and no longer dependent upon so lead the U.S. market is a good thing across Canada. And that's starting to show up as people are being constructive about, okay, we need to approve project. We want to approve them with -- we want to have the right conditions in the right process around that approval but if -- there's been a switch I think toward a momentum toward getting the project approved. Now I'll say that with an important caveat. We don't know what their conditions or ultimately going to be in the end, and we'll have to make an assessment of that when they're all in. We certainly have a good handle on what the NED proposed conditions are going to look like but we don't know what if any other conditions may be oppose. So we'll have to watch for that may be very carefully. But we've had good returns, good underlying customer to support contractual support and improving tone I think in the public sector debate."

The project is going to costs us and it's going to be a little bit dependent on the conditions. I think a couple of things. One is that there is some cost pressure. The Canadian dollar has weakened relative to U.S. dollar. A lot of goods and services are provided in U.S. dollar terms. So there's been some pressure there. There have been some conditions that we've agreed to and that have added over time, which put some pressure on. But I think in the -- at the end of the day, what matters is do the customers want the project. And we still have very strong interest from our shippers in the project. And we even have interest from shippers who are not currently our customers -- potential customers who are not currently shippers on the project. So we talk about this all the time.

Thank you, Sean, and welcome to the KMI first quarter investor call.
Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that today's earnings release and this call include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Act -- Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 as well as certain non-GAAP financial measures. We encourage you to read our full disclosure on forward-looking statements and use of non-GAAP financial measures set forth at the end of our earnings release as well as review our latest filings with the SEC for a list of risk factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those in such forward-looking statements.
I'll start the call, and before I turn it over to our CEO, Steve Kean, and our CFO, Kim Dang, I'd like to give you a quick overview of our strategy at KMI. The first point I would make is that this quarter's results again demonstrate that we remain a strong generator of cash even in these chaotic times for the energy sector. 
Second, as we've said previously and at our meeting in January, we do not anticipate any requirement to access the equity markets for the foreseeable future. We also do not see any requirement to access the debt markets for the foreseeable future, except for rollovers in years subsequent to 2016. We've again reduced our expansion CapEx. Steve will take you through that for 2016, and we expect that trend to continue in subsequent years through both high grading our projects and entering into selective joint ventures. 
We expect to fund the necessary CapEx out of our cash flow and continue to improve our debt-to-EBITDA ratio, thereby preserving and strengthening our investment-grade balance sheet. As our cash flow achieves those objectives, funding our CapEx and strengthening our balance sheet, we will obviously have excess cash which we will then use to either raise our dividend, purchase our shares, offer new projects and/or acquisitions but only if they are solidly accretive to our distributable cash flow per share.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Steve."

I'm going to hit on 3 topics before giving you some segment highlights for the quarter. First, an update to our capital projects and our expected growth spend for 2016, an update on our outlook for the balance of 2016 and some thoughts",2524,"Okay. Thanks, Rich. I'm going to hit on 3 topics before giving you some segment highlights for the quarter. First, an update to our capital projects and our expected growth spend for 2016, an update on our outlook for the balance of 2016 and some thoughts on our counterparty credit risk.
With respect to the capital update, we announced today a reduction in our project backlog of $4.1 billion. So from $18.2 billion down to $14.1 billion. The 2 biggest adjustments are the removal of Palmetto Pipeline Project, which is a reduction of $550 million, and the market portion of the NED project, which is a reduction of $3.1 billion. 
With respect to NED, we worked very hard. This is our Northeast Direct project serving -- that would have served New England markets. We worked very hard to get customer commitments on the project and while many of our LDC customers did sign-up, we did not receive enough contractual commitments from electric customers to make the project viable. So we will fulfill our obligation to consult with our customers over the next 30 days or so, but this project is not economic so we're removing it from the backlog. 
In both cases, NED and Palmetto, based on all the facts, we believe this is the right outcome for our investors. To be specific, the return on the NED Project, at the level of commitments that we have, would be less than 6% unlevered after-tax. That's clearly not viable, and we are far better off having that cash available for other uses, whether that's continued and even accelerated delevering, other investment opportunities or returning value to shareholders. We value our New England customers and continue to believe, along with many others, that additional capacity is needed in the region but we'll have to look for other ways to serve some part of those needs.  We didn't get there on this one, and the action we're taking is undeniably the right call for our investors. We previously wrote off, I'll remind you, our NED supply project, and we never had that one in the backlog.
On the Palmetto Pipeline. Essentially, the Georgia legislature prevented us from getting imminent domain and also prevented us from getting other state permits. We were making good progress with land acquisition even without imminent domain, but we needed other permits, which Georgia has now put a moratorium on, we needed environmental permits, for example, which they've now put a moratorium on until mid-2017. So as a result, we are not moving forward with Palmetto. We had some other small adjustments to the backlog, including putting about $160 million for the projects in service during the quarter. We had some cost changes, which netted to a reduction of $254 million in the overall backlog, and we had some other scope additions and removals, which essentially offset each other.
So looking at the bigger picture on our capital projects spend, we continue to high-grade our capital investments to ensure that we're securing our investment-grade credit metrics and maximizing the returns we get for the capital that we do deploy. We're aiming to reduce spend, improve returns and selectively joint venture projects where that makes sense. We reduced our expected 2016 spend by an additional $400 million to $2.9 billion. So that compares to the $3.3 million that we projected in January for 2016, which, in turn, was $900 million down from the $4.2 billion that we projected in our preliminary 2016 guidance, which we sent out last December. So we continue to work through our backlog and high-grade where we're spending our capital.
With respect to joint ventures. As we discussed at the January conference, we'd be pursuing these where they made sense. That is where we could share the capital spending obligation on a particular project with a third-party, get paid a reasonable value for having originated the opportunity, et cetera. Those processes are competitive and confidential so we're only going to be able to give you limited details but the summary is that the process is going well and we currently expect to achieve results -- the results that we built in to our plan. 
We're also taking care to not be dependent on any one transaction. These processes can be unpredictable, and we will be in a position to back away from a given transaction if acceptable value does not materialize.
Overall, as we complete projects and further high-grade the backlog, as Rich mentioned, we will free up cash that we can use to reduce debt, return cash to investors in the form of buybacks and dividends or invest in attractive projects or acquisition, or some combination of those.
Now for the 2016 outlook update. We have looked at the potential impacts for the remainder of 2016 due to continued weakness in the sector. We now estimate on a full year basis for 2016, a negative impact of about 3% to the EBITDA that we showed in January, but because of our ongoing efforts to high-grade our capital spend and to pursue the joint ventures where it makes sense, we expect to meet our investment-grade credit metrics, notwithstanding the 3% reduction. That 3% EBITDA reduction translates into a 4% reduction in DCF. 
Yes, as the year goes on, we will try to mitigate that negative but we are not assuming in this outlook any dramatic turnaround for our producer customers by the end of the year as some analysts have predicted.
Now we're not happy about any negative to plan, but I think when you put this in the context of a dramatic production declines, particularly in the Eagle Ford, which is down 28% on oil from its peak and 15% on gas and credit weaknesses, our business is really diversified and insulated from the full brunt of the weakness in the producing sector.
So here are the 2 main contributors. A little under half of the deterioration is attributable to lower Eagle Ford volumes, and those flow through both our Midstream group in the gas business unit and also in our products group. And again, what -- this is all comparing to our original outlook. So this is not a year-over-year look. This is a -- versus our January outlook that we presented at the conference. So a little under half attributable to the Eagle Ford. Another 20% is attributable to the coal customer bankruptcies. So there is -- there are a lot of other pieces and Kim will take you through some additional details, but those are the 2 big chunks contributing to the degradation of the forecast.
So while the current year outlook for North American engine production is experiencing weakness, we're still bullish on the longer-term. We believe that we'll continue to see more of our North American energy needs met by North American energy production that will grow our exports. We've already been growing refined products, natural gas to Mexico. I think we'll continue to see growth in natural gas and natural gas liquids exports. And those long-term trends are good for North American energy midstream companies like Kinder Morgan.
Okay, the third general topic is counterparty credit. We've been monitoring counterparty credit very closely. But beyond monitoring, we've been taking action. We've been calling on collateral, putting other credits quarter arrangements in place. A few points about our particular circumstances. Given our diverse business mix, we've got a very broad and diverse customer base. We've got producer customers, of course, but we also have integrated energy companies, gas and electric utilities and industrial users of our services. We're not exposed to any single sector, commodity or service. That diversifies our exposure, which reduces our risk. 
Our Top 25 customers constitute 44% of our revenue and of that revenue, 85% is investment-grade. Of our total revenue, about 75% is investment-grade or has substantial credit support and 86% is rated B or better. In our business, real exposure is more complicated than simply looking at our customers ratings. In many cases, the rights our customers hold are valuable to third parties or essential to the revenue-generating activities of those customers and therefore, will be needed on an ongoing basis by the customer or in the worst case, a debtor in possession of bankruptcy or a subsequent purchaser. We analyze all of those factors in mitigation to get to our credit concern list. Our identified credit concern list amounts to about 5% of revenue, and about half of that is mitigated by credit support or underlying resale value of the capacity that the customers hold. And those numbers, that 5% and that half of 5%, include Peabody, the Peabody bankruptcy which we're now reflecting. So the going-forward number is less than that. We're reflecting Peabody, the Peabody bankruptcy, in our forecast update.
So in the segments, a few highlights. Looking at the first quarter 2016 to Q1 of 2015, the overall summary is this: on an earnings before DD&A and Certain Items basis, 3 of our 5 units basis grew year-over-year; gas was up 4%; Products Pipelines was up 17%; Terminals was up 2%; Kinder Morgan Canada would have been up year-over-year, but for the effect of the weakening Canadian dollar; and CO2 was down 21% as a result of lower commodity prices and some lower production.
On Natural Gas Pipelines. We had very strong performance on TGP and the contributions from our Hiland midstream acquisition. So we split the Hiland acquisition between our Midstream business units in gas and our Products Pipelines for the Double H pipeline. So contributions from really, really strong performance on TGP and the contribution from our Hiland midstream acquisition that we made in the first quarter of last year, and those 2 things more than offset weakness in our other midstream assets and in our Western pipelines. The Midstream weakness is largely gathering the processing in the Eagle Ford and on a year-over-year basis, gathering in the Haynesville.
In the West, year-over-year growth on our EPNG system was more than offset by weakness in Cheyenne Plains, WIC, CIG and Trans Colorado as the fundamentals for basis pipes out of the Rockies continues to degrade.
Natural gas needs for transportation and storage services, we believe, should grow over the medium and long-term as power generation exports, including LNG and exports to Mexico, and pet-chem and industrial demand continue to grow. 
Over the last 2 years, the gas group has entered into new and firm -- new and pending firm transport capacity commitments totaling 8.2 Bcf, and I think importantly, about 1.8 Bcf that was existing previously unsold capacity. And we currently estimate that we move about 38% of the natural gas consumed in the United States on our pipelines.
Moving to the Products segment. The 17% year-over-year growth in segment earnings was driven by growth in KMCC. That's our crude and condensate pipeline on the Eagle Ford and the full quarter operation of the splitter, the first splitter, in the Houston Ship Channel. We have both splitters up and running in the Houston Ship Channel. We also saw a good refined products transportation growth, 2.3% increase year-over-year. And while Eagle Ford volumes have declined over all, and we are projecting some decline on our assets as we look forward, we have seen the volumes grow on our KMCC pipeline as projects have come on, and we think that's due to the pipes in a great position. It's serving a great part of that market. It has good upstream and downstream connectivity and good contracts. Now we think we've just started to see some flattening in that pipeline, but if you think about what's happening in the Eagle Ford overall, what we've done on this pipe is essentially dramatically grow our market share out of the basin on that pipe.
CO2. We saw earnings before DD&A decline 20% year-over-year to $223 million for the quarter. Production net to our interest was down 7%. And I will point out, SACROC was down, but Jesse, you can confirm this, but I think we had our highest quarter probably in the fourth quarter of 2014 at SACROC. And then our next highest was in the first quarter of 2015. So very strong quarter in 2015 that we're comparing to our 2016 performance.
The CO2 group has -- well, I'll also mention price. The weighted average realized price has declined about 18% year-over-year, and of course, that's a big part of the explanation for the downturn on a year-over-year basis. The CO2, on the bright side, the CO2 group has been very diligent in reducing costs and husbanding our capital to the very highest available return opportunities. And I will say, perhaps somewhat counterintuitively, third-party demand for CO2 under our arrangements with them has stayed strong. We're roughly flat year-over-year on CO2, notwithstanding the deterioration in commodity prices.
Moving to Terminals. Terminals was up 2% year-over-year. Growth in this business came from expansions and acquisitions, which slightly more than offset the weakness in our bulk business and that being driven primarily by bankruptcies of our coal customers. Most of our liquids terminal businesses and refined projects, and we've continued to see high utilization and generally good pricing on rollovers and renewals there. And we continue to have a very strong outlook for the great liquids terminals positions that we've built in the Houston Ship Channel and Edmonton.
Kinder Morgan Canada, the Trans Mountain expansion project. So again, this is under long-term contracts with customers. The 3-key areas of focus for us remain getting the NEB recommended order and the cabinet level Order In Council from the federal process; consultation and accommodation with First Nations; and thirdly, satisfaction of the B.C. government's 5 conditions. We're making progress on all 3. 
With respect to the NEB, we got our draft conditions last August. We believe that they're manageable but we did seek some important changes, particularly around the time required to approve certain portions of the build. We now have the outline of the further process to be conducted by the federal government during the Order In Council process, which is expected to result in a final order. They're -- they've scheduled the final order for December 20 of this year. 
We're making good progress in meeting the consultation and accommodation obligations we have at the First Nations, and we've added mutual benefit agreements that bring us to a number -- a majority of the bands that are most directly affected by the project actually supporting the project.
On the 5 conditions, we're still working on those. We are engaged actively with the B.C. government on those. The B.C. government is also going to be conducting an environmental review under their provincial process. We expect that both of those things will be concluded within the same time frame of the federal process, maybe not the same day, but within the same general time frame. and we have this project in the backlog and we are aiming for a 2019 completion, end of 2019 completion.
And that's it for the segment updates. With that, I'll turn it over to Kim."
34952431,331317848,960298,"Kinder Morgan, Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 20, 2016",2016-04-20,"Earnings Calls","Kinder Morgan, Inc.","Executives","Okay. Thanks, Steve. Today, we're declaring a dividend of $0.125 per share. That's consistent with our budget and the guidance we gave you in December of last year. But most importantly, we generated $954 million of DCF in excess of our dividend, which, a",1677,"Okay. Thanks, Steve. Today, we're declaring a dividend of $0.125 per share. That's consistent with our budget and the guidance we gave you in December of last year. But most importantly, we generated $954 million of DCF in excess of our dividend, which, as Steve and Rich pointed out, insulates us from the challenging capital markets and significantly enhances our credit profile.
Now let me explain what I mean when we say significantly enhances our credit profile. If you compare our coverage ratio, and that's DCF divided by the dividend, in the first quarter of last year, which was 1.2x versus the 4.4x in the first quarter of this year, we have significantly more retained cash flow, approximately $750 million, and therefore, we have no capital markets risk to getting equity raised. In addition, our previous funding policy was to fund our expansion CapEx, 50% equity and 50% debt. Now we're using 100% retained cash flow. And therefore, our balance metrics will improve more quickly than under our prior funding model.
Before we get to DCF, let me point out a couple of things on our GAAP income statement. You will see that revenues, net income available to common shareholders and earnings per share are down. As I say in many quarters, we do not believe that these measures, or changes in these measures, are necessarily a good predictor of our performance. We have some businesses where revenues and expenses fluctuate with commodity prices but margin generally does not. In addition, these numbers can be impacted by noncash, nonrecurring accounting issues or what we call, Certain Items. For example, if you look at revenues, revenues are down $402 million or 11%. However, if you strip out the Certain Items with the primary certain item impacting revenues, being the CO2 and the mark-to-market on our other hedges, revenues would be down $316 million. When you compare the $316 million to the $359 million reduction in cost of goods sold, gross margin is actually up. And again, that's largely because we have some businesses where both revenues and expenses fluctuate with commodity prices.
With respect to net income. If you strip out the Certain Items, and I'll go through those with you in a minute, net income before Certain Items was $446 million compared to $445 million for the same period in 2015 or essentially flat. EPS before Certain Items, and here when you do EPS, earnings is defined as net income to common shareholders, so after the payment of the preferred, EPS before Certain Items was $0.18 versus the $0.12 that you see on the page for the first quarter of 2016 compared to $0.20 in the first quarter of 2015. 
So while stripping out Certain Items from earnings does help, we still believe that the best indicator of our performance is the cash we generate, which we measure as distributable cash flow and distributable cash flow per share.
So let's turn to the second page of the financials, which I really will give you a clear picture of our performance. We generated total DCF for the quarter of $1.233 billion versus the $1.242 billion for the comparable period in 2015. Therefore, total DCF was down approximately $9 million. So essentially flat between the 2 periods. The segments were up by $28 million, as Steve mentioned, or 1% with the increases in natural gas and products, which combined for an increase of $85 million, slightly offsetting the $58 million reduction in CO2, which was driven largely by lower crude price. The $28 million increase in the segment was offset by a $39 million increase in our preferred stock dividends. If you remember, we issued a preferred stock in the fourth quarter of last year. Now there are other moving parts but if you take the $28 million from the segments, offset by the $39 million, that gets you a decrease of $11 million versus the decrease in DCF that I mentioned of $9 million. So that gets you almost all of the change.
DCF per share in the quarter was $0.55 versus $0.58 for the first quarter of last year. DCF per share was down slightly due to the additional shares we issued during 2015 to finance our growth projects and maintain our balance sheet. Therefore, despite an almost 30% decline in commodity prices versus the first quarter of last year, our performance was relatively flat, and we believe that this demonstrates the resiliency of our cash flows generated by a large diversified platform of primarily fee-based assets.
There are a couple of Certain Items in the quarter that I want to highlight for you. Certain Items in the quarter totaled $235 million loss on a pretax basis but $132 million loss on an after-tax basis. $170 million of the pre-tax loss was driven by the write-off of costs associated with the NED market and the Palmetto Projects, which, as Steve mentioned, have also been removed from the backlog. $85 million was associated with losses on asset disposals and impairments in 4 of our business segments, with the most significant items being in CO2 and Terminal. In CO2, it was primarily associated with the write-off of the CO2 recapture plant due to the lack of expected volumes. And in Terminals, it was due to lost business at 3 of our bulk terminals. We also -- there's a certain tax benefit of $103 million, and that's primarily just the tax impact of the Certain Items at approximately 35%.
As Steve mentioned in his comments, we currently expect EBITDA for the year to be approximately 3% below our budget and DCF to be approximately 4% below. Now for the first quarter, we did better than that with EBITDA about 2% below our budget and DCF about 1% below our budget. But we believe our outlook is consistent with the current environment and produce our decisions, and we are not assuming any improvement.
Now let me give you a little more granularity on expected segment performance for the full year versus our budget. We expect Natural Gas Pipelines to come in approximately 2% below its budget, primarily as a result of lower volumes, mainly in the Eagle Ford. The other factor impacting our Natural Gas for the full year is delay on our EEC SNG pipeline expansion project as a result of the FERC certificate being about 3 months later than we anticipated. 
CO2 is expected to end the year on its budget. We expect prices to be essentially in line with our $38 per barrel in our budget and cost savings to offset any weakness in oil production or CO2 volumes.
We expect Terminals to end the year approximately 4% below its budget, primarily due to the impact of the Peabody bankruptcy. We currently expect products to be about 6% below its budget primarily due to lower crude and condensate volumes on KMCC, Double H and Double Eagle. Right now, we are projecting KMC to be slightly below its budget for the full year due to higher book taxes. But remember the book taxes, while they impact the segment, have no impact on EBITDA or DCF.
With respect to interest, cash taxes, G&A and sustaining CapEx, on a combined basis, those items are expected to come in slightly positive to budget, or said another way, generate a favorable variance with the positive interest in sustaining CapEx more than offsetting the negatives on G&A and cash taxes. The negative variance on G&A is driven by lower capitalized overhead as a result of the lower expansion capital that Steve mentioned and interest expense expected to be lower than budget due to lower LIBOR rates.
And with that, I'll move to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with debt of $41.555 billion, and EBITDA for the trailing 12 months was about $7.4 billion, which results in a debt-to-EBITDA of about 5.6x, consistent with where we ended the year last year. And as Steve mentioned, we still expect to end 2016 at 5.5x consistent with our budget. Debt was up in the quarter, an increase in debt of about $330 million since the end of last year. So let me reconcile that for you.
We've generated DCF in the quarter, as I mentioned a minute ago, of $1.233 billion. We spent about $700 million in CapEx. We spent about $245 million roughly on acquisitions, with almost all of that being associated with the BP acquisition, and we contributed about $44 million to equity investments. So about $900 million -- a little -- $990 million roughly attributable to our expansion CapEx program.
We paid dividends of $279 million and then there were working capital and other items that were used at roughly $300 million. When you look at the use of working capital, about -- over $150 million of that was associated with accrued interest. And when I give you the DCF figure of $1.233 million, that has 3 months of accrued interest in it but we make interest payments twice a year. We make them primarily in the first quarter and the third quarter. And so we make cash interest payments in the first quarter attributable to 6 months. So you have a working capital use associated with that incremental 6 months of cash going out the door, which is different from the 3 months of accrual within DCF.
The other working capital use in the quarter was primarily associated with property tax, and there's probably about $100 million associated with that. Again, we have about 3 months of property tax accrual in the quarter. By the time you get to the end of the year, you have 12 months of accrual but a lot of our property tax payments are made for the full year in January. And therefore, relative to DCF, you have a working capital use in the quarter. In future quarters, you'll have a working capital source. And that gets you to about the $330 million increase in debt.
And so with that, I'll turn it back to Rich."

I mean, I'll start with the 2 big pieces, and then Kim has some additional detail. But as I said, about -- just a little under half of it, a little under 50% of the reduction is attributable to lower Eagle Ford volumes than what we had in the plan. So I talked about volumes been up year-over-year but versus what we had in the plan, we had lower Eagle Ford volumes. And that impact -- that's trying to sum up everything. So that is on our Eagle Ford gathering system itself, on our DK, Heather line and the processing facility. It's also volumes that we're entering into our taxes Intrastate system that we expected to be able to move on that system and collect transport fees. So it's kind of from end to end almost on the Eagle Ford volumes through our Texas assets. 
The other place where we have exposure to the Eagle Ford volumes is in our projects pipelines, where we have the KMCC pipeline and the splitter. And we've expected the splitter in our plan to run a little bit above its contract minimums. We have good contracts with good protection there. It's running. We're expecting kind of just to run at the minimum, which are pretty good. I mean, it's a pretty high percentage of the capacity of the facility but we had budgeted a little bit more there. And KMCC, we expect we're now going to start to see some volume metric decline on that. Again, that's all versus planned. So that's a little -- if you just say -- and look, there are a lots of different ways to rack up these numbers, but that's -- those factors, the Eagle Ford volumes, as they impact 2 of our business units, amount to about half, a little less than half of the adjustment. The other -- another 20% is attributable to the coal company bankruptcy. So those are the 2 very big pieces."

So on the first point, and I want to separate that a little bit from the high-grading discussion because, look, we gave it our all on NED. I mean, we pursued customers hard. We pursued approvals hard. In the end, the customer commitments just weren't there. Now that makes the project uneconomic not surprisingly, and that's why I wanted to specify the return for you. It's apparent. It's objectively apparent that the project is not economically a viable project at that customer sign-up level. And so we said at the conference, we're going to make a big push in the first quarter to try to get customer commitments in and sell down some of the equity to customers. Not a lot of takers at that return as you might expect, and so we put on a hard push to try to get done and it's just not forthcoming. We had one significant perspective customer who's determined to put their volume some place else, and that was a significant negative for the project. 
So that's how we got to that decision in the time that we're talking about now, but I want to go back and underscore again, from an investor standpoint, in light of that return, we are a lot better off with that $3.1 billion back in our pockets and being put to some other use. The project wasn't going to produce the return that would be required to make it viable because, again, the contracts weren't there. We're better off having that money back. I think if you look through the rest of the backlog, my guess is we'll find some bits and pieces here and there that will either -- will save some money on or we may change the timing of a little bit. Still think those are high-probability projects, though, and ones that we want to build out and do, and they contribute to our DCF per share growth that we're aiming to achieve by building it out."

It was also, we got cost reductions. We had other projects that were moved as we said at the beginning of the year we made some JV assumptions as well."

We were fighting to get NED under contract and didn't get there. Trans Mountain has the contracts in place. 20-year contract for 93% of the volume and the other 7% is on a 15 year contract. So long-term contracts and look, the overall picture, I mean, it's -- the overall picture in Canada is notwithstanding very, very difficult netbacks up there, right? They're taking a very long view. The producers are taking a long view and they're finishing out projects that they're well into and the oil stands become a very stable source of production. It's not like the shales, where it ramps, you get a high ramp up in the beginning and then it falls off rapidly. So there's an actual projection of increase in production in Canada. At the same time, that the transport options outside of Canada are becoming more limited. So our customer still want to do this project and we do, too, and the returns are good. 
Switching to the, I guess, public opinion or the governmental outlook. I would say just very broadly that the tone of the comments in the public arena up there are improving. I think that there is a recognition that getting Canadian natural resources to points where they can be extra ported and no longer dependent upon so lead the U.S. market is a good thing across Canada. And that's starting to show up as people are being constructive about, okay, we need to approve projects. We want to approve them with -- we want to have the right conditions in the right process around that approval but if -- there's been a switch, I think, toward a momentum, toward getting the project approved. Now I'll say that with an important caveat. We don't know what their conditions or ultimately going to be in the end, and we'll have to make an assessment of that when it's all in. We certainly have a good handle on what the NED proposed conditions are going to look like but we don't know what if any other conditions may be oppose. So we're going o have to watch for that may be very carefully. But we've had good returns, good underlying customer to support contractual support and improving tone, I think, in the public sector debate."

We actually approved a project today that had a 43% return. These are small. The capital program on CO2 is now just a little over $200 million, but we continue to approve small program spends in the CO2 group. And I think that the easiest way to think about it, Becca, is where we've got an existing flood that's up and running. And so what we're doing is using share facilities, maybe adding an injector, converting a current producing well to an injector, drilling a new producing well. But we've got all the other facilities, all the central facilities in place. The incremental -- the return on the incremental capital spend that we make is still attractive. Now if you're talking about a brand-new CO2 flood and getting one of those started, that's a ways off.

The Canadian dollar has weakened relative to the U.S. dollar. A lot of the goods and services are provided in U.S.-dollar terms. So there's been some pressure there. There have been some conditions that we've agreed to and that have been added over time, which has put some pressure on.

Thank you, Sean, and welcome to the KMI first quarter investor call.
Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that today's earnings release and this call include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Act -- Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 as well as certain non-GAAP financial measures. We encourage you to read our full disclosure on forward-looking statements and use of non-GAAP financial measures set forth at the end of our earnings release as well as review our latest filings with the SEC for a list of risk factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those in such forward-looking statements.
I'll start the call, and before I turn it over to our CEO, Steve Kean, and our CFO, Kim Dang, I'd like to give you a quick overview of our strategy at KMI. The first point I would make is that this quarter's results again demonstrate that we remain a strong generator of cash even in these chaotic times for the energy sector. 
Second, as we've said previously and at our meeting in January, we do not anticipate any requirement to access the equity markets for the foreseeable future. We also do not see any requirement to access the debt markets for the foreseeable future, except for rollovers in years subsequent to 2016. We've again reduced our expansion CapEx. Steve will take you through that for 2016, and we expect that trend to continue in subsequent years through both high grading our projects and entering into selective joint ventures. 
We expect to fund the necessary CapEx out of our cash flow and continue to improve our debt-to-EBITDA ratio, thereby preserving and strengthening our investment-grade balance sheet. As our cash flow achieves those objectives, funding our CapEx and strengthening our balance sheet, we will obviously have excess cash which we will then use to either raise our dividend, purchase our shares, offer new projects and/or acquisitions but only if they are solidly accretive to our distributable cash flow per share.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Steve."

I'm going to hit on 3 topics before giving you some segment highlights for the quarter. First, an update to our capital projects and our expected growth spend for 2016, an update on our outlook for the balance of 2016 and some thoughts",2525,"Okay. Thanks, Rich. I'm going to hit on 3 topics before giving you some segment highlights for the quarter. First, an update to our capital projects and our expected growth spend for 2016, an update on our outlook for the balance of 2016 and some thoughts on our counterparty credit risk.
With respect to the capital update, we announced today a reduction in our project backlog of $4.1 billion. So from $18.2 billion down to $14.1 billion. The 2 biggest adjustments are the removal of Palmetto Pipeline Project, which is a reduction of $550 million, and the market portion of the NED project, which is a reduction of $3.1 billion. 
With respect to NED, we worked very hard. This is our Northeast Direct project serving -- that would have served New England markets. We worked very hard to get customer commitments on the project and while many of our LDC customers did sign up, we did not receive enough contractual commitments from electric customers to make the project viable. So we will fulfill our obligation to consult with our customers over the next 30 days or so, but this project is not economic so we're removing it from the backlog. 
In both cases, NED and Palmetto, based on all the facts, we believe this is the right outcome for our investors. To be specific, the return on the NED Project, at the level of commitments that we have, would be less than 6% unlevered after-tax. That's clearly not viable, and we are far better off having that cash available for other uses, whether that's continued and even accelerated delevering, other investment opportunities or returning value to shareholders. We value our New England customers and continue to believe, along with many others, that additional capacity is needed in the region but we'll have to look for other ways to serve some part of those needs.  We didn't get there on this one, and the action we're taking is undeniably the right call for our investors. We previously wrote off, I'll remind you, our NED supply project, and we never had that one in the backlog.
On the Palmetto Pipeline. Essentially, the Georgia legislature prevented us from getting imminent domain and also prevented us from getting other state permits. We were making good progress with land acquisition even without imminent domain, but we needed other permits, which Georgia has now put a moratorium on, we needed environmental permits, for example, which they've now put a moratorium on until mid-2017. So as a result, we are not moving forward with Palmetto. We had some other small adjustments to the backlog, including putting about $160 million for the projects in service during the quarter. We had some cost changes, which netted to a reduction of $254 million in the overall backlog, and we had some other scope additions and removals, which essentially offset each other.
So looking at the bigger picture on our capital projects spend, we continue to high-grade our capital investments to ensure that we're securing our investment-grade credit metrics and maximizing the returns we get for the capital that we do deploy. We're aiming to reduce spend, improve returns and selectively joint venture projects where that makes sense. We reduced our expected 2016 spend by an additional $400 million to $2.9 billion. So that compares to the $3.3 billion that we projected in January for 2016, which, in turn was $900 million down from the $4.2 billion that we projected in our preliminary 2016 guidance, which we set out last December. So we continue to work through our backlog and high-grade where we're spending our capital.
With respect to joint ventures. As we discussed at the January conference, we'd be pursuing these where they made sense. That is where we could share the capital spending obligation on a particular project with a third-party, get paid a reasonable value for having originated the opportunity, et cetera. Those processes are competitive and confidential so we're only going to be able to give you limited details but the summary is that the process is going well and we currently expect to achieve results -- the results that we built into our plan. 
We're also taking care to not be dependent on any one transaction. These processes can be unpredictable, and we will be in a position to back away from a given transaction if acceptable value does not materialize.
Overall, as we complete projects and further high-grade the backlog, as Rich mentioned, we will free up cash that we can use to reduce debt, return cash to investors in the form of buybacks and dividends or invest in attractive projects or acquisitions, or some combination of those.
Now for the 2016 outlook update. We have looked at the potential impacts for the remainder of 2016 due to continued weakness in the sector. We now estimate on a full year basis for 2016, a negative impact of about 3% to the EBITDA that we showed in January, but because of our ongoing efforts to high-grade our capital spend and to pursue the joint ventures where it makes sense, we expect to meet our investment-grade credit metrics, notwithstanding the 3% reduction. That 3% EBITDA reduction translates into a 4% reduction in DCF. 
Yes, as the year goes on, we will try to mitigate that negative but we are not assuming in this outlook any dramatic turnaround for our producer customers by the end of the year as some analysts have predicted.
Now we're not happy about any negative to plan, but I think when you put this in the context of a dramatic production declines, particularly in the Eagle Ford, which is down 28% on oil from its peak and 15% on gas and credit weaknesses, our business is really diversified and insulated from the full brunt of the weakness in the producing sector.
So here are the 2 main contributors. A little under half of the deterioration is attributable to lower Eagle Ford volumes, and those flow through both our midstream group in the gas business unit and also in our products group. And again, what -- this is all comparing to our original outlook. So this is not a year-over-year look. This is a -- versus our January outlook that we presented at the conference. So a little under half attributable to the Eagle Ford. Another 20% is attributable to the coal customer bankruptcies. So there is -- there are a lot of other pieces and Kim will take you through some additional details, but those are the 2 big chunks contributing to the degradation of the forecast.
So while the current year outlook for North American energy production is experiencing weakness, we're still bullish on the longer-term. We believe that we'll continue to see more of our North American energy needs met by North American energy production that will grow our exports. We've already been growing refined products, natural gas to Mexico. I think we'll continue to see growth in natural gas and natural gas liquids exports. And those long-term trends are good for North American energy midstream companies like Kinder Morgan.
Okay, the third general topic is counterparty credit. We've been monitoring counterparty credit very closely. But beyond monitoring, we've been taking action. We've been calling on collateral, putting other credit support arrangements in place. A few points about our particular circumstances. Given our diverse business mix, we've got a very broad and diverse customer base. We've got producer customers, of course, but we also have integrated energy companies, gas and electric utilities and industrial users of our services. We're not exposed to any single sector, commodity or service. That diversifies our exposure, which reduces our risk. 
Our Top 25 customers constitute 44% of our revenue and of that revenue, 85% is investment-grade. Of our total revenue, about 75% is investment-grade or has substantial credit support and 86% is rated B or better. In our business, real exposure is more complicated than simply looking at our customers' ratings. In many cases, the rights our customers hold are valuable to third parties or essential to the revenue-generating activities of those customers and therefore, will be needed on an ongoing basis by the customer or in the worst case, a debtor in possession of bankruptcy or a subsequent purchaser. We analyze all of those factors in mitigation to get to our credit concern list. Our identified credit concern list amounts to about 5% of revenue, and about half of that is mitigated by credit support or underlying resale value of the capacity that the customers hold. And those numbers, that 5% and that half of 5%, include Peabody, the Peabody bankruptcy which we're now reflecting. So the going-forward number is less than that. We're reflecting Peabody, the Peabody bankruptcy, in our forecast update.
So in the segments, a few highlights. Looking at the first quarter 2016 to Q1 of 2015, the overall summary is this: on an earnings before DD&A and Certain Items basis, 3 of our 5 business units improve year-over-year. Gas was up 4%. Products Pipelines was up 17%. Terminals was up 2. Kinder Morgan Canada would have been up year-over-year, but for the effect of the weakening Canadian dollar; and CO2 was down 21% as a result of lower commodity prices and some lower production.
On Natural Gas Pipelines. We had very strong performance on TGP and the contributions from our Hiland midstream acquisition. So we split the Hiland acquisition between our midstream business units in gas and our Products Pipelines for the Double H pipeline. So contributions from really, really strong performance on TGP and the contribution from our Hiland midstream acquisition that we made in the first quarter of last year, and those 2 things more than offset weakness in our other midstream assets and in our Western pipelines. The Midstream weakness is largely gathering the processing in the Eagle Ford and on a year-over-year basis, gathering in the Haynesville.
In the West, year-over-year growth on our EPNG system was more than offset by weakness in Cheyenne Plains, WIC, CIG and Trans Colorado as the fundamentals for basis pipes out of the Rockies continues to degrade.
Natural gas needs for transportation and storage services, we believe, should grow over the medium and long-term as power generation exports, including LNG and exports to Mexico, and pet-chem and industrial demand continue to grow. 
Over the last 2 years, the gas group has entered into new and firm -- new and pending firm transport capacity commitments totaling 8.2 Bcf, and I think importantly, about 1.8 Bcf that was existing previously unsold capacity. And we currently estimate that we move about 38% of the natural gas consumed in the United States on our pipelines.
Moving to the Products segment. The 17% year-over-year growth in segment earnings was driven by growth in KMCC. That's our crude and condensate pipeline out of the Eagle Ford and the full quarter operation of the splitter, the first splitter in the Houston Ship Channel. We have both splitters up and running in the Houston Ship Channel. We also saw a good refined products transportation growth, 2.3% increase year-over-year. And while Eagle Ford volumes have declined over all, and we are projecting some decline on our assets as we look forward, we have seen the volumes grow on our KMCC pipeline as projects have come on, and we think that's due to the pipes' in a great position. It's serving a great part of that market. It has good upstream and downstream connectivity and good contracts. Now we think we've just started to see some flattening in that pipeline, but if you think about what's happening in the Eagle Ford overall, what we've done on this pipe is essentially dramatically grow our market share out of the basin on that pipe.
CO2. We saw earnings before DD&A decline 20% year-over-year to $223 million for the quarter. Production net to our interest was down 7%. And I will point out, SACROC was down, but Jesse, you can confirm this, but I think we had our highest quarter probably in the fourth quarter of 2014 at SACROC. And then our next highest was in the first quarter of 2015. So very strong quarter in 2015 that we're comparing to our 2016 performance.
The CO2 group has -- well, I'll also mention price. The weighted average realized price has declined about 18% year-over-year, and of course, that's a big part of the explanation for the downturn on a year-over-year basis. The CO2, on the bright side, the CO2 group has been very diligent in reducing costs and husbanding our capital to the very highest available return opportunities. And I will say, perhaps somewhat counterintuitively, third-party demand for CO2 under our arrangements with them has stayed strong. We're roughly flat year-over-year on CO2, notwithstanding the deterioration in commodity prices.
Moving to Terminals. Terminals was up 2% year-over-year. Growth in this business came from expansions and acquisitions, which slightly more than offset the weakness in our bulk business and that being driven primarily by bankruptcies of our coal customers. Most of our liquids terminal businesses and refined projects, and we've continued to see high utilization and generally good pricing on rollovers and renewals there. And we continue to have a very strong outlook for the great liquids terminals positions that we've built in the Houston Ship Channel and Edmonton.
Kinder Morgan Canada, the Trans Mountain expansion project. So again, this is under long-term contracts with customers. The 3-key areas of focus for us remain getting the NEB recommended order and the cabinet level Order In Council from the federal process; consultation and accommodation with First Nations; and thirdly, satisfaction of the B.C. government's 5 conditions. We're making progress on all 3. 
With respect to the NEB, we got our draft conditions last August. We believe that they're manageable but we did seek some important changes, particularly around the time required to approve certain portions of the build. We now have the outline of the further process to be conducted by the federal government during the Order In Council process, which is expected to result in a final order. They're -- they've scheduled the final order for December 20 of this year. 
We're making good progress in meeting the consultation and accommodation obligations we have with the First Nations, and we've added mutual benefit agreements that bring us to a number -- a majority of the bands that are most directly affected by the project actually supporting the project.
On the 5 conditions, we're still working on those. We are engaged actively with the B.C. government on those. The B.C. government is also going to be conducting an environmental review under their provincial process. We expect that both of those things will be concluded within the same time frame of the federal process, maybe not the same day, but within the same general time frame. And we have this project in the backlog and we are aiming for a 2019 completion, end of 2019 completion.
And that's it for the segment updates. With that, I'll turn it over to Kim."
34952431,331317848,960363,"Kinder Morgan, Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 20, 2016",2016-04-20,"Earnings Calls","Kinder Morgan, Inc.","Executives","Okay. Thanks, Steve. Today, we're declaring a dividend of $0.125 per share. That's consistent with our budget and the guidance we gave you in December of last year. But most importantly, we generated $954 million of DCF in excess of our dividend, which, a",1678,"Okay. Thanks, Steve. Today, we're declaring a dividend of $0.125 per share. That's consistent with our budget and the guidance we gave you in December of last year. But most importantly, we generated $954 million of DCF in excess of our dividend, which, as Steve and Rich pointed out, insulates us from the challenging capital markets and significantly enhances our credit profile.
Now let me explain what I mean when we say significantly enhances our credit profile. If you compare our coverage ratio, and that's DCF divided by the dividend, in the first quarter of last year, which was 1.2x versus the 4.4x in the first quarter of this year, we have significantly more retained cash flow, approximately $750 million, and therefore, we have no capital markets risk to getting equity raised. In addition, our previous funding policy was to fund our expansion CapEx, 50% equity and 50% debt. Now we're using 100% retained cash flow. And therefore, our balance metrics will improve more quickly than under our prior funding model.
Before we get to DCF, let me point out a couple of things on our GAAP income statement. You will see that revenues, net income available to common shareholders and earnings per share are down. As I say in many quarters, we do not believe that these measures, or changes in these measures, are necessarily a good predictor of our performance. We have some businesses where revenues and expenses fluctuate with commodity prices but margin generally does not. In addition, these numbers can be impacted by noncash, nonrecurring accounting issues or what we call, Certain Items. For example, if you look at revenues, revenues are down $402 million or 11%. However, if you strip out the Certain Items with the primary certain item impacting revenues, being the CO2 and the mark-to-market on our other hedges, revenues would be down $316 million. When you compare the $316 million to the $359 million reduction in cost of goods sold, gross margin is actually up. And again, that's largely because we have some businesses where both revenues and expenses fluctuate with commodity prices.
With respect to net income. If you strip out the Certain Items, and I'll go through those with you in a minute, net income before Certain Items was $446 million compared to $445 million for the same period in 2015 or essentially flat. EPS before Certain Items, and here when you do EPS, earnings is defined as net income to common shareholders, so after the payment of the preferred, EPS before Certain Items was $0.18 versus the $0.12 that you see on the page for the first quarter of 2016 compared to $0.20 in the first quarter of 2015. 
So while stripping out Certain Items from earnings does help, we still believe that the best indicator of our performance is the cash we generate, which we measure as distributable cash flow and distributable cash flow per share.
So let's turn to the second page of the financials, which I believe will give you a clear picture of our performance. We generated total DCF for the quarter of $1.233 billion versus the $1.242 billion for the comparable period in 2015. Therefore, total DCF was down approximately $9 million. So essentially flat between the 2 periods. The segments were up by $28 million, as Steve mentioned, or 1% with the increases in natural gas and products, which combined for an increase of $85 million, slightly offsetting the $58 million reduction in CO2, which was driven largely by lower crude price. The $28 million increase in the segment was offset by a $39 million increase in our preferred stock dividends. If you remember, we issued a preferred stock in the fourth quarter of last year. Now there are other moving parts but if you take the $28 million from the segments, offset by the $39 million, that gets you a decrease of $11 million versus the decrease in DCF that I mentioned of $9 million. So that gets you almost all of the change.
DCF per share in the quarter was $0.55 versus $0.58 for the first quarter of last year. DCF per share was down slightly due to the additional shares we issued during 2015 to finance our growth projects and maintain our balance sheet. Therefore, despite an almost 30% decline in commodity prices versus the first quarter of last year, our performance was relatively flat, and we believe that this demonstrates the resiliency of our cash flows generated by a large diversified platform of primarily fee-based assets.
There are a couple of Certain Items in the quarter that I want to highlight for you. Certain Items in the quarter totaled $235 million loss on a pretax basis but $132 million loss on an after-tax basis. $170 million of the pre-tax loss was driven by the write off of costs associated with the NED market and the Palmetto Projects, which, as Steve mentioned, have also been removed from the backlog. $85 million was associated with losses on asset disposals and impairments in 4 of our business segments, with the most significant items being in CO2 and Terminal. In CO2, it was primarily associated with the write-off of the CO2 recapture plant due to the lack of expected volumes. And in Terminals, it was due to lost business at 3 of our bulk terminals. We also -- there's a certain tax benefit of $103 million, and that's primarily just the tax impact of the Certain Items at approximately 35%.
As Steve mentioned in his comments, we currently expect EBITDA for the year to be approximately 3% below our budget and DCF to be approximately 4% below. Now for the first quarter, we did better than that with EBITDA about 2% below our budget and DCF about 1% below our budget. But we believe our outlook is consistent with the current environment and producer decisions, and we are not assuming any improvement.
Now let me give you a little more granularity on expected segment performance for the full year versus our budget. We expect Natural Gas Pipelines to come in approximately 2% below its budget, primarily as a result of lower volumes, mainly in the Eagle Ford. The other factor impacting our Natural Gas for the full year is the delay on our EEC SNG pipeline expansion project as a result of the FERC certificate being about 3 months later than we anticipated. 
CO2 is expected to end the year on its budget. We expect prices to be essentially in line with our $38 per barrel in our budget and cost savings to offset any weakness in oil production or CO2 volumes.
We expect Terminals to end the year approximately 4% below its budget, primarily due to the impact of the Peabody bankruptcy. We currently expect Products to be about 6% below its budget primarily due to lower crude and condensate volumes on KMCC, Double H and Double Eagle. Right now, we are projecting KMC to be slightly below its budget for the full year due to higher book taxes. But remember the book taxes, while they impact the segment, have no impact on EBITDA or DCF.
With respect to interest, cash taxes, G&A and sustaining CapEx, on a combined basis, those items are expected to come in slightly positive to budget, or said another way, generate a favorable variance with the positive interest in sustaining CapEx more than offsetting the negatives on G&A and cash taxes. The negative variance on G&A is driven by lower capitalized overhead as a result of the lower expansion capital that Steve mentioned and interest expense expected to be lower than budget due to lower LIBOR rates.
And with that, I'll move to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with debt of $41.555 billion, and EBITDA for the trailing 12 months was about $7.4 billion, which results in a debt-to-EBITDA of about 5.6x, consistent with where we ended the year last year. And as Steve mentioned, we still expect to end 2016 at 5.5x consistent with our budget. Debt was up in the quarter, an increase in debt of about $330 million since the end of last year. So let me reconcile that for you.
We've generated DCF in the quarter, as I mentioned a minute ago, of $1.233 billion. We spent about $700 million in CapEx. We spent about $245 million roughly on acquisitions, with almost all of that being associated with the BP acquisition, and we contributed about $44 million to equity investments. So about $900 million -- a little -- $990 million roughly attributable to our expansion CapEx program.
We paid dividends of $279 million and then there were working capital and other items that weren't used at roughly $300 million. When you look at the use of working capital, about -- over $150 million of that was associated with accrued interest. And when I give you the DCF figure of $1.233 million, that has 3 months of accrued interest in it but we make interest payments twice a year. We make them primarily in the first quarter and the third quarter. And so we make cash interest payments in the first quarter attributable to 6 months. So you have a working capital use associated with that incremental 6 months of cash going out the door, which is different from the 3 months of accrual within DCF.
The other working capital use in the quarter was primarily associated with property tax, and there's probably about $100 million associated with that. Again, we have about 3 months of property tax accrual in the quarter. By the time you get to the end of the year, you have 12 months of accrual but a lot of our property tax payments are made for the full year in January. And therefore, relative to DCF, you have a working capital use in the quarter. In future quarters, you'll have a working capital source. And that gets you to about the $330 million increase in debt.
And so with that, I'll turn it back to Rich."

I mean, I'll start with the 2 big pieces, and then Kim has some additional detail.

I mean, I'll start with the 2 big pieces, and then Kim has some additional detail. But as I said, about -- just a little under half of it, a little under 50% of the reduction is attributable to lower Eagle Ford volumes than what we had in the plan. So I talked about volumes been up year-over-year but versus what we had in the plan, we had lower Eagle Ford volumes. And that impact -- that's trying to sum up everything. So that is on our Eagle Ford gathering system itself, on our DK Heather line and the processing facility. It's also volumes that we're entering into our Texas intrastate system that we expected to be able to move on that system and collect transport fees. So it's kind of from end to end almost on the Eagle Ford volumes through our Texas assets. 
The other place where we have exposure to the Eagle Ford volumes is in our projects pipelines, where we have the KMCC pipeline and the splitter. And we've expected the splitter in our plan to run a little bit above its contract minimums. We have good contracts with good protection there. It's running-- we're expecting it to kind of just to run at the minimum, which are pretty good. I mean, it's a pretty high percentage of the capacity of the facility but we had budgeted a little bit more there. And KMCC, we expect we're now going to start to see some volume metric decline on that. Again, that's all versus plan. So that's a little -- if you just say -- and look, there are a lots of different ways to rack up these numbers, but that's -- those factors, the Eagle Ford volumes, as they impact 2 of our business units, amount to about half, a little less than half of the adjustment. The other -- another 20% is attributable to the coal company bankruptcy. So those are the 2 very big pieces."

So on the first point, and I want to separate that a little bit from the high-grading discussion because, look, we gave it our all on NED. I mean, we pursued customers hard. We pursued approvals hard. In the end, the customer commitments just weren't there. Now that makes the project uneconomic not surprisingly, and that's why I wanted to specify the returns for you. It's apparent. It's objectively apparent that the project is not economically a viable project at that customer sign-up level. And so we said at the conference, we're going to make a big push in the first quarter to try to get customer commitments in and sell down some of the equity to customers. Not a lot of takers at that return as you might expect, and so we put on a hard push to try to get done and it's just not forthcoming. We had one significant perspective customer who's determined to put their volume some place else, and that was a significant negative for the project. 
So that's how we got to that decision in the time that we're talking about now, but I want to go back and underscore again, from an investor standpoint, in light of that return, we are a lot better off with that $3.1 billion back in our pockets and being put to some other use. The project wasn't going to produce the return that would be required to make it viable because, again, the contracts weren't there. We're better off having that money back. I think if you look through the rest of the backlog, my guess is we'll find some bits and pieces here and there that will either -- we'll save some money on or we may change the timing of a little bit. Still think those are high probability projects, though, and ones that we want to build out and do, and they contribute to our DCF per share growth that we're aiming to achieve by building it out."

We were fighting to get NED under contract and didn't get there. Trans Mountain has the contracts in place. 20-year contracts for 93% of the volume and the other 7% is on a 15 year contract. So long-term contracts and look, the overall picture, I mean, it's -- the overall picture in Canada is notwithstanding very, very difficult netbacks up there, right? They're taking a very long view. The producers are taking a long view and they're finishing out projects that they're well into and the oil sands become a very stable source of production. It's not like the shales, where it ramps, you get a high ramp up in the beginning and then it falls off rapidly. So there's an actual projection of-- an increase in production in Canada at the same time, that the transport options outside of Canada are becoming more limited. So our customers still want to do this project and we do, too, and the returns are good. 
Switching to the, I guess, public opinion or the governmental outlook. I would say just very broadly that the tone of the comments in the public arena up there are improving. I think that there is a recognition that getting Canadian natural resources to points where they can be exported and no longer dependent upon solely the U.S. market is a good thing across Canada. And that's starting to show up as people are being constructive about, okay, we need to approve projects. We want to approve them with -- we want to have the right conditions in the right process around that approval but if -- there's been a switch, I think, toward a momentum, toward getting the project approved. Now I'll say that with an important caveat. We don't know what their conditions or ultimately going to be in the end, and we'll have to make an assessment of that when it's all in. We certainly have a good handle on what the NED proposed conditions are going to look like but we don't know what if any other conditions may be imposed. So we're going o have to watch for that may be very carefully. But we've had good returns, good underlying customer support, contractual support, and improving tone, I think, in the public sector debate."

We don't have an update on the $6.8 billion [ph] because we're still evaluating what we think the projects are going to cost us, and it will be a bit dependent upon the conditions. I think a couple things. One is that there is some cost pressure. The Canadian dollar has weakened relative to the U.S. dollar. A lot of the goods and services are provided in U.S.-dollar terms. So there's been some pressure there. There have been some conditions that we've agreed to and that have been added over time, which has put some pressure on. But I think in the -- at the end of the day, what matters is do the customers want the project? And we still have very strong interest from our shippers in the project, and we even have interest from shippers who are not currently customers -- potential customers who are not currently shippers on the project. So we talk about this all the time, but I think this is still a project that our customers want."

Thank you, Sean, and welcome to the KMI first quarter investor call.
Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that today's earnings release and this call include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Act -- Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 as well as certain non-GAAP financial measures. We encourage you to read our full disclosure on forward-looking statements and use of non-GAAP financial measures set forth at the end of our earnings release as well as review our latest filings with the SEC for a list of risk factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those in such forward-looking statements.
I'll start the call, and before I turn it over to our CEO, Steve Kean, and our CFO, Kim Dang, I'd like to give you a quick overview of our strategy at KMI. The first point I would make is that this quarter's results again demonstrate that we remain a strong generator of cash even in these chaotic times for the energy sector. 
Second, as we've said previously and at our meeting in January, we do not anticipate any requirement to access the equity markets for the foreseeable future. We also do not see any requirement to access the debt markets for the foreseeable future, except for rollovers in years subsequent to 2016. We've again reduced our expansion CapEx. Steve will take you through that for 2016, and we expect that trend to continue in subsequent years through both high grading our projects and entering into selective joint ventures. 
We expect to fund the necessary CapEx out of our cash flow and continue to improve our debt-to-EBITDA ratio, thereby preserving and strengthening our investment-grade balance sheet. As our cash flow achieves those objectives, funding our CapEx and strengthening our balance sheet, we will obviously have excess cash which we will then use to either raise our dividend, purchase our shares, offer new projects and/or acquisitions but only if they are solidly accretive to our distributable cash flow per share.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Steve."

I'm going to hit on 3 topics before giving you some segment highlights for the quarter. First, an update to our capital projects and our expected growth spend for 2016, an update on our outlook for the balance of 2016 and some thoughts",2525,"Okay. Thanks, Rich. I'm going to hit on 3 topics before giving you some segment highlights for the quarter. First, an update to our capital projects and our expected growth spend for 2016, an update on our outlook for the balance of 2016 and some thoughts on our counterparty credit risk.
With respect to the capital update, we announced today a reduction in our project backlog of $4.1 billion. So from $18.2 billion down to $14.1 billion. The 2 biggest adjustments are the removal of Palmetto Pipeline Project, which is a reduction of $550 million, and the market portion of the NED project, which is a reduction of $3.1 billion. 
With respect to NED, we worked very hard. This is our Northeast Direct project serving -- that would have served New England markets. We worked very hard to get customer commitments on the project and while many of our LDC customers did sign up, we did not receive enough contractual commitments from electric customers to make the project viable. So we will fulfill our obligation to consult with our customers over the next 30 days or so, but this project is not economic so we're removing it from the backlog. 
In both cases, NED and Palmetto, based on all the facts, we believe this is the right outcome for our investors. To be specific, the return on the NED Project, at the level of commitments that we have, would be less than 6% unlevered after-tax. That's clearly not viable, and we are far better off having that cash available for other uses, whether that's continued and even accelerated delevering, other investment opportunities or returning value to shareholders. We value our New England customers and continue to believe, along with many others, that additional capacity is needed in the region but we'll have to look for other ways to serve some part of those needs.  We didn't get there on this one, and the action we're taking is undeniably the right call for our investors. We previously wrote off, I'll remind you, our NED supply project, and we never had that one in the backlog.
On the Palmetto Pipeline. Essentially, the Georgia legislature prevented us from getting imminent domain and also prevented us from getting other state permits. We were making good progress with land acquisition even without imminent domain, but we needed other permits, which Georgia has now put a moratorium on, we needed environmental permits, for example, which they've now put a moratorium on until mid-2017. So as a result, we are not moving forward with Palmetto. We had some other small adjustments to the backlog, including putting about $160 million for the projects in service during the quarter. We had some cost changes, which netted to a reduction of $254 million in the overall backlog, and we had some other scope additions and removals, which essentially offset each other.
So looking at the bigger picture on our capital projects spend, we continue to high-grade our capital investments to ensure that we're securing our investment-grade credit metrics and maximizing the returns we get for the capital that we do deploy. We're aiming to reduce spend, improve returns and selectively joint venture projects where that makes sense. We reduced our expected 2016 spend by an additional $400 million to $2.9 billion. So that compares to the $3.3 billion that we projected in January for 2016, which, in turn was $900 million down from the $4.2 billion that we projected in our preliminary 2016 guidance, which we set out last December. So we continue to work through our backlog and high-grade where we're spending our capital.
With respect to joint ventures. As we discussed at the January conference, we'd be pursuing these where they made sense. That is where we could share the capital spending obligation on a particular project with a third-party, get paid a reasonable value for having originated the opportunity, et cetera. Those processes are competitive and confidential so we're only going to be able to give you limited details but the summary is that the process is going well and we currently expect to achieve results -- the results that we built into our plan. 
We're also taking care to not be dependent on any one transaction. These processes can be unpredictable, and we will be in a position to back away from a given transaction if acceptable value does not materialize.
Overall, as we complete projects and further high-grade the backlog, as Rich mentioned, we will free up cash that we can use to reduce debt, return cash to investors in the form of buybacks and dividends or invest in attractive projects or acquisitions, or some combination of those.
Now for the 2016 outlook update. We have looked at the potential impacts for the remainder of 2016 due to continued weakness in the sector. We now estimate on a full year basis for 2016, a negative impact of about 3% to the EBITDA that we showed in January, but because of our ongoing efforts to high-grade our capital spend and to pursue the joint ventures where it makes sense, we expect to meet our investment-grade credit metrics, notwithstanding the 3% reduction. That 3% EBITDA reduction translates into a 4% reduction in DCF. 
Yes, as the year goes on, we will try to mitigate that negative but we are not assuming in this outlook any dramatic turnaround for our producer customers by the end of the year as some analysts have predicted.
Now we're not happy about any negative to plan, but I think when you put this in the context of a dramatic production declines, particularly in the Eagle Ford, which is down 28% on oil from its peak and 15% on gas and credit weaknesses, our business is really diversified and insulated from the full brunt of the weakness in the producing sector.
So here are the 2 main contributors. A little under half of the deterioration is attributable to lower Eagle Ford volumes, and those flow through both our midstream group in the gas business unit and also in our products group. And again, what -- this is all comparing to our original outlook. So this is not a year-over-year look. This is a -- versus our January outlook that we presented at the conference. So a little under half attributable to the Eagle Ford. Another 20% is attributable to the coal customer bankruptcies. So there is -- there are a lot of other pieces and Kim will take you through some additional details, but those are the 2 big chunks contributing to the degradation of the forecast.
So while the current year outlook for North American energy production is experiencing weakness, we're still bullish on the longer-term. We believe that we'll continue to see more of our North American energy needs met by North American energy production that will grow our exports. We've already been growing refined products, natural gas to Mexico. I think we'll continue to see growth in natural gas and natural gas liquids exports. And those long-term trends are good for North American energy midstream companies like Kinder Morgan.
Okay, the third general topic is counterparty credit. We've been monitoring counterparty credit very closely. But beyond monitoring, we've been taking action. We've been calling on collateral, putting other credit support arrangements in place. A few points about our particular circumstances. Given our diverse business mix, we've got a very broad and diverse customer base. We've got producer customers, of course, but we also have integrated energy companies, gas and electric utilities and industrial users of our services. We're not exposed to any single sector, commodity or service. That diversifies our exposure, which reduces our risk. 
Our Top 25 customers constitute 44% of our revenue and of that revenue, 85% is investment-grade. Of our total revenue, about 75% is investment-grade or has substantial credit support and 86% is rated B or better. In our business, real exposure is more complicated than simply looking at our customers' ratings. In many cases, the rights our customers hold are valuable to third parties or essential to the revenue-generating activities of those customers and therefore, will be needed on an ongoing basis by the customer or in the worst case, a debtor in possession of bankruptcy or a subsequent purchaser. We analyze all of those factors in mitigation to get to our credit concern list. Our identified credit concern list amounts to about 5% of revenue, and about half of that is mitigated by credit support or underlying resale value of the capacity that the customers hold. And those numbers, that 5% and that half of 5%, include Peabody, the Peabody bankruptcy which we're now reflecting. So the going-forward number is less than that. We're reflecting Peabody, the Peabody bankruptcy, in our forecast update.
So in the segments, a few highlights. Looking at the first quarter 2016 to Q1 of 2015, the overall summary is this: on an earnings before DD&A and Certain Items basis, 3 of our 5 business units improve year-over-year. Gas was up 4%. Products Pipelines was up 17%. Terminals was up 2. Kinder Morgan Canada would have been up year-over-year, but for the effect of the weakening Canadian dollar; and CO2 was down 21% as a result of lower commodity prices and some lower production.
On Natural Gas Pipelines. We had very strong performance on TGP and the contributions from our Hiland midstream acquisition. So we split the Hiland acquisition between our midstream business units in gas and our Products Pipelines for the Double H pipeline. So contributions from really, really strong performance on TGP and the contribution from our Hiland midstream acquisition that we made in the first quarter of last year, and those 2 things more than offset weakness in our other midstream assets and in our Western pipelines. The Midstream weakness is largely gathering the processing in the Eagle Ford and on a year-over-year basis, gathering in the Haynesville.
In the West, year-over-year growth on our EPNG system was more than offset by weakness in Cheyenne Plains, WIC, CIG and Trans Colorado as the fundamentals for basis pipes out of the Rockies continues to degrade.
Natural gas needs for transportation and storage services, we believe, should grow over the medium and long-term as power generation exports, including LNG and exports to Mexico, and pet-chem and industrial demand continue to grow. 
Over the last 2 years, the gas group has entered into new and firm -- new and pending firm transport capacity commitments totaling 8.2 Bcf, and I think importantly, about 1.8 Bcf that was existing previously unsold capacity. And we currently estimate that we move about 38% of the natural gas consumed in the United States on our pipelines.
Moving to the Products segment. The 17% year-over-year growth in segment earnings was driven by growth in KMCC. That's our crude and condensate pipeline out of the Eagle Ford and the full quarter operation of the splitter, the first splitter in the Houston Ship Channel. We have both splitters up and running in the Houston Ship Channel. We also saw a good refined products transportation growth, 2.3% increase year-over-year. And while Eagle Ford volumes have declined over all, and we are projecting some decline on our assets as we look forward, we have seen the volumes grow on our KMCC pipeline as projects have come on, and we think that's due to the pipes' in a great position. It's serving a great part of that market. It has good upstream and downstream connectivity and good contracts. Now we think we've just started to see some flattening in that pipeline, but if you think about what's happening in the Eagle Ford overall, what we've done on this pipe is essentially dramatically grow our market share out of the basin on that pipe.
CO2. We saw earnings before DD&A decline 20% year-over-year to $223 million for the quarter. Production net to our interest was down 7%. And I will point out, SACROC was down, but Jesse, you can confirm this, but I think we had our highest quarter probably in the fourth quarter of 2014 at SACROC. And then our next highest was in the first quarter of 2015. So very strong quarter in 2015 that we're comparing to our 2016 performance.
The CO2 group has -- well, I'll also mention price. The weighted average realized price has declined about 18% year-over-year, and of course, that's a big part of the explanation for the downturn on a year-over-year basis. The CO2, on the bright side, the CO2 group has been very diligent in reducing costs and husbanding our capital to the very highest available return opportunities. And I will say, perhaps somewhat counterintuitively, third-party demand for CO2 under our arrangements with them has stayed strong. We're roughly flat year-over-year on CO2, notwithstanding the deterioration in commodity prices.
Moving to Terminals. Terminals was up 2% year-over-year. Growth in this business came from expansions and acquisitions, which slightly more than offset the weakness in our bulk business and that being driven primarily by bankruptcies of our coal customers. Most of our liquids terminal businesses and refined projects, and we've continued to see high utilization and generally good pricing on rollovers and renewals there. And we continue to have a very strong outlook for the great liquids terminals positions that we've built in the Houston Ship Channel and Edmonton.
Kinder Morgan Canada, the Trans Mountain expansion project. So again, this is under long-term contracts with customers. The 3-key areas of focus for us remain getting the NEB recommended order and the cabinet level Order In Council from the federal process; consultation and accommodation with First Nations; and thirdly, satisfaction of the B.C. government's 5 conditions. We're making progress on all 3. 
With respect to the NEB, we got our draft conditions last August. We believe that they're manageable but we did seek some important changes, particularly around the time required to approve certain portions of the build. We now have the outline of the further process to be conducted by the federal government during the Order In Council process, which is expected to result in a final order. They're -- they've scheduled the final order for December 20 of this year. 
We're making good progress in meeting the consultation and accommodation obligations we have with the First Nations, and we've added mutual benefit agreements that bring us to a number -- a majority of the bands that are most directly affected by the project actually supporting the project.
On the 5 conditions, we're still working on those. We are engaged actively with the B.C. government on those. The B.C. government is also going to be conducting an environmental review under their provincial process. We expect that both of those things will be concluded within the same time frame of the federal process, maybe not the same day, but within the same general time frame. And we have this project in the backlog and we are aiming for a 2019 completion, end of 2019 completion.
And that's it for the segment updates. With that, I'll turn it over to Kim."
34952431,331317848,961528,"Kinder Morgan, Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 20, 2016",2016-04-20,"Earnings Calls","Kinder Morgan, Inc.","Executives","Okay. Thanks, Steve. Today, we're declaring a dividend of $0.125 per share. That's consistent with our budget and the guidance we gave you in December of last year. But most importantly, we generated $954 million of DCF in excess of our dividend, which, a",1678,"Okay. Thanks, Steve. Today, we're declaring a dividend of $0.125 per share. That's consistent with our budget and the guidance we gave you in December of last year. But most importantly, we generated $954 million of DCF in excess of our dividend, which, as Steve and Rich pointed out, insulates us from the challenging capital markets and significantly enhances our credit profile.
Now let me explain what I mean when we say significantly enhances our credit profile. If you compare our coverage ratio, and that's DCF divided by the dividend, in the first quarter of last year, which was 1.2x versus the 4.4x in the first quarter of this year, we have significantly more retained cash flow, approximately $750 million, and therefore, we have no capital markets risk to getting equity raised. In addition, our previous funding policy was to fund our expansion CapEx, 50% equity and 50% debt. Now we're using 100% retained cash flow. And therefore, our balance metrics will improve more quickly than under our prior funding model.
Before we get to DCF, let me point out a couple of things on our GAAP income statement. You will see that revenues, net income available to common shareholders and earnings per share are down. As I say in many quarters, we do not believe that these measures, or changes in these measures, are necessarily a good predictor of our performance. We have some businesses where revenues and expenses fluctuate with commodity prices but margin generally does not. In addition, these numbers can be impacted by noncash, nonrecurring accounting issues or what we call, Certain Items. For example, if you look at revenues, revenues are down $402 million or 11%. However, if you strip out the Certain Items with the primary certain item impacting revenues, being the CO2 and the mark-to-market on our other hedges, revenues would be down $316 million. When you compare the $316 million to the $359 million reduction in cost of goods sold, gross margin is actually up. And again, that's largely because we have some businesses where both revenues and expenses fluctuate with commodity prices.
With respect to net income. If you strip out the Certain Items, and I'll go through those with you in a minute, net income before Certain Items was $446 million compared to $445 million for the same period in 2015 or essentially flat. EPS before Certain Items, and here when you do EPS, earnings is defined as net income to common shareholders, so after the payment of the preferred, EPS before Certain Items was $0.18 versus the $0.12 that you see on the page for the first quarter of 2016 compared to $0.20 in the first quarter of 2015. 
So while stripping out Certain Items from earnings does help, we still believe that the best indicator of our performance is the cash we generate, which we measure as distributable cash flow and distributable cash flow per share.
So let's turn to the second page of the financials, which I believe will give you a clear picture of our performance. We generated total DCF for the quarter of $1.233 billion versus the $1.242 billion for the comparable period in 2015. Therefore, total DCF was down approximately $9 million. So essentially flat between the 2 periods. The segments were up by $28 million, as Steve mentioned, or 1% with the increases in natural gas and products, which combined for an increase of $85 million, slightly offsetting the $58 million reduction in CO2, which was driven largely by lower crude price. The $28 million increase in the segment was offset by a $39 million increase in our preferred stock dividends. If you remember, we issued a preferred stock in the fourth quarter of last year. Now there are other moving parts but if you take the $28 million from the segments, offset by the $39 million, that gets you a decrease of $11 million versus the decrease in DCF that I mentioned of $9 million. So that gets you almost all of the change.
DCF per share in the quarter was $0.55 versus $0.58 for the first quarter of last year. DCF per share was down slightly due to the additional shares we issued during 2015 to finance our growth projects and maintain our balance sheet. Therefore, despite an almost 30% decline in commodity prices versus the first quarter of last year, our performance was relatively flat, and we believe that this demonstrates the resiliency of our cash flows generated by a large diversified platform of primarily fee-based assets.
There are a couple of Certain Items in the quarter that I want to highlight for you. Certain Items in the quarter totaled $235 million loss on a pretax basis but $132 million loss on an after-tax basis. $170 million of the pre-tax loss was driven by the write off of costs associated with the NED market and the Palmetto Projects, which, as Steve mentioned, have also been removed from the backlog. $85 million was associated with losses on asset disposals and impairments in 4 of our business segments, with the most significant items being in CO2 and Terminal. In CO2, it was primarily associated with the write-off of the CO2 recapture plant due to the lack of expected volumes. And in Terminals, it was due to lost business at 3 of our bulk terminals. We also -- there's a certain tax benefit of $103 million, and that's primarily just the tax impact of the Certain Items at approximately 35%.
As Steve mentioned in his comments, we currently expect EBITDA for the year to be approximately 3% below our budget and DCF to be approximately 4% below. Now for the first quarter, we did better than that with EBITDA about 2% below our budget and DCF about 1% below our budget. But we believe our outlook is consistent with the current environment and producer decisions, and we are not assuming any improvement.
Now let me give you a little more granularity on expected segment performance for the full year versus our budget. We expect Natural Gas Pipelines to come in approximately 2% below its budget, primarily as a result of lower volumes, mainly in the Eagle Ford. The other factor impacting our Natural Gas for the full year is the delay on our EEC SNG pipeline expansion project as a result of the FERC certificate being about 3 months later than we anticipated. 
CO2 is expected to end the year on its budget. We expect prices to be essentially in line with our $38 per barrel in our budget and cost savings to offset any weakness in oil production or CO2 volumes.
We expect Terminals to end the year approximately 4% below its budget, primarily due to the impact of the Peabody bankruptcy. We currently expect Products to be about 6% below its budget primarily due to lower crude and condensate volumes on KMCC, Double H and Double Eagle. Right now, we are projecting KMC to be slightly below its budget for the full year due to higher book taxes. But remember the book taxes, while they impact the segment, have no impact on EBITDA or DCF.
With respect to interest, cash taxes, G&A and sustaining CapEx, on a combined basis, those items are expected to come in slightly positive to budget, or said another way, generate a favorable variance with the positive interest in sustaining CapEx more than offsetting the negatives on G&A and cash taxes. The negative variance on G&A is driven by lower capitalized overhead as a result of the lower expansion capital that Steve mentioned and interest expense expected to be lower than budget due to lower LIBOR rates.
And with that, I'll move to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with debt of $41.555 billion, and EBITDA for the trailing 12 months was about $7.4 billion, which results in a debt-to-EBITDA of about 5.6x, consistent with where we ended the year last year. And as Steve mentioned, we still expect to end 2016 at 5.5x consistent with our budget. Debt was up in the quarter, an increase in debt of about $330 million since the end of last year. So let me reconcile that for you.
We've generated DCF in the quarter, as I mentioned a minute ago, of $1.233 billion. We spent about $700 million in CapEx. We spent about $245 million roughly on acquisitions, with almost all of that being associated with the BP acquisition, and we contributed about $44 million to equity investments. So about $900 million -- a little -- $990 million roughly attributable to our expansion CapEx program.
We paid dividends of $279 million and then there were working capital and other items that weren't used at roughly $300 million. When you look at the use of working capital, about -- over $150 million of that was associated with accrued interest. And when I give you the DCF figure of $1.233 million, that has 3 months of accrued interest in it but we make interest payments twice a year. We make them primarily in the first quarter and the third quarter. And so we make cash interest payments in the first quarter attributable to 6 months. So you have a working capital use associated with that incremental 6 months of cash going out the door, which is different from the 3 months of accrual within DCF.
The other working capital use in the quarter was primarily associated with property tax, and there's probably about $100 million associated with that. Again, we have about 3 months of property tax accrual in the quarter. By the time you get to the end of the year, you have 12 months of accrual but a lot of our property tax payments are made for the full year in January. And therefore, relative to DCF, you have a working capital use in the quarter. In future quarters, you'll have a working capital source. And that gets you to about the $330 million increase in debt.
And so with that, I'll turn it back to Rich."

I mean, I'll start with the 2 big pieces, and then Kim has some additional detail.

I mean, I'll start with the 2 big pieces, and then Kim has some additional detail. But as I said, about -- just a little under half of it, a little under 50% of the reduction is attributable to lower Eagle Ford volumes than what we had in the plan. So I talked about volumes been up year-over-year but versus what we had in the plan, we had lower Eagle Ford volumes. And that impact -- that's trying to sum up everything. So that is on our Eagle Ford gathering system itself, on our DK Heather line and the processing facility. It's also volumes that we're entering into our Texas intrastate system that we expected to be able to move on that system and collect transport fees. So it's kind of from end to end almost on the Eagle Ford volumes through our Texas assets. 
The other place where we have exposure to the Eagle Ford volumes is in our projects pipelines, where we have the KMCC pipeline and the splitter. And we've expected the splitter in our plan to run a little bit above its contract minimums. We have good contracts with good protection there. It's running-- we're expecting it to kind of just to run at the minimum, which are pretty good. I mean, it's a pretty high percentage of the capacity of the facility but we had budgeted a little bit more there. And KMCC, we expect we're now going to start to see some volume metric decline on that. Again, that's all versus plan. So that's a little -- if you just say -- and look, there are a lots of different ways to rack up these numbers, but that's -- those factors, the Eagle Ford volumes, as they impact 2 of our business units, amount to about half, a little less than half of the adjustment. The other -- another 20% is attributable to the coal company bankruptcy. So those are the 2 very big pieces."

So on the first point, and I want to separate that a little bit from the high-grading discussion because, look, we gave it our all on NED. I mean, we pursued customers hard. We pursued approvals hard. In the end, the customer commitments just weren't there. Now that makes the project uneconomic not surprisingly, and that's why I wanted to specify the returns for you. It's apparent. It's objectively apparent that the project is not economically a viable project at that customer sign-up level. And so we said at the conference, we're going to make a big push in the first quarter to try to get customer commitments in and sell down some of the equity to customers. Not a lot of takers at that return as you might expect, and so we put on a hard push to try to get done and it's just not forthcoming. We had one significant perspective customer who's determined to put their volume some place else, and that was a significant negative for the project. 
So that's how we got to that decision in the time that we're talking about now, but I want to go back and underscore again, from an investor standpoint, in light of that return, we are a lot better off with that $3.1 billion back in our pockets and being put to some other use. The project wasn't going to produce the return that would be required to make it viable because, again, the contracts weren't there. We're better off having that money back. I think if you look through the rest of the backlog, my guess is we'll find some bits and pieces here and there that will either -- we'll save some money on or we may change the timing of a little bit. Still think those are high probability projects, though, and ones that we want to build out and do, and they contribute to our DCF per share growth that we're aiming to achieve by building it out."

I mean, obviously, you took an ED out because of returns issue. At this stage right now, is Trans Mountain at risk for the same thing regardless of what happens on the approval process? Are the returns that you expect at your latest update, does it look -- is it close to your return hurdles or well-above your return hurdle? And I was wondering if you could comment about some of the comments that the Canadian government made last week with respect specifically to guidelines. Do you view that as a positive? Or do you just sort of continue your focus as is?"

We were fighting to get NED under contract and didn't get there. Trans Mountain has the contracts in place. 20-year contracts for 93% of the volume and the other 7% is on a 15 year contract. So long-term contracts and look, the overall picture, I mean, it's -- the overall picture in Canada is notwithstanding very, very difficult netbacks up there, right? They're taking a very long view. The producers are taking a long view and they're finishing out projects that they're well into and the oil sands become a very stable source of production. It's not like the shales, where it ramps, you get a high ramp up in the beginning and then it falls off rapidly. So there's an actual projection of-- an increase in production in Canada at the same time, that the transport options outside of Canada are becoming more limited. So our customers still want to do this project and we do, too, and the returns are good. 
Switching to the, I guess, public opinion or the governmental outlook. I would say just very broadly that the tone of the comments in the public arena up there are improving. I think that there is a recognition that getting Canadian natural resources to points where they can be exported and no longer dependent upon solely the U.S. market is a good thing across Canada. And that's starting to show up as people are being constructive about, okay, we need to approve projects. We want to approve them with -- we want to have the right conditions in the right process around that approval but if -- there's been a switch, I think, toward a momentum, toward getting the project approved. Now I'll say that with an important caveat. We don't know what their conditions or ultimately going to be in the end, and we'll have to make an assessment of that when it's all in. We certainly have a good handle on what the NED proposed conditions are going to look like but we don't know what if any other conditions may be imposed. So we're going to have to watch for that may be very carefully. But we've had good returns, good underlying customer support, contractual support, and improving tone, I think, in the public sector debate."

And at that time, we'll just look at all the factors and see what makes sense. I think it's an enviable position to be in. I feel that way as the largest shareholder. And we'll look at it. If it makes the most sense to buy back shares at that time, we'll buy them back. I can tell you if the price is where it is today, at $19, we would buy it back. But we'll see where the price is and see what the market looks like and whether we benefit our shareholders in a better way by buying back their shares or by raising the dividend.

Now other customers do approach us in the gas group occasionally on contract restructurings. So far, we haven't had to do anything that we didn't want to do, meaning finding something that had mutual benefit, finding incremental revenues that we could -- I'm sorry, incremental volumes that we could put on.

We actually approved a project today that had a 43% return. These are small. The capital program on CO2 is now just a little over $200 million, but we continue to approve small program spends in the CO2 group. And I think that the easiest way to think about it, Becca, is where we've got an existing flood that's up and running. And so what we're doing is using shared facilities, maybe adding an injector, converting a current producing well to an injector, drilling a new producing well. If we've got all the other facilities, all the central facilities in place, the incremental -- the return on the incremental capital spend that we make is still attractive. Now if you're talking about a brand-new CO2 flood and getting one of those started, that's a ways off.

So there's been some pressure there. There have been some conditions that we've agreed to and that have been added over time, which has put some pressure on.

As always, before we begin, I'd like to remind you that today's earnings release and this call include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as well as certain non-GAAP financial measures. We encourage you to read our full disclosure on forward-looking statements and use of non-GAAP financial measures set forth at the end of our earnings release as well as review our latest filings with the SEC for a list of risk factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those in such forward-looking statements. 
Let me begin by just making very few introductory comments before turning the call over to our CEO, Steve Kean, and our CFO, Kim Dang. First of all, the operating results for both the second quarter and year-to-date are very consistent with Kim's guidance, which she shared with you on our Q1 call and which were in our Q1 earnings release. And I think this demonstrates once more that our assets are consistent generators of strong cash flow even in these times of volatility. 
Several specific events have happened since our last call, mostly positive. First of all, the National Energy Board of Canada recommended approval of our Trans Mountain expansion project. This is an important step. But we still need an Order in Council and that decision is expected in December of this year. 
We also entered into joint ventures. As you know, with Southern Company, on our SNG natural gas system and with Riverstone on our UTOPIA Pipeline Project. And have also divested an additional approximate $175 million of non-core assets. These steps allow us to significantly improve our balance sheet with the expectation of now ending this year, 2016, at about 5.3x debt-to-EBITDA, which is an improvement from the 5.5x budget. In addition, we're also reducing our future need for expansion CapEx and all of this is getting us measurably closer to being able to return significant additional cash to our shareholders through either increasing the dividend or buying back shares. I can assure you we will continue on this flight path as we work to maintain and strengthen our balance sheet while at the same time, preparing to deliver increased value to our shareholders. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Steve."

I'm going to update on capital and counterparty credit and then hit on some additional segment highlights and trends that we're seeing. On the capital update, we've been talking for several quarters now about high grading the backlog an",1355,"All right, thanks. I'm going to update on capital and counterparty credit and then hit on some additional segment highlights and trends that we're seeing. On the capital update, we've been talking for several quarters now about high grading the backlog and how we do that. That consists of making sure that we are attending to our balance sheet but also ensuring that we grow our DCF per share through the investments that we're making at attractive returns and that we are now funding out of the excess cash flow that we generate without needing to access the capital market. 
The high grading includes select joint ventures on assets and projects. The UTOPIA JV shows that we can originate high-value midstream projects that are valued by investors. On SNG, we are entering a JV with our largest customer and a transaction which brings value to that asset with specifically identified opportunities and is accretive in the medium term. We have trimmed some projects in the backlog where they don't make sense from a return standpoint or in today's commodity price environment. And we've also made scope and cost savings improvement and, in some cases, deferred cost on some projects that we are proceeding with. One example of this improvement is in the gas group in this quarter. And part of the reduction in the backlog is due to this. We renegotiated the contract with the customer. The result of that renegotiation was a reduction in our capital spend for that project, a boosted return, acceleration of the in-service data and a proportion of the revenues and we freed up some capacity that we believe we can resell. Meanwhile, the customer got the benefit of the lower cost, longer-term [indiscernible] for [indiscernible]. We're going to continue to work on additional opportunities within our backlog and in addition to our current projects. 
The results of these efforts is a backlog which now has an EBITDA multiple of 6.5x CapEx, that's excluding CO2 projects which tend to have a higher return but are more commodity price sensitive. We now expect to spend discretionary capital of $2.8 billion in 2016, which is down from $2.9 billion last quarter that we estimated for the year, and down $500 million from the plan for the year. Our backlog is now $13.5 billion, down to $14.1 billion. And as a function of projects going into service, the UTOPIA JV, the project renegotiation that I mentioned and that is again some project decision. So in short, we are making good progress and doing what we told you we would do and that progress is on the balance sheet as well as positioning us to grow our DCF per share. 
On customer credit, we continue our extreme focus throughout our commercial and corporate organization. In the past quarter, credit default amounted to about 0.3, 0.3% of budgeted revenue annualized and most of that is associated with the Peabody bankruptcy which equates to the first 2 weeks of the quarter. Without that, we would be well under 0.1%. And again, putting our situation in perspective, we're a broadly diversified midstream company, we've got a strong and diversified customer base, which includes integrated energy majors, utilities and end users. So the credit fixture is stabilizing. 
Now for some of the segment highlights and trends. Overall, and I compare it to a year-over-year basis to segment earnings before DD&A and certain items is down $31 million or 2% from Q2 of 2015 to Q2 of '16. CO2 -- so $31 million down -- CO2 by itself is down $59 million due to lower prices primarily and lower production. Even though CO2 is making plan due to surprise improvements and good performance on the cost savings front. 
Compared to the last -- the same quarter last year, GAAP is down 1% while terminals and products are 4% and 8%, respectively. So broad themes on our year to year performance. We continue -- number 1, we continue to see strong demand for natural gas across our network, transport volumes are up 5% year-over-year. We're getting good terms on storage, transportation and sales renewals in our business. 
Power burn on our pipe is up 8% year-over-year. And recall that power burn was up 16% from Q2 of '14 to '15. So there's strong compounding growth coming from the power sector. For the first time ever, gas is making up a larger share of the fuel for power generation and coal. That's been true year-to-date for 2016 and very close in 2015. In the last, most recent quarter, Q2 of '16, 35% of generation came from gas versus 27% from coal. Gas exports are up [indiscernible]. Exports to Mexico have grown to 3.3 Bcf a day and 3/4 of that volume moves on Kinder Morgan pipes. We continue to believe and will see the need for natural gas transportation storage services growing as the demand in the power sector, power generation sector, industrial sectors continues to grow, along with export demand for Mexico and LNG. 
The product pipelines we're getting the benefit year-over-year of higher volumes on KMDC and Cochin and the startup on the second splitter unit in the Houston Ship Channel. 
In terminals, we are seeing the benefit of new liquids capacity coming online. And remember, liquids makes up a little better than 3/4 of our segment earnings before DD&A in this business and we're also seeing increased utilization of that expanded capacity. So more capacity online and higher overall utilization of that capacity. 
The second quarter was a record-setting quarter of throughput on our liquids terminals. 
On the bulk side, while coal volumes is down year-over-year, other bulk volumes are partially offsetting that declines, particularly in petco and metals. We also renewed our steel handling arrangement with Nucor for 10 years with some value enhancements in that new deal. Overall, in the bulk part of the business, the entire year-over-year change can be explained by the coal bankruptcy. 
The negatives affecting the business on a year-over-year basis are, of course, lower commodity prices, which affected directly in the enhanced oil recovery part of CO2 and indirectly in our gathered volumes of gas and crude and condensates. But even with oil prices and gas prices that are lower year-over-year by 18% and 26%, respectively, we're showing durable performance from our portfolio. 
Lastly, an update on our Trans Mountain expansion. This continues to be a 2 steps forward, 1 step back development. I'll start with the fundamentals. What we consistently hear from our producer customers in Canada is that they're counting on this project to get built. Putting the recent fires aside in Alberta, production continues to grow and take away capacity projects continue to be behind this demand. Oil prices have hurt Alberta for sure. But from the perspective of our expansion, the supply and demand fundamentals for take away capacity are good. With the list of the federal review process, as Rich mentioned, we have our ENB recommendation, finding the project to be in the public interest and the federal government is undertaking its further consultation process with the objective of final decision in December this year. We've made great progress with communities along the route, have agreements to support for a majority of the most directly affected First Nations stand. We are actively engaged with the B.C. government on the satisfaction of their five conditions and we are making very good progress there. We are going to be actively working with contractors over the summer on the always challenging work on cost and final scope of the project. 
Finally, before turning over to Kim for the financials, I'm going to point out, you probably noticed that the release is in a slightly different format than usual. What we're doing is showing GAAP measures with equal or greater prominence further [ph] recent SEC guidance as a public company. As always, we'll continue to show you all the numbers, including the non-GAAP measures that we use in our management of the business. This is the business format we'll show going forward. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Kim."
34952431,375871248,1008823,"Kinder Morgan, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 20, 2016",2016-07-20,"Earnings Calls","Kinder Morgan, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Steve. Let me start by reiterating three overall financial points that Rich mentioned to you that we believe you should take over from this call. Number 1, as Rich said, our full-year guidance does not change from the updated guidance we gave you",1139,"Thanks, Steve. Let me start by reiterating three overall financial points that Rich mentioned to you that we believe you should take over from this call. Number 1, as Rich said, our full-year guidance does not change from the updated guidance we gave you last quarter. We continue to expect that EBITDA will be about 3% below budget and DCF will be approximately 4% below budget. 
To be consistent with the guidance we gave you last quarter, this guidance does not include the impact of the SNG JV which we anticipate will close in the late third or early fourth quarter. 
Secondly, we expect to end the year at 5.3x debt-to-EBITDA, which is down from our budget guidance and [indiscernible] the guidance we gave you last quarter, largely as a result of our balance sheet improvement efforts. When you analyze the EBITDA impact from the SNG transaction, we expect that the full-year impact would be slightly higher than the 5.3x. 
And third, our debt-to-EBITDA target is still around 5x. And once we've reach that level, we will decide how to return value to shareholders and we're not committing to a specific method at this time. 
Our dividend today. We are declaring a dividend of $0.125 per share consistent with our budget and the guidance we gave you at December of last year. 
Looking at our GAAP income statement, you will see that revenues are down significantly. As I say in many quarters, we do not believe that revenue or the changes in revenues are necessarily good predictors of our performance. We have some businesses where revenues and expense fluctuate with commodity prices but margin generally does not. Which is why you also see a large change across the sales during the quarter. 
In addition, our GAAP numbers can be impacted by noncash, nonrecurring accounting entries for what we call certain items. 
So if you turn to the second page of numbers, which shows our Bcf for the quarter and year-to-date, I believe you'll get a better picture of our performance. We generated total DCF for the quarter of 1.05 billion, versus 1.095 billion for the comparable period in 2015. Therefore, total DCF was down about 45 million or 4%. The segments were down approximately 31 million or 2% with a $59 million decrease in CO2 offsetting increases in terminals and products. The $31 million decrease in the segment was partially offset by $23 million decrease in G&A and interest expense. If you net out the $39 million increase in our preferred stock dividend, you get a DCF variance [ph] of $47 million versus the $45 million that we show on the page. There are a bunch of other moving parts but that gives you the main one. 
DCF per share was $0.47 in the quarter versus $0.50 for the second quarter of last year or down $0.03, with about $0.02 associated with the DCF variance that I just walked you through and about $0.01 due to the additional shares that we issued during 2015 to finance our growth projects and maintain our balance sheet. Therefore, despite approximately 20% decline in commodity prices versus the second quarter of last year, our performance was down approximately 4%. 
We believe these results demonstrate the resiliency of our cash flows generated by a large diversified platform, primarily fee-based assets. 
Certain items in the quarter were relatively small, income of approximately $8 million. But let me describe a couple of them that you wouldn't have seen before so we'll make sure you know what they are. We had a contract early termination revenue, which is $39 million of income, which was associated with a customer buying out of its source contract on one of our Texas Interstate storage fields. We also had a $21 million in legal and environmental reserves and that was primarily related to settlement of our over tenure litigation matter with the City of San Diego. 
Now let me give you a little bit more granularity on our expected performance for the full year versus our budget. We expect natural gas pipeline to come in approximately 2% below its budget, primarily as a result of the lower volumes in our midstream group and a 4.5 months in-service delay on our EEC SNG pipeline expansion as a result of a delay in receiving our FERC certificate. 
CO2 is expected to end the year on its budget. And essentially here, what's happening is we have some price help in cost savings that are offsetting a little bit lower oil in CO2 volumes than we budgeted. We currently expect terminals to end the year at about 4% below its budget, primarily due to the impact of the coal bankruptcy. We expect products to end the year approximately 5% below its budget due to lower crude and condensate volume on KMCC, Double H and Double Eagle, lower rates in our SSPP pipeline and the sale of our Parkway pipeline. Right now, we're projecting KMCC to be essentially on budget. 
On the expense side, interest, cash taxes, G&A and sustaining CapEx on a combined basis are expected to come in positive versus budget, or said another way, generate a favorable variance, primarily as a result of lower interest. 
And with that, I will move to the balance sheet. 
On the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $41.3 billion in debt. That is an increase in debt of about $97 million since the end of last year and is a decrease in debt versus where we ended the first quarter of about $234 million. So let me reconcile that for you. 
DCF in the quarter, as I mentioned a moment ago, was $1.05 billion. We spent about 800 -- a little under $870 million on expansion CapEx and contributions to equity investments. We distributed or paid dividends of about $279 million. We have-- we received proceeds from asset divestitures and JVs of about $220 million and then working capital and other items was a source of cash of about $110 million. 
Year-to-date, we generated $2.28 billion in distributable cash flow. We spent about $1.88 million on expansion capital, on acquisitions and on contributions to equity investments with the only significant acquisition being the acquisition of the BP terminals in the first quarter. We paid dividends of $558 million and we have proceeds from asset divestitures and JVs of $220 million and then we had working capitals used of about $160 million, that gets you to the $97 million increase in debt year-to-date. 
We ended the quarter at about 5.6x debt-to-EBITDA, which is consistent where we ended last year and consistent where we ended the first quarter. And as we have mentioned a couple of times on the call, we expect to end the year at 5.3x debt-to-EBITDA. 
So with that, I'll turn it back to Rich."

The other thing I would point out is, and this was part of our strategy in maintaining some flexibility on what we would work on and what we could've done, we've gotten so far already this year. We've gotten to a point where we brought our debt-to-EBITDA metric down to 5.3x which is better than where we'd expected to end the year.

But if you looked on a Q2-to-Q2 basis, after having a very, very robust growth from '14 to '15, we saw growth on top of that -- of 8%. And here, I'm just talking about our system. So 8% on top of that 16% that we saw before which I think was very strong. And I think bodes well. We had another data point there, as we had 5 of our 6 biggest days for power generation on the SNG system happened in the last 45 days. 5 of our biggest, 5 of the 6 biggest."

And again, they are, I think, we've had a few others. They're somewhat exceptional. And it's either a case where  it's really a case where the customer on the asset or a third party has a much higher value, or places a higher strategic value on the underlying asset. Parkway was an example. There were some others, smaller examples during the quarter. We sold a small transfix facility which we were essentially just doing spot business through and really not making much of anything on it. We had a third-party who was interested in doing more with that asset. And so again, I think those are exceptional cases. But where we see them, we go get them."

I mean, starting to see some people come back to the Eagle Ford. But you not only had to come back, you had to bring a lot of rigs back in order to see that flatten back out and start to increase. And frankly, I don't think the basin is at that point yet. And so most of what we have been focusing on is where we lost some volumes to third parties, we're trying to incent those to come back to the system rather than just collecting the deficiency charges from those customers. And as I said, I think, we've made good progress over the course of the quarter in doing that. But by the -- the over -- so long as the overall basin is declining, we're -- what we're doing is fighting off decline and trying to stay above that decline rate, if you will. but I don't know if -- it depends on whether the basin decline starts to slow, I think, and level out. And now, I'll point out to, because we haven't talked about Highland. We actually had year-over-year and over budget improvement on our Highland gathering assets in North Dakota. A lot of that was due to, also, restructuring of contracts and primarily migrating them from percent of proceeds to fee base, which gives us both greater stability but also happen to have a beneficial impact on this year's earnings. So we'll talk a lot about Eagle Ford. In the Haynesville, we've done an arrangement to try to incent a current customer to do some drilling. And there, what we've done is we've divided, if you will, the contract between what's already under contract to us and new or incremental wells and providing discounts there to try to incent some drilling.

As always, before we begin, I'd like to remind you that today's earnings release and this call include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as well as certain non-GAAP financial measures. We encourage you to read our full disclosure on forward-looking statements and use of non-GAAP financial measures set forth at the end of our earnings release as well as review our latest filings with the SEC for a list of risk factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those in such forward-looking statements. 
Let me begin by just making very few introductory comments before turning the call over to our CEO, Steve Kean; and our CFO, Kim Dang. First of all, the operating results for both the second quarter and year-to-date are very consistent with Kim's guidance, which she shared with you on our Q1 call and which were in our Q1 earnings release. And I think this demonstrates once more that our assets are consistent generators of strong cash flow even in these times of volatility. 
Several specific events have happened since our last call, mostly positive. First of all, the National Energy Board of Canada recommended approval of our Trans Mountain expansion project. This is an important step. But we still need an Order in Council, and that decision is expected in December of this year. 
We also entered into joint ventures. As you know, with Southern Company on our SNG natural gas system and with Riverstone on our Utopia pipeline project. And have also divested an additional approximate $175 million of noncore assets. These steps allow us to significantly improve our balance sheet with the expectation of now ending this year, 2016, at about 5.3x debt-to-EBITDA, which is an improvement from the 5.5x budget. In addition, we're also reducing our future need for expansion CapEx and all of this is getting us measurably closer to being able to return significant additional cash to our shareholders through either increasing the dividend or buying back shares. I can assure you we will continue on this flight path as we work to maintain and strengthen our balance sheet while at the same time, preparing to deliver increased value to our shareholders. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Steve."
34952431,375871248,1008929,"Kinder Morgan, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 20, 2016",2016-07-20,"Earnings Calls","Kinder Morgan, Inc.","Executives","All right, thanks. I'm going to update on capital and counterparty credit and then hit on some additional segment highlights and trends that we're seeing. On the capital update, we've been talking for several quarters now about high grading the backlog",1349,"All right, thanks. I'm going to update on capital and counterparty credit and then hit on some additional segment highlights and trends that we're seeing. 
On the capital update, we've been talking for several quarters now about high grading the backlog and how we do that. That consists of making sure that we are attending to our balance sheet, but also ensuring that we grow our DCF per share through investments that we're making at attractive returns, and that we are now funding out of the excess cash flow that we generate without needing to access the capital market. 
The high grading includes select joint ventures on assets and projects. The Utopia JV shows that we can originate high-value midstream projects that are valued by investors. On SNG, we are entering a JV with our largest customer and a transaction which brings value to that asset through specifically identified opportunities and is accretive in the medium term. We have trimmed some projects in the backlog where they don't make sense from a return standpoint or in today's commodity price environment. And we've also made scope and cost savings improvement and, in some cases, deferred cost on projects that we are proceeding with. One example of this improvement is in the gas group in this quarter. And part of the reduction in the backlog is due to this. We renegotiated the contract with the customer. The result of that renegotiation was a reduction in our capital spend for that project, a boosted return, acceleration of the in-service date of a portion of the revenues, and we freed up some capacity that we believe we can resell. Meanwhile, the customer got the benefit of the lower-cost, longer-term solution for its need. We're going to continue to work on additional opportunities within our backlog and in addition to our current projects. 
The results of these efforts is a backlog which now has an EBITDA multiple of 6.5x CapEx. That's excluding CO2 projects which tend to have a higher return, but are more commodity price sensitive. We now expect to spend discretionary capital of $2.8 billion in 2016, which is down from $2.9 billion last quarter that we estimated for the year, and down $500 million from our plan for the year. Our backlog is now $13.5 billion, down from $14.1 billion. And as a function of projects going into service, the Utopia JV, the project renegotiation that I mentioned, and that is again some project decision. So in short, we're making good progress and doing what we told you we would do, and that progress is on the balance sheet as well as positioning us to grow our DCF per share. 
On customer credit, we continue our extreme focus throughout our commercial and corporate organization. In the past quarter, credit default amounted to about 0.3 -- 0.3% of budgeted revenue annualized and most of that is associated with the Peabody bankruptcy which equates to the first 2 weeks of the quarter. Without that, we would be well under 0.1%. And again, putting our situation in perspective, we're a broadly diversified midstream company, we've got a strong and diversified customer base, which includes integrated energy majors, utilities and end users. So the credit picture is stabilizing. 
Now for some of the segment highlights and trends. Overall, and I compare it to a year-over-year basis to segment earnings before DD&A and certain items is down $31 million or 2% from Q2 of 2015 to Q2 of '16. CO2 -- so $31 million down -- CO2 by itself is down $59 million due to lower prices primarily and lower production. Even though CO2 is making plan due to surprise improvements and good performance on the cost-savings front. 
Compared to last -- the same quarter last year, GAAP is down 1% while terminals and products are 4% and 8%, respectively. So broad themes on our year-to-year performance. We continue -- number one, we continue to see strong demand for natural gas across our network, transport volumes are up 5% year-over-year. We're getting good terms on storage, transportation and sales renewals in our business. 
Power burn on our pipe is up 8% year-over-year. And recall that power burn was up 16% from Q2 of '14 to '15. So there's strong compounding growth coming from the power sector. For the first time ever, gas is making up a larger share of the fuel for power generation and coal. That's been true year-to-date for 2016 and very close in 2015. In the last, most recent quarter, Q2 of '16, 35% of generation came from gas versus 27% from coal. Gas exports are up on our system, too. Exports to Mexico have grown to 3.3 Bcf a day and 3/4 of that volume moves on Kinder Morgan pipes. We continue to believe, and we're seeing the need for natural gas transportation storage services growing as the demand in the power sector, power generation sector, industrial sectors continues to grow, along with export demand from Mexico and LNG. 
The Products Pipelines we're getting the benefit year-over-year of higher volumes on KMCC and Cochin and the start-up on the second splitter unit in the Houston Ship Channel. 
In Terminals, we are seeing the benefit of new liquids capacity coming online. And remember, liquids makes up a little better than 3/4 of our segment earnings before DD&A in this business, and we're also seeing increased utilization of that expanded capacity. So more capacity online and higher overall utilization of that capacity. The second quarter was a record-setting quarter for throughput on our liquids terminals. 
On the bulk side, while coal volumes is down year-over-year, other bulk volumes are partially offsetting that declines, particularly in petcoke and metals. We also renewed our steel handling arrangement with Nucor for 10 years with some value enhancements in that new deal. Overall, in the bulk part of the business, the entire year-over-year change can be explained by the coal bankruptcy. 
The negatives affecting the business on a year-over-year basis are, of course, lower commodity prices, which affected directly in the enhanced oil recovery part of CO2 and indirectly in our gathered volumes of gas and crude and condensates. But even with oil prices and gas prices that are lower year-over-year by 18% and 26%, respectively, we're showing durable performance from our portfolio [indiscernible]. 
Lastly, an update on our Trans Mountain expansion. This continues to be a ""2 steps forward, 1 step back"" development. I'll start with the fundamentals. What we consistently hear from our producer customers in Canada is that they're counting on this project to get built. Putting the recent fires aside in Alberta, production continues to grow and take-away capacity projects continue to be behind the demand. Oil prices have hurt Alberta for sure. But from the perspective of our expansion, the supply and demand fundamentals for take-away capacity are good. We're in the midst of the federal review process, as Rich mentioned, we have our NEB recommendation, finding the project to be in the public interest and the federal government is undertaking its further consultation process with the objective of final decision in December this year. We've made great progress with communities along the route, have agreements to support for a majority of the most directly affected First Nations stand. We are actively engaged with the B.C. government on the satisfaction of their 5 conditions, and we are making very good progress there. We are going to be actively working with contractors over the summer on the always-challenging work on cost and final scope of the project. 
Finally, before turning over to Kim for the financials, I'm going to point out that you probably noticed the release is in a slightly different format than usual. What we're doing is showing GAAP measures with equal or greater prominence for the recent SEC guidance to public company. As always, we'll continue to show you all the numbers, including the non-GAAP measures that we use in our management of the business. The business of format we'll show going forward. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Kim."
34952431,375871248,1008929,"Kinder Morgan, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 20, 2016",2016-07-20,"Earnings Calls","Kinder Morgan, Inc.","Executives","Okay. Thanks, Steve. Let me start by reiterating 3 overall financial points that Rich mentioned to you that we believe you should take away from this call. Number one, as Rich said, our full year guidance has not change from the updated guidance we gave y",1138,"Okay. Thanks, Steve. Let me start by reiterating 3 overall financial points that Rich mentioned to you that we believe you should take away from this call. Number one, as Rich said, our full year guidance has not change from the updated guidance we gave you last quarter. We continue to expect that EBITDA will be about 3% below budget and DCF will be approximately 4% below budget. 
To be consistent with the guidance we gave you last quarter, this guidance does not include the impact of the SNG JV which we anticipate will close in the late third or early fourth quarter. Secondly, we expect to end the year at 5.3x debt-to-EBITDA, which is down from our budget guidance and the guidance we gave you last quarter, largely as a result of our balance sheet improvement efforts. When you annualize the EBITDA impact from the SNG transaction, we expect that the full year impact would be slightly higher than the 5.3x. And third, our debt-to-EBITDA target is still around 5x. And once we've reach that level, we will decide how to return value to shareholders, and we're not committing to a specific method at this time. 
On our dividend. Today, we're declaring a dividend of $0.125 per share consistent with our budget and the guidance we gave you in December of last year. 
Looking at our GAAP income statement, you will see that revenues are down significantly. As I say in many quarters, we do not believe that revenue or the changes in revenues are necessarily good predictors of our performance. We have some businesses where revenues and expense fluctuate with commodity prices, but margin generally does not. Which is why you also see a large change in cost of sales during the quarter. In addition, our GAAP numbers can be impacted by noncash, nonrecurring accounting entries for what we call certain items.
So if you turn to the second page of numbers, which shows our DCF for this quarter and year-to-date, I believe you'll get a better picture of our performance. We generated total DCF for the quarter of $1.05 billion versus $1.095 billion for the comparable period in 2015. Therefore, total DCF was down about $45 million or 4%. The segments were down approximately $31 million or 2% with a $59 million decrease in CO2 offsetting increases in terminals and products. The $31 million decrease in the segment was partially offset by $23 million decrease in G&A and interest expense. If you net out the $39 million increase in our preferred stock dividend, you get a DCF variance of $47 million versus the $45 million that we show on the page. There are a bunch of other moving parts, but that gives you the main one. 
DCF per share was $0.47 in the quarter versus $0.50 for the second quarter of last year or down $0.03, with about $0.02 associated with the DCF variance that I just walked you through and about $0.01 due to the additional shares that we issued during 2015 to finance our growth projects and maintain our balance sheet. Therefore, despite approximately 20% decline in commodity prices versus the second quarter of last year, our performance was down approximately 4%. We believe these results demonstrate the resiliency of our cash flows generated by a large diversified platform, primarily fee-based assets. 
Certain items in the quarter were relatively small, income of approximately $8 million. But let me describe a couple of them that you wouldn't have seen before, so we'll make sure you know what they are. We had a contract early-termination revenue, which is $39 million of income, which was associated with a customer buying out of its source contract on one of our Texas Intrastate storage fields. We also had a $21 million in legal and environmental reserves, and that was primarily related to settlement of our over 10-year litigation matter with the city of San Diego. 
Now let me give you a little bit more granularity on our expected performance for the full year versus our budget. We expect natural gas pipeline to come in approximately 2% below its budget, primarily as a result of the lower volumes in our midstream group and a 4.5 months in-service delay on our EEC/SNG pipeline expansion as a result of a delay in receiving our FERC certificate. 
CO2 is expected to end the year on its budget. And essentially here, what's happening is we have some price help and cost savings that are offsetting a little bit lower oil in CO2 volumes than we budgeted. We currently expect terminals to end the year about 4% below its budget, primarily due to the impact of the Coal bankruptcy. We expect products to end the year approximately 5% below its budget due to lower crude and condensate volume on KMCC, Double H and Double Eagle, lower rates on our SSPP pipeline and the sale of our Parkway Pipeline. Right now, we're projecting KMC to be essentially on budget. 
On the expense side, interest, cash taxes, G&A and sustaining CapEx on a combined basis are expected to come in positive versus budget, or said another way, generate a favorable variance, primarily as a result of lower interest. 
And with that, I will move to the balance sheet. On the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $41.3 billion in debt. That is an increase in debt of about $97 million since the end of last year and is a decrease in debt versus where we ended the first quarter of about $234 million. So let me reconcile that for you. 
DCF in the quarter, as I mentioned a moment ago, was $1.05 billion. We spent about 800 -- a little under $870 million on expansion CapEx and contributions to equity investments. We distributed or paid dividends of about $279 million. We have -- we received proceeds from asset divestitures and JVs of about $220 million, and then working capital and other items was a source of cash of about $110 million. 
Year-to-date, we generated $2.28 billion in distributable cash flow. We spent about $1.88 on expansion capital, on acquisitions and on contributions to equity investments with the only significant acquisition being the acquisition of the BP terminals in the first quarter. We paid dividends of $558 million and we have proceeds from asset divestitures and JVs of $220 million and then we had working capitals used of about $160 million to get you to the $97 million increase in debt year-to-date. 
We ended the quarter at about 5.6x debt-to-EBITDA, which is consistent where we ended last year and consistent where we ended the first quarter. And as we have mentioned a couple of times on the call, we expect to end the year at 5.3x debt-to-EBITDA. 
So with that, I'll turn it back to Rich."

We've got some commercial considerations and competitive considerations around counterparties that we're working with there. So we're not identifying for you the whole list of things that we would be considering. But I think it's safe to say that we would look at and evaluate, if we could make it work, just about anything on our backlog that is separable, that we think we can extract good value for and that we can get promoted on and boost our return on. I mean, we'll have kind of the full list. Now a lot of the things that are in our backlog are things that are components of our existing network, our existing asset base. And so those are a lot harder. The other thing I would point out is, and this was part of our strategy in maintaining some flexibility on what we would work on and what we could have done, we've gotten so far already this year. We've gotten to a point where we brought our debt-to-EBITDA metric down to 5.3x, which is better than where we'd expected to end the year. So I know that's not definitive answer on here's the list of things that we look at doing. That's the kind of characteristics of things that we look at doing, and we made great progress on it."

So we lost some volumes on our Eagle Ford system that we are now getting back by entering into these arrangements. So it's probably a little bit worse than what we would have been shooting for, hoping for. But I think we've taken the right steps during the quarter to get some volumes and send it back on the system. And so I look for improvements here. Yes, and then on power, we were watching to kind of see how power generation would play out. I think I'll say, and Tom Martin is here, too, a little surprised to the upside on the year-over-year improvement when you think about how big of a leap we had last year. Now if you look at the year-to-date number, it's not quite as strong because we have that weak winter. And so Q1 was actually down a bit. But if you look on a Q2-to-Q2 basis, after having a very, very robust growth from '14 to '15, we saw growth on top of that -- of 8%. And here, I'm just talking about our system. So 8% on top of that 16% that we saw before which I think was -- is very strong, and I think bodes well. We had another data point there, as we had 5 of our 6 biggest days for power generation on the SNG system happened in the last 45 days. 5 of our biggest, 5 of the 6 biggest."

I think that's a fairly unique situation. We had, as Kim mentioned in some of her updates on the cash numbers, proceeds from other asset sales that we did. And again, they are, I think, we've had a few others. They're somewhat exceptional. And it's either a case where -- it's really a case where the customer on the asset or a third party has a much higher value or places a higher strategic value on the underlying asset. Parkway was an example. There were some others, smaller examples during the quarter. We sold a small -- a transmix facility, which we were essentially just doing spot business through and really not making much of anything on it. We had a third party who's interested in doing more with that asset. And so again, I think those are exceptional cases. But where we see them, we go get them."

And I mean, we're starting to see some people come back to the Eagle Ford. But you not only had to come back, you had to bring a lot of rigs back in order to see that flatten back out and then start to increase. And frankly, I don't think the basin is at that point yet. And so most of what we have been focusing on is where we lost some volumes to third parties, we're trying to incent those to come back to the system rather than just collecting the deficiency charges from those customers. And as I said, I think we've made some good progress over the course of the quarter in doing that. But by the -- the over -- so long as the overall basin is declining, we're -- what we're doing is fighting off decline and trying to stay above that decline rate, if you will. But I don't know if -- it depends on whether the basin decline starts to slow and level out. Now I'll point out to -- because we haven't talked about Highland. We actually had year-over-year and over budget improvement on our Highland gathering assets in North Dakota. A lot of that was due to, also, restructuring of contracts and primarily migrating them from percent of proceeds to fee based, which gives us both greater stability, but also happened to have a beneficial impact on this year's earnings. So we've talked a lot about Eagle Ford. In the Haynesville, we've done an arrangement to try to incent a current customer to do some drilling. And there, what we've done is we've divided, if you will, the contract between what's already under contract to us and new or incremental wells and providing discounts there to try to incent some drilling. But again, the overall gathering picture is primarily driven by what the overall basin picture is."

I think if you look at what our opportunities, and it remains to be seen what the total investment opportunity is going to be out there, but I think there's a very reasonable case, right, a reasonable scenario where we're in a situation where we're generating significantly more cash, particularly as these projects come online, more cash than we're investing. And when we're in that position, we're going to be also in a position to either -- as we've said multiple times, either further delever the balance sheet or return value to shareholders in the form of buybacks or increase the dividends.

I don't mean to beat the dead horse, but I wanted to revisit sort of the balancing act that you spoke about with Faisel and then Craig's efforts -- or comments around sort of the deleveraging efforts versus capital deployment opportunities. Steve, recognizing that you don't need the access to capital markets, but I'm just wondering like at what point -- what are the conditions under which you would? But if the -- I get that the effort around JV-ing on in-flight projects is seemingly the most attractive thing, particularly if the party can bring something to that other than just capital. You've -- we've obviously seen the asset sales, but it's kind of tricky when you're selling underlying cash flow and utilizing some of the NOL balance.

As always, before we begin, I'd like to remind you that today's earnings release and this call include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as well as certain non-GAAP financial measures. We encourage you to read our full disclosure on forward-looking statements and use of non-GAAP financial measures set forth at the end of our earnings release as well as review our latest filings with the SEC for a list of risk factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those in such forward-looking statements. 
Let me begin by just making very few introductory comments before turning the call over to our CEO, Steve Kean; and our CFO, Kim Dang. First of all, the operating results for both the second quarter and year-to-date are very consistent with Kim's guidance, which she shared with you on our Q1 call and which were in our Q1 earnings release. And I think this demonstrates once more that our assets are consistent generators of strong cash flow even in these times of volatility. 
Several specific events have happened since our last call, mostly positive. First of all, the National Energy Board of Canada recommended approval of our Trans Mountain expansion project. This is an important step. But we still need an Order in Council, and that decision is expected in December of this year. 
We also entered into joint ventures. As you know, with Southern Company on our SNG natural gas system and with Riverstone on our Utopia pipeline project. And have also divested an additional approximate $175 million of noncore assets. These steps allow us to significantly improve our balance sheet with the expectation of now ending this year, 2016, at about 5.3x debt-to-EBITDA, which is an improvement from the 5.5x budgeted. In addition, we're also reducing our future need for expansion CapEx and all of this is getting us measurably closer to being able to return significant additional cash to our shareholders through either increasing the dividend or buying back shares. I can assure you we will continue on this flight path as we work to maintain and strengthen our balance sheet while at the same time, preparing to deliver increased value to our shareholders. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Steve."
34952431,375871248,1008968,"Kinder Morgan, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 20, 2016",2016-07-20,"Earnings Calls","Kinder Morgan, Inc.","Executives","All right, thanks. I'm going to update on capital and counterparty credit and then hit on some additional segment highlights and trends that we're seeing. On the capital update, we've been talking for several quarters now about high grading the backlog",1356,"All right, thanks. I'm going to update on capital and counterparty credit and then hit on some additional segment highlights and trends that we're seeing. 
On the capital update, we've been talking for several quarters now about high grading the backlog and how we do that. That consists of making sure that we are attending to our balance sheet, but also ensuring that we grow our DCF per share through investments that we're making at attractive returns, and that we are now funding out of the excess cash flow that we generate without needing to access the capital market. 
The high grading includes select joint ventures on assets and projects. The Utopia JV shows that we can originate high-value midstream projects that are valued by investors. On SNG, we are entering a JV with our largest customer in a transaction which brings value to that asset through specifically identified opportunities and is accretive in the medium term. We have trimmed some projects in the backlog where they don't make sense from a return standpoint or in today's commodity price environment. And we've also made scope and cost savings improvement and, in some cases, deferred cost on projects that we are proceeding with. One example of this improvement is in the gas group in this quarter. And part of the reduction in the backlog is due to this. We renegotiated the contract with the customer. The result of that renegotiation was a reduction in our capital spend for that project, a boosted return, acceleration of the in-service date of a portion of the revenues, and we freed up some capacity that we believe we can resell. Meanwhile, the customer got the benefit of the lower-cost, longer-term solution for its needs. We're going to continue to work on additional opportunities within our backlog and in addition to our current projects. 
The results of these efforts is a backlog which now has an EBITDA multiple of 6.5x CapEx. That's excluding CO2 projects which tend to have a higher return, but are more commodity price sensitive. We now expect to spend discretionary capital of $2.8 billion in 2016, which is down from $2.9 billion last quarter that we estimated for the year, and down $500 million from our plan for the year. Our backlog is now $13.5 billion, down from $14.1 billion. And that is a function of projects going into service, the Utopia JV, the project renegotiation that I mentioned, and netted again some project decision. So in short, we're making good progress and doing what we told you we would do, and that progress is on the balance sheet as well as positioning us to grow our DCF per share. 
On customer credit, we continue our extreme focus throughout our commercial and corporate organizations. In the past quarter, credit default amounted to about 0.3 -- 0.3% of budgeted revenue annualized and most of that is associated with the Peabody bankruptcy which equates to the first 2 weeks of the quarter. Without that, we would be well under 0.1%. And again, putting our situation in perspective, we're a broadly diversified midstream company, we've got a strong and diversified customer base, which includes integrated energy majors, utilities and end users. So the credit picture is stabilizing. 
Now for some of the segment highlights and trends. Overall, and I compare it to a year-over-year basis to segment earnings before DD&A and certain items is down $31 million or 2% from Q2 of 2015 to Q2 of '16. CO2 -- so $31 million down -- CO2 by itself is down $59 million due to lower prices primarily and lower production. Even though CO2 is making plans due to some price improvements and good performance on the cost-savings front. 
Compared to last -- the same quarter last year, GAAP is down 1% while terminals and products are up 4% and 8%, respectively. So broad themes on our year-to-year performance. We continue -- number one, we continue to see strong demand for natural gas across our network, transport volumes are up 5% year-over-year. We're getting good terms on storage, transportation and sales renewals in our business. 
Power burn on our pipe is up 8% year-over-year. And recall that power burn was up 16% from Q2 of '14 to '15. So there's strong compounding growth coming from the power sector. For the first time ever, gas is making up a larger share of the fuel for power generation than coal. That's been true year-to-date for 2016 and is very close in 2015. In the last, most recent quarter, Q2 of '16, 35% of generation came from gas versus 27% from coal. Gas exports are up on our system, too. Exports to Mexico have grown to 3.3 Bcf a day and 3/4 of that volume moves on Kinder Morgan pipes. We continue to believe, and we're seeing the need for natural gas transportation and storage services growing as the demand in the power sector -- power generation sector, industrial sectors continues to grow, along with export demand from Mexico in LNG. 
The Products Pipelines. We're getting the benefit year-over-year of higher volumes on KMCC and Cochin and the start-up on the second splitter unit in the Houston Ship Channel. 
In Terminals, we are seeing the benefit of new liquids capacity coming online. And remember, liquids makes up a little better than 3/4 of our segment earnings before DD&A in this business, and we're also seeing increased utilization of that expanded capacity. So more capacity online and higher overall utilization of that capacity. The second quarter was a record-setting quarter for throughput on our liquids terminals. 
On the bulk side, while coal volumes are down year-over-year, other bulk volumes are partially offsetting that declines, particularly in petcoke and metals. We also renewed our steel handling arrangement with Nucor for 10 years with some value enhancements in that new deal. Overall, the bulk part of the business, the entire year-over-year change can be explained by the coal bankruptcy. 
The negatives affecting the business on a year-over-year basis are, of course, lower commodity prices, which affect us directly in the enhanced oil recovery part of CO2 and indirectly in our gathered volumes of gas and crude and condensates. But even with oil prices and gas prices that are lower year-over-year by 18% and 26%, respectively, we're showing durable performance from our portfolio [indiscernible]. 
Lastly, an update on our Trans Mountain expansion. This continues to be a ""2 steps forward, 1 step back"" development. I'll start with the fundamentals. What we consistently hear from our producer customers in Canada is that they're counting on this project to get built. Putting the recent fires aside in Alberta, production continues to grow and take-away capacity projects continue to be behind the demand. Oil prices have hurt Alberta for sure. But from the perspective of our expansion, the supply and demand fundamentals for take-away capacity are good. We're in the midst of the federal review process, as Rich mentioned. We have our NEB recommendation, finding the project to be in the public interest and the federal government is undertaking its further consultation process with the objective of final decision in December this year. We've made great progress with communities along the route, have agreements of support from a majority of the most directly affected First Nations stand [ph] We are actively engaged with the B.C. government on the satisfaction of their 5 conditions, and we are making very good progress there. We are going to be actively working with contractors over the summer on the always-challenging work on cost and final scope of the project. 
Finally, before turning over to Kim for the financials, I'm going to point out that you probably noticed the release is in a slightly different format than usual. What we're doing is showing GAAP measures with equal or greater prominence per the recent SEC guidance to public company. As always, we'll continue to show you all the numbers, including the non-GAAP measures that we use in our management of the business. But this is the format we'll show going forward. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Kim."

Let me start by reiterating 3 overall financial points that Rich mentioned to you that we believe you should take away from this call. Number one, as Rich said, our full year guidance has not change from the updated guidance we gave y",1142,"Okay. Thanks, Steve. Let me start by reiterating 3 overall financial points that Rich mentioned to you that we believe you should take away from this call. Number one, as Rich said, our full year guidance has not change from the updated guidance we gave you last quarter. We continue to expect that EBITDA will be about 3% below budget and DCF will be approximately 4% below budget. 
To be consistent with the guidance we gave you last quarter, this guidance does not include the impact of the SNG JV which we anticipate will close in the late third or early fourth quarter. Secondly, we expect to end the year at 5.3x debt-to-EBITDA, which is down from our budget guidance and the guidance we gave you last quarter, largely as a result of our balance sheet improvement efforts. When you annualize the EBITDA impact from the SNG transaction, we expect that the full year impact would be slightly higher than the 5.3x. And third, our debt-to-EBITDA target is still around 5x. And once we reach that level, we will decide how to return value to shareholders, and we're not committing to a specific method at this time. 
On our dividend. Today, we're declaring a dividend of $0.125 per share consistent with our budget and the guidance we gave you in December of last year. 
Looking at our GAAP income statement, you will see that revenues are down significantly. As I say in many quarters, we do not believe that revenue or the changes in revenues are necessarily good predictors of our performance. We have some businesses where revenues and expense fluctuate with commodity prices, but margin generally does not. Which is why you also see a large change in cost of sales during the quarter. In addition, our GAAP numbers can be impacted by noncash, nonrecurring accounting entries for what we call certain items.
So if you turn to the second page of numbers, which shows our DCF for the quarter and year-to-date, I believe you'll get a better picture of our performance. We generated total DCF for the quarter of $1.05 billion versus $1.095 billion for the comparable period in 2015. Therefore, total DCF was down about $45 million or 4%. The segments were down approximately $31 million or 2% with a $59 million decrease in CO2 offsetting increases in terminals and products. The $31 million decrease in the segments was partially offset by $23 million decrease in G&A and interest expense. If you net out the $39 million increase in our preferred stock dividends, you get a DCF variance of $47 million versus the $45 million that we show on the page. There are a bunch of other moving parts, but that gives you the main one. 
DCF per share was $0.47 in the quarter versus $0.50 for the second quarter of last year or down $0.03, with about $0.02 associated with the DCF variance that I just walked you through and about $0.01 due to the additional shares that we issued during 2015 to finance our growth projects and maintain our balance sheet. Therefore, despite approximately 20% decline in commodity prices versus the second quarter of last year, our performance was down approximately 4%. We believe these results demonstrate the resiliency of our cash flows generated by a large diversified platform of primarily fee-based assets. 
Certain items in the quarter were relatively small, they are income of approximately $8 million. But let me describe a couple of them that you wouldn't have seen before, so you can make sure you know what they are. We had a contract early-termination revenue, which is $39 million of income, which was associated with a customer buying out of its source contract on one of our Texas Intrastate storage fields. We also had a $21 million in legal and environmental reserves, and that was primarily related to settlement of our over 10-year litigation matter with the city of San Diego. 
Now let me give you a little bit more granularity on our expected performance for the full year versus our budget. We expect natural gas pipelines to come in approximately 2% below its budget, primarily as a result of the lower volumes in our midstream group and a 4.5 months in-service delay on our EEC/SNG pipeline expansion as a result of a delay in receiving our FERC certificate. 
CO2 is expected to end the year on its budget. And essentially, here what's happening is we have some price help and cost savings that are offsetting a little bit lower oil and CO2 volumes than we budgeted. We currently expect Terminals to end the year about 4% below its budget, primarily due to the impact of the coal bankruptcy. We expect products to end the year approximately 5% below its budget due to lower crude and condensate volume on KMCC, Double H and Double Eagle, lower rates on our SSPP pipeline and the sale of our Parkway Pipeline. Right now, we're projecting KMC to be essentially on budget. 
On the expense side, interest, cash taxes, G&A and sustaining CapEx on a combined basis are expected to come in positive versus budget, or said another way, generate a favorable variance, primarily as a result of lower interest. 
And with that, I will move to the balance sheet. On the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $41.3 billion in debt. That is an increase in debt of about $97 million since the end of last year and is a decrease in debt versus where we ended the first quarter of about $234 million. So let me reconcile that for you. 
DCF in the quarter, as I mentioned a moment ago, was $1.05 billion. We spent about 800 -- a little under $870 million on expansion CapEx and contributions to equity investments. We distributed or paid dividends of about $279 million. We have -- we received proceeds from asset divestitures and JVs of about $220 million, and then working capital and other items was a source of cash of about $110 million. 
Year-to-date, we generated $2.28 billion in distributable cash flow. We spent about $1.88 on expansion capital, on acquisitions and on contributions to equity investments with the only significant acquisition being the acquisition of the BP terminals in the first quarter. We paid dividends of $558 million and we have proceeds from asset divestitures and JVs of $220 million and then we had working capitals used of about $160 million to get you to the $97 million increase in debt year-to-date. 
We ended the quarter at about 5.6x debt-to-EBITDA, which is consistent where we ended last year and consistent where we ended the first quarter. And as we have mentioned a couple of times on the call, we expect to end the year at 5.3x debt-to-EBITDA. 
So with that, I'll turn it back to Rich."

So we have not been talking about specific JVs other than what we put kind of in as a placeholder, right, when we announced our plans for the year. And there are competitive reasons for doing that. We want to -- we don't want to be beholding to any one particular transaction. We've got some commercial considerations and competitive considerations around counterparties that we're working with there. So we're not identifying for you the whole list of things that we would be considering. But I think it's safe to say that we would look at and evaluate, if we could make it work, just about anything on our backlog that is separable, that we think we can extract good value for and that we can get promoted on and boost our return on. I mean, we'll have kind of the full list. Now a lot of the things that are in our backlog are things that are components of our existing network, our existing asset base. And so those are a lot harder. The other thing I would point out is, and this was part of our strategy in maintaining some flexibility on what we would work on and what we would get done, we've gotten so far already this year, we've gotten to a point where we brought our debt-to-EBITDA metric down to 5.3x, which is better than where we'd expected to end the year. So I know that's not definitive answer on here's the list of things that we look at doing. That's the kind of characteristics of things that we look at doing, and we made great progress on it."

We made some good progress during this quarter, and maybe a little bit at the end of last quarter in terms of signing, and we'd sign 6 or 7 -- I think 6, with existing shippers and 7 with the new shipper -- kind of incentive agreements to try to bring volumes to our system above the contract minimum. So we lost some volumes on our Eagle Ford system that we are now getting back by entering into these arrangements. So it's probably a little bit worse than what we would have been shooting for, hoping for. But I think we've taken the right steps during the quarter to get some volumes and send it back on the system. And so I look for improvements here. Yes, and then on power, we were watching to kind of see how power generation would play out. I think I'll say, and Tom Martin is here, too, a little surprised to the upside on the year-over-year improvement when you think about how big of a leap we had last year. Now if you look at the year-to-date number, it's not quite as strong because we had that weak winter. And so Q1 was actually down a bit. But if you look on a Q2-to-Q2 basis, after having a very, very robust growth from '14 to '15, we saw growth on top of that -- of 8%. And here, I'm just talking about our system. So 8% on top of that 16% that we saw before which I think was -- is very strong, and I think bodes well. We had another data point there, as we had 5 of our 6 biggest days for power generation on the SNG system happened in the last 45 days: 5 of our biggest -- 5 of the 6 biggest."

That tends to be an expensive way to raise capital. It was -- I would characterize it as a somewhat unique opportunity in the SNG case, because what we had there is our largest customer, a great power market in the Southeast U.S. and some specifically identified and agreed to opportunities that we can jointly pursue in this JV that, again, somewhat unusual for such a transaction would actually make the sale of interest in an existing asset accretive in the medium term. I think that's a fairly unique situation. We had, as Kim mentioned in some of her updates on the cash numbers, proceeds from other asset sales that we did. And again, they are, I think, we've had a few others, they're somewhat exceptional, and it's either a case where -- it's really a case where the customer on the asset or a third party has a much higher value or places a higher strategic value on the underlying asset. Parkway was an example. There were some others, smaller examples during the quarter. We sold a small -- a transmix facility, which we were essentially just doing spot business through and really not making much of anything on it. We had a third party who's interested in doing more with that asset. And so again, I think those are exceptional cases. But where we see them, we go get them."

Maybe not give the exact rates, but maybe talk about additional opportunities on top of what you've already captured as far as the magnitude of potential volumes that may come back in the back half of the year?"

And I mean, we're starting to see some people come back to the Eagle Ford. But you not only have to come back, you have to bring a lot of rigs back in order to see that flatten back out and then start to increase. And frankly, I don't think the basin is at that point yet. And so most of what we have been focusing on is where we lost some volumes to third parties, we're trying to incent those to come back to the system rather than just collecting the deficiency charges from those customers. And as I said, I think we've made some good progress over the course of the quarter in doing that. But by the -- the over -- so long as the overall basin is declining, we're -- what we're doing is fighting off decline and trying to stay above that decline rate, if you will. But I don't know if -- it depends on whether the basin decline starts to slow and level out. Now I'll point out to -- because we haven't talked about Highland. We actually had year-over-year and over budget improvement on our Highland gathering assets in North Dakota. A lot of that was due to, also, restructuring of contracts and primarily migrating them from percent of proceeds to fee based, which gives us both greater stability, but also happened to have a beneficial impact on this year's earnings. So we've talked a lot about Eagle Ford. In the Haynesville, we've done an arrangement to try to incent a current customer to do some drilling. And there, what we've done is we've divided, if you will, the contract between what's already under contract to us and new or incremental wells and providing discounts there to try to incent some drilling.

So we are trying to make sure that we are dedicating our capital that we have to the best returns we can get and not be in a position where we have to access the capital market; where we have to access the capital market. And so those are really the things we are balancing. We remain focused on getting the balance sheet in order and then improving our DCF per share. And we believe, following that course will allow us to be in a position to return cash to shareholders. I think if you look at what our opportunities, and it remains to be seen what the total investment opportunity is going to be out there, but I think there's a very reasonable case, right, a reasonable scenario where we're in a situation where we're generating significantly more cash -- particularly as these projects come online -- more cash than we're investing. And when we're in that position, we're going to be also in a position to either -- as we've said multiple times -- either further delever the balance sheet or return value to shareholders in the form of buybacks or increase the dividend.

As always, before we begin, I'd like to remind you that today's earnings release and this call include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as well as certain non-GAAP financial measures. We encourage you to read our full disclosure on forward-looking statements and use of non-GAAP financial measures set forth at the end of our earnings release as well as review our latest filings with the SEC for a list of risk factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those in such forward-looking statements. 
Let me begin by just making very few introductory comments before turning the call over to our CEO, Steve Kean; and our CFO, Kim Dang. First of all, the operating results for both the second quarter and year-to-date are very consistent with Kim's guidance, which she shared with you on our Q1 call and which were in our Q1 earnings release. And I think this demonstrates once more that our assets are consistent generators of strong cash flow even in these times of volatility. 
Several specific events have happened since our last call, mostly positive. First of all, the National Energy Board of Canada recommended approval of our Trans Mountain expansion project. This is an important step. But we still need an Order in Council, and that decision is expected in December of this year. 
We also entered into joint ventures. As you know, with Southern Company on our SNG natural gas system and with Riverstone on our Utopia pipeline project. And have also divested an additional approximate $175 million of noncore assets. These steps allow us to significantly improve our balance sheet with the expectation of now ending this year, 2016, at about 5.3x debt-to-EBITDA, which is an improvement from the 5.5x budgeted. In addition, we're also reducing our future need for expansion CapEx and all of this is getting us measurably closer to being able to return significant additional cash to our shareholders through either increasing the dividend or buying back shares. I can assure you we will continue on this flight path as we work to maintain and strengthen our balance sheet while at the same time, preparing to deliver increased value to our shareholders. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Steve."
34952431,375871248,1009588,"Kinder Morgan, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 20, 2016",2016-07-20,"Earnings Calls","Kinder Morgan, Inc.","Executives","All right, thanks. I'm going to update on capital and counterparty credit and then hit on some additional segment highlights and trends that we're seeing. On the capital update, we've been talking for several quarters now about high grading the backlog",1356,"All right, thanks. I'm going to update on capital and counterparty credit and then hit on some additional segment highlights and trends that we're seeing. 
On the capital update, we've been talking for several quarters now about high grading the backlog and how we do that. That consists of making sure that we are attending to our balance sheet, but also ensuring that we grow our DCF per share through investments that we're making at attractive returns, and that we are now funding out of the excess cash flow that we generate without needing to access the capital market. 
The high grading includes select joint ventures on assets and projects. The Utopia JV shows that we can originate high-value midstream projects that are valued by investors. On SNG, we are entering a JV with our largest customer in a transaction which brings value to that asset through specifically identified opportunities and is accretive in the medium term. We have trimmed some projects in the backlog where they don't make sense from a return standpoint or in today's commodity price environment. And we've also made scope and cost savings improvement and, in some cases, deferred cost on projects that we are proceeding with. One example of this improvement is in the gas group in this quarter. And part of the reduction in the backlog is due to this. We renegotiated the contract with the customer. The result of that renegotiation was a reduction in our capital spend for that project, a boosted return, acceleration of the in-service date of a portion of the revenues, and we freed up some capacity that we believe we can resell. Meanwhile, the customer got the benefit of the lower-cost, longer-term solution for its needs. We're going to continue to work on additional opportunities within our backlog and in addition to our current projects. 
The results of these efforts is a backlog which now has an EBITDA multiple of 6.5x CapEx. That's excluding CO2 projects which tend to have a higher return, but are more commodity price sensitive. We now expect to spend discretionary capital of $2.8 billion in 2016, which is down from $2.9 billion last quarter that we estimated for the year, and down $500 million from our plan for the year. Our backlog is now $13.5 billion, down from $14.1 billion. And that is a function of projects going into service, the Utopia JV, the project renegotiation that I mentioned, and netted again some project decision. So in short, we're making good progress and doing what we told you we would do, and that progress is on the balance sheet as well as positioning us to grow our DCF per share. 
On customer credit, we continue our extreme focus throughout our commercial and corporate organizations. In the past quarter, credit default amounted to about 0.3 -- 0.3% of budgeted revenue annualized and most of that is associated with the Peabody bankruptcy which equates to the first 2 weeks of the quarter. Without that, we would be well under 0.1%. And again, putting our situation in perspective, we're a broadly diversified midstream company, we've got a strong and diversified customer base, which includes integrated energy majors, utilities and end users. So the credit picture is stabilizing. 
Now for some of the segment highlights and trends. Overall, and I compare it to a year-over-year basis to segment earnings before DD&A and certain items is down $31 million or 2% from Q2 of 2015 to Q2 of '16. CO2 -- so $31 million down -- CO2 by itself is down $59 million due to lower prices primarily and lower production. Even though CO2 is making plans due to some price improvements and good performance on the cost-savings front. 
Compared to last -- the same quarter last year, GAAP is down 1% while terminals and products are up 4% and 8%, respectively. So broad themes on our year-to-year performance. We continue -- number one, we continue to see strong demand for natural gas across our network, transport volumes are up 5% year-over-year. We're getting good terms on storage, transportation and sales renewals in our business. 
Power burn on our pipe is up 8% year-over-year. And recall that power burn was up 16% from Q2 of '14 to '15. So there's strong compounding growth coming from the power sector. For the first time ever, gas is making up a larger share of the fuel for power generation than coal. That's been true year-to-date for 2016 and is very close in 2015. In the last, most recent quarter, Q2 of '16, 35% of generation came from gas versus 27% from coal. Gas exports are up on our system, too. Exports to Mexico have grown to 3.3 Bcf a day and 3/4 of that volume moves on Kinder Morgan pipes. We continue to believe, and we're seeing the need for natural gas transportation and storage services growing as the demand in the power sector -- power generation sector, industrial sectors continues to grow, along with export demand from Mexico in LNG. 
The Products Pipelines. We're getting the benefit year-over-year of higher volumes on KMCC and Cochin and the start-up on the second splitter unit in the Houston Ship Channel. 
In Terminals, we are seeing the benefit of new liquids capacity coming online. And remember, liquids makes up a little better than 3/4 of our segment earnings before DD&A in this business, and we're also seeing increased utilization of that expanded capacity. So more capacity online and higher overall utilization of that capacity. The second quarter was a record-setting quarter for throughput on our liquids terminals. 
On the bulk side, while coal volumes are down year-over-year, other bulk volumes are partially offsetting that declines, particularly in petcoke and metals. We also renewed our steel handling arrangement with Nucor for 10 years with some value enhancements in that new deal. Overall, the bulk part of the business, the entire year-over-year change can be explained by the coal bankruptcy. 
The negatives affecting the business on a year-over-year basis are, of course, lower commodity prices, which affect us directly in the enhanced oil recovery part of CO2 and indirectly in our gathered volumes of gas and crude and condensates. But even with oil prices and gas prices that are lower year-over-year by 18% and 26%, respectively, we're showing durable performance from our portfolio [indiscernible]. 
Lastly, an update on our Trans Mountain expansion. This continues to be a ""2 steps forward, 1 step back"" development. I'll start with the fundamentals. What we consistently hear from our producer customers in Canada is that they're counting on this project to get built. Putting the recent fires aside in Alberta, production continues to grow and take-away capacity projects continue to be behind the demand. Oil prices have hurt Alberta for sure. But from the perspective of our expansion, the supply and demand fundamentals for take-away capacity are good. We're in the midst of the federal review process, as Rich mentioned. We have our NEB recommendation, finding the project to be in the public interest and the federal government is undertaking its further consultation process with the objective of final decision in December this year. We've made great progress with communities along the route, have agreements of support from a majority of the most directly affected First Nations stand [ph] We are actively engaged with the B.C. government on the satisfaction of their 5 conditions, and we are making very good progress there. We are going to be actively working with contractors over the summer on the always-challenging work on cost and final scope of the project. 
Finally, before turning over to Kim for the financials, I'm going to point out that you probably noticed the release is in a slightly different format than usual. What we're doing is showing GAAP measures with equal or greater prominence per the recent SEC guidance to public company. As always, we'll continue to show you all the numbers, including the non-GAAP measures that we use in our management of the business. But this is the format we'll show going forward. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Kim."
34952431,375871248,1009588,"Kinder Morgan, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 20, 2016",2016-07-20,"Earnings Calls","Kinder Morgan, Inc.","Executives","Okay. Thanks, Steve. Let me start by reiterating 3 overall financial points that Rich mentioned to you that we believe you should take away from this call. Number one, as Rich said, our full year guidance has not change from the updated guidance we gave y",1142,"Okay. Thanks, Steve. Let me start by reiterating 3 overall financial points that Rich mentioned to you that we believe you should take away from this call. Number one, as Rich said, our full year guidance has not change from the updated guidance we gave you last quarter. We continue to expect that EBITDA will be about 3% below budget and DCF will be approximately 4% below budget. 
To be consistent with the guidance we gave you last quarter, this guidance does not include the impact of the SNG JV which we anticipate will close in the late third or early fourth quarter. Secondly, we expect to end the year at 5.3x debt-to-EBITDA, which is down from our budget guidance and the guidance we gave you last quarter, largely as a result of our balance sheet improvement efforts. When you annualize the EBITDA impact from the SNG transaction, we expect that the full year impact would be slightly higher than the 5.3x. And third, our debt-to-EBITDA target is still around 5x. And once we reach that level, we will decide how to return value to shareholders, and we're not committing to a specific method at this time. 
On our dividend. Today, we're declaring a dividend of $0.125 per share consistent with our budget and the guidance we gave you in December of last year. 
Looking at our GAAP income statement, you will see that revenues are down significantly. As I say in many quarters, we do not believe that revenue or the changes in revenues are necessarily good predictors of our performance. We have some businesses where revenues and expense fluctuate with commodity prices, but margin generally does not. Which is why you also see a large change in cost of sales during the quarter. In addition, our GAAP numbers can be impacted by noncash, nonrecurring accounting entries for what we call certain items.
So if you turn to the second page of numbers, which shows our DCF for the quarter and year-to-date, I believe you'll get a better picture of our performance. We generated total DCF for the quarter of $1.05 billion versus $1.095 billion for the comparable period in 2015. Therefore, total DCF was down about $45 million or 4%. The segments were down approximately $31 million or 2% with a $59 million decrease in CO2 offsetting increases in terminals and products. The $31 million decrease in the segments was partially offset by $23 million decrease in G&A and interest expense. If you net out the $39 million increase in our preferred stock dividends, you get a DCF variance of $47 million versus the $45 million that we show on the page. There are a bunch of other moving parts, but that gives you the main one. 
DCF per share was $0.47 in the quarter versus $0.50 for the second quarter of last year or down $0.03, with about $0.02 associated with the DCF variance that I just walked you through and about $0.01 due to the additional shares that we issued during 2015 to finance our growth projects and maintain our balance sheet. Therefore, despite approximately 20% decline in commodity prices versus the second quarter of last year, our performance was down approximately 4%. We believe these results demonstrate the resiliency of our cash flows generated by a large diversified platform of primarily fee-based assets. 
Certain items in the quarter were relatively small, they are income of approximately $8 million. But let me describe a couple of them that you wouldn't have seen before, so you can make sure you know what they are. We had a contract early-termination revenue, which is $39 million of income, which was associated with a customer buying out of its source contract on one of our Texas Intrastate storage fields. We also had a $21 million in legal and environmental reserves, and that was primarily related to settlement of our over 10-year litigation matter with the city of San Diego. 
Now let me give you a little bit more granularity on our expected performance for the full year versus our budget. We expect natural gas pipelines to come in approximately 2% below its budget, primarily as a result of the lower volumes in our midstream group and a 4.5 months in-service delay on our EEC/SNG pipeline expansion as a result of a delay in receiving our FERC certificate. 
CO2 is expected to end the year on its budget. And essentially, here what's happening is we have some price help and cost savings that are offsetting a little bit lower oil and CO2 volumes than we budgeted. We currently expect Terminals to end the year about 4% below its budget, primarily due to the impact of the coal bankruptcy. We expect products to end the year approximately 5% below its budget due to lower crude and condensate volume on KMCC, Double H and Double Eagle, lower rates on our SSPP pipeline and the sale of our Parkway Pipeline. Right now, we're projecting KMC to be essentially on budget. 
On the expense side, interest, cash taxes, G&A and sustaining CapEx on a combined basis are expected to come in positive versus budget, or said another way, generate a favorable variance, primarily as a result of lower interest. 
And with that, I will move to the balance sheet. On the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $41.3 billion in debt. That is an increase in debt of about $97 million since the end of last year and is a decrease in debt versus where we ended the first quarter of about $234 million. So let me reconcile that for you. 
DCF in the quarter, as I mentioned a moment ago, was $1.05 billion. We spent about 800 -- a little under $870 million on expansion CapEx and contributions to equity investments. We distributed or paid dividends of about $279 million. We have -- we received proceeds from asset divestitures and JVs of about $220 million, and then working capital and other items was a source of cash of about $110 million. 
Year-to-date, we generated $2.28 billion in distributable cash flow. We spent about $1.88 on expansion capital, on acquisitions and on contributions to equity investments with the only significant acquisition being the acquisition of the BP terminals in the first quarter. We paid dividends of $558 million and we have proceeds from asset divestitures and JVs of $220 million and then we had working capitals used of about $160 million to get you to the $97 million increase in debt year-to-date. 
We ended the quarter at about 5.6x debt-to-EBITDA, which is consistent where we ended last year and consistent where we ended the first quarter. And as we have mentioned a couple of times on the call, we expect to end the year at 5.3x debt-to-EBITDA. 
So with that, I'll turn it back to Rich."

So it's probably a little bit worse than what we would have been shooting for, hoping for. But I think we've taken the right steps during the quarter to get some volumes and send it back on the system. And so I look for improvements here. Yes, and then on power, we were watching to kind of see how power generation would play out. I think I'll say, and Tom Martin is here, too, a little surprised to the upside on the year-over-year improvement when you think about how big of a leap we had last year. Now if you look at the year-to-date number, it's not quite as strong because we had that weak winter. And so Q1 was actually down a bit. But if you look on a Q2-to-Q2 basis, after having a very, very robust growth from '14 to '15, we saw growth on top of that -- of 8%. And here, I'm just talking about our system. So 8% on top of that 16% that we saw before which I think was -- is very strong, and I think bodes well. We had another data point there, as we had 5 of our 6 biggest days for power generation on the SNG system happened in the last 45 days: 5 of our biggest -- 5 of the 6 biggest."

As we said last week, I mean, in general, it's not going to make a lot of sense for us, in general, to be selling interests in up and running assets. That tends to be an expensive way to raise capital. It was -- I would characterize it as a somewhat unique opportunity in the SNG case, because what we had there is our largest customer, a great power market in the Southeast U.S. and some specifically identified and agreed to opportunities that we can jointly pursue in this JV that, again, somewhat unusual for such a transaction would actually make the sale of interest in an existing asset accretive in the medium term. I think that's a fairly unique situation. We had, as Kim mentioned in some of her updates on the cash numbers, proceeds from other asset sales that we did. And again, they are, I think, we've had a few others, they're somewhat exceptional, and it's either a case where -- it's really a case where the customer on the asset or a third party has a much higher value or places a higher strategic value on the underlying asset. Parkway was an example. There were some others, smaller examples during the quarter. We sold a small -- a transmix facility, which we were essentially just doing spot business through and really not making much of anything on it. We had a third party who's interested in doing more with that asset. And so again, I think those are exceptional cases. But where we see them, we go get them."

And we're pleased that the stock has rallied here post the announcement on SNG, to the $22 range, but that's still about a 9% yield on DCF.

And I mean, we're starting to see some people come back to the Eagle Ford. But you not only have to come back, you have to bring a lot of rigs back in order to see that flatten back out and then start to increase. And frankly, I don't think the basin is at that point yet. And so most of what we have been focusing on is where we lost some volumes to third parties, we're trying to incent those to come back to the system rather than just collecting the deficiency charges from those customers. And as I said, I think we've made some good progress over the course of the quarter in doing that. But by the -- the over -- so long as the overall basin is declining, we're -- what we're doing is fighting off decline and trying to stay above that decline rate, if you will. But I don't know if -- it depends on whether the basin decline starts to slow and level out. Now I'll point out to -- because we haven't talked about Highland. We actually had year-over-year and over budget improvement on our Highland gathering assets in North Dakota. A lot of that was due to, also, restructuring of contracts and primarily migrating them from percent of proceeds to fee based, which gives us both greater stability, but also happened to have a beneficial impact on this year's earnings. So we've talked a lot about Eagle Ford. In the Haynesville, we've done an arrangement to try to incent a current customer to do some drilling. And there, what we've done is we've divided, if you will, the contract between what's already under contract to us and new or incremental wells and providing discounts there to try to incent some drilling.

One is we want to get our debt-to-EBITDA down into the vicinity of 5x, okay? The other thing we want to do is grow the DCF per share. And that involves investing in projects, as we've described, and getting good returns for the capital that we do deploy. And we're doing this in a context of being self-funding. So we are trying to make sure that we are dedicating our capital that we have to the best returns we can get and not be in a position where we have to access the capital market; where we have to access the capital market. And so those are really the things we are balancing. We remain focused on getting the balance sheet in order and then improving our DCF per share. And we believe, following that course will allow us to be in a position to return cash to shareholders. I think if you look at what our opportunities, and it remains to be seen what the total investment opportunity is going to be out there, but I think there's a very reasonable case, right, a reasonable scenario where we're in a situation where we're generating significantly more cash, particularly as these projects come online, more cash than we're investing. And when we're in that position, we're going to be also in a position to either -- as we've said multiple times, either further delever the balance sheet or return value to shareholders in the form of buybacks or increase the dividend. And as we get closer in time too, that we'll be evaluating which one of those approaches is the best way for maximizing -- to maximize shareholder value."

Before I turn it over to our CEO, Steve Kean; and our CFO, Kim Dang, let me make a couple of brief comments, one more industry-wide in nature and the other specific to KMI. 
Let's start with the industry-wide thought. We continue to be bullish on the prospects for North American energy, especially natural gas. And as the largest midstream energy company in North America, we believe we're well positioned in our existing businesses and with our backlog of growth projects. 
Fossil fuels and especially natural gas, which has now surpassed coal as the primary fuel source for power generation in the U.S., are going to be needed for a long, long time. I would add that natural gas is a key in reducing CO2 emissions in America. For example, despite a substantial increase in electric generation over the levels of 1993, the CO2 emissions from electric generation in 2015 were flat to those in 1993, largely as a result of the increased use of natural gas to generate that electricity. So natural gas is playing a major role in reducing emissions. But there have been recent controversies, as you all know, surrounding new pipeline projects and I'd like to offer my perspective. 
First, to the extent it becomes difficult to build new infrastructure that tends to make existing pipeline networks more valuable, and we obviously have a tremendous existing network. 
Second, while the protesters tend to get the headlines, it is still possible to build out new infrastructure. This quarter, for example, we completed an expansion on our Texas gas pipeline network. 
Third and maybe most importantly, I think, is to distinguish the permitting environment both geographically and jurisdictionally. There is a big difference, for example, between state-permitted projects where eminent domain is a function of state law and a federally certificated natural gas project. Ultimately, we realize that the environment is changing and we are adapting by building those changing circumstances into how we budget and plan our projects. 
Now to the comments specific to Kinder Morgan. During the third quarter, we substantially reduced our debt, and this positions us for long-term value creation. We are now ahead of our plan for 2016 year-end leverage. And as the Chairman and largest shareholder of the company, I'm very pleased with the progress we're making toward achieving our target leverage level of around 5x net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA. This will put us in a position to deliver substantial value to our shareholders through dividend increases, share repurchases, attractive growth projects or further debt reduction. 
Now because we get so many questions regarding these alternatives, let me expand a bit on this subject. Our current view leans towered increasing the dividend substantially while maintaining both greater coverage than in the past and a stronger balance sheet. That said, we'll obviously make the best economic decision at the time we reach that point, and we can't give you exact timing on when we will reach our target because there are numerous factors involved. But as I said, the message today is we're pleased with the progress to date. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Steve."

So I'll update on capital projects and counter-party credit and then hit on some segment highlights and trends. On the capital update, 2 of our larger projects, first on Trans Mountain. On that expansion, I'll start with the fundamen",1713,"Okay. Thanks, Rich. So I'll update on capital projects and counter-party credit and then hit on some segment highlights and trends. 
On the capital update, 2 of our larger projects, first on Trans Mountain. On that expansion, I'll start with the fundamentals. We consistently hear from producers in Canada and some refiners in the Northwest U.S. that they're counting on this project to get built. Production is expected to continue growing even though it's at a slower rate out of the oil sands, and takeaway capacity projects continue to lag the demand. Oil prices have hurt the oil sands, no question. But from the perspective of our expansion, the supply-and-demand fundamentals for new takeaway capacity are good. We're nearing the end of the federal review process right now. We have already the recommendation finding the project to be in a public interest, and the federal government has undertaken its further consultation process with the objective of a final decision in December of this year. We've made great progress with communities along the route and have agreements with the majority of the most directly affected First Nations bands. We're actively engaged with the BC government on the satisfaction of their 5 conditions. 
Finally, I'll note that we do believe that this project would make a very good candidate for bringing in other investors through a joint venture or other structure. It is an attractive project economically, and there is substantial interest in it. We believe that the project needs to write [ph] them through the review processes that are nearing a conclusion now. But following those reviews, assuming the outcomes of favorable or if the outcomes are favorable, we would look to syndicate this investment. We've got a lot of options here, including self-funding. So we're not committing to any one approach, but we do think it's worth exploring the options at the right time. 
On Elba, we have our 7(c) certificate from FERC. We got that in June. But the news is that we have received now our first significant notices to proceed from FERC just this week, and that's the authorization and follows the 7(c) that takes our implementation plan and gives us permission to go forward with construction. So we and Shell, our customer, are prepared for us to begin construction starting the 1st of November. 
With respect to the rest of our projects. We've been talking for several quarters now about high-grading the backlog. That's making sure that we're attending to our balance sheet and also ensuring that we grow value through investments at attractive returns that we can fund out of the cash flow that we generate. That is without needing to access the capital markets. This quarter, our backlog stands at $13 billion. That's down from $13.5 billion last quarter. We believe it's an attractive slate of projects projected 6.5x CapEx-to-EBITDA multiple. 87% of the backlog is for fee-based projects in our Pipelines and Terminals businesses. The changes from that $13.5 billion to the $13 billion, we put $600 million worth of projects into service during the quarter, including bringing on intrastate Texas gas crossover project that's in support of LNG in Mexico markets, taking delivery of 2 Jones Act vessels which are under charter, completing 2 smaller liquids terminal expansions, and we completed Phase I of our Tall Cotton enhanced oil recovery project. So $600 million went into service. We added a little over $200 million of projects in the quarter, $130 million of that in gas and $75 million in CO2 where we continue to see good returns even at current prices. If you look at the year-to-date numbers, we've added a little under $600 million, about $575 million, in new projects. Now that's been -- the backlog has been coming down. So that's been more than -- those additions have been more than offset by projects going into service and in project cancellations earlier in the year. But overall, I think what this shows you is we've been successful in doing what we set out to do. We have high-graded the backlog to strengthen our balance sheet and enabled the funding of our growth projects without needing to access capital markets while continuing to add projects where we find them at attractive returns. 
Turning to customer credit. We have a broad, diverse customer base with overall very good credit quality. We continue our extreme focus throughout our commercial and corporate organizations, active monitoring, calling for collateral, et cetera. And we've seen some stabilization in counter-party credit as our producer customers have been actively addressing their issues over the last few quarters. So in the past quarter, we were not impacted by any customer defaults. We had one customer file for bankruptcy, and the reorganized entity continued the contract with us. So no impact from customer defaults in the third quarter. 
So now turning to the segment for some highlights and trends there, starting with the GAAP measures. GAAP segment earnings were down $211 million for the quarter compared to the third quarter of 2015 primarily due to higher impairments in this quarter compared to the same quarter last year. Those were primarily comprised of a $350 million noncash impairment on our MEP investments, driven by the expectation of future lower contract rates and an approximately $84 million loss associated with the partial sale of SNG. 
If you look at segment earnings before DD&A and certain items, which is how we measure our performance, we're down $33 million or 2% quarter-to-quarter. CO2 is down $53 million year-over-year due to lower prices, $72 a barrel realized versus $74 in the third quarter of last year, and lower production. Nevertheless, we expect CO2 to make plan due to some price improvement versus our planned price and good performance on cost savings by that segment. 
Compared to the same quarter last year, gas is down 2% while Terminals and Products are up 22% and 7%, respectively. Overall, we think again that the quarter's performance demonstrates the resiliency of our cash flows even in difficult commodity price environments. 
Focusing on some of the broad trends affecting our business. First, in Natural Gas. We're seeing the demand-side developments that we anticipated. On our systems specifically, we're benefiting from increased demand for gas in the power sector, increased exports to Mexico and now, for the first time, increases due to LNG exports. 
On Kinder Morgan pipelines, power-driven gas demand was up 9% 3Q to 3Q from 6.5 Bcf last year to 7 Bcf this quarter. On a macro basis, gas is now overtaking coal, as Rich mentioned, as the fuel source for power generation. 
Mexico export demand on our pipelines grew by 6% year-over-year for the quarter and is up 15% on a comparable year-to-date number. We reached an average volume of 2.8 Bcf a day for the quarter, about 75% of total exports to Mexico.
We're in the early days of LNG export-driven demand. But even with the Sabine Pass outage in the last 2 weeks of the quarter, we experienced about 350 a day of LNG demand on our systems and much more to come there, we believe. 
Most of our $4 billion of backlog projects in the gas sector are directed at those 3 market trends plus one more, and that is the reversal projects on our TGP system to move more Marcellus and Utica gas to the South. 
Natural Gas, which is by far our largest segment, is kind of an 80-20 story, with approximately 80% of the budget segment earnings before DD&A attributable to transportation and storage, which benefits from the trends I just discussed; and the other 20% in gathering and processing. Our gathered volumes are down 17% to 18% year-over-year as a result of declines in the Eagle Ford, Oklahoma and the Bakken. 
Our Bakken midstream financial performance is up year-over-year and up versus planned, primarily due to contract restructuring earlier in the year. But overall, this business, outside of the take-or-pay commitments that we have, is dependent upon the recovery in those basins as gas demand grows and oil prices and, therefore, drilling recovers. 
We continue to believe that the need for natural gas transportation and storage capacity will grow as the demand trends that I talked about continue. And in the longer term, the gathering volumes flatten and turn up when we ultimately see recovery in the gas supply basins that we serve. 
In Products Pipelines, we're getting the benefit year-over-year of higher volumes. Refined products volumes are up 3% quarter-to-quarter and year-over-year and well above the growth in the EIA national numbers. Our crude and condensate volumes are up 6% year-over-year. Our NGL volumes are down 1%, primarily due to a plant -- a petrochemical plant turnaround by one of our customers. 
In Terminals, we're seeing the benefit of new liquids capacity coming online and increased utilization of that expanded capacity, so more capacity online and higher overall utilization. We also took delivery of 2 additional Jones Act vessels, which are under contract. Overall, the liquids portion of our Terminals business is over 75% of the segment earnings before DD&A before certain items. And the increased utilization we're seeing and the expansions we're bringing on are positives for that long-term outlook. 
With respect to the Jones Act vessels, we see medium-term market weakness there. We benefit from having charters in place for the vast majority of our vessels, and we have a modern fuel-efficient fleet that should be very competitive. But we expect some overcapacity in the market for the medium term, which will affect new charter rates and renewal rates until the overall U.S. fleet is right-sized from a capacity standpoint. 
On the bulk side, we're down slightly year-over-year, primarily, again, attributable to the coal vessels. 
In CO2, we had lower volumes year-over-year for the quarter, down 5%, with SACROC and gates [ph] down year-over-year; Katz, Goldsmith and Tall Cotton up year-over-year but below our plan. We also had strong NGL production of the segment, a record quarter, in fact, which is slightly higher than last year. And we also approved some new EOR development projects during the quarter and continue to find attractive return projects in this segment. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Kim for the financials."

Today, we're declaring a dividend of $0.125 per share, consistent with our budget and the guidance we gave you in December of last year. First, turning to the preliminary GAAP income statement. You will see that similar to the first",1819,"Okay. Thanks, Steve. Today, we're declaring a dividend of $0.125 per share, consistent with our budget and the guidance we gave you in December of last year. 
First, turning to the preliminary GAAP income statement. You will see that similar to the first 2 quarters of this year, revenues in the quarter are down significantly. As I say many quarters, we believe that revenue -- or the changes in revenue are not necessarily a good indicator of our performance. We have some businesses where revenues and expenses fluctuate with commodity prices but margin generally does not, which is why you also see a partially offsetting variance in cost of sales. 
In addition, both revenues and cost of sales can be impacted by noncash, sporadic accounting entries or certain items. The largest impact of the certain items on changes and revenues and cost of sales relates to the unrealized CO2 mark-to-market and hedging effectiveness impact on our change in revenues, which accounts for almost 40% of the $377 million change in revenues in the quarter. 
We had a net loss in the quarter of $227 million and a loss per share of $0.10 versus income of $186 million and earnings per share of $0.08 in the third quarter of last year, a reduction of $413 million and $0.18 a share. 
Now let me talk about what's driving that loss. We recorded a $230 million noncash after tax, and that's why that number is a little different from what Steve said because this is after-tax impairment on our MEP investment, driven by our expectations of lower future transportation contract rates and approximately a $350 million after-tax loss associated with the SNG transaction, most of which is noncash book tax expense. 
For those of you who are interested in how we can have such a large book tax expense on a relatively modest book loss when you would ordinarily expect a book tax benefit, I would be happy to explain later, but I'm not going to bore everybody with all the details at this point. Together, these 2 charges result in a net expense of $580 million and are the primary drivers of our $570 million in certain items for the quarter. So net income before certain items was a positive $343 million. The adjusted number in 2015 of -- was $345 million or down $2 million, essentially flat. EPS excluding certain items was $0.15 or down $0.01 versus the third quarter of 2015, so essentially flat when excluding certain items. 
Now let's turn to the second page of the financials, which shows our DCF for the quarter and year-to-date and is reconciled to our GAAP numbers in the earnings release. DCF is the primary financial measure on which management judges its performance. We generated total DCF for the quarter of $1.081 billion versus $1.129 billion for the comparable period in 2015, down $48 million or 4%. There are a lot of moving parts, but if you want a very simple explanation, it boils down to CO2 being down $53 million, primarily on lower commodity prices. But to take you through a more granular analysis, the segments were down by $33 million or 2%. As I previously mentioned, CO2 decreased $53 million and Natural Gas decreased about $18 million, with offsets -- those 2 segments were offset by increases in all of our other segments, with the largest dollar increase from the other segments coming from our Terminals segment. 
The Natural Gas segment would have been slightly positive if you exclude the impact of the SNG sale, which we sold a 50% interest in on September 1 of this year. Adding back an $11 million change in JV DD&A, which primarily reflects our increased interest in NGPL that we acquired in the fourth quarter of 2015, we add that back to the segment. The segment is now $33 million. The assets are really down about $22 million. This $22 million decrease was partially offset by $12 million benefit, i.e., lower expense when you combine G&A and interest expense. The $19 million in increased cash taxes, which is primarily driven by the fact that Citrus fully utilized its NOLs in 2015, is largely offset by an $18 million decrease in sustaining CapEx, a lot of which is cost savings. Netting out the $39 million increase in preferred stock dividends, you get to a DCF variance of $50 million versus the $48 million shown on the page. 
DCF per share was $0.48 in the quarter versus $0.51 for the third quarter of last year or down about -- down $0.03 per share, with about $0.02 associated with the DCF variance I just walked you through and about $0.01 due to the additional shares that were issued during 2015 to finance our growth projects and maintain our balance sheet. $0.48 in DCF per share results in $801 million in excess distributable cash flow above our $0.125 dividend for the quarter, and year-to-date, we've generated approximately $2.5 billion of excess distributable cash flow above our dividend. 
Now let me give you some details on our expected performance for the full year versus budget. Natural Gas Pipelines is expected to be approximately 5% below its budget due to the SNG transaction, lower volumes in our midstream group and a delay on our EEC/SNG pipeline expansion in service as a result of a delay in receiving our FERC certificate. If you exclude the impact of the sale of the 50% interest in SNG, we would have expected Natural Gas to be about 2% below its budget. So on an apples-to-apples basis, the 2% is consistent with what we told you last quarter for the Natural Gas Pipelines segment. 
CO2 is expected to end the year on its budget, consistent with the guidance we gave you last quarter. Some price help and cost savings are offsetting the lower-than-expected oil and CO2 volumes. 
We currently expect Terminals to end the year about 5% below its budget. That's slightly more than the 4% we discussed last quarter. The overall variance is due to the impact of the coal bankruptcies and lower throughput and ancillaries on some of our liquids terminals versus what we budgeted. Actually, throughput on our liquids terminals year-to-year, when you compare it to 2015, is actually up. It's just slightly lower than what we expected in our budget. 
We currently expect Products to end the year approximately 5% below its budget, consistent with the guidance we gave you last quarter, primarily due to lower crude and condensate volumes on KMCC, Double H and Double Eagle; lower throughput on KMST; and lower rates on our SFPP pipeline and as a result of the lost income due to the sale of Parkway. Consistent with last quarter, we are projecting KMC to be essentially on its budget. 
With respect to other items, interest, cash taxes, G&A and sustaining, on a combined basis for those items, we're expecting to come in lower than budget. Or said another way, they're expected to be a favorable variance, primarily as a result of lower interest and sustaining CapEx. Interest is expected to be approximately 4% below its budget. About half of those variance -- or over half of those variance is associated with the lower balance as a result of the SNG transaction, with the remaining variance driven primarily by lower rates. Sustaining CapEx is also expected to be approximately 4% lower than budget. 
Let me conclude with 2 overall financial points. On an apples-to-apples basis, our full year guidance has not changed from the updated guidance we gave you last quarter, when you exclude the impact from the 50% sale of SNG. We continue to expect that adjusted EBITDA will be about 3% below budget and DCF will be approximately 4% below budget. When you adjust for the 4-month impact of the 50% SNG sale, so not on an apples-to-apples basis with what we gave you last quarter, we expect EBITDA to be approximately 4% below budget. The DCF will also be approximately 4% below budget. DCF doesn't change versus SNG transaction versus no SNG transaction, given the interest rate savings -- 4% doesn't change, given the interest rate savings offset from the impact of the lost SNG EBITDA as we use all the proceeds from this transaction to reduce debt. 
And the second point is that we expect to end the year at 5.3x debt-to-EBITDA, which is also consistent with what we told you in the second quarter call. The 5.3 is down from our budget guidance of 5.5x, largely as a result of the SNG transaction. 
With that, I'll move to the balance sheet. When you look at total assets on the balance sheet, total assets are down $2.5 billion, and that's largely driven by the sale of the 50% interest in SNG. We ended the quarter with net debt of $39.25 billion, which is down $1.976 billion from the end of last year and down $2.073 billion from the second quarter. As I -- we ended the quarter at 5.3x debt-to-EBITDA, and as I said, that's where we would expect to end the year. The 5.3x is down from the 5.6x where we ended last year. 
Now to reconcile the change in debt for you for the quarter. As I said, debt is down $2.073 billion. We've generated DCF of $1.08 billion. We spent about $550 million in expansion CapEx, acquisitions and contributions to equity investments. We paid $280 million in dividends. We had proceeds from divestitures of about $1.43 billion, with the biggest being the SNG transaction. We also deconsolidated about $1.2 billion in debt as a result of the SNG transaction. And we also took $803 million of the cash that we received from that transaction and it is sitting in restricted cash, so in other current assets on our balance sheet. And we used that to pay debt on October 1. So that debt was not paid down as of 9/30 but has subsequently been paid down. And then we had $9 million of working capital and other items that was a use of cash. 
Year-to-date, the change in debt, $1.976 billion. So we've reduced debt by just under $2 billion. We've generated DCF of $3.36 billion. We had expansions, acquisitions and contributions to equity investments of $2.43 billion. We had -- we paid dividends of $839 million. We had proceeds from divestitures of $1.65 billion. We've deconsolidated $1.2 billion of SNG debt. We placed $800 million again into escrow, which is shown in restricted cash or other current assets on our balance sheet. Again, that paid down -- we used to pay down debt on October 1. And then we had working capital and other items that was a use of cash of about $168 million. And that gets you to the $1.976 billion reduction in debt. 
So with that, I'll turn it back over to Rich."

What we need to do is and we've been doing for months now is evaluating our project opportunities and having discussions with our customers that attempt to price and schedule in to our projects what is, no doubt, an enhanced regulatory burden for getting those projects through the permitting and approval process. So we have to make the appropriate adjustments. In terms of what can turn that around, again, this varies from place to place. I mean, we built our Texas pipeline over the summer effectively, and it's -- you have to go kind of place by place and kind of commodity by commodity to sort this out. But the bottom line is you need to fully take into account and we need to fully take into account the additional lengths and requirements that will be placed on the permitting process. So it's not that the whole world needs to change. This is a kind of a case-by-case consideration that you need to make. The other thing that can change the whole dynamic is, I think, increasingly, people will realize, those who don't already, that a big part of the answer to reduce CO2 emissions and cleaner power generation and compliance with the Clean Power Plan and things like that is enhanced -- is additional natural gas. And you don't get the additional natural gas without the additional gas infrastructure. So I think that's a driver that could potentially change some of that dynamic."

But we continue to explore options to JV assets, and that's one of the big variables and sort of what our plans are and how quickly we get to where we want to go.

We had a few of those. And the big transaction, of course, was SNG. And that was a bit unique circumstances. We're not generally in the business of selling cash flow and pipeline assets. But in that particular case, we have a partner who is bringing value, securing the asset but also bring incremental investment opportunities to the project. So it made a lot of sense for us to go ahead and do that. With respect to CO2 specifically, we like that business. It's a good business. We invest and get good returns on that business. It's a niche for us. We're not out chasing E&P and shale and offshore and things like that. We have CO2, which is a scarce commodity. And we have the infrastructure to get it delivered to EOR fields where it's the only thing that can free up oil, and we've integrated forward into enhanced oil recovery. And we've got expertise there, and we think we're good at it. So we like that business, and we're happy to keep running it. If you think about your question in terms of a transaction or a potential transaction, we are shareholder-directed company. And if there is a transaction to be done that will improve overall value for our shareholders, we are absolutely going to consider it and do it if it makes sense. The considerations around CO2 specifically is that it would probably slightly dilutive or somewhat dilutive. And then the question would have to be, is the multiple expansion that you get on the remaining EBITDA of the remaining business and the yield contraction on DCF that you get by having a better portfolio or a more stable portfolio of remaining businesses enough to offset that and produce real shareholder value? And certainly, there are theoretical numbers at which that would work. And so again, we are shareholder-directed company. We're going to do things that are going to make sense and create value for our shareholders."

And our game plan -- again, we would reserve the right to see what the facts on the ground are when we get to that point. But our game plan would be, we obviously have a lot of firepower, a lot of free cash flow. And to the extent we can substantially increase the dividend while still maintaining an adequate coverage ratio, and by that, I would mean that we would be able to fund the equity portion of our going rate of capital expenditures. We don't know exactly what that is, but we look back and you take out the pigs going through the boa constrictor like Trans Mountain, for example. You're kind of in that, I don't know, $2 billion, $2.5 billion, $3 billion in that range. And if you say once our balance sheet is where we want it, we're going to finance half of that out of retained cash and half of that back in the debt markets at that point in time, then you can get -- you can see your way clear to having a very nice dividend but with very nice coverage and maintaining a strong balance sheet. And that's really the trifecta that we're looking for. And I think, I mean, just look at this year, I think Kim emphasized this, we're right consistent, absent the SNG transaction, with where we told you in April and where we told you in July we're going to be. And that leaves the DCF of about $2 per share for this year, and we're paying out a $0.50 dividend. That's a whale of a spread between the 2. But at some point, when we get this balance sheet the way we want it, we're going to be able to take that dividend up substantially and still have adequate coverage. We're not going back to having $0.05 of coverage or something like that because we like to cover our portion -- the equity portion of a normalized CapEx program."

And I think my answer to the first will address the answer to the second question, which is the reason that we decreased the dividend primarily a year ago had to do with inefficient capital markets and not wanting to fund expansion CapEx in a market that wasn't rationally pricing debt and equity securities. And so I think that the debt market has changed. The equity market is still significantly different from where we were 12 months ago, 18 months ago. And so we are funding our CapEx program. So we -- in my mind, what we're constrained by, we do want to improve the balance sheet and that is the goal that we have. But what we're doing is that we're living within our cash flow, meaning that we want to be able to fund our equity -- our CapEx and our dividend from our cash flow. And so that is the constraint. And because -- and so -- because we have limited amount of capital, that is why we have the hurdle rates set at 15% unlevered after-tax IRR for projects. I fully anticipate that over time, as that CapEx comes down and also, as the balance sheet improves, that we would relax that standard. I don't know exactly what that number is going to be today. But it would be something less than the 15%. It probably won't be back at the 8% unlevered after-tax that we previously used for hurdle rate but we will have to make the assessment when that time comes."

But basically, I think our view is it's very hard to get big, newbuilds done into New England or into the Northeast. We've seen that not only with MEP which we talked about in the first quarter and discontinued. But also with recent rulings that I think verified that decision. It's making it harder to get things done on a kind of a mega- scale call it. Now we have continued to engage with our customers on smaller scale projects and we'll continue to pursue those. But I think from the perspective of right now, today, it is hard to get new, significant gas infrastructure built into New England. And that would intend to increase the basis differentials for, between what's already lowest price for gas in Dominion South, call it, and the New England market, which is the few -- the highest priced in North America and it just a few hundred miles away. So borrowing some improvement on an overall permitting environment, I think it's difficult to do those. But I think we're looking at the smaller projects to do. The other thing I think New England is a perfect example of what Rich said at the very beginning which is that it does tend to make existing -- the existing network more valuable. The other thing I'd add to Tom throw them what everyone's. With that TGP system is a system that is continuing to produce project opportunities for us. A lot of our backlog on TGP, a lot of our backlog on gas is on TGP. I mean, is the biggest home for us outside of the Elba project right now. And what a lot of the project capital is directed at now is getting the gas, as you know, Darren, South from the Marcellus and Utica to the new market, the new market area, which is now the Gulf Coast of the United States. And we are proceeding along very well with those. We're building on our existing footprint, that again, goes to the need to make distinctions between projects out there and infrastructure projects, building off of your existing footprint, adding compression, maybe laying some parallel pipe, things like that. That create a difference -- that's a different, in a federally certificated process, that's a different context in which to be doing your project expansions. So I think you'll see basis widen too in New England to the Northeast and I think we'll find plenty of things to invest in and [indiscernible] to invest in, on TGP, to get that gas someplace else."

But that annual burn rate commercial, of expansion CapEx is something in the range we talked about. And that's what we would want to use as providing enough coverage to pay for the ""equity portion"" of that burn rate. And I think under almost any scenario, that leaves a lot of money to pay dividends. But we'll just look at the exact circumstances when we reach that point."

I think the one place that we took a close look at was CO2 and certainly, in the oil price environment we saw earlier in the year, we took projects off the table and now, we're adding those back as we see oil prices recover. So look, after some -- are there some things that we might have been able to do if you were at an 8% world that we're not doing when we're in a 15% world? Yes, maybe so. But I think what we're talking about in the longer-term is return hurdles that we will relax off of the 15%, as Kim said.

As usual, before we begin, I'd like to remind you that today's earnings release and this call includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 as well as certain non-GAAP financial measures.

Before I turn it over to our CEO, Steve Kean; and our CFO, Kim Dang, let me make a couple of brief comments, one more industry-wide in nature and the other specific to KMI. 
Let's start with the industry-wide thought. We continue to be bullish on the prospects for North American energy, especially natural gas. And as the largest midstream energy company in North America, we believe we're well positioned in our existing businesses and with our backlog of growth projects. 
Fossil fuels and especially natural gas, which has now surpassed coal as the primary fuel source for power generation in the U.S., are going to be needed for a long, long time. I would add that natural gas is a key in reducing CO2 emissions in America. For example, despite a substantial increase in electric generation over the levels of 1993, the CO2 emissions from electric generation in 2015 were flat to those in 1993, largely as a result of the increased use of natural gas to generate that electricity. So natural gas is playing a major role in reducing emissions. But there have been recent controversies, as you all know, surrounding new pipeline projects and I'd like to offer my perspective. 
First, to the extent it becomes difficult to build new infrastructure that tends to make existing pipeline networks more valuable, and we obviously have a tremendous existing network. 
Second, while the protesters tend to get the headlines, it is still possible to build out new infrastructure. This quarter, for example, we completed an expansion on our Texas gas pipeline network. 
Third and maybe most importantly, I think, is to distinguish the permitting environment both geographically and jurisdictionally. There is a big difference, for example, between state-permitted projects where eminent domain is a function of state law and a federally certificated natural gas project. Ultimately, we realize that the environment is changing and we are adapting by building those changing circumstances into how we budget and plan our projects. 
Now to the comments specific to Kinder Morgan. During the third quarter, we substantially reduced our debt, and this positions us for long-term value creation. We are now ahead of our plan for 2016 year-end leverage. And as the Chairman and largest shareholder of the company, I'm very pleased with the progress we're making toward achieving our target leverage level of around 5x net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA. This will put us in a position to deliver substantial value to our shareholders through dividend increases, share repurchases, attractive growth projects or further debt reduction. 
Now because we get so many questions regarding these alternatives, let me expand a bit on this subject. Our current view leans towered increasing the dividend substantially while maintaining both greater coverage than in the past and a stronger balance sheet. That said, we'll obviously make the best economic decision at the time we reach that point, and we can't give you exact timing on when we will reach our target because there are numerous factors involved. But as I said, the message today is we're pleased with the progress to date. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Steve."

So I'll update on capital projects and counter-party credit and then hit on some segment highlights and trends. On the capital update, 2 of our larger projects, first on Trans Mountain. On that expansion, I'll start with the fundamen",1711,"Okay. Thanks, Rich. So I'll update on capital projects and counter-party credit and then hit on some segment highlights and trends. 
On the capital update, 2 of our larger projects, first on Trans Mountain. On that expansion, I'll start with the fundamentals. We consistently hear from producers in Canada and some refiners in the Northwest U.S. that they're counting on this project to get built. Production is expected to continue growing even though it's at a slower rate out of the oil sands, and takeaway capacity projects continue to lag the demand. Oil prices have hurt the oil sands, no question. But from the perspective of our expansion, the supply-and-demand fundamentals for new takeaway capacity are good. We're nearing the end of the federal review process right now. We have already the recommendation finding the project to be in a public interest, and the federal government has undertaken its further consultation process with the objective of a final decision in December of this year. We've made great progress with communities along the route and have agreements with the majority of the most directly affected First Nations bands. We're actively engaged with the BC government on the satisfaction of their 5 conditions. 
Finally, I'll note that we do believe that this project would make a very good candidate for bringing in other investors through a joint venture or other structure. It is an attractive project economically, and there is substantial interest in it. We believe that the project needs to ripen through the review processes that are nearing a conclusion now. But following those reviews, assuming the outcomes of favorable or if the outcomes are favorable, we would look to syndicate this investment. We've got a lot of options here, including self-funding. So we're not committing to any one approach, but we do think it's worth exploring the options at the right time. 
On Elba, we have our 7(c) certificate from FERC. We got that in June. But the news is that we have received now our first significant notices to proceed from FERC just this week, and that's the authorization and follows the 7(c) that takes our implementation plan and gives us permission to go forward with construction. So we and Shell, our customer, are prepared for us to begin construction starting the 1st of November. 
With respect to the rest of our projects. We've been talking for several quarters now about high-grading the backlog. That's making sure that we're attending to our balance sheet and also ensuring that we grow value through investments at attractive returns that we can fund out of the cash flow that we generate. That is without needing to access the capital markets. This quarter, our backlog stands at $13 billion. That's down from $13.5 billion last quarter. We believe it's an attractive slate of projects projected 6.5x CapEx-to-EBITDA multiple. 87% of the backlog is for fee-based projects in our Pipelines and Terminals businesses. The changes from that $13.5 billion to the $13 billion, we put $600 million worth of projects into service during the quarter, including bringing on intrastate Texas gas crossover project that's in support of LNG in Mexico markets, taking delivery of 2 Jones Act vessels which are under charter, completing 2 smaller liquids terminal expansions, and we completed Phase I of our Tall Cotton enhanced oil recovery project. So $600 million went into service. We added a little over $200 million of projects in the quarter, $130 million of that in gas and $75 million in CO2 where we continue to see good returns even at current prices. If you look at the year-to-date numbers, we've added a little under $600 million, about $575 million, in new projects. Now that's been -- the backlog has been coming down. So that's been more than -- those additions have been more than offset by projects going into service and in project cancellations earlier in the year. But overall, I think what this shows you is we've been successful in doing what we set out to do. We have high-graded the backlog to strengthen our balance sheet and enabled the funding of our growth projects without needing to access capital markets while continuing to add projects where we find them at attractive returns. 
Turning to customer credit. We have a broad, diverse customer base with overall very good credit quality. We continue our extreme focus throughout our commercial and corporate organizations, active monitoring, calling for collateral, et cetera. And we've seen some stabilization in counter-party credit as our producer customers have been actively addressing their issues over the last few quarters. So in the past quarter, we were not impacted by any customer defaults. We had one customer file for bankruptcy, and the reorganized entity continued the contract with us. So no impact from customer defaults in the third quarter. 
So now turning to the segment for some highlights and trends there, starting with the GAAP measures. GAAP segment earnings were down $211 million for the quarter compared to the third quarter of 2015 primarily due to higher impairments in this quarter compared to the same quarter last year. Those were primarily comprised of a $350 million noncash impairment on our MEP investments, driven by the expectation of future lower contract rates and an approximately $84 million loss associated with the partial sale of SNG. 
If you look at segment earnings before DD&A and certain items, which is how we measure our performance, we're down $33 million or 2% quarter-to-quarter. CO2 is down $53 million year-over-year due to lower prices, $72 a barrel realized versus $74 in the third quarter of last year, and lower production. Nevertheless, we expect CO2 to make plan due to some price improvement versus our planned price and good performance on cost savings by that segment. 
Compared to the same quarter last year, gas is down 2% while Terminals and Products are up 22% and 7%, respectively. Overall, we think again that the quarter's performance demonstrates the resiliency of our cash flows even in difficult commodity price environments. 
Focusing on some of the broad trends affecting our business. First, in Natural Gas. We're seeing the demand-side developments that we anticipated. On our systems specifically, we're benefiting from increased demand for gas in the power sector, increased exports to Mexico and now, for the first time, increases due to LNG exports. 
On Kinder Morgan pipelines, power-driven gas demand was up 9% 3Q to 3Q from 6.5 Bcf last year to 7 Bcf this quarter. On a macro basis, gas is now overtaking coal, as Rich mentioned, as the fuel source for power generation. 
Mexico export demand on our pipelines grew by 6% year-over-year for the quarter and is up 15% on a comparable year-to-date number. We reached an average volume of 2.8 Bcf a day for the quarter, about 75% of total exports to Mexico.
We're in the early days of LNG export-driven demand. But even with the Sabine Pass outage in the last 2 weeks of the quarter, we experienced about 350 a day of LNG demand on our systems and much more to come there, we believe. 
Most of our $4 billion of backlog projects in the gas sector are directed at those 3 market trends plus one more, and that is the reversal projects on our TGP system to move more Marcellus and Utica gas to the South. 
Natural Gas, which is by far our largest segment, is kind of an 80-20 story, with approximately 80% of the budget segment earnings before DD&A attributable to transportation and storage, which benefits from the trends I just discussed; and the other 20% in gathering and processing. Our gathered volumes are down 17% to 18% year-over-year as a result of declines in the Eagle Ford, Oklahoma and the Bakken. 
Our Bakken midstream financial performance is up year-over-year and up versus planned, primarily due to contract restructuring earlier in the year. But overall, this business, outside of the take-or-pay commitments that we have, is dependent upon the recovery in those basins as gas demand grows and oil prices and, therefore, drilling recovers. 
We continue to believe that the need for natural gas transportation and storage capacity will grow as the demand trends that I talked about continue. And in the longer term, the gathering volumes flatten and turn up when we ultimately see recovery in the gas supply basins that we serve. 
In Products Pipelines, we're getting the benefit year-over-year of higher volumes. Refined products volumes are up 3% quarter-to-quarter and year-over-year and well above the growth in the EIA national numbers. Our crude and condensate volumes are up 6% year-over-year. Our NGL volumes are down 1%, primarily due to a plant -- a petrochemical plant turnaround by one of our customers. 
In Terminals, we're seeing the benefit of new liquids capacity coming online and increased utilization of that expanded capacity, so more capacity online and higher overall utilization. We also took delivery of 2 additional Jones Act vessels, which are under contract. Overall, the liquids portion of our Terminals business is over 75% of the segment earnings before DD&A before certain items. And the increased utilization we're seeing and the expansions we're bringing on are positives for that long-term outlook. 
With respect to the Jones Act vessels, we see medium-term market weakness there. We benefit from having charters in place for the vast majority of our vessels, and we have a modern fuel-efficient fleet that should be very competitive. But we expect some overcapacity in the market for the medium term, which will affect new charter rates and renewal rates until the overall U.S. fleet is right-sized from a capacity standpoint. 
On the bulk side, we're down slightly year-over-year, primarily, again, attributable to the coal vessels. 
In CO2, we had lower volumes year-over-year for the quarter, down 5%, with SACROC and gates [ph] down year-over-year; Katz, Goldsmith and Tall Cotton up year-over-year but below our plan. We also had strong NGL production of the segment, a record quarter, in fact, which is slightly higher than last year. And we also approved some new EOR development projects during the quarter and continue to find attractive return projects in this segment. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Kim for the financials."

Today, we're declaring a dividend of $0.125 per share, consistent with our budget and the guidance we gave you in December of last year. First, turning to the preliminary GAAP income statement. You will see that similar to the first",1819,"Okay. Thanks, Steve. Today, we're declaring a dividend of $0.125 per share, consistent with our budget and the guidance we gave you in December of last year. 
First, turning to the preliminary GAAP income statement. You will see that similar to the first 2 quarters of this year, revenues in the quarter are down significantly. As I say many quarters, we believe that revenue -- or the changes in revenue are not necessarily a good indicator of our performance. We have some businesses where revenues and expenses fluctuate with commodity prices but margin generally does not, which is why you also see a partially offsetting variance in cost of sales. 
In addition, both revenues and cost of sales can be impacted by noncash, sporadic accounting entries or certain items. The largest impact of the certain items on changes and revenues and cost of sales relates to the unrealized CO2 mark-to-market and hedging effectiveness impact on our change in revenues, which accounts for almost 40% of the $377 million change in revenues in the quarter. 
We had a net loss in the quarter of $227 million and a loss per share of $0.10 versus income of $186 million and earnings per share of $0.08 in the third quarter of last year, a reduction of $413 million and $0.18 a share. 
Now let me talk about what's driving that loss. We recorded a $230 million noncash after tax, and that's why that number is a little different from what Steve said because this is after-tax impairment on our MEP investment, driven by our expectations of lower future transportation contract rates and approximately a $350 million after-tax loss associated with the SNG transaction, most of which is noncash book tax expense. 
For those of you who are interested in how we can have such a large book tax expense on a relatively modest book loss when you would ordinarily expect a book tax benefit, I would be happy to explain later, but I'm not going to bore everybody with all the details at this point. Together, these 2 charges result in a net expense of $580 million and are the primary drivers of our $570 million in certain items for the quarter. So net income before certain items was a positive $343 million. The adjusted number in 2015 of -- was $345 million or down $2 million, essentially flat. EPS excluding certain items was $0.15 or down $0.01 versus the third quarter of 2015, so essentially flat when excluding certain items. 
Now let's turn to the second page of the financials, which shows our DCF for the quarter and year-to-date and is reconciled to our GAAP numbers in the earnings release. DCF is the primary financial measure on which management judges its performance. We generated total DCF for the quarter of $1.081 billion versus $1.129 billion for the comparable period in 2015, down $48 million or 4%. There are a lot of moving parts, but if you want a very simple explanation, it boils down to CO2 being down $53 million, primarily on lower commodity prices. But to take you through a more granular analysis, the segments were down by $33 million or 2%. As I previously mentioned, CO2 decreased $53 million and Natural Gas decreased about $18 million, with offsets -- those 2 segments were offset by increases in all of our other segments, with the largest dollar increase from the other segments coming from our Terminals segment. 
The Natural Gas segment would have been slightly positive if you exclude the impact of the SNG sale, which we sold a 50% interest in on September 1 of this year. Adding back an $11 million change in JV DD&A, which primarily reflects our increased interest in NGPL that we acquired in the fourth quarter of 2015, we add that back to the segment. The segment is now $33 million. The assets are really down about $22 million. This $22 million decrease was partially offset by $12 million benefit, i.e., lower expense when you combine G&A and interest expense. The $19 million in increased cash taxes, which is primarily driven by the fact that Citrus fully utilized its NOLs in 2015, is largely offset by an $18 million decrease in sustaining CapEx, a lot of which is cost savings. Netting out the $39 million increase in preferred stock dividends, you get to a DCF variance of $50 million versus the $48 million shown on the page. 
DCF per share was $0.48 in the quarter versus $0.51 for the third quarter of last year or down about -- down $0.03 per share, with about $0.02 associated with the DCF variance I just walked you through and about $0.01 due to the additional shares that were issued during 2015 to finance our growth projects and maintain our balance sheet. $0.48 in DCF per share results in $801 million in excess distributable cash flow above our $0.125 dividend for the quarter, and year-to-date, we've generated approximately $2.5 billion of excess distributable cash flow above our dividend. 
Now let me give you some details on our expected performance for the full year versus budget. Natural Gas Pipelines is expected to be approximately 5% below its budget due to the SNG transaction, lower volumes in our midstream group and a delay on our EEC/SNG pipeline expansion in service as a result of a delay in receiving our FERC certificate. If you exclude the impact of the sale of the 50% interest in SNG, we would have expected Natural Gas to be about 2% below its budget. So on an apples-to-apples basis, the 2% is consistent with what we told you last quarter for the Natural Gas Pipelines segment. 
CO2 is expected to end the year on its budget, consistent with the guidance we gave you last quarter. Some price help and cost savings are offsetting the lower-than-expected oil and CO2 volumes. 
We currently expect Terminals to end the year about 5% below its budget. That's slightly more than the 4% we discussed last quarter. The overall variance is due to the impact of the coal bankruptcies and lower throughput and ancillaries on some of our liquids terminals versus what we budgeted. Actually, throughput on our liquids terminals year-to-year, when you compare it to 2015, is actually up. It's just slightly lower than what we expected in our budget. 
We currently expect Products to end the year approximately 5% below its budget, consistent with the guidance we gave you last quarter, primarily due to lower crude and condensate volumes on KMCC, Double H and Double Eagle; lower throughput on KMST; and lower rates on our SFPP pipeline and as a result of the lost income due to the sale of Parkway. Consistent with last quarter, we are projecting KMC to be essentially on its budget. 
With respect to other items, interest, cash taxes, G&A and sustaining, on a combined basis for those items, we're expecting to come in lower than budget. Or said another way, they're expected to be a favorable variance, primarily as a result of lower interest and sustaining CapEx. Interest is expected to be approximately 4% below its budget. About half of those variance -- or over half of those variance is associated with the lower balance as a result of the SNG transaction, with the remaining variance driven primarily by lower rates. Sustaining CapEx is also expected to be approximately 4% lower than budget. 
Let me conclude with 2 overall financial points. On an apples-to-apples basis, our full year guidance has not changed from the updated guidance we gave you last quarter, when you exclude the impact from the 50% sale of SNG. We continue to expect that adjusted EBITDA will be about 3% below budget and DCF will be approximately 4% below budget. When you adjust for the 4-month impact of the 50% SNG sale, so not on an apples-to-apples basis with what we gave you last quarter, we expect EBITDA to be approximately 4% below budget. The DCF will also be approximately 4% below budget. DCF doesn't change versus SNG transaction versus no SNG transaction, given the interest rate savings -- 4% doesn't change, given the interest rate savings offset from the impact of the lost SNG EBITDA as we use all the proceeds from this transaction to reduce debt. 
And the second point is that we expect to end the year at 5.3x debt-to-EBITDA, which is also consistent with what we told you in the second quarter call. The 5.3 is down from our budget guidance of 5.5x, largely as a result of the SNG transaction. 
With that, I'll move to the balance sheet. When you look at total assets on the balance sheet, total assets are down $2.5 billion, and that's largely driven by the sale of the 50% interest in SNG. We ended the quarter with net debt of $39.25 billion, which is down $1.976 billion from the end of last year and down $2.073 billion from the second quarter. As I -- we ended the quarter at 5.3x debt-to-EBITDA, and as I said, that's where we would expect to end the year. The 5.3x is down from the 5.6x where we ended last year. 
Now to reconcile the change in debt for you for the quarter. As I said, debt is down $2.073 billion. We've generated DCF of $1.08 billion. We spent about $550 million in expansion CapEx, acquisitions and contributions to equity investments. We paid $280 million in dividends. We had proceeds from divestitures of about $1.43 billion, with the biggest being the SNG transaction. We also deconsolidated about $1.2 billion in debt as a result of the SNG transaction. And we also took $803 million of the cash that we received from that transaction and it is sitting in restricted cash, so in other current assets on our balance sheet. And we used that to pay debt on October 1. So that debt was not paid down as of 9/30 but has subsequently been paid down. And then we had $9 million of working capital and other items that was a use of cash. 
Year-to-date, the change in debt, $1.976 billion. So we've reduced debt by just under $2 billion. We've generated DCF of $3.36 billion. We had expansions, acquisitions and contributions to equity investments of $2.43 billion. We had -- we paid dividends of $839 million. We had proceeds from divestitures of $1.65 billion. We've deconsolidated $1.2 billion of SNG debt. We placed $800 million again into escrow, which is shown in restricted cash or other current assets on our balance sheet. Again, that paid down -- we used to pay down debt on October 1. And then we had working capital and other items that was a use of cash of about $168 million. And that gets you to the $1.976 billion reduction in debt. 
So with that, I'll turn it back over to Rich."

So it's not that the whole world needs to change. This is a kind of a case-by-case consideration that you need to make. The other thing that can change the whole dynamic is, I think, increasingly, people will realize, those who don't already, that a big part of the answer to reduce CO2 emissions and cleaner power generation and compliance with the Clean Power Plan and things like that is enhanced -- is additional natural gas. And you don't get the additional natural gas without the additional gas infrastructure. So I think that's a driver that could potentially change some of that dynamic."

We don't have the JV Elba. I think it is a very amenable -- it is very amenable to a joint venture. It is a stand-alone asset investment, at least when it comes to the liquefaction facilities, and it's attractive. It's under a 20-year contract with Shell. We've got the ability to self-fund that or to JV it, but it is an attractive JV candidate. But again, we're not in a position where we have to do anything, in particular, with it. But we continue to explore options to JV assets, and that's one of the big variables and sort of what our plans are and how quickly we get to where we want to go. And Elba certainly is on the list of things that we can consider. I don't think the rehearing really bears on it that much one way or the other. I mean, I think in the context of FERC 7(c)s, it is often -- it's traditional for -- you get the 7(c) and you start construction when you get the notice to proceed without waiting for the rehearing. In this case, I would say we've got an extremely tight, extremely well reasoned, extremely thorough 7(c). They took extra time to get it out. And so we think it's going to withstand any rehearing or appeal, and so we're going to go ahead and get started."

We had a few of those, and the big transaction, of course, was SNG. And that was a bit unique circumstances. We're not generally in the business of selling cash flow and pipeline assets. But in that particular case, we had a partner who is bringing value, securing the asset but also bringing incremental investment opportunities to the project. So it made a lot of sense for us to go ahead and do that. With respect to CO2 specifically, we like that business. It's a good business. We invest and get good returns on that business. It's a niche for us. We're not out chasing E&P and shale and offshore and things like that. We have CO2, which is a scarce commodity. And we have the infrastructure to get it delivered to EOR fields where it's the only thing that can free up oil, and we've integrated forward into enhanced oil recovery. And we've got expertise there, and we think we're good at it. So we like that business, and we're happy to keep running it. If you think about your question in terms of a transaction or a potential transaction, we are shareholder-directed company. And if there is a transaction to be done that will improve overall value for our shareholders, we are absolutely going to consider it and do it if it makes sense. The considerations around CO2 specifically is that it would probably slightly dilutive or somewhat dilutive. And then the question would have to be, is the multiple expansion that you get on the remaining EBITDA of the remaining business and the yield contraction on DCF that you get by having a better portfolio or a more stable portfolio of remaining businesses enough to offset that and produce real shareholder value? And certainly, there are theoretical numbers at which that would work. And so again, we're a shareholder-directed company. We're going to do the things that are going to make sense and create value for our shareholders."

And our game plan -- again, we would reserve the right to see what the facts on the ground are when we get to that point. But our game plan would be, we obviously have a lot of firepower, a lot of free cash flow. And to the extent we can substantially increase the dividend while still maintaining an adequate coverage ratio, and by that, I would mean that we would be able to fund the equity portion of our going rate of capital expenditures. We don't know exactly what that is, but we look back and you take out the pigs going through the boa constrictor like Trans Mountain, for example. You're kind of in that, I don't know, $2 billion, $2.5 billion, $3 billion, in that range. And if you say once our balance sheet is where we want it, we're going to finance half of that out of retained cash and half of that back in the debt markets at that point in time, then you can get -- you can see your way clear to having a very nice dividend but with very nice coverage and maintaining a strong balance sheet. And that's really the trifecta that we're looking for. And I think, I mean, just look at this year, and I think Kim emphasized this, we're right consistent, absent the SNG transaction, with where we told you in April and where we told you in July we're going to be. And that leaves the DCF of about $2 per share for this year, and we're paying out a $0.50 dividend. That's a whale of a spread between the 2. But at some point, when we get this balance sheet the way we want it, we're going to be able to take that dividend up substantially and still have adequate coverage. We're not going back to having $0.05 of coverage or something like that because we like to cover our portion -- the equity portion of a normalized CapEx program."

And so it's part of a -- is part of a larger grid, and our piece of that grid is well positioned to benefit from the pulling into Mexico that's happening in increasing volumes over the years. So even if it's not us constructing in-country pipe, which we haven't gotten comfortable with from a risk/reward standpoint, the increase in demand and the hooking it up increasingly to U.S. supply resources is going to benefit our system overall, transport as well as storage and on the intrastate side sales."

And so I think that the debt market has changed. The equity market is still significantly different from where we were 12 months ago, 18 months ago. And so we are funding our CapEx program. So we -- in my mind, what we are constrained by -- we do want to improve the balance sheet, and that is a goal that we have. But what we are doing is we are living within our cash flow, meaning that we want to be able to fund our equity -- our CapEx and our dividend from our cash flow. And so that is the constraint. And so because we have limited amount of capital, that is why we have the hurdle rate set at 15% unlevered after-tax IRR for projects. I fully anticipate that over time, as the CapEx comes down and also as the balance sheet improves, that we would relax that standard. I don't know exactly what that number is going to be today, but it would be something less than the 15%. It probably won't be back at the 8% unlevered after-tax that we previously used for a hurdle rate, but we will have to make the assessment when that time comes."

So barring some improvement in an overall permitting environment, I think it's difficult to do those, but we'll keep looking for the smaller projects to do. The other thing, I think New England is a perfect example of what Rich said at the very beginning, which is that it does tend to make existing -- the existing network more valuable. The other thing I'd add and I'll let Tom throw in whatever he wants. But the TGP system is a system that is continuing to produce project opportunities for us. A lot of our backlog on TGP -- a lot of our backlog in gas is on TGP. I mean, it's the biggest home for it outside of the Elba project right now. And what a lot of that project capital is directed at now is getting the gas, as you know, Darren, south from the Marcellus and Utica to the new market, the new market area, which is now the Gulf Coast of the United States. And we are proceeding along very well with those. We're building on our existing footprint. That again goes to the need to make distinctions between projects out there and infrastructure projects, building off of your existing footprint, adding compression, maybe laying some parallel pipe, things like that. That create a different -- that's a different -- in a federally certificated process, that's a different context in which to be doing your project expansions. So I think you will see basis widen to New England, to the northeast, and I think we'll find plenty of things to invest in and our -- plenty of things to invest in on TGP to get that gas someplace else."

So look, is there some -- are there some things that we might have been able to do if we were in an 8% world that we're not doing when we're in a 15% world? Yes, maybe so.

Before I turn it over to our CEO, Steve Kean; and our CFO, Kim Dang, let me make a couple of brief comments, one more industry-wide in nature and the other specific to KMI. 
Let's start with the industry-wide thought. We continue to be bullish on the prospects for North American energy, especially natural gas. And as the largest midstream energy company in North America, we believe we're well positioned in our existing businesses and with our backlog of growth projects. 
Fossil fuels and especially natural gas, which has now surpassed coal as the primary fuel source for power generation in the U.S., are going to be needed for a long, long time. I would add that natural gas is a key in reducing CO2 emissions in America. For example, despite a substantial increase in electric generation over the levels of 1993, the CO2 emissions from electric generation in 2015 were flat to those in 1993, largely as a result of the increased use of natural gas to generate that electricity. So natural gas is playing a major role in reducing emissions. But there have been recent controversies, as you all know, surrounding new pipeline projects and I'd like to offer my perspective. 
First, to the extent it becomes difficult to build new infrastructure that tends to make existing pipeline networks more valuable, and we obviously have a tremendous existing network. 
Second, while the protesters tend to get the headlines, it is still possible to build out new infrastructure. This quarter, for example, we completed an expansion on our Texas gas pipeline network. 
Third and maybe most importantly, I think, is to distinguish the permitting environment both geographically and jurisdictionally. There is a big difference, for example, between state-permitted projects where eminent domain is a function of state law and a federally certificated natural gas project. Ultimately, we realize that the environment is changing and we are adapting by building those changing circumstances into how we budget and plan our projects. 
Now to the comments specific to Kinder Morgan. During the third quarter, we substantially reduced our debt, and this positions us for long-term value creation. We are now ahead of our plan for 2016 year-end leverage. And as the Chairman and largest shareholder of the company, I'm very pleased with the progress we're making toward achieving our targeted leverage level of around 5x net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA. This will put us in a position to deliver substantial value to our shareholders through dividend increases, share repurchases, attractive growth projects or further debt reduction. 
Now because we get so many questions regarding these alternatives, let me expand a bit on this subject. Our current view leans towered increasing the dividend substantially while maintaining both greater coverage than in the past and a stronger balance sheet. That said, we'll obviously make the best economic decision at the time we reach that point, and we can't give you exact timing on when we will reach our target because there are numerous factors involved. But as I said, the message today is we're pleased with the progress to date. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Steve."
34952431,404700863,1057266,"Kinder Morgan, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 19, 2016",2016-10-19,"Earnings Calls","Kinder Morgan, Inc.","Executives","Okay. Thanks, Rich. So I'll update on capital projects and counter-party credit and then hit on some segment highlights and trends. On the capital update, 2 of our larger projects, first on Trans Mountain. On that expansion, I'll start with the fundamen",1712,"Okay. Thanks, Rich. So I'll update on capital projects and counter-party credit and then hit on some segment highlights and trends. 
On the capital update, 2 of our larger projects, first on Trans Mountain. On that expansion, I'll start with the fundamentals. We consistently hear from producers in Canada and some refiners in the Northwest U.S. that they're counting on this project to get built. Production is expected to continue growing even though it's at a slower rate out of the oil sands, and takeaway capacity projects continue to lag the demand. Oil prices have hurt the oil sands, no question. But from the perspective of our expansion, the supply-and-demand fundamentals for new takeaway capacity are good. We're nearing the end of the federal review process right now. We have our NEB recommendation finding the project to be in a public interest, and the federal government has undertaken its further consultation process with the objective of a final decision in December of this year. We've made great progress with communities along the route and have agreements with the majority of the most directly affected First Nations bands. We're actively engaged with the BC government on the satisfaction of their 5 conditions. 
Finally, I'll note that we do believe that this project would make a very good candidate for bringing in other investors through a joint venture or other structure. It is an attractive project economically, and there is substantial interest in it. We believe that the project needs to ripen through the review processes that are nearing a conclusion now. But following those reviews, assuming the outcomes of favorable or if the outcomes are favorable, we would look to syndicate this investment. We've got a lot of options here, including self-funding. So we're not committing to any one approach, but we do think it's worth exploring the options at the right time. 
On Elba, we have our 7(c) certificate from FERC. We got that in June. But the news is that we have received now our first significant notices to proceed from FERC just this week, and that's the authorization that follows the 7(c) that takes our implementation plan and gives us permission to go forward with construction. So we and Shell, our customer, are prepared for us to begin construction starting the 1st of November. 
With respect to the rest of our projects. We've been talking for several quarters now about high-grading the backlog. That's making sure that we're attending to our balance sheet and also ensuring that we grow value through investments at attractive returns that we can fund out of the cash flow that we generate. That is without needing to access the capital markets. This quarter, our backlog stands at $13 billion. That's down from $13.5 billion last quarter. We believe it's an attractive slate of projects projected 6.5x CapEx-to-EBITDA multiple. 87% of the backlog is for fee-based projects in our Pipelines and Terminals businesses. 
The changes from that $13.5 billion to the $13 billion, we put $600 million worth of projects into service during the quarter, including bringing on the intrastate Texas gas crossover project that's in support of LNG in Mexico markets, taking delivery of 2 Jones Act vessels which are under charter, completing 2 smaller liquids terminal expansions, and we completed Phase I of our Tall Cotton enhanced oil recovery project. So $600 million went into service. We added a little over $200 million of projects in the quarter, $130 million of that in gas and $75 million in CO2 where we continue to see good returns even at current prices. If you look at the year-to-date numbers, we've added a little under $600 million, about $575 million, in new projects. Now that's been -- the backlog has been coming down. So that's been more than -- those additions have been more than offset by projects going into service and in project cancellations earlier in the year. But overall, I think what this shows you is we've been successful in doing what we set out to do. We have high-graded the backlog to strengthen our balance sheet and enabled the funding of our growth projects without needing to access capital markets while continuing to add projects where we find them at attractive returns. 
Turning to customer credit. We have a broad, diverse customer base with overall very good credit quality. We continue our extreme focus throughout our commercial and corporate organizations, active monitoring, calling for collateral, et cetera. And we've seen some stabilization in counter-party credit as our producer customers have been actively addressing their issues over the last few quarters. So in the past quarter, we were not impacted by any customer defaults. We had one customer file for bankruptcy, and the reorganized entity continued the contract with us. So no impact from customer defaults in the third quarter. 
So now turning to the segment for some highlights and trends there, starting with the GAAP measures. GAAP segment earnings were down $211 million for the quarter compared to the third quarter of 2015 primarily due to higher impairments in this quarter compared to the same quarter last year. Those were primarily comprised of a $350 million noncash impairment on our MEP investments, driven by the expectation of future lower contract rates and an approximately $84 million loss associated with the partial sale of SNG. 
If you look at segment earnings before DD&A and certain items, which is how we measure our performance, we're down $33 million or 2% quarter-to-quarter. CO2 is down $53 million year-over-year due to lower prices, $62 a barrel realized versus $74 in the third quarter of last year, and lower production. Nevertheless, we expect CO2 to make plan due to some price improvement versus our planned price and good performance on cost savings by that segment. 
Compared to the same quarter last year, gas is down 2% while Terminals and Products are up 22% and 7%, respectively. Overall, we think again that the quarter's performance demonstrates the resiliency of our cash flows even in difficult commodity price environments. 
Focusing on some of the broad trends affecting our business. First, in Natural Gas. We're seeing the demand-side developments that we anticipated. On our systems specifically, we're benefiting from increased demand for gas in the power sector, increased exports to Mexico and now, for the first time, increases due to LNG exports. 
On Kinder Morgan pipelines, power-driven gas demand was up 9% 3Q to 3Q from 6.5 Bcf last year to 7 Bcf this quarter. On a macro basis, gas is now overtaking coal, as Rich mentioned, as the fuel source for power generation. 
Mexico export demand on our pipelines grew by 6% year-over-year for the quarter and is up 15% on a comparable year-to-date number. We reached an average volume of 2.8 Bcf a day for the quarter, about 75% of total exports to Mexico.
We're in the early days of LNG export-driven demand. But even with the Sabine Pass outage in the last 2 weeks of the quarter, we experienced about 350 a day of LNG demand on our systems and much more to come there, we believe. 
Most of our $4 billion of backlog projects in the gas sector are directed at those 3 market trends plus one more, and that is the reversal projects on our TGP system to move more Marcellus and Utica gas to the South. 
Natural Gas, which is by far our largest segment, is kind of an 80-20 story, with approximately 80% of the budget segment earnings before DD&A attributable to transportation and storage, which benefits from the trends I just discussed; and the other 20% in gathering and processing. Our gathered volumes are down 17% to 18% year-over-year as a result of declines in the Eagle Ford, Oklahoma and the Bakken. 
Our Bakken midstream financial performance is up year-over-year and up versus planned, primarily due to contract restructuring earlier in the year. But overall, this business, outside of the take-or-pay commitments that we have, is dependent upon the recovery in those basins as gas demand grows and oil prices and, therefore, drilling recovers. 
We continue to believe that the need for natural gas transportation and storage capacity will grow as the demand trends that I talked about continue. And in the longer term, the gathering volumes flatten and turn up when we ultimately see recovery in the gas supply basins that we serve. 
In Products Pipelines, we're getting the benefit year-over-year of higher volumes. Refined products volumes are up 3% quarter-to-quarter and year-over-year and well above the growth in the EIA national numbers. Our crude and condensate volumes are up 6% year-over-year. Our NGL volumes are down 1%, primarily due to a plant -- a petrochemical plant turnaround by one of our customers. 
In Terminals, we're seeing the benefit of new liquids capacity coming online and increased utilization of that expanded capacity, so more capacity online and higher overall utilization. We also took delivery of 2 additional Jones Act vessels, which are under contract. Overall, the liquids portion of our Terminals business is over 75% of the segment earnings before DD&A before certain items. And the increased utilization we're seeing and the expansions we're bringing on are positives for that long-term outlook. 
With respect to the Jones Act vessels, we see medium-term market weakness there. We benefit from having charters in place for the vast majority of our vessels, and we have a modern fuel-efficient fleet that should be very competitive. But we expect some overcapacity in the market for the medium term, which will affect new charter rates and renewal rates until the overall U.S. fleet is right-sized from a capacity standpoint. 
On the bulk side, we're down slightly year-over-year, primarily, again, attributable to the coal vessels. 
In CO2, we had lower volumes year-over-year for the quarter, down 5%, with SACROC in gaits [ph] down year-over-year; Katz, Goldsmith and Tall Cotton up year-over-year but below our plan. We also had strong NGL production of the segment, a record quarter, in fact, which is slightly higher than last year. And we also approved some new EOR development projects during the quarter and continue to find attractive return projects in this segment. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Kim for the financials."

Today, we're declaring a dividend of $0.125 per share, consistent with our budget and the guidance we gave you in December of last year. First, turning to the preliminary GAAP income statement. You will see that similar to the first",1819,"Okay. Thanks, Steve. Today, we're declaring a dividend of $0.125 per share, consistent with our budget and the guidance we gave you in December of last year. 
First, turning to the preliminary GAAP income statement. You will see that similar to the first 2 quarters of this year, revenues in the quarter are down significantly. As I say many quarters, we believe that revenue -- or the changes in revenue are not necessarily a good indicator of our performance. We have some businesses where revenues and expenses fluctuate with commodity prices but margin generally does not, which is why you also see a partially offsetting variance in cost of sales. 
In addition, both revenues and cost of sales can be impacted by noncash, sporadic accounting entries for certain items. The largest impact of the certain items on changes and revenues and cost of sales relates to the unrealized CO2 mark-to-market and hedging effectiveness impact on our change in revenues, which accounts for almost 40% of the $377 million change in revenues in the quarter. 
We had a net loss in the quarter of $227 million and a loss per share of $0.10 versus income of $186 million and earnings per share of $0.08 in the third quarter of last year, a reduction of $413 million and $0.18 a share. 
Now let me talk about what's driving that loss. We recorded a $230 million noncash after tax, and that's why that number is a little different from what Steve said because this is after-tax impairment on our MEP investment, driven by our expectations of lower future transportation contract rates and approximately a $350 million after-tax loss associated with the SNG transaction, most of which is noncash book tax expense. 
For those of you who are interested in how we can have such a large book tax expense on a relatively modest book loss when you would ordinarily expect a book tax benefit, I would be happy to explain later, but I'm not going to bore everybody with all the details at this point. Together, these 2 charges result in a net expense of $580 million and are the primary drivers of our $570 million in certain items for the quarter. So net income before certain items was a positive $343 million. The adjusted number in 2015 of -- was $345 million or down $2 million, essentially flat. EPS excluding certain items was $0.15 or down $0.01 versus the third quarter of 2015, so essentially flat when excluding certain items. 
Now let's turn to the second page of the financials, which shows our DCF for the quarter and year-to-date and is reconciled to our GAAP numbers in the earnings release. DCF is the primary financial measure on which management judges its performance. We generated total DCF for the quarter of $1.081 billion versus $1.129 billion for the comparable period in 2015, down $48 million or 4%. There are a lot of moving parts, but if you want a very simple explanation, it boils down to CO2 being down $53 million, primarily on lower commodity prices. But to take you through a more granular analysis, the segments were down by $33 million or 2%. As I previously mentioned, CO2 decreased $53 million and Natural Gas decreased about $18 million, with offsets -- those 2 segments were offset by increases in all of our other segments, with the largest dollar increase from the other segments coming from our Terminals segment. 
The Natural Gas segment would have been slightly positive if you exclude the impact of the SNG sale, which we sold a 50% interest in on September 1 of this year. Adding back an $11 million change in JV DD&A, which primarily reflects our increased interest in NGPL that we acquired in the fourth quarter of 2015, we add that back to the segment, the segment is now $33 million, the assets are really down about $22 million. This $22 million decrease was partially offset by $12 million benefit, i.e., lower expense when you combine G&A and interest expense. The $19 million in increased cash taxes, which is primarily driven by the fact that Citrus fully utilized its NOLs in 2015, is largely offset by an $18 million decrease in sustaining CapEx, a lot of which is cost savings. Netting out the $39 million increase in preferred stock dividends, you get to a DCF variance of $50 million versus the $48 million shown on the page. 
DCF per share was $0.48 in the quarter versus $0.51 for the third quarter of last year or down about -- down $0.03 per share, with about $0.02 associated with the DCF variance I just walked you through and about $0.01 due to the additional shares that were issued during 2015 to finance our growth projects and maintain our balance sheet. $0.48 in DCF per share results in $801 million in excess distributable cash flow above our $0.125 dividend for the quarter, and year-to-date, we've generated approximately $2.5 billion of excess distributable cash flow above our dividend. 
Now let me give you some details on our expected performance for the full year versus budget. Natural Gas Pipelines is expected to be approximately 5% below its budget due to the SNG transaction, lower volumes in our midstream group and a delay on our EEC/SNG pipeline expansion in service as a result of a delay in receiving our FERC certificate. If you exclude the impact of the sale of the 50% interest in SNG, we would have expected Natural Gas to be about 2% below its budget. So on an apples-to-apples basis, the 2% is consistent with what we told you last quarter for the Natural Gas Pipelines segment. 
CO2 is expected to end the year on its budget, consistent with the guidance we gave you last quarter. Some price help and cost savings are offsetting the lower-than-expected oil and CO2 volumes. 
We currently expect Terminals to end the year about 5% below its budget. That's slightly more than the 4% we discussed last quarter. The overall variance is due to the impact of the coal bankruptcies and lower throughput and ancillaries on some of our liquids terminals versus what we budgeted. Actually, throughput on our liquids terminals year-to-year, when you compare it to 2015, is actually up. It's just slightly lower than what we expected in our budget. 
We currently expect Products to end the year approximately 5% below its budget, consistent with the guidance we gave you last quarter, primarily due to lower crude and condensate volumes on KMCC, Double H and Double Eagle; lower throughput on KMST; and lower rates on our SFPP pipeline and as a result of the lost income due to the sale of Parkway. Consistent with last quarter, we are projecting KMC to be essentially on its budget. 
With respect to other items, interest, cash taxes, G&A and sustaining, on a combined basis for those items, we're expecting to come in lower than budget. Or said another way, they're expected to be a favorable variance, primarily as a result of lower interest and sustaining CapEx. Interest is expected to be approximately 4% below its budget. About half of those variance -- or over half of those variance is associated with the lower balance as a result of the SNG transaction, with the remaining variance driven primarily by lower rates. Sustaining CapEx is also expected to be approximately 4% lower than budget. 
Let me conclude with 2 overall financial points. On an apples-to-apples basis, our full year guidance has not changed from the updated guidance we gave you last quarter, when you exclude the impact from the 50% sale of SNG. We continue to expect that adjusted EBITDA will be about 3% below budget and DCF will be approximately 4% below budget. When you adjust for the 4-month impact of the 50% SNG sale, so not on an apples-to-apples basis with what we gave you last quarter, we expect EBITDA to be approximately 4% below budget but DCF will also be approximately 4% below budget. DCF doesn't change versus SNG transaction versus no SNG transaction, given the interest rate savings -- 4% doesn't change, given the interest rate savings offset from the impact of the lost SNG EBITDA as we use all the proceeds from this transaction to reduce debt. 
And the second point is that we expect to end the year at 5.3x debt-to-EBITDA, which is also consistent with what we told you in the second quarter call. The 5.3 is down from our budget guidance of 5.5x, largely as a result of the SNG transaction. 
With that, I'll move to the balance sheet. When you look at total assets on the balance sheet, total assets are down $2.5 billion, and that's largely driven by the sale of the 50% interest in SNG. We ended the quarter with net debt of $39.25 billion, which is down $1.976 billion from the end of last year and down $2.073 billion from the second quarter. As I -- we ended the quarter at 5.3x debt-to-EBITDA, and as I said, that's where we would expect to end the year. The 5.3x is down from the 5.6x where we ended last year. 
Now to reconcile the change in debt for you for the quarter. As I said, debt is down $2.073 billion. We've generated DCF of $1.08 billion. We spent about $550 million in expansion CapEx, acquisitions and contributions to equity investments. We paid $280 million in dividends. We had proceeds from divestitures of about $1.43 billion, with the biggest being the SNG transaction. We also deconsolidated about $1.2 billion in debt as a result of the SNG transaction. And we also took $803 million of the cash that we received from that transaction and it is sitting in restricted cash, so in other current assets on our balance sheet. And we used that to pay debt on October 1. So that debt was not paid down as of 9/30 but has subsequently been paid down. And then we had $9 million of working capital and other items that was a use of cash. 
Year-to-date, the change in debt, $1.976 billion. So we've reduced debt by just under $2 billion. We've generated DCF of $3.36 billion. We had expansions, acquisitions and contributions to equity investments of $2.43 billion. We had -- we paid dividends of $839 million. We had proceeds from divestitures of $1.65 billion. We've deconsolidated $1.2 billion of SNG debt. We placed $800 million again into escrow, which is shown in restricted cash or other current assets on our balance sheet. Again, that paid down -- we used to pay down debt on October 1. And then we had working capital and other items that was a use of cash of about $168 million. And that gets you to the $1.976 billion reduction in debt. 
So with that, I'll turn it back over to Rich."

Now there may be some other decisions that come out of Wood County that will be consistent with that, but we expect ultimately to prevail on appeal. Now we are going to -- we are in the process of evaluating what that means. We're 2/3 of the way through acquiring right-of-way already, separate and apart from what happened with that decision. So this is fairly recent news, and so we're sitting down and strategizing about how to go forward with the acquisition of the remaining right-of-way, what our legal strategy is going to be, et cetera. But that's what that decision was about. That's where we are in the project in terms of acquiring right-of-way and what we plan to do in terms of what we've already done in terms of appeal. On the Elba project, yes, we have -- we've reached agreement with Shell to proceed without the rehearing having been finalized. So we're ready to go. Our customers are ready to go. We are ready to go. We have our 7(c) already. As I've mentioned, we have the notice to proceed, which gives us the authority to go forward with construction even without a final order on rehearing.

I mean, I think -- and Rich mentioned this. On the adjustments, what we need to do is and we've been doing for months now is evaluating our project opportunities and having discussions with our customers that attempt to price and schedule in to our projects what is, no doubt, an enhanced regulatory burden for getting those projects through the permitting and approval process. So we have to make the appropriate adjustments. In terms of what can turn that around, again, this varies from place to place. I mean, we built our Texas pipeline over the summer effectively, and it's -- you have to go kind of place by place and kind of commodity by commodity to sort this out. But the bottom line is you need to fully take into account and we need to fully take into account the additional length and requirements that will be placed on the permitting process. So it's not that the whole world needs to change. This is a kind of a case-by-case consideration that you need to make. The other thing that can change the whole dynamic is, I think, increasingly, people will realize, those who don't already, that a big part of the answer to reduce CO2 emissions and cleaner power generation and compliance with the Clean Power Plan and things like that is enhanced -- is additional natural gas. And you don't get the additional natural gas without the additional gas infrastructure. So I think that's a driver that could potentially change some of that dynamic."

We don't have the JV Elba. I think it is a very amenable -- it is very amenable to a joint venture. It is a stand-alone asset investment, at least when it comes to the liquefaction facilities, and it's attractive. It's under a 20-year contract with Shell. We've got the ability to self-fund that or to JV it, but it is an attractive JV candidate. But again, we're not in a position where we have to do anything, in particular, with it. But we continue to explore options to JV assets, and that's one of the big variables and sort of what our plans are and how quickly we get to where we want to go. And Elba is certainly on the list of things that we can consider. I don't think the rehearing really bears on it that much one way or the other. I mean, I think in the context of FERC 7(c)s, it is often -- it's traditional for -- you get the 7(c) and you start construction when you get the notice to proceed without waiting for the rehearing. In this case, I would say we've got an extremely tight, extremely well reasoned, extremely thorough 7(c). They took extra time to get it out.

We had a few of those, and the big transaction, of course, was SNG. And that was a bit unique circumstances. We're not generally in the business of selling cash flow and pipeline assets. But in that particular case, we had a partner who is bringing value, securing the asset but also bringing incremental investment opportunities to the project. So it made a lot of sense for us to go ahead and do that. With respect to CO2 specifically, we like that business. It's a good business. We invest and get good returns on that business. It's a niche for us. We're not out chasing E&P and shale and offshore and things like that. We have CO2, which is a scarce commodity. And we have the infrastructure to get it delivered to EOR fields where it's the only thing that can free up oil, and we've integrated forward into enhanced oil recovery. And we've got expertise there, and we think we're good at it. So we like that business, and we're happy to keep running it. If you think about your question in terms of a transaction or a potential transaction, we are shareholder-directed company. And if there is a transaction to be done that will improve overall value for our shareholders, we are absolutely going to consider it and do it if it makes sense. The considerations around CO2 specifically is that it would probably slightly dilutive or somewhat dilutive. And then the question would have to be, is the multiple expansion that you get on the remaining EBITDA of the remaining business and the yield contraction on DCF that you get by having a better portfolio or a more stable portfolio of remaining businesses enough to offset that and produce real shareholder value? And certainly, there are theoretical numbers at which that would work. And so again, we're a shareholder-directed company.

And our game plan -- again, we would reserve the right to see what the facts on the ground are when we get to that point. But our game plan would be, we obviously have a lot of firepower, a lot of free cash flow. And to the extent we can substantially increase the dividend while still maintaining an adequate coverage ratio, and by that, I would mean that we would be able to fund the equity portion of our going rate of capital expenditures. We don't know exactly what that is, but we look back and you take out the pigs going through the boa constrictor like Trans Mountain, for example. You're kind of in that, I don't know, $2 billion, $2.5 billion, $3 billion, in that range. And if you say once our balance sheet is where we want it, we're going to finance half of that out of retained cash and half of that back in the debt markets at that point in time, then you can get -- you can see your way clear to having a very nice dividend but with very nice coverage and maintaining a strong balance sheet. And that's really the trifecta that we're looking for. And I think, I mean, just look at this year, and I think Kim emphasized this, we're right consistent, absent the SNG transaction, with where we told you in April and where we told you in July we're going to be. And that leaves the DCF of about $2 per share for this year, and we're paying out a $0.50 dividend. That's a whale of a spread between the 2. But at some point, when we get this balance sheet the way we want it, we're going to be able to take that dividend up substantially and still have adequate coverage. We're not going back to having $0.05 of coverage or something like that because we like to cover our portion -- the equity portion of a normalized CapEx program."

And I think my answer to the first will address the answer to the second question, which is the -- the reason that we decreased the dividend primarily a year ago had to do with inefficient capital markets and not wanting to fund expansion CapEx in a market that wasn't rationally pricing debt and equity securities. And so I think that the debt market has changed. The equity market is still significantly different from where we were 12 months ago, 18 months ago. And so we are funding our CapEx program. So we -- in my mind, what we are constrained by -- we do want to improve the balance sheet, and that is a goal that we have. But what we are doing is we are living within our cash flow, meaning that we want to be able to fund our equity -- our CapEx and our dividend from our cash flow. And so that is the constraint. And so because we have limited amount of capital, that is why we have the hurdle rate set at 15% unlevered after-tax IRR for projects. I fully anticipate that over time, as the CapEx comes down and also as the balance sheet improves, that we would relax that standard. I don't know exactly what that number is going to be today, but it would be something less than the 15%. It probably won't be back at the 8% unlevered after-tax that we previously used for a hurdle rate, but we will have to make the assessment when that time comes."

But basically, I think our view is, it's very hard to get big newbuilds done into New England or into the Northeast. We've seen that not only with NED, which we talked about in the first quarter and discontinued, but also with recent rulings that, I think, verified that decision. It's making it harder to get things done on a kind of a mega-scale, call it. Now we have continued to engage with our customers on smaller scale projects and we'll continue to pursue those. But I think from the perspective of right now, today, it is hard to get new, significant gas infrastructure built into New England. And that would in -- tend to increase the basis differentials between what's already the lowest-price gas at Dominion South, call it, and the New England market, which is just a few -- the highest-priced in North America and just a few hundred miles away. So barring some improvement in an overall permitting environment, I think it's difficult to do those, but we'll keep looking for the smaller projects to do. The other thing, I think New England is a perfect example of what Rich said at the very beginning, which is that it does tend to make existing -- the existing network more valuable. The other thing I'd add and I'll let Tom throw in whatever he wants. But the TGP system is a system that is continuing to produce project opportunities for us. A lot of our backlog on TGP -- a lot of our backlog in gas is on TGP. I mean, it's the biggest home for it outside of the Elba project right now. And what a lot of that project capital is directed at now is getting the gas, as you know, Darren, south from the Marcellus and Utica to the new market, the new market area, which is now the Gulf Coast of the United States. And we are proceeding along very well with those. We're building on our existing footprint. That again goes to the need to make distinctions between projects out there and infrastructure projects, building off of your existing footprint, adding compression, maybe laying some parallel pipe, things like that. That create a different -- that's a different -- in a federally certificated process, that's a different context in which to be doing your project expansions. So I think you will see basis widen to New England, to the Northeast, and I think we'll find plenty of things to invest in and our -- plenty of things to invest in on TGP to get that gas someplace else."

Before I turn it over to our CEO, Steve Kean; and our CFO, Kim Dang, let me make a couple of brief comments, one more industry-wide in nature and the other specific to KMI. 
Let's start with the industry-wide thought. We continue to be bullish on the prospects for North American energy, especially natural gas. And as the largest midstream energy company in North America, we believe we're well positioned in our existing businesses and with our backlog of growth projects. 
Fossil fuels and especially natural gas, which has now surpassed coal as the primary fuel source for power generation in the U.S., are going to be needed for a long, long time. I would add that natural gas is a key in reducing CO2 emissions in America. For example, despite a substantial increase in electric generation over the levels of 1993, the CO2 emissions from electric generation in 2015 were flat to those in 1993, largely as a result of the increased use of natural gas to generate that electricity. So natural gas is playing a major role in reducing emissions. But there have been recent controversies, as you all know, surrounding new pipeline projects and I'd like to offer my perspective. 
First, to the extent it becomes difficult to build new infrastructure that tends to make existing pipeline networks more valuable, and we obviously have a tremendous existing network. 
Second, while the protesters tend to get the headlines, it is still possible to build out new infrastructure. This quarter, for example, we completed an expansion on our Texas gas pipeline network. 
Third and maybe most importantly, I think, is to distinguish the permitting environment both geographically and jurisdictionally. There is a big difference, for example, between state-permitted projects where eminent domain is a function of state law and a federally certificated natural gas project. Ultimately, we realize that the environment is changing and we are adapting by building those changing circumstances into how we budget and plan our projects. 
Now to the comments specific to Kinder Morgan. During the third quarter, we substantially reduced our debt, and this positions us for long-term value creation. We are now ahead of our plan for 2016 year-end leverage. And as the Chairman and largest shareholder of the company, I'm very pleased with the progress we're making toward achieving our targeted leverage level of around 5x net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA. This will put us in a position to deliver substantial value to our shareholders through dividend increases, share repurchases, attractive growth projects or further debt reduction. 
Now because we get so many questions regarding these alternatives, let me expand a bit on this subject. Our current view leans towered increasing the dividend substantially while maintaining both greater coverage than in the past and a stronger balance sheet. That said, we'll obviously make the best economic decision at the time we reach that point, and we can't give you exact timing on when we will reach our target because there are numerous factors involved. But as I said, the message today is we're pleased with the progress to date. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Steve."
34952431,404700863,1057585,"Kinder Morgan, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 19, 2016",2016-10-19,"Earnings Calls","Kinder Morgan, Inc.","Executives","Okay. Thanks, Rich. So I'll update on capital projects and counter-party credit and then hit on some segment highlights and trends. On the capital update, 2 of our larger projects, first on Trans Mountain. On that expansion, I'll start with the fundamen",1712,"Okay. Thanks, Rich. So I'll update on capital projects and counter-party credit and then hit on some segment highlights and trends. 
On the capital update, 2 of our larger projects, first on Trans Mountain. On that expansion, I'll start with the fundamentals. We consistently hear from producers in Canada and some refiners in the Northwest U.S. that they're counting on this project to get built. Production is expected to continue growing even though it's at a slower rate out of the oil sands, and takeaway capacity projects continue to lag the demand. Oil prices have hurt the oil sands, no question. But from the perspective of our expansion, the supply-and-demand fundamentals for new takeaway capacity are good. We're nearing the end of the federal review process right now. We have our NEB recommendation finding the project to be in a public interest, and the federal government has undertaken its further consultation process with the objective of a final decision in December of this year. We've made great progress with communities along the route and have agreements with the majority of the most directly affected First Nations bands. We're actively engaged with the BC government on the satisfaction of their 5 conditions. 
Finally, I'll note that we do believe that this project would make a very good candidate for bringing in other investors through a joint venture or other structure. It is an attractive project economically, and there is substantial interest in it. We believe that the project needs to ripen through the review processes that are nearing a conclusion now. But following those reviews, assuming the outcomes of favorable or if the outcomes are favorable, we would look to syndicate this investment. We've got a lot of options here, including self-funding. So we're not committing to any one approach, but we do think it's worth exploring the options at the right time. 
On Elba, we have our 7(c) certificate from FERC. We got that in June. But the news is that we have received now our first significant notices to proceed from FERC just this week, and that's the authorization that follows the 7(c) that takes our implementation plan and gives us permission to go forward with construction. So we and Shell, our customer, are prepared for us to begin construction starting the 1st of November. 
With respect to the rest of our projects. We've been talking for several quarters now about high-grading the backlog. That's making sure that we're attending to our balance sheet and also ensuring that we grow value through investments at attractive returns that we can fund out of the cash flow that we generate. That is without needing to access the capital markets. This quarter, our backlog stands at $13 billion. That's down from $13.5 billion last quarter. We believe it's an attractive slate of projects projected 6.5x CapEx-to-EBITDA multiple. 87% of the backlog is for fee-based projects in our Pipelines and Terminals businesses. 
The changes from that $13.5 billion to the $13 billion, we put $600 million worth of projects into service during the quarter, including bringing on the intrastate Texas gas crossover project that's in support of LNG in Mexico markets, taking delivery of 2 Jones Act vessels which are under charter, completing 2 smaller liquids terminal expansions, and we completed Phase I of our Tall Cotton enhanced oil recovery project. So $600 million went into service. We added a little over $200 million of projects in the quarter, $130 million of that in gas and $75 million in CO2 where we continue to see good returns even at current prices. If you look at the year-to-date numbers, we've added a little under $600 million, about $575 million, in new projects. Now that's been -- the backlog has been coming down. So that's been more than -- those additions have been more than offset by projects going into service and in project cancellations earlier in the year. But overall, I think what this shows you is we've been successful in doing what we set out to do. We have high-graded the backlog to strengthen our balance sheet and enabled the funding of our growth projects without needing to access capital markets while continuing to add projects where we find them at attractive returns. 
Turning to customer credit. We have a broad, diverse customer base with overall very good credit quality. We continue our extreme focus throughout our commercial and corporate organizations, active monitoring, calling for collateral, et cetera. And we've seen some stabilization in counter-party credit as our producer customers have been actively addressing their issues over the last few quarters. So in the past quarter, we were not impacted by any customer defaults. We had one customer file for bankruptcy, and the reorganized entity continued the contract with us. So no impact from customer defaults in the third quarter. 
So now turning to the segment for some highlights and trends there, starting with the GAAP measures. GAAP segment earnings were down $211 million for the quarter compared to the third quarter of 2015 primarily due to higher impairments in this quarter compared to the same quarter last year. Those were primarily comprised of a $350 million noncash impairment on our MEP investments, driven by the expectation of future lower contract rates and an approximately $84 million loss associated with the partial sale of SNG. 
If you look at segment earnings before DD&A and certain items, which is how we measure our performance, we're down $33 million or 2% quarter-to-quarter. CO2 is down $53 million year-over-year due to lower prices, $62 a barrel realized versus $74 in the third quarter of last year, and lower production. Nevertheless, we expect CO2 to make plan due to some price improvement versus our planned price and good performance on cost savings by that segment. 
Compared to the same quarter last year, gas is down 2% while Terminals and Products are up 22% and 7%, respectively. Overall, we think again that the quarter's performance demonstrates the resiliency of our cash flows even in difficult commodity price environments. 
Focusing on some of the broad trends affecting our business. First, in Natural Gas. We're seeing the demand-side developments that we anticipated. On our systems specifically, we're benefiting from increased demand for gas in the power sector, increased exports to Mexico and now, for the first time, increases due to LNG exports. 
On Kinder Morgan pipelines, power-driven gas demand was up 9% 3Q to 3Q from 6.5 Bcf last year to 7 Bcf this quarter. On a macro basis, gas is now overtaking coal, as Rich mentioned, as the fuel source for power generation. 
Mexico export demand on our pipelines grew by 6% year-over-year for the quarter and is up 15% on a comparable year-to-date number. We reached an average volume of 2.8 Bcf a day for the quarter, about 75% of total exports to Mexico.
We're in the early days of LNG export-driven demand. But even with the Sabine Pass outage in the last 2 weeks of the quarter, we experienced about 350 a day of LNG demand on our systems and much more to come there, we believe. 
Most of our $4 billion of backlog projects in the gas sector are directed at those 3 market trends plus one more, and that is the reversal projects on our TGP system to move more Marcellus and Utica gas to the South. 
Natural Gas, which is by far our largest segment, is kind of an 80-20 story, with approximately 80% of the budget segment earnings before DD&A attributable to transportation and storage, which benefits from the trends I just discussed; and the other 20% in gathering and processing. Our gathered volumes are down 17% to 18% year-over-year as a result of declines in the Eagle Ford, Oklahoma and the Bakken. 
Our Bakken midstream financial performance is up year-over-year and up versus planned, primarily due to contract restructuring earlier in the year. But overall, this business, outside of the take-or-pay commitments that we have, is dependent upon the recovery in those basins as gas demand grows and oil prices and, therefore, drilling recovers. 
We continue to believe that the need for natural gas transportation and storage capacity will grow as the demand trends that I talked about continue. And in the longer term, the gathering volumes flatten and turn up when we ultimately see recovery in the gas supply basins that we serve. 
In Products Pipelines, we're getting the benefit year-over-year of higher volumes. Refined products volumes are up 3% quarter-to-quarter and year-over-year and well above the growth in the EIA national numbers. Our crude and condensate volumes are up 6% year-over-year. Our NGL volumes are down 1%, primarily due to a plant -- a petrochemical plant turnaround by one of our customers. 
In Terminals, we're seeing the benefit of new liquids capacity coming online and increased utilization of that expanded capacity, so more capacity online and higher overall utilization. We also took delivery of 2 additional Jones Act vessels, which are under contract. Overall, the liquids portion of our Terminals business is over 75% of the segment earnings before DD&A before certain items. And the increased utilization we're seeing and the expansions we're bringing on are positives for that long-term outlook. 
With respect to the Jones Act vessels, we see medium-term market weakness there. We benefit from having charters in place for the vast majority of our vessels, and we have a modern fuel-efficient fleet that should be very competitive. But we expect some overcapacity in the market for the medium term, which will affect new charter rates and renewal rates until the overall U.S. fleet is right-sized from a capacity standpoint. 
On the bulk side, we're down slightly year-over-year, primarily, again, attributable to the coal vessels. 
In CO2, we had lower volumes year-over-year for the quarter, down 5%, with SACROC in gaits [ph] down year-over-year; Katz, Goldsmith and Tall Cotton up year-over-year but below our plan. We also had strong NGL production of the segment, a record quarter, in fact, which is slightly higher than last year. And we also approved some new EOR development projects during the quarter and continue to find attractive return projects in this segment. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Kim for the financials."

Today, we're declaring a dividend of $0.125 per share, consistent with our budget and the guidance we gave you in December of last year. First, turning to the preliminary GAAP income statement. You will see that similar to the first",1819,"Okay. Thanks, Steve. Today, we're declaring a dividend of $0.125 per share, consistent with our budget and the guidance we gave you in December of last year. 
First, turning to the preliminary GAAP income statement. You will see that similar to the first 2 quarters of this year, revenues in the quarter are down significantly. As I say many quarters, we believe that revenue -- or the changes in revenue are not necessarily a good indicator of our performance. We have some businesses where revenues and expenses fluctuate with commodity prices but margin generally does not, which is why you also see a partially offsetting variance in cost of sales. 
In addition, both revenues and cost of sales can be impacted by noncash, sporadic accounting entries for certain items. The largest impact of the certain items on changes and revenues and cost of sales relates to the unrealized CO2 mark-to-market and hedging effectiveness impact on our change in revenues, which accounts for almost 40% of the $377 million change in revenues in the quarter. 
We had a net loss in the quarter of $227 million and a loss per share of $0.10 versus income of $186 million and earnings per share of $0.08 in the third quarter of last year, a reduction of $413 million and $0.18 a share. 
Now let me talk about what's driving that loss. We recorded a $230 million noncash after tax, and that's why that number is a little different from what Steve said because this is after-tax impairment on our MEP investment, driven by our expectations of lower future transportation contract rates and approximately a $350 million after-tax loss associated with the SNG transaction, most of which is noncash book tax expense. 
For those of you who are interested in how we can have such a large book tax expense on a relatively modest book loss when you would ordinarily expect a book tax benefit, I would be happy to explain later, but I'm not going to bore everybody with all the details at this point. Together, these 2 charges result in a net expense of $580 million and are the primary drivers of our $570 million in certain items for the quarter. So net income before certain items was a positive $343 million. The adjusted number in 2015 of -- was $345 million or down $2 million, essentially flat. EPS excluding certain items was $0.15 or down $0.01 versus the third quarter of 2015, so essentially flat when excluding certain items. 
Now let's turn to the second page of the financials, which shows our DCF for the quarter and year-to-date and is reconciled to our GAAP numbers in the earnings release. DCF is the primary financial measure on which management judges its performance. We generated total DCF for the quarter of $1.081 billion versus $1.129 billion for the comparable period in 2015, down $48 million or 4%. There are a lot of moving parts, but if you want a very simple explanation, it boils down to CO2 being down $53 million, primarily on lower commodity prices. But to take you through a more granular analysis, the segments were down by $33 million or 2%. As I previously mentioned, CO2 decreased $53 million and Natural Gas decreased about $18 million, with offsets -- those 2 segments were offset by increases in all of our other segments, with the largest dollar increase from the other segments coming from our Terminals segment. 
The Natural Gas segment would have been slightly positive if you exclude the impact of the SNG sale, which we sold a 50% interest in on September 1 of this year. Adding back an $11 million change in JV DD&A, which primarily reflects our increased interest in NGPL that we acquired in the fourth quarter of 2015, we add that back to the segment, the segment is now $33 million, the assets are really down about $22 million. This $22 million decrease was partially offset by $12 million benefit, i.e., lower expense when you combine G&A and interest expense. The $19 million in increased cash taxes, which is primarily driven by the fact that Citrus fully utilized its NOLs in 2015, is largely offset by an $18 million decrease in sustaining CapEx, a lot of which is cost savings. Netting out the $39 million increase in preferred stock dividends, you get to a DCF variance of $50 million versus the $48 million shown on the page. 
DCF per share was $0.48 in the quarter versus $0.51 for the third quarter of last year or down about -- down $0.03 per share, with about $0.02 associated with the DCF variance I just walked you through and about $0.01 due to the additional shares that were issued during 2015 to finance our growth projects and maintain our balance sheet. $0.48 in DCF per share results in $801 million in excess distributable cash flow above our $0.125 dividend for the quarter, and year-to-date, we've generated approximately $2.5 billion of excess distributable cash flow above our dividend. 
Now let me give you some details on our expected performance for the full year versus budget. Natural Gas Pipelines is expected to be approximately 5% below its budget due to the SNG transaction, lower volumes in our midstream group and a delay on our EEC/SNG pipeline expansion in service as a result of a delay in receiving our FERC certificate. If you exclude the impact of the sale of the 50% interest in SNG, we would have expected Natural Gas to be about 2% below its budget. So on an apples-to-apples basis, the 2% is consistent with what we told you last quarter for the Natural Gas Pipelines segment. 
CO2 is expected to end the year on its budget, consistent with the guidance we gave you last quarter. Some price help and cost savings are offsetting the lower-than-expected oil and CO2 volumes. 
We currently expect Terminals to end the year about 5% below its budget. That's slightly more than the 4% we discussed last quarter. The overall variance is due to the impact of the coal bankruptcies and lower throughput and ancillaries on some of our liquids terminals versus what we budgeted. Actually, throughput on our liquids terminals year-to-year, when you compare it to 2015, is actually up. It's just slightly lower than what we expected in our budget. 
We currently expect Products to end the year approximately 5% below its budget, consistent with the guidance we gave you last quarter, primarily due to lower crude and condensate volumes on KMCC, Double H and Double Eagle; lower throughput on KMST; and lower rates on our SFPP pipeline and as a result of the lost income due to the sale of Parkway. Consistent with last quarter, we are projecting KMC to be essentially on its budget. 
With respect to other items, interest, cash taxes, G&A and sustaining, on a combined basis for those items, we're expecting to come in lower than budget. Or said another way, they're expected to be a favorable variance, primarily as a result of lower interest and sustaining CapEx. Interest is expected to be approximately 4% below its budget. About half of those variance -- or over half of those variance is associated with the lower balance as a result of the SNG transaction, with the remaining variance driven primarily by lower rates. Sustaining CapEx is also expected to be approximately 4% lower than budget. 
Let me conclude with 2 overall financial points. On an apples-to-apples basis, our full year guidance has not changed from the updated guidance we gave you last quarter, when you exclude the impact from the 50% sale of SNG. We continue to expect that adjusted EBITDA will be about 3% below budget and DCF will be approximately 4% below budget. When you adjust for the 4-month impact of the 50% SNG sale, so not on an apples-to-apples basis with what we gave you last quarter, we expect EBITDA to be approximately 4% below budget but DCF will also be approximately 4% below budget. DCF doesn't change versus SNG transaction versus no SNG transaction, given the interest rate savings -- 4% doesn't change, given the interest rate savings offset from the impact of the lost SNG EBITDA as we use all the proceeds from this transaction to reduce debt. 
And the second point is that we expect to end the year at 5.3x debt-to-EBITDA, which is also consistent with what we told you in the second quarter call. The 5.3 is down from our budget guidance of 5.5x, largely as a result of the SNG transaction. 
With that, I'll move to the balance sheet. When you look at total assets on the balance sheet, total assets are down $2.5 billion, and that's largely driven by the sale of the 50% interest in SNG. We ended the quarter with net debt of $39.25 billion, which is down $1.976 billion from the end of last year and down $2.073 billion from the second quarter. As I -- we ended the quarter at 5.3x debt-to-EBITDA, and as I said, that's where we would expect to end the year. The 5.3x is down from the 5.6x where we ended last year. 
Now to reconcile the change in debt for you for the quarter. As I said, debt is down $2.073 billion. We've generated DCF of $1.08 billion. We spent about $550 million in expansion CapEx, acquisitions and contributions to equity investments. We paid $280 million in dividends. We had proceeds from divestitures of about $1.43 billion, with the biggest being the SNG transaction. We also deconsolidated about $1.2 billion in debt as a result of the SNG transaction. And we also took $803 million of the cash that we received from that transaction and it is sitting in restricted cash, so in other current assets on our balance sheet. And we used that to pay debt on October 1. So that debt was not paid down as of 9/30 but has subsequently been paid down. And then we had $9 million of working capital and other items that was a use of cash. 
Year-to-date, the change in debt, $1.976 billion. So we've reduced debt by just under $2 billion. We've generated DCF of $3.36 billion. We had expansions, acquisitions and contributions to equity investments of $2.43 billion. We had -- we paid dividends of $839 million. We had proceeds from divestitures of $1.65 billion. We've deconsolidated $1.2 billion of SNG debt. We placed $800 million again into escrow, which is shown in restricted cash or other current assets on our balance sheet. Again, that paid down -- we used to pay down debt on October 1. And then we had working capital and other items that was a use of cash of about $168 million. And that gets you to the $1.976 billion reduction in debt. 
So with that, I'll turn it back over to Rich."

On the adjustments, what we need to do is and we've been doing for months now is evaluating our project opportunities and having discussions with our customers that attempt to price and schedule in to our projects what is, no doubt, an enhanced regulatory burden for getting those projects through the permitting and approval process. So we have to make the appropriate adjustments. In terms of what can turn that around, again, this varies from place to place. I mean, we built our Texas pipeline over the summer effectively, and it's -- you have to go kind of place by place and kind of commodity by commodity to sort this out. But the bottom line is you need to fully take into account and we need to fully take into account the additional length and requirements that will be placed on the permitting process. So it's not that the whole world needs to change. This is a kind of a case-by-case consideration that you need to make. The other thing that can change the whole dynamic is, I think, increasingly, people will realize, those who don't already, that a big part of the answer to reduce CO2 emissions and cleaner power generation and compliance with the Clean Power Plan and things like that is enhanced -- is additional natural gas. And you don't get the additional natural gas without the additional gas infrastructure. So I think that's a driver that could potentially change some of that dynamic."

We've got the ability to self-fund that or to JV it, but it is an attractive JV candidate. But again, we're not in a position where we have to do anything, in particular, with it. But we continue to explore options to JV assets, and that's one of the big variables and sort of what our plans are and how quickly we get to where we want to go. And Elba is certainly on the list of things that we can consider. I don't think the rehearing really bears on it that much one way or the other.

In this case, I would say we've got an extremely tight, extremely well reasoned, extremely thorough 7(c). They took extra time to get it out.

But in that particular case, we had a partner who is bringing value, securing the asset but also bringing incremental investment opportunities to the project. So it made a lot of sense for us to go ahead and do that. With respect to CO2 specifically, we like that business. It's a good business. We invest and get good returns on that business. It's a niche for us. We're not out chasing E&P and shale and offshore and things like that. We have CO2, which is a scarce commodity. And we have the infrastructure to get it delivered to EOR fields where it's the only thing that can free up oil, and we've integrated forward into enhanced oil recovery. And we've got expertise there, and we think we're good at it. So we like that business, and we're happy to keep running it. If you think about your question in terms of a transaction or a potential transaction, we are shareholder-directed company. And if there is a transaction to be done that will improve overall value for our shareholders, we are absolutely going to consider it and do it if it makes sense. The considerations around CO2 specifically is that it would probably slightly dilutive or somewhat dilutive. And then the question would have to be, is the multiple expansion that you get on the remaining EBITDA of the remaining business and the yield contraction on DCF that you get by having a better portfolio or a more stable portfolio of remaining businesses enough to offset that and produce real shareholder value? And certainly, there are theoretical numbers at which that would work. And so again, we're a shareholder-directed company.

And our game plan -- again, we would reserve the right to see what the facts on the ground are when we get to that point. But our game plan would be, we obviously have a lot of firepower, a lot of free cash flow. And to the extent we can substantially increase the dividend while still maintaining an adequate coverage ratio, and by that, I would mean that we would be able to fund the equity portion of our going rate of capital expenditures. We don't know exactly what that is, but we look back and you take out the pigs going through the boa constrictor like Trans Mountain, for example. You're kind of in that, I don't know, $2 billion, $2.5 billion, $3 billion, in that range. And if you say once our balance sheet is where we want it, we're going to finance half of that out of retained cash and half of that back in the debt markets at that point in time, then you can get -- you can see your way clear to having a very nice dividend but with very nice coverage and maintaining a strong balance sheet. And that's really the trifecta that we're looking for. And I think, I mean, just look at this year, and I think Kim emphasized this, we're right consistent, absent the SNG transaction, with where we told you in April and where we told you in July we're going to be. And that leaves the DCF of about $2 per share for this year, and we're paying out a $0.50 dividend. That's a whale of a spread between the 2. But at some point, when we get this balance sheet the way we want it, we're going to be able to take that dividend up substantially and still have adequate coverage. We're not going back to having $0.05 of coverage or something like that because we like to cover our portion -- the equity portion of a normalized CapEx program."

But the difference is, we would not put -- would not contemplate putting out new equity. We would be using retained cash flow from operations to fund the ""equity portion"" of that. Does that answer your question now?"

And I think my answer to the first will address the answer to the second question, which is the -- the reason that we decreased the dividend primarily a year ago had to do with inefficient capital markets and not wanting to fund expansion CapEx in a market that wasn't rationally pricing debt and equity securities. And so I think that the debt market has changed. The equity market is still significantly different from where we were 12 months ago, 18 months ago. And so we are funding our CapEx program. So we -- in my mind, what we are constrained by -- we do want to improve the balance sheet, and that is a goal that we have. But what we are doing is we are living within our cash flow, meaning that we want to be able to fund our equity -- our CapEx and our dividend from our cash flow. And so that is the constraint. And so because we have limited amount of capital, that is why we have the hurdle rate set at 15% unlevered after-tax IRR for projects. I fully anticipate that over time, as the CapEx comes down and also as the balance sheet improves, that we would relax that standard. I don't know exactly what that number is going to be today, but it would be something less than the 15%. It probably won't be back at the 8% unlevered after-tax that we previously used for a hurdle rate, but we will have to make the assessment when that time comes."

But basically, I think our view is, it's very hard to get big newbuilds done into New England or into the Northeast. We've seen that not only with NED, which we talked about in the first quarter and discontinued, but also with recent rulings that, I think, verified that decision. It's making it harder to get things done on a kind of a mega-scale, call it. Now we have continued to engage with our customers on smaller scale projects and we'll continue to pursue those. But I think from the perspective of right now, today, it is hard to get new, significant gas infrastructure built into New England. And that would in -- tend to increase the basis differentials between what's already the lowest-price gas at Dominion South, call it, and the New England market, which is just a few -- the highest-priced in North America and just a few hundred miles away. So barring some improvement in an overall permitting environment, I think it's difficult to do those, but we'll keep looking for the smaller projects to do. The other thing, I think New England is a perfect example of what Rich said at the very beginning, which is that it does tend to make existing -- the existing network more valuable. The other thing I'd add and I'll let Tom throw in whatever he wants. But the TGP system is a system that is continuing to produce project opportunities for us. A lot of our backlog on TGP -- a lot of our backlog in gas is on TGP. I mean, it's the biggest home for it outside of the Elba project right now. And what a lot of that project capital is directed at now is getting the gas, as you know, Darren, south from the Marcellus and Utica to the new market, the new market area, which is now the Gulf Coast of the United States. And we are proceeding along very well with those. We're building on our existing footprint. That again goes to the need to make distinctions between projects out there and infrastructure projects, building off of your existing footprint, adding compression, maybe laying some parallel pipe, things like that. That create a different -- that's a different -- in a federally certificated process, that's a different context in which to be doing your project expansions. So I think you will see basis widen to New England, to the Northeast, and I think we'll find plenty of things to invest in and our -- plenty of things to invest in on TGP to get that gas someplace else."
