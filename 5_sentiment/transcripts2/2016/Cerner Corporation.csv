Zane Burke, our President, will follow me with result highlights and marketplace observations. And then Jeff Townsend, EVP and Chief of Staff, will provide an update on Intermountain Healthcare and Cerner's innovation. 
Now I will turn to our results. Q4 was a good finish to the year. Revenue, earnings and cash flow were all at or above targeted levels. Bookings were slightly below our guided levels, primarily because we didn't have a work steel on the quarter, but full year bookings were very strong. 
Our bookings revenue in Q4 was $1.35 billion, which reflects 16% growth over Q4 of '14. While that is a healthy growth rate, it is below our guided range. There was an IT work steel and a large professional services contract in our forecast that would have led us to comfortably achieving our guidance range. While they didn't close in Q4, we do expect it in future quarters. 
For the full year, our bookings revenue was $5.43 billion, which is 28% growth over 2014 and reflects more than $200 million of upside to the bookings guidance we provided throughout the year, including Q4.
Our revenue backlog ended the year at $14.2 billion, which is up from $10.6 billion a year ago. Revenue in the quarter was $1.18 billion, which is up 27% over Q4 of '14, in the middle of our guidance range.
The revenue composition for Q4 was $382 million in system sales, $247 million in support and maintenance, $528 million in services and $18 million in reimbursed travel.
Revenue in the quarter includes approximately $245 million from Health Services. This is down from approximately $250 million in Q3, but note that the deferred revenue adjustment was higher in Q4, so Health Services revenue was basically flat sequentially on an operational basis, which is in line with our expectations.
For the full year, revenue grew 30% over 2014 to $4.4 billion and includes approximately $930 million from Health Services. System sales revenue reflects a 36% increase over Q4 of, '1 with, the growth mainly driven by increase in subscriptions, which is where the addition of Health Services has had the biggest impact, as well as strong growth in licensed software. For the full year, system sales revenue grew by 36% over 2014. 
Our system sales margin percent in Q4 was 68.4%, which is up from 67.5% in Q3, due to strong sequential growth in licensed software. Full year system sales margin percent was 66.4%, which is basically flat compared to 2014. 
Moving to services. Total services revenue, including professional and managed services, was up 23% compared to Q4 of '14. Full year services revenue was up 28% over 2014.
Support and maintenance revenue increased 25% over Q4 of '14 and 35% for the full year, with a lower growth in Q4 due to the extra week in Q4 of 2014. 
Looking at revenue by geographic segment. Domestic revenue increased 28% over the year ago quarter $1.04 billion, and global revenue grew 21% at $234 million, both driven largely by the addition of Health Services. For the full year, domestic revenue grew 29%, and global grew 37%. 
As a preview to the annual update of our detailed business model that we will provide at our Investment Community Meeting on March 2 at HIMSS, I'd like to provide you with the total revenue and growth by business model for the full year 2015. 
Licensed software grew 24% to $564 million. Tech resale grew 21% to $330 million. Subscription increased 76% to $388 million. Professional services grew 13% to $1.24 billion. Managed services increased 56% to $858 million. Support and maintenance was up 35% to $976 million. And reimbursed travel was $73 million, which is down 19%.
Moving to gross margin. Our gross margin for Q4 was 83.0%, which is up from 81.3% in Q4 of '14, reflecting strong licensed software growth. Full year gross margin of 83% was up from 82.2% in 2014. 
Looking at operating spending. Our fourth quarter non-GAAP operating expenses, which exclude share-based compensation expense, voluntary separation plan expense and acquisition-related adjustments, were $686 million, which is up 31% compared to adjusted Q4 of '14 operating expenses. This growth was primarily driven by the addition of the Health Services business. 
For the full year, operating expenses before share-based compensation expense, voluntary separation plan expense and acquisition-related adjustments were up  33% to $2.6 billion. 
The total year-over-year growth for each expense category in Q4 on a non-GAAP basis was: 26% for sales and client service, 33% for software development and 59% from D&A. Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, the new line we added in Q2, was basically flat. 
For the full year, sales declined and service grew 29%, software development grew 38% and G&A grew 54%.
Moving to operating earnings and operating margins. Operating margin before share-based compensation expense, voluntary separation expense and acquisition-related adjustments was 24.7% in Q4, which is flat to the year ago period and up 20 basis points from Q3 of '15. Full year operating margin came in at 24.3%, which is basically flat compared to last year.
Moving to net earnings and EPS. Our GAAP net earnings in Q4 were $166 million or $0.48 per diluted share. Adjusted net earnings were $2.2 million, and adjusted EPS -- diluted EPS was $0.61, which is up 30% compared to Q4 of '14. Adjusted net earnings exclude share-based compensation expense, which had a net impact on GAAP earnings of $13 million or $0.04 per diluted share, as well as the voluntary separation plan expense, which had a net impact on GAAP earnings of $861,000 or less than $0.01 per diluted share. 
Adjusted net earnings also reflect adjustments related to the acquisition of Health Services, including Health Services acquisition-related amortization, which reduced GAAP net earnings and diluted earnings per share by $15 million and $0.04, respectively; other acquisition-related adjustments, which reduced GAAP net earnings and diluted earnings per share by $4 million and $0.01, respectively; and acquisition-related deferred revenue adjustment, which is not included in GAAP net earnings, but decreased -- increased adjusted net earnings and diluted earnings per share by $13 million and $0.04, respectively. 
For the full year, adjusted net earnings were $741 million and adjusted EPS was $2.11, which is  up 28% from 2014. 
Q4 tax rate for adjusted net earnings was 27%, which is lower than the normal range, primarily due to the R&D tax credit being reinstated in Q4. The R&D tax credit benefited EPS by approximately $0.04 or about $0.03 related to the first 3 quarters before the reinstatement of the credit. Therefore, we view our normalized adjusted EPS for the quarter as $0.58 instead of $0.61.
Now let's move to our balance sheet. [indiscernible] Q4 was $686 million of total cash and investments, which is down from $766 million in Q3, primarily due to the use of cash for our stock repurchase program. During the quarter, we finished the remaining $145 million of stock repurchases authorized in September this year, repurchasing 2.5 million shares at an average price of $58.40. For the year, we repurchased 5.7 million shares for $345 million or an average price of $60.39.
Moving to debt. Our total debt, including capital lease obligations, is $605 million, which is down slightly compared to Q3. Total receivables ended the quarter at $1.03 billion, which is down $19 million from Q3. Our Q4 DSO was 80 days, which is an improvement of 5 days compared to Q3. We are targeting DSO in the 70s in 2016. 
Operating cash flow for the quarter was extremely strong at $353 million, up from $272 million in Q3. Q4 capital expenditures was $107 million, and capitalized software was $60 million. Free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures and capitalized software, was $186 million for the quarter, driven by strong operating cash flow. 
For the full year, operating cash flow was $948 million and free cash flow was $321 million, with capital expenditures of $362 million and capitalized software of $265 million.
As previously indicated, we expect capital expenditures to increase in 2016, primarily due to construction of the new campus. We still expect to generate solid free cash flow, with growth in operating cash flow offsetting most of the increase in capital expenditures. 
Now let's go to Q1 and full year 2016 guidance.
For Q1, we expect revenue between $1.15 billion and $1.2 billion, with the midpoint reflecting growth of 18% over Q1 of '15. For the full year, we expect revenue between $4.9 billion and $5.1 billion, reflecting 13% growth over 2015 at the midpoint. We expect Q1 adjusted EPS before share-based compensation and acquisition-related adjustments to be $0.52 to $0.54 per share, with the midpoint reflecting 18% growth over Q1 '15 adjusted EPS.
For the full year, we continue to expect adjusted EPS before share-based compensation and acquisition-related adjustments to be $2.30 to $2.40, as initially stated on our Q3 earnings call, with the midpoint reflecting 11% growth over 2015.
Moving to bookings guidance. We expect bookings guidance in Q1 of $1.15 billion to $1.25 billion. The midpoint of this range is flat to Q1 of '15 bookings. Given a very tough comparable establishing Q1 of last year with 32% bookings growth and 28% growth for the full year in 2015, there will be some quarters this year with flat or low growth. We do expect for the year -- we do expect growth for the year, but note that even flat bookings will lead to a 2-year CAGR or 13%, also given that nearly 80% of our guided revenue is scheduled to come out of backlog. We believe we can deliver our revenue and earnings guidance even if bookings were flat. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Zane."

Today, I'll provide color on our results and make some marketplace observations. Starting with number bookings. Our bookings revenue in Q4 of $1.35 billion reflects 16% growth over Q4 2014. As Marc mentioned, this",1884,"Thanks, Marc. Good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'll provide color on our results and make some marketplace observations. 
Starting with number bookings. Our bookings revenue in Q4 of $1.35 billion reflects 16% growth over Q4 2014. As Marc mentioned, this is slightly lower than expected, primarily due to less long-term bookings but still a strong level bookings contribute to our excellent growth for the year at 28%.
Bookings this quarter included another all-time high level of large contracts, with 46 contracts over $5 million, including 29 over $10 million. For the year, we had 153 contracts over $5 million, with 102 being over $10 million. This reflects 37% growth in contracts over $5 million and 62% growth in contracts over $10 million. 
For long-term bookings, we had a strong quarter for remote hosting, but we did not have a new ITWorks or RevWorks deal. So the percent of bookings from long-term contracts was 27%, which is about 7% lower than the average of the first 3 quarters. 
For the year, long-term bookings were 32% of the total bookings, which is 2% higher than last year, reflecting full-year strength in the work steals. 
We continued our new business momentum in Q4 with 36% of our bookings coming from outside our 4 million installed base. 2015 was, by far, the best year in our history from a new business standpoint. During the year, we signed more than double the number of new footprints that any year in our history, which we believe is evidence of our strong competitiveness and a large opportunity for competitive displacements. 
Our success was very broad during the year, with new business coming from IBM, regional hospitals, children's hospitals, community hospitals, state and federal, behavioral health, ambulatory surgery centers and physician groups. 
I believe 2015 was a breakthrough year from a competitive standpoint. I believe our success is driven by several factors.  First, we are much better in key areas to cover because of our R&D investments. In the past 5 years, we've invested more than $2 billion in R&D, with a focus on population health, positioning clinician experience, revenue cycles, consumer and comparability, open platforms and mobility. These investments are leading to much better performance in traditional competitions for EHR revenue cycle and further differentiation in areas like population health and open platform capabilities. 
We have also focused on predictable delivery capabilities, cost of ownership and delivering measurable value, which is critical in an environment where ROI is increasingly important.
Finally, the marketplace is becoming more aware of our primary competitor's higher cost of ownership, consistent openness and a lack of investment in cloud-based systems to support population health. We believe this is leading to more success against our primary competitor in EHR procurements and opportunities in their installed base for population health.
Turning to population health. 2015 was a great year. We had 30% bookings growth, and we now have 85 clients that have chosen the HealtheIntent platform to support their population health strategy. 
The highlight in 2015 was success outside of our EHR installed base, with one example being Geisinger Health System choosing HealtheIntent to extend their data-driven population health capabilities. This announcement made a clear statement to the market and has already added to our long list of opportunities outside of our EHR base. 
We currently have more than 20 opportunities outside our installed base, most of which use our primary competitor's EHR. I believe this activity is validating the broad opportunity for HealtheIntent and the shortcomings of our primary competitor. 
Another highlight was the that we were recently selected sport the health insights of the statewide Medicaid population. The state will use HealtheIntent's Enterprise Data Warehouse Solution to gain insights and intelligence from claims and clinical information across the state's Medicaid population, which will enable them to manage outcomes at an optimal level. This is a new market entry point for Cerner, and as additional example, our HealtheIntent expands Cerner reach beyond our EHR base. 
A key reason we're having so much success in selling HealtheIntent solutions is the clients who have already adopted them are getting great value and have become examples for the industry for how technology can enable and transition to quality and value-based reimbursement. A good example of this was captured in the January feature in Health data Management Magazine. Article covered Advocate Health Care success at using HealtheIntent platform together more than 60 different clinical and transactional data sources and use predictive algorithms to predict the risks, improve patient care and control costs. 
Moving to our revenue cycle business. We had a very good year with bookings that are more than double 2014 levels and included several of our large clients choosing Cerner for revenue cycle. 
Operationally, we brought 39 acute-care sites and 455 clinics live on Millennium revenue cycle. And we now have more than 1,800 live sites. Our momentum in revenue cycle of also reflected in very strong organic revenue growth, with revenue cycles nearly doubling in the past 3 years.
We expect continued strong growth going forward with many large clients forecasted the transition to Cerner, revenue cycle and a large volume of reports and extended business opportunities.
Moving to the ambulatory market, where we had a strong Q4 and year. For the year, ambulatory bookings grew over 50% and included 38 displacements of our primary ambulatory competitors. This included some of our largest acute-care clients choosing to replace their existing ambulatory supplier. We also had a strong start to penetrating the Health Services base with 16 Health Services clients choosing Cerner ambulatory. 
Our ambulatory business operating services offering also had a strong year and included 2 -- our 2 largest deals to date, both of which were displaced in a certain cloud competitor. 
We also had a strong year in the small hospital market with our cloud-based community works offering, where we ended the year with more than 130 clients. This year's success was driven by a combination of traditional new footprints, extensions through our health system clients and Healthcare Services migrations.
One highlight for the year was Great Plains health alliance selecting Cerner community works for their 25 critical access hospitals across Nebraska and Kansas. 
Looking ahead, the small hospital market remains very active and expect 2016 to be another good year. 
Now I'd like to provide an update on the Department of Defense project. I'm pleased with the work accomplished by the Leidos partnership for health events. Over the past several months, as we prepare for the pilot by rollout the next month has a partnership will have that many of the solutions that will be used in of limitation including some military-specific workflows, first responder application from aspect vaccination of your synchronization. Our collaborative effort has led to solution announcements and data portability essential to achieving the free flow of information across all the use of care and creating system that works for help their organizations are working to improve the well-being of individuals and communities. I believe this work can benefit the entire client base and the broader health care industry. 
Moving to Health Services. We had a good first year at signing Health Services clients to migrate to Millennium. Over the year, over 40 sites signed to migrate, including both IDNs and small hospitals. Operationally, I'm very pleased with how Cerner and Health Services teams have come together in the past year. Health Services associates have proven to be highly talented of adding value in many key areas of our business. 
Outside the U.S., we had a solid year. Full non-U.S. revenue growth was 37%, with most of this driven by the addition of Health Services, as organic revenue growth was [indiscernible] to low single digits due to the extra week in 2014, the impact of currency fluctuations and the lower activity in some markets where economies are struggling. Even though our non-U.S. results tend to be lumpier, we continue to believe in global markets represent a large opportunity for growth for both EHR and population health. And Cerner's well positioned for this opportunity with associates or offices more than 25 countries, a strong market position in many of them.
Now I'd would like to provide several marketplace observations. The first is that health systems are increasingly being asked to live in 2 worlds. A future state, driven by reimbursement model aligned to risk and quality outcomes and a current state where people you for services the predominant model. To bridge the gap between the present and the future, health systems need to solve the same problem; how to effectively manage and make disparate data meaningful and drive appropriate actions from it; solving current state problems such as proactively identifying reimbursement opportunities; driving efficiency across the venue-specific workflows; and true visibility into the quality of care we delivered a critical to enable health systems outperform their peers in an increasingly competitive health care market. 
To make the pivot, health systems will compete by proactively identifying populations at risk, redefining clinical engagement to preempt problems and enabling the persons to be a more active member of that carotene. We believe clients are looking for flat from to help bridge these worlds, compete more effectively and quality and efficiency in today's environment. And we're actively engaging to manage population in the future state. And HealtheIntent is a perfect fit for satisfying these needs. 
Second, the EHR placement remains very active. While regulatory pressures and solutions being sunset by competitors continue to have opportunities, we're also seeing more purchasing behavior driven b y value ambition, which is positive for Cerner.
Almost all EHR placement am also represent a revenue cycle opportunity, as providers prefer integrated clinical, ambulatory and revenue cycle systems. 
Third, consolidation in the hospital market has remained active, and this is creating opportunity for Cerner in the past 3 years, Cerner clients accounted for nearly 50% of the hospital buying activity creating an opportunity for more than 100 new footprints. Consolidation is not isolated in the provider market, with payers and HCIT suppliers also actively merging in the subject is still to compete in the evolving health care market. 
Fourth, we believe that EHR will involve from a transactional system to an intelligent activity-based system that will enable faster adoption of best practices, reduce variance, personalized care, improve outcomes and the ability to identify unit costs, which will be critical as reimbursement shifts to outcome-based and bottle payments.
This is consistent with the direction from has been headed as been a focus for efforts within our market healthcare. 
Finally, we believe openness and interoperability continue to become increasingly important. This benefits Cerner because our long-time commitment to interoperability and open system. This commitment was an advanced our knowledge of our Cerner Open Developer Experience, which is an open site designed to enhance collaboration with third-party and client developers with SMART on Fire applications. We believe this open platform has the potential to unlock future cutting-edge solutions that can benefit out only our client base, but the entire industry. 
In summary, there is a significant amount of change occurring in health care. Move the more change of the next 5 years than the last several decades, and Cerner is very well positioned to benefit from these changes. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff."

After completing the second regional d",1002,"Thanks, Jim. Today, I'm going to provide an update of our collaboration with Intermountain Healthcare and what they refer to as I project and hos this is advancing Cerner's methodologies and our patient innovation. 
After completing the second regional deployment in Q4 of 2015, we are now deploying an ever improving model system design across Intermountain in 2016, while continuing to innovate and improve in parallel. A component of how we're doing both at the same time will be a topic that Mark, the CIO at Intermountain, and I will be co-presenting at him in an education session titled what it takes for a success. Sharing our joint experiences and approaches to shift traditional information technology to improvement technology that will better align with Intermountain's journey to Learning Healthcare System. 
By applying the hybrid of agile development concepts with continuous quality improvement is to significantly change pace of both innovation and adoption. As a by-product of this work, the model is a method continue to shape Cerner's medical generation of continuous improvement methodologies, which are represented within our model system framework. 
The library of process models workflows, configuration and best practices are all part of a comprehensive kit that is applicable and measurable across our client base, dispute our life cycle from innovation to adoption at scale. 
If this foundation of techniques, tools and measurements are utilized across multiple organization, Cerner has continued to build on our ability to measure the experience of an end user as they navigate through our applications. The suite of analytics is called Cerner Advance, which includes a set of solutions that has leveraged our learning in the population health space. The difference is that this is the population of clinicians using the systems and the health status is how effectively they're utilizing the features and preferences of the system within their workflow. It also allows us to identify and personalize improvement interactions at the individual the user level, just like you would with care management for patients. We all learn a different pace and different ways. This technique applies an Amazon-like consumer profiling for clinicians, which we think is a key component of accelerating adoption. 
As I've shared before, our core component of our relationship with Intermountain has been the ability to advance innovation of clinical computing models more quickly. Within Cerner, we have started to use the term model practice to represent the focus on contextual, clinical decision-making within the workflow as a seamless by-product of patient care. 
In the case of Intermountain Healthcare, this is where their Care Process Models surface naturally. As Zane outlined, the evolution of reimbursement models is increasing to the demand to remove unnecessary variance in both cost and outcomes, which is shifting the focus to greater predictability and intelligence within the EMR experience.
We are now far enough along our journey together that we have represented a breath of structural care models for simple to complex and have extended the platform capabilities with a small set of Cerner clients to cover the continuum of care models, guidelines, pathways and predictive algorithms. The suite of clinical decisions support solutions is called Care Decisions. This covers a continuum of capabilities that can range from highly contextual point-in-time decisions like a patient with pneumonia presenting in the ED for treatment, to a series of massive pathways that will cover chronic conditions or diseases like cancer that could span several years.
Architecture of this platform is based on open principles allowing for both for the ability of predictive models that run from the cloud across multiple clinical data sets that span enterprises. This is something we call a SMART Zone, which is face up within the physician workflow and conceptual to the moment. 
Through this coordinated set of care decision capabilities that we think we can deliver intelligence that would create what Clayton Richardson refers to as the facilitated network in his book of, Innovators Prescription. We anticipate this configurator and collection of open systems will make up the model practice layer of our model efforts and enable clinical evidence to be shareable, portable and programmable across Cerner clients and the industry. 
Finally, I wanted to briefly share of a growing capability of advancing activity center design within the EMR. We have found that the ability to make measurements from application experiences, process variation, clinical evidence and outcomes provides significant new insights into our ability to achieve business and clinical objectives. This, too is becoming part of the evolution towards a Learning Healthcare System, with priorities being established based on desired outcomes versus implementation of technology. 
In many cases, this inverts the model that has most chaste in the air of Meaningful Use. What we found is that while independently, workflow may be followed, it may not be timely, which, in turn, impacts the effectiveness of adopting clinical evidence. This, in turn, produces a suboptimal outcome, even though several of the process inter- metrics may have indicated a good result. This concept is shaping the new understanding of critical thinking and how clinical integration defaults and an environment where everything is connected and instantaneously aware with the depth and breadth of data that is significantly larger. As the boundaries move from patient center visits to the continuous engagement of population health, there's no question that we'll acquire this next layer of intelligence in context. 
Our ability to predict and dynamically adopt the health care ecosystem based on activities and context is what we think drives the next tier of outcome improvement.
Before handing the call over to the questions, I wanted to provide a brief update on Neal. 
His initial treatments have gone well, and he is progressing as expected. He's very appreciative of all the well wishes and has received from associates, clients and investors and pleased with the accident year he's received. 
And Cerner coming of no doubt that his experience will further fuel his desire to continue to improve the system. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to questions."

Some of them -- a lot of the new deals come to us have a long-term component. So I think using 30% is pretty reasonable. Keep in mind, we don't expect for next year to have flat bookings, but our backlog currently will supply 79% of next year's revenue, just coming out of that backlog. So from an income statement perspective, we're well-suited even if bookings have been to be flat as we always indicate when we talk about our guidance. But we do see in the first half of the year, certainly as it gives us our best visibility, would expect to exceed and grow bookings for that period."

So kind of updating where we have set up a previous conference that would have been through the third quarter. We're at 238 sites for the year, so that represented 8 of those 238. So very small percentage of those are related to the DOD in 2015. As we have successful moving forward with the DOD, we'd anticipate this additional insights coming into play. We see great market opportunity in 2016, similar to 2015 in terms of the opportunity that we see, particularly as we look out in the first 9 months of the year. And so I feel very strong about the opportunity and really our competitors from that. So I think we would expect to see similar numbers. It's hard to get it with each opportunity, number of sites is a little challenging because that can differ based on the mix that you have in there. But we see the same kind of levels of new market opportunities. So I think that kind of site-level performance will be pretty similar."

So I feel very good about those components. The number of migrations that we had, as I mentioned my prepared comments, was over 40. If you've looked at the previous 5 years combined, we had more conversions to Millennium than we had in the previous 5 years combined from just natural takeover, what happened from a migration perspective in the open-market place. So I would look at that as incredibly positive on the moving the traditional Siemens Health Services clients to a Millennium platform. The combination clients that have Cerner as a core EMR solution and as a revenue client, we have done a lot of work in terms of taking out the endpoints for those clients for managing those 2 different databases now that we're under one company and able to help those clients and really could de-risk that base from the revenue cycle perspective. So I feel really good about the overall performance of Health Services.

Good news is that they have the same lack of visibility on spending, and that actually turned out to be better from a reduced spending standpoint than the lower revenue. So we all ended up a year actually. We had it there we want to be from in the we perspective, as Zane said. That's probably the thing iCentra will point out as the bid was a little bit lower than what I original expectations. But significantly better obviously impacted some of the guidance we provided. I think as far as the 2 companies coming together, that feels really good. I'm very impressed with both of our teams and the effort and time that they put in to achieving kind of one Cerner view of the world. I think, 1 year in, we just today updated our financial systems to PeopleSoft 9.1. And so we are already in the same financial systems, and all that is pretty impressive to get done within this 12-month period from date of close.

Although when you grow the bookings over 30% in the year, growing the next years is going to be challenging on those tough comps, which we still believe we can grow. So I think from our standpoint, I think the backlog is strong, continues to grow. It's probably got, on average -- once you take out the initial component that supports 79% of our revenue next year, then you've got -- then basically probably point 3.5-year life of the remainder. So it will contribute significantly in 2017 absolutely from a backlog perspective. There's still plenty of medium firms elements of that backlog, particularly services, that roll out.

From a new bookings perspective, new footprints were actually very strong in Q4. So 36% of our bookings.

So we saw very strong growth in 2015, what I would actually say was near 2011 kind of meaningful use era decision-making in 2015. And we expect that to continue into 2016. So our experience was really very strong opportunity in '15, 2016  and beyond. And from that perspective, we over attained. When you really look at though one piece that doesn't get down, it was really truly an ITWorks and professional services on a deal that did get back to close, the professional services with that opportunity did not close but will close. And so those aren't reflective of the marketplace. So I wouldn't look at the bookings element and say, ""Any of that is reflective of marketplace."" I'm looking for marketplace as hot as it's been for the past 5-plus years in that perspective. And our competitiveness all-time high, helps us to feel very good about our position as we move in forward. I think there is great opportunity in a number of this is where client can either sunset their solution or near track to do in upgrades to solution and platforms to prepare for future elements. And there's this lack of confidence in those companies and organizations' ability to invest and deliver contemporary solutions. So the level of buying opportunity in 2016 and '17 is very strong. And I think that will -- our view point right now is that there's a very strong marketplace, and over half of the marketplace is basically up for grabs. In addition to that, our success around the penetrating the non-Cerner EHR base with our population health solutions in our care word solution is very significant, represents there opportunity on the upside for us as we move forward.

Given the size of the backlog, can you talk about how many years of visibility to you feel like you have to that 79% of next year's revenue, which is, I guess, probably $4 billion? Should we think of the backlog is representing 3.5 years or 4 years of the number is of visibility? Like you've basically got 80% visibility to 4 years of revenue. Is that the right way of thinking about it?"

I've got long-term bookings with all the bookings success we've had. I'm still -- I've added in a lot of long-term contracts. I mean, this year, we're 32% of our contracts are long term. So those aren't going to flow in to all significantly impact as a percent of the bookings number of those deals hit '17 or '18. So no, and we're, it's important. Deliver bookings to go see the backlog to drive the next year. But I can't tell you that I've got 80% of the next 4 years revenue sharing our backlog. That will be really nice thing to have happened. But the reality is the average life point you'd take out the '16 numbers is probably 3.5 average life. And you've got things that are 10 years in that and things that are shorter term. So from a visibility supervised outstanding visibility from a backlog, and especially from things that are in our bigger backlog, which includes support now, so I do have a significant visibility, but it's not -- wouldn't be 80%. Certainly, when I go into next year, I'm going to have delivered things from the $5.4-plus billion of bookings that I expect to deliver this year, that will then inform and help me on next year's numbers. So but certainly, I don't have a number that I can tell you write-off the top of my head of the percent of revenue and backlog today that will help '17. But certainly, it isn't 80% today, but by the time we get to the end of the year, my expectation is that keeps going up, which is impressive in the environment where I'm going to growth revenue double-digit next year."

I would tell you that there is captive Health Services offerings, particularly around things like publishing health and ambulatory, even some more mundane things, if you will, around surgery and a full functioning ED solution. So as clients come into -- do the migration, they will often procure additional software to fill out that solutions set, and that's what we've seen. And then we have additional implementation services to implement the new Millennium software. And then the recurring tends to stay fairly similar to what it has been. So the additional pops are in this -- the professional services and in the licensed software and any a related support fees that will go with those pieces, so for the long term. And the additional Cerner mode, most all of our clients do remote hosting. So they will come through or either do remote hosting aspects of that. And many of the Siemens Health Services clients were remote-hosted previously, but some of them were not. And so we see that trend picking up as well. So it's basically cookie cutter in terms of where the failure there's a percentage increase that we see because all clients are not created equal in terms of what they contracted for or what they want to do moving forward. But generally speaking, you see us rounding up a full solution set and doing the implementation, doing the hosting and ongoing maintenance. So it does represent an uplift and typically, overall revenues."

And obviously, some of our time to not only working with publishing but they just won a work in a way to go back into their identify a population, where they could go actually do some proactive services for, which improves their revenue and also reduces the overall cost of whoever is taking over. So from a bookings standpoint, those have not been a significant contributor. So I'd say kind if you look at the total bookings, we gave be a percent of new clients, which most of which probably aren't having a significant component of HealtheIntent with a brand-new client. Our ITWorks client, works businesses, which are really not -- they're separated out. And when you look at the long-term being 30-plus percent if you look at the new clients 30-plus percent, you kind of got the bucket of things that are going in the base.

So as we look at Q1 last year to Q1 of 2016, we're giving you our best guidance as it relates to that quarter. As it relates to the year, I feel very strongly that we will see bookings growth for the year. We just turn out providing guidance as it relates to the year of bookings. There's great opportunities out there. In 2015, I see very similar around the new business opportunities that we had for 2015, I see the same dynamics at play for 2016. So there's still a competitors that are sunsetting solutions. There are competitors that have not kept contemporary architectures, and they don't age like a fine wine. And so those are born to become more and more at play in that. So I feel very good about the EHR market. In addition, there are all the works pieces of the business and the population health, which continues to get traction. So my expectation is that we will grow bookings in 2016 on a very tough comparable from 2015. We're just looking at Q1 and providing the best guidance that we can as we look at the mix of the opportunities in there. And so the sway of kind of one services piece and one ITWorks deal really shouldn't taint how we feel about the market and does not. So my long-term view of the marketplace and, frankly, short-term view is very, very bullish. And I feel really good about that. And because there has never been a bigger need for health care IT solutions. And so kind of that piece of living in a fee-for-service world and an at-risk model, it's coming slower. But the nice part is you can utilize our population health and solutions to maximize both worlds. And really, we're the only ones doing that, which is really unique, and it's creating a differentiation for us in the marketplace. And that's where, I think, as people begin to understand that, you'll see even accelerated growth on top of the great growth we've seen in that space."

Now I will turn to our results. Q4 was a good finish to the year. Revenue, earnings and cash flow were all at or above targeted levels. Bookings were slightly below our guided levels, primarily because we didn't have a work steal on the quarter, but full year bookings were very strong. 
Our bookings revenue in Q4 was $1.35 billion, which reflects 16% growth over Q4 of '14. While that is a healthy growth rate, it is below our guided range. There was an IT work steal and a large professional services contract in our forecast that would have led us to comfortably achieving our guidance range. While they didn't close in Q4, we do expect it in future quarters. 
For the full year, our bookings revenue was $5.43 billion, which is 28% growth over 2014 and reflects more than $200 million of upside to the bookings guidance we've provided throughout the year, including Q4.
Our revenue backlog ended the year at $14.2 billion, which is up from $10.6 billion a year ago. Revenue in the quarter was $1.18 billion, which is up 27% over Q4 of '14, in the middle of our guidance range.
The revenue composition for Q4 was $382 million in system sales, $247 million in support and maintenance, $528 million in services and $18 million in reimbursed travel.
Revenue in the quarter includes approximately $245 million from Health Services. This is down from approximately $250 million in Q3, but note that the deferred revenue adjustment was higher in Q4, so Health Services revenue was basically flat sequentially on an operational basis, which is in line with our expectations.
For the full year, revenue grew 30% over 2014 to $4.4 billion and includes approximately $930 million from Health Services. System sales revenue reflects a 36% increase over Q4 of, '1 with the growth mainly driven by increase in subscriptions, which is where the addition of Health Services has had the biggest impact, as well as strong growth in licensed software. For the full year, system sales revenue grew by 36% over 2014. 
Our system sales margin percent in Q4 was 68.4%, which is up from 67.5% in Q3, due to strong sequential growth in licensed software. Full year system sales margin percent was 66.4%, which is basically flat compared to 2014. 
Moving to services. Total services revenue, including professional and managed services, was up 23% compared to Q4 of '14. Full year services revenue was up 28% over 2014.
Support and maintenance revenue increased 25% over Q4 of '14 and 35% for the full year, with a lower growth in Q4 due to the extra week in Q4 of 2014. 
Looking at revenue by geographic segment. Domestic revenue increased 28% over the year-ago quarter to $1.04 billion, and global revenue grew 21% at $234 million, both driven largely by the addition of Health Services. For the full year, domestic revenue grew 29%, and global grew 37%. 
As a preview to the annual update of our detailed business model that we'll provide at our Investment Community Meeting on March 2 at HIMSS, I'd like to provide you with the total revenue and growth by business model for the full year 2015. 
Licensed software grew 24% to $564 million. Tech resale grew 21% to $330 million. Subscriptions increased 76% to $388 million. Professional services grew 13% to $1.24 billion. Managed services increased 56% to $858 million. Support and maintenance was up 35% to $976 million. And reimbursed travel was $73 million, which is down 19%.
Moving to gross margin. Our gross margin for Q4 was 83.0%, which is up from 81.3% in Q4 of '14, reflecting strong license software growth. Full year gross margin of 83% was up from 82.2% in 2014. 
Looking at operating spending. Our fourth quarter non-GAAP operating expenses, which exclude share-based compensation expense, voluntary separation plan expense and acquisition-related adjustments were $686 million, which is up 31% compared to adjusted Q4 of '14 operating expenses. This growth was primarily driven by the addition of the Health Services business. 
For the full year, operating expenses before share-based compensation expense, voluntary separation plan expense and acquisition-related adjustments were up 33% to $2.6 billion. 
The total year-over-year growth for each expense category in Q4 on a non-GAAP basis was: 26% for sales and client service, 33% for software development and 59% for D&A. Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, the new line we added in Q2, was basically flat. 
For the full year, sales and client service grew 29%, software development grew 38% and G&A grew 54%.
Moving to operating earnings and operating margins. Our operating margin before share-based compensation expense, voluntary separation expense and acquisition-related adjustments was 24.7% in Q4, which is flat to the year-ago period and up 20 basis points from Q3 of '15. Full year operating margin came in at 24.3%, which is basically flat compared to last year.
Moving to net earnings and EPS. Our GAAP net earnings in Q4 were $166 million or $0.48 per diluted share. Adjusted net earnings were $2.2 million, and adjusted EPS -- diluted EPS was $0.61, which is up 30% compared to Q4 of '14. Adjusted net earnings exclude share-based compensation expense, which had a net impact on GAAP earnings of $13 million or $0.04 per diluted share, as well as a voluntary separation plan expense, which had a net impact on GAAP earnings of $861,000 or less than $0.01 per diluted share. 
Adjusted net earnings also reflect adjustments related to the acquisition of Health Services, including Health Services acquisition-related amortization, which reduced GAAP net earnings and diluted earnings per share by $15 million and $0.04, respectively; other acquisition-related adjustments, which reduced GAAP net earnings and diluted earnings per share by $4 million and $0.01, respectively; and the acquisition-related deferred revenue adjustment, which is not included in GAAP net earnings, but decreased -- increased adjusted net earnings and diluted earnings per share by $13 million and $0.04, respectively. 
For the full year, adjusted net earnings were $741 million and adjusted EPS was $2.11, which is  up 28% from 2014. 
Q4 tax rate for adjusted net earnings was 27%, which is lower than the normal range, primarily due to the R&D tax credit being reinstated in Q4. The R&D tax credit benefited EPS by approximately $0.04 or about $0.03 related to the first 3 quarters before the reinstatement of the credit. Therefore, we view our normalized adjusted EPS for the quarter as $0.58 instead of $0.61.
Now I'll move to our balance sheet. Beginning Q4 was $686 million of total cash and investments, which is down from $766 million in Q3, primarily due to the use of cash for our stock repurchase program. During the quarter, we finished the remaining $145 million of stock repurchases authorized in September this year, repurchasing 2.5 million shares at an average price of $58.40. For the year, we repurchased 5.7 million shares for $345 million or an average price of $60.39.
Moving to debt. Our total debt, including capital lease obligations, is $605 million, which is down slightly compared to Q3. Total receivables ended the quarter at $1.03 billion, which is down $19 million from Q3. Our Q4 DSO was 80 days, which is an improvement of 5 days compared to Q3. We are targeting DSO in the 70s in 2016. 
Operating cash flow for the quarter was extremely strong at $353 million, up from $272 million in Q3. Q4 capital expenditures was $107 million, and capitalized software was $60 million. Free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures and capitalized software, was $186 million for the quarter, driven by strong operating cash flow. 
For the full year, operating cash flow was $948 million, and free cash flow was $321 million, with capital expenditures of $362 million and capitalized software of $265 million.
As previously indicated, we expect capital expenditures to increase in 2016, primarily due to construction of the new campus. We still expect to generate solid free cash flow, with growth in operating cash flow offsetting most of the increase in capital expenditures. 
Now I'll go through to Q1 and full year 2016 guidance. For Q1, we expect revenue between $1.15 billion and $1.2 billion, with the midpoint reflecting growth of 18% over Q1 of '15. For the full year, we expect revenue between $4.9 billion and $5.1 billion, reflecting 13% growth over 2015 at the midpoint. We expect Q1 adjusted EPS before share-based compensation and acquisition-related adjustments to be $0.52 to $0.54 per share, with the midpoint reflecting 18% growth over Q1 '15 adjusted EPS.
For the full year, we continue to expect adjusted EPS before share-based compensation and acquisition-related adjustments to be $2.30 to $2.40, as initially stated on our Q3 earnings call, with the midpoint reflecting 11% growth over 2015.
Moving to bookings guidance. We expect bookings guidance in Q1 of $1.15 billion to $1.25 billion. The midpoint of this range is flat to Q1 of '15 bookings. Given a very tough comparable establishing Q1 of last year with 32% bookings growth and 28% growth for the full year in 2015, there will be some quarters this year with flat or low growth. We do expect for the year -- we do expect growth for the year, but note that even flat bookings will lead to a 2-year CAGR or 13%. Also given that nearly 80% of our guided revenue is scheduled to come out of backlog. We believe we can deliver our revenue and earnings guidance even if bookings were flat. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Zane."

As Marc mentioned, this is",1898,"Thanks, Marc. Good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'll provide color on our results and make some marketplace observations. 
Starting with our bookings. Our bookings revenue in Q4 of $1.35 billion reflects 16% growth over Q4 2014. As Marc mentioned, this is slightly lower than expected, primarily due to less long-term bookings but still a strong level bookings that contributed to our excellent growth for the year at 28%.
Bookings this quarter included another all-time high level of large contracts, with 46 contracts over $5 million, including 29 over $10 million. For the year, we had 153 contracts over $5 million, with 102 of those being over $10 million. This reflects 37% growth in contracts over $5 million and 62% growth in contracts over $10 million. 
For long-term bookings, we had a strong quarter for remote hosting, but we did not have a new ITWorks or RevWorks deal. So the percent of bookings from long-term contracts was 27%, which is about 7% lower than the average of the first 3 quarters. 
For the year, long-term bookings were 32% of the total bookings, which is 2% higher than last year, reflecting full-year strength in the work steals.
We continued our new business momentum in Q4 with 36% of our bookings coming from outside our 4 million installed base. 2015 was, by far, the best year in our history from a new business standpoint. During the year, we signed more than double the number of new footprints that any year in our history, which we believe is evidence of our strong competitiveness and a large opportunity for competitive displacements. 
Our success was very broad during the year, with new business coming from IDNs, regional hospitals, children hospitals, community hospitals, state and federal, behavioral health, ambulatory surgery centers and physician groups. 
I believe 2015 was a breakthrough year from a competitive standpoint. I believe our success is driven by several factors: First, we are much better in key areas that cover up because of our R&D investments. In the past 5 years, we've invested more than $2 billion in R&D, with a focus on population health, positioning clinician experience, revenue cycle, consumer and operability, open platforms and mobility. These investments are leading to much better performance in traditional competitions for EHR revenue cycle and further differentiation in areas like population health and open-platform capabilities. 
We have also focused on predictable delivery capabilities, cost of ownership and delivering measurable value, which is critical in an environment where ROI is increasingly important.
Finally, the marketplace is becoming more aware of our primary competitor's higher cost of ownership, lack of system openness and a lack of investment in cloud-based systems to support population health. We believe this is leading to more success against our primary competitor in EHR procurements and opportunities in their installed base for population health.
Turning to population health. 2015 was a great year. We had 30% bookings growth, and we now have 85 clients that have chosen the HealtheIntent platform to support their population health strategy. 
The highlight in 2015 was success outside of our EHR installed base, with one example being Geisinger Health System choosing HealtheIntent to extend their data-driven population health capabilities. This announcement made a clear statement to the market and has already added to our long list of opportunities outside of our EHR base. 
We currently have more than 20 opportunities outside our installed base, most of which use our primary competitor's EHR. I believe this activity is validating the broad opportunity for HealtheIntent and the shortcomings of our primary competitor. 
Another highlight was the that we were recently selected to sport the health insights of the statewide Medicaid population. The state will use HealtheIntent's Enterprise Data Warehouse Solution to gain insights and intelligence from claims and clinical information across the state's Medicaid population, which will enable them to manage outcomes at an optimal level. This is a new market entry point for Cerner, and as additional example, our HealtheIntent expands Cerner reach beyond our EHR base. 
A key reason we're having so much success at selling HealtheIntent solutions is that clients who have already adopted them are getting great value and have become examples for the industry for how technology can enable the transition to quality and value-based reimbursement. A good example of this was captured in a January feature in Health Data Management magazine. The article covered Advocate Health Care success at using HealtheIntent platform to gather more than 60 different clinical and transactional data sources and use predictive algorithms to predict risks, improve patient care and control costs. 
Moving to our revenue cycle business. We had a very good year with bookings that are more than double 2014 levels and included several of our large clients choosing Cerner for revenue cycle. 
Operationally, we brought 39 acute-care sites and 455 clinics live on Millennium revenue cycle, and we now have more than 1,800 live sites. Our momentum in revenue cycle also reflected in very strong organic revenue growth, with revenue cycles nearly doubling in the past 3 years.
We expect continued strong growth going forward with many large clients forecasted to transition to Cerner revenue cycle and a large volume of RevWorks and extended business office opportunities.
Moving to the ambulatory market, where we had a strong Q4 and year. For the year, ambulatory bookings grew over 50% and included 38 displacements of our primary ambulatory competitors. This included some of our largest acute care clients choosing to replace their existing ambulatory supplier. We also had a strong start to penetrating the Health Services base with 16 Health Services clients choosing Cerner ambulatory. 
Our ambulatory business office services offering also had a strong year that included 2 -- our 2 largest deals to date, both of which were displaced in some of the certain cloud competitor. 
We also had a strong year in the small hospital market with our cloud-based CommunityWorks offering, where we ended the year with more than 130 clients. This year's success was driven by a combination of traditional new footprints, extensions through our health system clients and Health Services migrations.
One highlight for the year was Great Plains Health Alliance selecting Cerner CommunityWorks for their 25 critical access hospitals across Nebraska and Kansas. 
Looking ahead, the small hospital market remains very active and expect 2016 to be another good year. 
Now I'd like to provide an update on the Department of Defense project. I'm pleased with the work accomplished by the Leidos partnership for health events. Over the past several months, as we prepare for the pilot flight rollout. The next months ahead, the partnership will highlight have that many of the solutions that will be used in the implementation, including some military-specific workflows, first responder applications, mass vaccinations and theater synchronizations. Our collaborative effort has led to solution enhancements and data portability that are essential to achieving the free flow of information across all the uses of care and creating a system that works for health care organizations working to improve the well-being of individuals and communities. I believe this work can benefit the entire client base and the broader health care industry. 
Moving to Health Services. We had a good first year at signing Health Services clients to migrate to Millennium. Over the year, over 40 sites signed to migrate, including both IDNs and small hospitals. Operationally, I'm very pleased with how Cerner and Health Services teams have come together in the past year. Health Services associates have proven to be highly talented and are adding value in many key areas of our business. 
Outside the U.S., we had a solid year. Full non-U.S. revenue growth was 37%, with most of this driven by the addition of Health Services, as organic revenue growth was limited to low single-digit due to the extra week in 2014, the impact of currency fluctuations and the lower activity in some markets where economies are struggling. Even though our non-U.S. results tend to be lumpier, we continue to believe the global markets represent a large opportunity for growth for both EHR and population health. And Cerner is well-positioned for this opportunity with associates or offices in more than 25 countries and a strong market position in many of them.
Now I'd would like to provide several marketplace observations. The first is that health systems are increasingly being asked to live in 2 worlds, at future state, driven by reimbursement models aligned to risk and quality outcomes and a current state where fee-for-service is still the predominant model. To bridge the gap between the present and the future, health systems need to solve the same problem: How to effectively manage and make disparate data meaningful and drive appropriate actions from it; solving current state problems such as proactively identifying reimbursement opportunities; driving efficiency across the venue-specific workflows; and true visibility into the quality of care we delivered are critical to enable health systems outperform their peers in an increasingly competitive health care market. 
To make the pivot, health systems will compete by proactively identifying populations at risk, redefining clinical engagement to preempt problems and enabling the person to be a more active member of the care team. We believe clients are looking for a platform to help bridge these worlds, compete more effectively and quality and efficiency in today's environment and more actively engaged in managed population in the future state. And HealtheIntent was a perfect fit for satisfying these needs. 
Second, the EHR placement market remains very active. While regulatory pressures and solution being sunset by competitors continue to drive opportunities, we're also seeing more purchasing behavior driven by value and vision, which is positive for Cerner.
Almost all EHR placements also represent a revenue cycle opportunity as providers prefer integrated clinical, ambulatory and revenue cycle systems. 
Third. Consolidations in the hospital market has remained active, and this is creating opportunities for Cerner. In the past 3 years, Cerner clients accounted for nearly 50% of the hospital buying activity, creating an opportunity for more than 100 new footprints. Consolidation is not isolated in the provider market with payers and HCIT suppliers also actively merging in attempt to attain scale to compete in the evolving health care market. 
Fourth. We believe that EHR will evolve from a transactional system to an intelligent activity-based system that will enable faster adoption of best practices, reduce variance, personalized care, improved outcomes and the ability to identify unit costs, which will be critical as reimbursement shift to outcome-based and bundle payments.
This is consistent with the direction Cerner has been headed and has been a focus for our efforts with Intermountain Healthcare. 
Finally, we believe openness and interoperability continue to become increasingly important. This benefits Cerner because of our long-time commitment to interoperability and open systems. This commitment was recently advanced by our launch of our Cerner Open Developer Experience, which is an open site designed to enhance collaboration with third-party and client developers with SMART on FHIR applications. We believe this open platform has a potential to unlock future cutting-edge solutions that can benefit not only our client base, but the entire industry. 
In summary, there's a significant amount of change occurring in health care. There would be more change in the next 5 years than the last several decades, and Cerner is very well-positioned to benefit from these changes. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff."

Today, I'm going to provide an update on our collaboration with Intermountain Healthcare in what they refer to as iCentra project and how this is advancing Cerner's methodologies and our patient innovation. 
After completing the second regional deployment in Q4 of 2015, we are now heads down deploying an ever-improving model system design across Intermountain in 2016, while continuing to innovate and improve in parallel. A component of how we're doing both at the same time will be a topic that Marc Probst, the CIO at Intermountain, and I will be co-presenting at HiMSS, an education session titled, What IT Takes for Success. Sharing our joint experiences and approaches to shift traditional information technology to improvement technology that will better align with Intermountain's journey to Learning Healthcare System. 
By applying the hybrid of agile development concepts with continuous quality improvement significantly change pace of both innovation and adoption. As a by-product of this work, the models and methods continue to shape Cerner's next generation of continuous improvement methodologies, which are represented within our model system framework. 
The library of process models workflows, configuration and best practices are all part of a comprehensive kit that is applicable and measurable across our client base, dispute our life cycle from innovation to adoption at scale. 
As this foundation of techniques, tools and measurements are utilized across multiple organization, Cerner has continued to build on our ability to measure the experience of an end-user as they navigate through our applications. The suite of analytics is called Cerner Advance, which includes a set of solutions that has leveraged our learning in the population health space. The difference is that this is the population of clinicians using the systems and the health status is how effectively they're utilizing the features and preferences of the system within their workflow. It also allows us to identify and personalize improvement interactions at the individual user level, just like you would with care management for patients. We all learn at a different pace and different ways. This technique applies an Amazon-like consumer profiling for clinicians, which we think is a key component of this accelerating adoption. 
As I've shared before, our core component of our relationship with Intermountain has been the ability to advance innovation of clinical computing models more quickly. Within Cerner, we have started to use the term model practice to represent the focus on contextual, clinical decision-making within the workflow as a seamless by-product of patient care. 
In the case of Intermountain Healthcare, this is where their Care Process Models surface naturally. As Zane outlined, the evolution of reimbursement models is increasing the demand to remove unnecessary variance in both cost and outcomes, which is shifting the focus to greater predictability and intelligence within the EMR experience.
We are now far enough along in our journey together that we have represented a breath of structured care models from simple to complex and have extended the platform capabilities with a small set of Cerner clients that cover the continuum of care models, guidelines, pathways and predictive algorithms. The suite of clinical decisions support solutions is called care decisions. This covers a continuum of capabilities that can range from highly contextual point-in-time decisions, like a patient with pneumonia presenting in the ED for treatment, to a series of massive pathways that would cover chronic conditions or diseases like cancer that could span several years.
The architecture of this platform is based on open principles, allowing for both portability of predictive models that run from the cloud across multiple clinical data sets that span enterprises to something we call a SMART Zone, which is face up within the physician workflow and contextual to the moment. 
Through this coordinated set of care decision son that we think we can deliver intelligence that would create what Clayton Christensen refers to as a facilitated network in his book, The Innovator's Prescription. We anticipate this configuration and collection of open systems will make up the model practice layer of our model efforts and enable clinical evidence to be shareable, portable and programmable across Cerner clients and the industry. 
Finally, I wanted to briefly share the growing capabilities of advancing activity center design within the EMR. We have found that the ability to link measurements from application experiences, process variation, clinical evidence and outcomes provide significant new insights into our ability to achieve business and clinical objectives. This, too, is becoming part of the evolution towards learning healthcare system, with priorities being established based on desired outcomes versus implementation of technology. 
In many cases, this inverts the model that has most of chaste in the air of Meaningful Use. What we found is that while independently, workflow may be followed, it may not be timely, which, in turn, impacts the effectiveness of adopting clinical evidence. This, in turn, produces a suboptimal outcome, even though several of the process-centered metrics may have indicated a good result. This concept is shaping the new understanding of that critical thinking in how clinical integration evolves in an environment where everything is connected and instantaneously aware of the depth and breadth of data that is significantly larger. As the boundaries move from patient center visits to the continuous engagement of population health, there's no question that we'll acquire this next layer of intelligence in context. 
Our ability to predict and dynamically adopt to health care ecosystem based on the activity in context is what we think drives the next tier of outcome improvement.
Before handing the call over to the questions, I wanted to provide a brief update on Neal. 
His initial treatments have gone well, and he is progressing as expected. He's very appreciative of all the well wishes and has -- he has received from associates, clients and investors and pleased with the excellent care he has received. 
At Cerner, we have no doubt that his experience will further fuel his desire to continue and -- to improve the system. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to questions."

So when we talk about Q1 bookings, it's -- it likely is going to be slightly lower, but it's not unusual for Q1 to be somewhat cyclical and a little bit lower than we have experienced. So I think when we look at the first half of the year, when we see the pipeline that we have, I think we're very confident that we'll see a bit growth in bookings. So Q1 is more a reflection of us telling kind of exactly what we're seeing without any of the carryover deals from Q4 benefiting us."

So from an income statement perspective, we're well-suited even if bookings happen to be flat as we always indicate when we talk about our guidance.

So kind of updating where we were as said at a previous conference that would have been through the third quarter. We're at 238 sites for the year. So that represented 8 of those 238. So a very small percentage of those are related to the DOD in 2015. As we have successful moving forward with the DOD, we'd anticipate those additional site coming into play. We see great market opportunity in 2016, similar to 2015 in terms of the opportunity that we see, particularly as we look out in the first 9 months of the year. And so I feel very strong about the opportunity, and really, our competitors is nice. So I think we would expect to see similar numbers. It's hard to get it with each opportunity. Number of sites is a little challenging because that can differ based on the mix that you have in there.

So we -- I feel very good about those components. The number of migrations that we had, as I mentioned in my prepared comments, was over 40. If you've looked at the previous 5 years combined, we had more conversions to Millennium than we had in the previous 5 years combined from just natural takeover, what happened from a migration perspective in the open market place. So I would look at that as incredibly positive on the moving the traditional Siemens Health Services clients to a Millennium platform. The combination clients that have Cerner as a core EMR solution and as a revenue cycle client, we have done a lot of work in terms of taking out the pain points for those clients for managing those 2 different databases now that we're under one company and able to help those clients and really could de-risk that base from the revenue cycle perspective.

The good news is that they have the same lack of visibility on spending, and that actually turned out to be better from a reduced spending standpoint than the lower revenue. So we all ended up a year, actually, ahead of what we wanted from an OE perspective, as Zane said. So I think that's probably the thing I would point out as something that was a little bit lower than our original expectation. Not significantly, but enough that they obviously impacted some of the guidance that we've provided. I think as far as the 2 companies coming together, that feels really good. I'm very impressed with both of our teams and the effort and time that they've put in to achieving a kind of one Cerner view of the world. And I think, 1 year in, we just today upgraded our financial systems to PeopleSoft 9.1.

And if someone has figured out why that happens all the time, we're interested because it kind of sometimes comes in cycles like that a little bit. Although, when you grow the bookings over 30% in the year, growing the next year is going to be challenging on those tough comps, which we still believe we can grow. So I think from our standpoint, I think the backlog is strong and continues to grow. It's probably got an average -- once you take out the initial component that supports 79% of my revenue next year, then you've got -- then you basically probably have a 3.5-year average life of the remainder. So it will contribute significantly in 2017 absolutely from a backlog perspective. There's still plenty of medium firms elements in that backlog, particularly services, that roll out. And if we deliver the bookings that we expect -- certainly, for this year, if we even just deliver flat bookings and don't grow bookings, we'll not only deliver '16, but we set ourselves up well for '17."

From a new bookings perspective, new footprints were actually very strong in Q4. So it's 36% of our bookings. So we overachieved actually our internal projections and plans around the new business sites. So we saw very strong growth in 2015, what I would actually say it was near 2011 kind of meaningful use era type decision-makings in 2015. And we expect that to continue into 2016. So our experience was really very strong opportunity in '15, 2016 and beyond. And from that perspective, we over-attained. When you really look at the one piece that doesn't get done was, really, truly, in ITWorks. And a professional services on a deal that did get back to close, the professional services with that opportunity did not close but will close. And so those aren't reflective of the marketplace. So I wouldn't look at the bookings element and say, ""Any of that is reflective of the marketplace."" I'm looking at the marketplace as hot as it's been in the past 5-plus years in that perspective. And our competitiveness at all-time highs helps us to feel very good about our position as we move in forward. I think there's great opportunity in a number of bases where client companies have either sunset their solution or they're trying to do upgrades to solutions and platforms to prepare for future elements. And there's just a lack of confidence in those companies and organizations' ability to invest and deliver contemporary solutions. So the level of buying opportunity in 2016 and '17 is very strong. And I think that will -- our viewpoint right now is that there's a very strong marketplace, and over half of the marketplace is basically up for grabs. In addition to that, our success around penetrating the non-Cerner EHR base with our population health solutions and our CareAware solutions is very significant and represents the opportunity on the upside for us as we move forward. And I think that's another area where we'll need to continue to provide more information for you so you get to understand the impact of what that means for us because we see the market unfolding probably as -- I don't think I've ever seen it as robust as it is today. And as I look forward, it looks incredibly robust. I just think the makeup of that will evolve in terms of both EHR decisions as well as population health and other solutions that we have."

So those aren't going to flow into all -- significantly impact as a percent of the bookings number of those deals hit '17 or '18. So no, it's -- every year, it's important that I go out and deliver bookings that go feed the backlog to drive the next year. But -- so I can't tell you that I've got 80% of the next 4 years' revenue sit in my backlog. That would be a really nice thing to have happened. But the reality is the average life points you'd take out for the '16 numbers is probably 3.5 average life. But you've got things that are 10 years in that and things that are shorter-term. So from a visibility -- supervised outstanding visibility from a backlog and especially from things that are in our bigger backlog, which includes support now, so I do have a significant visibility, but it's not -- it wouldn't be 80%. Certainly, when I go into next year, I'm going to have delivered things from the $5.4-plus billion of bookings that I expect to deliver this year that will then inform and help me on next year's numbers. So -- but certainly, I don't have a number that I could tell you right off the top of my head of the percent of revenue and backlog today that will help '17.

I would tell you that there was gaps in the Health Services offerings, particularly around things like population health and ambulatory, even some more mundane things, if you will, around surgery and a full functioning ED solution. So as clients come into -- do the migration, they will often procure additional software to fill out that solution set, and that's what we've seen. And then we have additional implementation services to implement the new Millennium software. And then the recurring tends to stay fairly similar to what it has been. So the additional pops are in this -- the professional services and in the licensed software and any related support fees that would go with those pieces so for the long term. And then the traditional Cerner mode, most all of our clients do remote hostings, so they will come through and do the remote hosting aspects of that if they -- and many of the Siemens Health Services clients were remote-hosted previously, but some of them were not. And so we see that trend picking up as well. So it's basically -- there's not a cookie cutter in terms of I can tell you here's the percentage increase that we see because all clients are not created equal in terms of what they've contracted for or what they want to go do moving forward.

And obviously, some of our clients are not only looking at the risk population but they're just looking at a way to go back into their -- to identify a population where they could go, actually do some proactive services for, which improves that revenue and also reduces the overall cost of whoever is taking the risk. So from a bookings standpoint, those have not been a significant contributor. So I'd say kind of if you look at the total bookings, we give you a percent of new clients, which most of which probably aren't having a significant component of HealtheIntent with a brand-new client. Our ITWorks client and works businesses, which are really not -- they're separated out.

And so the sway of kind of one services piece and one ITWorks deal really shouldn't taint how we feel about the market and does not. So my long-term view of the marketplace and, frankly, short-term view is very, very bullish. And I feel really good about that. And because there has never been a bigger need for health care IT solutions. And so kind of that piece of living in a fee-for-service world and an at-risk model, it's coming slower. But the nice part is you can utilize our population health and solutions to maximize both worlds. And really, we're the only ones doing that, which is really unique, and it's creating a differentiation for us in the marketplace. And that's where, I think, as people begin to understand that, you'll see even accelerated growth on top of the great growth we've seen in that space."

Now I will turn to our results. Q4 was a good finish to the year. Revenue, earnings and cash flow were all at or above targeted levels. Bookings were slightly below our guided levels, primarily because we didn't have a Works deal in the quarter. The full year bookings were very strong. 
Our bookings revenue in Q4 was $1.35 billion, which reflects 16% growth over Q4 of '14. While that is a healthy growth rate, it is below our guided range. There was an ITWorks deal and a large professional services contract in our forecast that would have led us to comfortably achieving our guidance range. While they didn't close in Q4, we do expect it in future quarters. 
For the full year, our bookings revenue was $5.43 billion, which is 28% growth over 2014 and reflects more than $200 million of upside to the bookings guidance we've provided throughout the year, including Q4.
Our revenue backlog ended the year at $14.2 billion, which is up from $10.6 billion a year ago. Revenue in the quarter was $1.18 billion, which is up 27% over Q4 of '14, in the middle of our guidance range.
The revenue composition for Q4 was $382 million in system sales, $247 million in support and maintenance, $528 million in services and $18 million in reimbursed travel.
Revenue in the quarter includes approximately $245 million from Health Services. This is down from approximately $250 million in Q3, but note that the deferred revenue adjustment was higher in Q4, so Health Services revenue was basically flat sequentially on an operational basis, which is in line with our expectations.
For the full year, revenue grew 30% over 2014 to $4.4 billion and includes approximately $930 million from Health Services. System sales revenue reflects a 36% increase over Q4 '14 with the growth mainly driven by increase in subscriptions, which is where the addition of Health Services has had the biggest impact, as well as strong growth in licensed software. For the full year, system sales revenue grew by 36% over 2014. 
Our system sales margin percent in Q4 was 68.4%, which is up from 67.5% in Q3, due to strong sequential growth in licensed software. Full year system sales margin percent was 66.4%, which is basically flat compared to 2014. 
Moving to services. Total services revenue, including professional and managed services, was up 23% compared to Q4 of '14. Full-year services revenue was up 28% over 2014.
Support and maintenance revenue increased 25% over Q4 of '14 and 35% for the full year, with the lower growth in Q4 due to the extra week in Q4 of 2014. 
Looking at revenue by geographic segment. Domestic revenue increased 28% over the year-ago quarter to $1.04 billion, and global revenue grew 21% to $134 million, both driven largely by the addition of Health Services. For the full year, domestic revenue grew 29%, and global grew 37%. 
As a preview to the annual update of our detailed business model that we'll provide at our Investment Community Meeting on March 2 at HIMSS, I'd like to provide you with the total revenue and growth by business model for the full year 2015. 
Licensed software grew 24% to $564 million. Tech resale grew 21% to $330 million. Subscriptions increased 76% to $388 million. Professional services grew 13% to $1.24 billion. Managed services increased 56% to $858 million. Support and maintenance was up 35% to $976 million. And reimbursed travel was $73 million, which is down 19%.
Moving to gross margin. Our gross margin for Q4 was 83.0%, which is up from 81.3% in Q4 of '14, reflecting strong license software growth. Full year gross margin of 83% was up from 82.2% in 2014. 
Looking at operating spending. Our fourth quarter non-GAAP operating expenses, which exclude share-based compensation expense, voluntary separation plan expense and acquisition-related adjustments were $686 million, which is up 31% compared to adjusted Q4 of '14 operating expenses. This growth was primarily driven by the addition of the Health Services business. 
For the full year, operating expenses before share-based compensation expense, voluntary separation plan expense and acquisition-related adjustments were up 33% to $2.6 billion. 
The total year-over-year growth for each expense category in Q4 on a non-GAAP basis was: 26% for sales and client service, 33% for software development and 59% for D&A. Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, the new line we added in Q2, was basically flat. 
For the full year, sales in client service grew 29%, software development grew 38% and G&A grew 54%.
Moving to operating earnings and operating margins. Our operating margin before share-based compensation expense, voluntary separation expense and acquisition-related adjustments was 24.7% in Q4, which is flat to the year-ago period and up 20 basis points from Q3 of '15. Full year operating margin came in at 24.3%, which is basically flat compared to last year.
Moving to net earnings and EPS. Our GAAP net earnings in Q4 were $166 million or $0.48 per diluted share. Adjusted net earnings were $2.2 million, and adjusted EPS -- diluted EPS was $0.61, which is up 30% compared to Q4 of '14. Adjusted net earnings exclude share-based compensation expense, which had a net impact on GAAP earnings of $13 million or $0.04 per diluted share, as well as the voluntary separation plan expense, which had a net impact on GAAP earnings of $861,000 or less than $0.01 per diluted share. 
Adjusted net earnings also reflect adjustments related to Cerner's acquisition of Health Services, including Health Services acquisition-related amortization, which reduced GAAP net earnings and diluted earnings per share by $15 million and $0.04, respectively; other acquisition-related adjustments, which reduced GAAP net earnings and diluted earnings per share by $4 million and $0.01, respectively; and the acquisition-related deferred revenue adjustment, which is not included in GAAP net earnings, but decreased -- increased adjusted net earnings and diluted earnings per share by $13 million and $0.04, respectively. 
For the full year, adjusted net earnings were $741 million and adjusted EPS was $2.11, which is  up 28% from 2014. 
Q4 tax rate for adjusted net earnings was 27%, which is lower than the normal range, primarily due to the R&D tax credit being reinstated in Q4. The R&D tax credit benefited EPS by approximately $0.04 or about $0.03 related to the first 3 quarters before the reinstatement of the credit. Therefore, we view our normalized adjusted EPS for the quarter as $0.58 instead of $0.61.
Now I'll move to our balance sheet. Beginning Q4 was $686 million of total cash and investments, which is down from $766 million in Q3, primarily due to the use of cash for our stock repurchase program. During the quarter, we finished the remaining $145 million of stock repurchases authorized in September this year, repurchasing 2.5 million shares at an average price of $58.40. For the year, we repurchased 5.7 million shares for $345 million or an average price of $60.39.
Moving to debt. Our total debt, including capital lease obligations, is $605 million, which is down slightly compared to Q3. Total receivables ended the quarter at $1.03 billion, which is down $19 million from Q3. Our Q4 DSO was 80 days, which is an improvement of 5 days compared to Q3. We are targeting DSO in the 70s in 2016. 
Operating cash flow for the quarter was extremely strong at $353 million, up from $272 million in Q3. Q4 capital expenditures was $107 million, and capitalized software was $60 million. Free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures and capitalized software, was $186 million for the quarter, driven by strong operating cash flow. 
For the full year, operating cash flow was $948 million, and free cash flow was $321 million, with capital expenditures of $362 million and capitalized software of $265 million.
As previously indicated, we expect capital expenditures to increase in 2016, primarily due to construction of the new campus. We still expect to generate solid free cash flow, with growth in operating cash flow offsetting most of the increase in capital expenditures. 
Now I'll go through to Q1 and full year 2016 guidance. For Q1, we expect revenue between $1.15 billion and $1.2 billion, with the midpoint reflecting growth of 18% over Q1 of '15. For the full year, we expect revenue between $4.9 billion and $5.1 billion, reflecting 13% growth over 2015 at the midpoint. We expect Q1 adjusted EPS before share-based compensation and acquisition-related adjustments to be $0.52 to $0.54 per share, with the midpoint reflecting 18% growth over Q1 '15 adjusted EPS.
For the full year, we continue to expect adjusted EPS before share-based compensation and acquisition-related adjustments to be $2.30 to $2.40, as initially stated on our Q3 earnings call, with the midpoint reflecting 11% growth over 2015.
Moving to bookings guidance. We expect bookings guidance in Q1 of $1.15 billion to $1.25 billion. The midpoint of this range is flat to Q1 of '15 bookings. Given a very tough comparable establishing Q1 of last year with 32% bookings growth and 28% growth for the full year in 2015, there will be some quarters this year with flat or low growth. We do expect for the year -- we do expect growth for the year, but note that even flat bookings will lead to a 2-year CAGR or 13%. Also given that nearly 80% of our guided revenue is scheduled to come out of backlog. We believe we can deliver our revenue and earnings guidance even if bookings were flat. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Zane."

Today, I'll provide color on our results and make some marketplace observations. Starting with our bookings. Our bookings revenue in Q4 of $1.35 billion reflects 16% growth over Q4 2014. As Marc mentioned, this is",1897,"Thanks, Marc. Good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'll provide color on our results and make some marketplace observations. 
Starting with our bookings. Our bookings revenue in Q4 of $1.35 billion reflects 16% growth over Q4 2014. As Marc mentioned, this is slightly lower than expected, primarily due to less long-term bookings but still a strong level bookings that contributed to our excellent growth for the year at 28%.
Bookings this quarter included another all-time high level of large contracts, with 46 contracts over $5 million, including 29 over $10 million. For the year, we had 153 contracts over $5 million, with 102 of those being over $10 million. This reflects 37% growth in contracts over $5 million and 62% growth in contracts over $10 million. 
For long-term bookings, we had a strong quarter for remote hosting, but we did not have a new ITWorks or RevWorks deal. So the percent of bookings from long-term contracts was 27%, which is about 7% lower than the average of the first 3 quarters. 
For the year, long-term bookings were 32% of the total bookings, which is 2% higher than last year, reflecting full-year strength in the Works deals.
We continued our new business momentum in Q4 with 36% of our bookings coming from outside our core Millennium install base. 2015 was, by far, the best year in our history from a new business standpoint. During the year, we signed more than double the number of new footprints than any year in our history, which we believe is evidence of our strong competitiveness and a large opportunity for competitive displacements. 
Our success was very broad during the year, with new business coming from IDNs, regional hospitals, children hospitals, community hospitals, state and federal, behavioral health, ambulatory surgery centers and physician groups. 
I believe 2015 was a breakthrough year from a competitive standpoint. I believe our success is driven by several factors: First, we are much better in key areas because of our R&D investments. In the past 5 years, we've invested more than $2 billion in R&D, with a focus on population health, physician and clinician experience, revenue cycle, consumer, inter-operability, open platforms and mobility. These investments are leading to much better performance in traditional competitions for EHR and revenue cycle and further differentiation in areas like population health and open-platform capabilities. 
We have also focused on predictable delivery capabilities, cost of ownership and delivering measurable value, which is critical in an environment where ROI is increasingly important.
Finally, the marketplace is becoming more aware of our primary competitor's higher cost of ownership, lack of system openness and a lack of investment in cloud-based systems to support population health. We believe this is leading to more success against our primary competitor in EHR procurements and opportunities in their installed base for population health.
Turning to population health. 2015 was a great year. We had 30% bookings growth, and we now have 85 clients that have chosen the HealtheIntent platform to support their population health strategy. 
The highlight in 2015 was success outside of our EHR installed base, with one example being Geisinger Health System choosing HealtheIntent to extend their data-driven population health capabilities. This announcement made a clear statement to the market and has already added to our long list of opportunities outside of our EHR base. 
We currently have more than 20 opportunities outside our installed base, most of which use our primary competitor's EHR. I believe this activity is validating the broad opportunity for HealtheIntent and the shortcomings of our primary competitor. 
Another highlight was the that we were recently selected to sport the health insights of the statewide Medicaid population. The state will use HealtheIntent's Enterprise Data Warehouse Solution to gain insights and intelligence from claims and clinical information across the state's Medicaid population, which will enable them to manage outcomes at an optimal level. This is a new market entry point for Cerner, and is an additional example of how HealtheIntent expands Cerner reach beyond our EHR base. 
A key reason we are having so much success at selling HealtheIntent solutions is that clients who have already adopted them are getting great value and have become examples for the industry for how technology can enable the transition to quality and value-based reimbursement. A good example of this was captured in a January feature in Health Data Management magazine. The article covered Advocate Health Care success at using HealtheIntent platform to gather more than 60 different clinical and transactional data sources and use predictive algorithms to predict risks, improve patient care and control costs. 
Moving to our revenue cycle business. We had a very good year with bookings that are more than double 2014 levels and included several of our large clients choosing Cerner for revenue cycle. 
Operationally, we brought 39 acute-care sites and 455 clinics live on Millennium revenue cycle, and we now have more than 1,800 live sites. Our momentum in revenue cycle also reflected in very strong organic revenue growth, with revenue cycles nearly doubling in the past 3 years.
We expect continued strong growth going forward with many large clients forecasted to transition to Cerner revenue cycle and a large volume of RevWorks and extended business office opportunities.
Moving to the ambulatory market, where we had a strong Q4 and year. For the year, ambulatory bookings grew over 50% and included 38 displacements of our primary ambulatory competitors. This included some of our largest acute care clients choosing to replace their existing ambulatory supplier. We also had a strong start to penetrating the Health Services base with 16 Health Services clients choosing Cerner ambulatory. 
Our ambulatory business office services offering also had a strong year that included 2 -- our 2 largest deals to date, both of which were displacements of a certain cloud competitor. 
We also had a strong year in the small hospital market with our cloud-based CommunityWorks offering, where we ended the year with more than 130 clients. This year's success was driven by a combination of traditional new footprints, extensions through our health system clients and Health Services migrations.
One highlight for the year was Great Plains Health Alliance selecting Cerner CommunityWorks for their 25 critical access hospitals across Nebraska and Kansas. 
Looking ahead, the small hospital market remains very active and expect 2016 to be another good year. 
Now I'd like to provide an update on the Department of Defense project. I'm pleased with the work accomplished by the Leidos partnership for health events. Over the past several months, as we prepare for the pilot site rollouts. The next months ahead, the partnership will highlight have that many of the solutions that will be used in the implementation, including some military-specific workflows, first responder applications, mass vaccinations and theater synchronizations. Our collaborative effort has led to solution enhancements and data portability that are essential to achieving the free flow of information across all venues of care and creating a system that works for health care organizations working to improve the well-being of individuals and communities. I believe this work can benefit the entire client base and the broader health care industry. 
Moving to Health Services. We had a good first year at signing Health Services clients to migrate to Millennium. Over the year, over 40 sites signed to migrate, including both IDNs and small hospitals. Operationally, I'm very pleased with how Cerner and Health Services teams have come together in the past year. Health Services associates have proven to be highly talented and are adding value in many key areas of our business. 
Outside the U.S., we had a solid year. Full non-U.S. revenue growth was 37%, with most of this driven by the addition of Health Services, as organic revenue growth was limited to low single-digit due to the extra week in 2014, the impact of currency fluctuations and the lower activity in some markets where economies are struggling. Even though our non-U.S. results tend to be lumpier, we continue to believe the global markets represent a large opportunity for growth for both EHR and population health. And Cerner is well-positioned for this opportunity with associates or offices in more than 25 countries and a strong market position in many of them.
Now I'd would like to provide several marketplace observations. The first is that health systems are increasingly being asked to live in 2 worlds; a future state, driven by reimbursement models aligned to risk and quality outcomes, and a current state where fee-for-service is still the predominant model. To bridge the gap between the present and the future, health systems need to solve the same problem: How to effectively manage and make disparate data meaningful and drive appropriate actions from it; solving current state problems such as proactively identifying reimbursement opportunities; driving efficiency across the venue-specific workflows; and true visibility into the quality of care we delivered are critical to enable health systems outperform their peers in an increasingly competitive health care market. 
To make the pivot, health systems will compete by proactively identifying populations at risk, redefining clinical engagement to preempt problems and enabling the person to be a more active member of the care team. We believe clients are looking for a platform to help bridge these worlds, compete more effectively and quality and efficiency in today's environment and more actively engaged in managed population in the future state. And HealtheIntent was a perfect fit for satisfying these needs. 
Second, the EHR placement market remains very active. While regulatory pressures and solutions being sunset by competitors continue to drive opportunities, we're also seeing more purchasing behavior driven by value and vision, which is positive for Cerner.
Almost all EHR placements also represent a revenue cycle opportunity as providers prefer integrated clinical, ambulatory and revenue cycle systems. 
Third. Consolidations in the hospital market has remained active, and this is creating opportunities for Cerner. In the past 3 years, Cerner clients accounted for nearly 50% of the hospital buying activity, creating an opportunity for more than 100 new footprints. Consolidation is not isolated in the provider market with payers and HCIT suppliers also actively merging in attempt to attain scale to compete in the evolving health care market. 
Fourth. We believe that EHR will evolve from a transactional system to an intelligent activity-based system that will enable faster adoption of best practices, reduce variance, personalized care, improved outcomes and the ability to identify unit costs, which will be critical as reimbursements shift to outcome-based and bundle payments.
This is consistent with the direction Cerner has been headed and has been a focus for our efforts with Intermountain Healthcare. 
Finally, we believe openness and interoperability continue to become increasingly important. This benefits Cerner because of our long-time commitment to interoperability and open systems. This commitment was recently advanced by our launch of our Cerner Open Developer Experience, which is an open site designed to enhance collaboration with third-party and client developers with SMART on FHIR applications. We believe this open platform has a potential to unlock future cutting-edge solutions that can benefit not only our client base, but the entire industry. 
In summary, there is a significant amount of change occurring in health care. There would be more change in the next 5 years than the last several decades, and Cerner is very well-positioned to benefit from these changes. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff."

After completing the secon",1011,"Thanks, Zane. Today, I'm going to provide an update on our collaboration with Intermountain Healthcare in what they refer to as their iCentra project and how this is advancing Cerner's methodologies and our pace of innovation. 
After completing the second regional deployment in Q4 of 2015, we are now heads down deploying an ever-improving model system design across Intermountain in 2016, while continuing to innovate and improve in parallel. A component of how we're doing both at the same time will be a topic that Marc Probst, the CIO at Intermountain, and I will be co-presenting at HIMSS in an education session titled, What IT Takes for Success. Sharing our joint experiences and approaches to shift traditional information technology to improvement technology that will better align with Intermountain's journey to a learning healthcare system. 
By applying a hybrid of agile development concepts with continuous quality improvement to significantly change pace of both innovation and adoption. As a by-product of this work, the models and methods have continued to shape Cerner's next generation of continuous improvement methodologies, which are represented within our model system framework. 
The library of process models workflows, configuration and best practices are all part of a comprehensive kit that is applicable and measurable across our client base, to speed our life cycle from innovation to adoption at scale. 
As this foundation of techniques, tools and measurements are utilized across multiple organization, Cerner has continued to build on our ability to measure the experience of an end-user as they navigate through our applications. This suite of analytics is called Cerner Advance, which includes a set of solutions that has leveraged our learning in the population health space. The difference is that this is the population of clinicians using the systems and the health status is how effectively they're utilizing the features and preferences of the system within their workflow. It also allows us to identify and personalize improvement interactions at the individual user level, just like you would with care management for patients. We all learn at a different pace and in different ways. This technique applies an Amazon-like consumer profiling for clinicians, which we think is a key component of this accelerating adoption. 
As I've shared before, our core component of our relationship with Intermountain has been the ability to advance innovation of clinical computing models more quickly. Within Cerner, we have started to use the term model practice to represent the focus on contextual, clinical decision-making within the workflow as a seamless by-product of patient care. 
In the case of Intermountain Healthcare, this is where their Care Process Models surfaced naturally. As Zane outlined, the evolution of reimbursement models is increasing the demand to remove unnecessary variance in both cost and outcomes, which is shifting the focus to greater predictability and intelligence within the EMR experience.
We are now far enough along in our journey together that we have represented the breadth of structured care models from simple to complex and have extended the platform capabilities with a small set of Cerner clients that cover the continuum of care models, guidelines, pathways and predictive algorithms. The suite of clinical decisions support solutions is called care decisions. This covers a continuum of capabilities that can range from highly contextual point-in-time decisions, like a patient with pneumonia presenting in the ED for treatment, to a series of massive pathways that would cover chronic conditions or diseases like cancer that could span several years.
The architecture of this platform is based on open principles, allowing for both portability of predictive models that run from the cloud across multiple clinical data sets that span enterprises to something we call a SMART Zone, which is face up within the physician workflow and contextual to the moment. 
Through this coordinated set of care decision capabilities we think we can deliver intelligence that would create what Clayton Christensen refers to as a facilitated network in his book, The Innovator's Prescription. We anticipate this configuration and collection of open systems will make up the model practice layer of our model efforts and enable clinical evidence to be shareable, portable and programmable across Cerner clients and the industry. 
Finally, I wanted to briefly share the growing capabilities of advancing activity center design within the EMR. We have found that the ability to link measurements from application experiences, process variation, clinical evidence and outcomes provide significant new insights into our ability to achieve business and clinical objectives. This, too, is becoming part of the evolution towards learning healthcare system, with priorities being established based on desired outcomes versus implementation of technology. 
In many cases, this inverts the model that has -- most have chased in the era of Meaningful Use. What we found is that while independently, workflow may be followed, it may not be timely, which, in turn, impacts the effectiveness of adopting clinical evidence. This, in turn, produces a suboptimal outcome, even though several of the process-centered metrics may have indicated a good result. This concept of shaping the new understanding of critical thinking in how clinical integration evolves in an environment where everything is connected and instantaneously aware with the depth and breadth of data that is significantly larger. As the boundaries move from patient center visits to the continuous engagement of population health, there's no question that we'll acquire this next layer of intelligence in context. 
Our ability to predict and dynamically adapt the health care ecosystem based on the activities in context is what we think drives the next tier of outcome improvement.
Before handing the call over to the questions, I wanted to provide a brief update on Neal. 
His initial treatments have gone well, and he is progressing as expected. He's very appreciative of all the well wishes and has -- that he has received from associates, clients and investors and pleased with the excellent care he has received. 
At Cerner, we have no doubt that his experience will further fuel his desire to continue and -- to improve the system. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to questions."

So when we talk about Q1 bookings, it's -- it likely is going to be slightly lower, but it's not unusual for Q1 to be somewhat cyclical and a little bit lower than we have experienced. So I think when we look at the first half of the year, when we see the pipeline that we have, I think we're very confident that we'll see a bit growth in bookings. So Q1 is more a reflection of us telling you kind of exactly what we're seeing without any of the carryover deals from Q4 benefiting us."

Is 2016 going to be a very similar year the way that you guys are seeing it play out? Or are we going to see it be a year where maybe there's a little bit of a slowdown and then 2017 reaccelerates?"

So kind of updating where we -- what we had said at a previous conference that would have been through the third quarter. We're at 238 sites for the year. So that represented 8 of those 238. So a very small percentage of those are related to the DOD in 2015. As we have successful moving forward with the DOD, we'd anticipate those additional sites coming into play. 
We see great market opportunity in 2016, similar to 2015 in terms of the opportunity that we see, particularly as we look out in the first 9 months of the year. And so I feel very strong about the opportunity, and really, our competitiveness in that. So I think we would expect to see similar numbers. It's hard to get at -- with each opportunity number of sites is a little challenging because that can differ based on the mix that you have in there. But we see the same kind of levels of new market opportunities. So I think that kind of site-level performance will be pretty similar."

So we -- I feel very good about those components. The number of migrations that we had, as I mentioned in my prepared comments, was over 40. If you've looked at the previous 5 years combined, we had more conversions to Millennium than we had in the previous 5 years combined from just natural takeover, what happened from a migration perspective in the open market place. So I would look at that as incredibly positive on the moving the traditional Siemens Health Services clients to a Millennium platform. The combination clients that have Cerner as a core EMR solution and as a revenue cycle client, we have done a lot of work in terms of taking out the pain points for those clients for managing those 2 different databases now that we're under one company and able to help those clients and really kind of de-risk that base from the revenue cycle perspective.

The good news is that they have the same lack of visibility on spending, and that actually turned out to be better from a reduced spending standpoint than the lower revenue. So we all ended up a year, actually, ahead of what we wanted from an OE perspective, as Zane said. So I think that's probably the thing I would point out is something that was a little bit lower than our original expectation. Not significantly, but enough that they obviously impacted some of the guidance that we've provided. 
I think as far as the 2 companies coming together, that feels really good. I'm very impressed with both of our teams and the effort and time that they've put in to achieving a kind of one Cerner view of the world.

I mean, if you look at our history, it tends to be -- we have a strong bookings growth year and then the next year, we have a strong revenue growth year. And if someone has figured out why that happens all the time, we're interested because it kind of sometimes comes in cycles like that a little bit. Although, when you grow the bookings over 30% in the year, growing the next year is going to be challenging on those tough comps, which we still believe we can grow. So I think from our standpoint, I think the backlog is strong and continues to grow. It's probably got an average -- once you take out the initial component that supports 79% of my revenue next year, then you've got -- then you basically probably have a 3.5-year average life for the remainder. So it will contribute significantly in 2017 absolutely from a backlog perspective. There's still plenty of medium term elements in that backlog, particularly services, that roll out. And if we deliver the bookings that we expect -- certainly, for this year, if we even just deliver flat bookings and don't grow bookings, we'll not only deliver '16, but we set ourselves up well for '17."

From a new bookings perspective, new footprints were actually very strong in Q4. So it's 36% of our bookings. So we overachieved actually our internal projections and plans around the new business side. So we saw very strong growth in 2015, what I would actually say it was near 2011 kind of Meaningful Use era type decision-makings in 2015. And we expect that to continue into 2016. So our experience was really very strong opportunity in '15, 2016 and beyond. And from that perspective, we over-attained. When you really look at the one piece that doesn't get done was, really, truly, an ITWorks and a professional services on a deal that did get -- in fact close. The professional services with that opportunity did not close but will close. And so those aren't reflective of the marketplace. So I wouldn't look at the bookings element and say, any of that is reflective of the marketplace. I'm looking at the marketplace as hot as it's been in the past 5-plus years in that perspective. And our competitiveness at all-time highs helps us to feel very good about our position as we move in forward. I think there's great opportunity in a number of bases where client companies have either sunset their solution or they're trying to do upgrades to solutions and platforms to prepare for future elements. And there's just a lack of confidence in those companies' and organizations' ability to invest and deliver contemporary solutions. So the level of buying opportunity in 2016 and '17 is very strong. And I think that will -- our viewpoint right now is that there's a very strong marketplace, and over half of the marketplace is basically up for grabs. In addition to that, our success around penetrating the non-Cerner EHR base with our population health solutions and our CareAware solutions is very significant and represents the opportunity on the upside for us as we move forward. And I think that's another area where we'll need to continue to provide more information for you so you get to understand the impact of what that means for us because we see the market unfolding probably as -- I don't think I've ever seen it as robust as it is today. And as I look forward, it looks incredibly robust. I just think the makeup of that will evolve in terms of both EHR decisions as well as population health and other solutions that we have."

So those aren't going to flow in to all -- significantly impact as a percent of the bookings number of those deals hit '17 or '18. So no, it's -- every year, it's important that I go out and deliver bookings that go feed the backlog to drive the next year. But -- so I can't tell you that I've got 80% of the next 4 years' revenue sitting in my backlog. That would be a really nice thing to have happen. But the reality is the average life once you take out for the '16 numbers is probably 3.5 years average life. But you've got things that are 10 years and that and things that are shorter-term. So from a visibility -- supervised outstanding visibility from a backlog and especially from things that are in our bigger backlog, which includes support now, so I do have a significant visibility, but it's not -- it wouldn't be 80%. Certainly, when I go into next year, I'm going to have delivered things from the $5.4-plus billion of bookings that I expect to deliver this year that will then inform and help me on next year's numbers. So -- but certainly, I don't have a number that I could tell you right off the top of my head of the percent of revenue and backlog today that will help '17. But it, certainly, isn't 80% today, but by the time I get to the end of the year, my expectation is that number keeps going up, which is impressive in an environment where I'm going to grow revenue double-digit next year."

I would tell you that there was gaps in the Health Services offerings, particularly around things like population health and ambulatory, even some more mundane things, if you will, around surgery and a full functioning ED solution. So as clients come in to do the migration, they will often procure additional software to fill out that solution set, and that's what we've seen. And then we have additional implementation services to implement the new Millennium software. And then the recurring tends to stay fairly similar to what it has been. So the additional pops are in this -- the professional services and in the licensed software and any related support fees that would go with those pieces so for the long term. And then the traditional Cerner mode, most all of our clients do remote hosting, so they will come through and do the remote hosting aspects of that if they -- and many of the Siemens Health Services clients were remote-hosted previously, but some of them were not. And so we see that trend picking up as well. So it's basically -- there's not a cookie cutter in terms of I can tell you here's the percentage increase that we see because all clients are not created equal in terms of what they've contracted for or what they want to go do moving forward. But generally speaking, you see us rounding out the full solution set and doing the implementation and doing the hosting and ongoing maintenance.

And obviously, some of our clients are not only looking at the risk population but they're just looking at a way to go back into their -- to identify a population where they could go, actually do some proactive services for, which improves that revenue and also reduces the overall cost of whoever is taking the risk. So from a bookings standpoint, those have not been a significant contributor. So I'd say kind of if you look at the total bookings, we give you a percent of new clients, which most of which probably aren't having a significant component of HealtheIntent with a brand-new client. Our ITWorks client and works businesses, which are really not -- they're separated out. And when you look at the long-term being 30-plus percent and if you look at the new clients being 30-plus percent, you kind of got the bucket of things that are going into the base.

So I think the opportunities are out there. But the good news is that except for the top 2 competitors in the environment, no one else is stepping up and saying, ""We're really going to be great."" I mean, in our marketplace, certainly, within the health -- the hospital marketplace certainly, the people that have been -- or kind of not doing as well continue that trajectory. So there is the opportunity as we've seen in '15 to go in and displace people, competitors who had a footprint and have not delivered. And I think that continues. We got that continuing through '16 and '17. So I don't -- I think it's difficult for us to tell you what our bookings are going to be in 4 years, but I think the elements, the things that we will be selling will be big booking opportunities. So it wouldn't surprise me to keep that at that level."

So as we look at Q1 last year to Q1 of 2016, we're giving you our best guidance as it relates to that quarter. As it relates to the year, I feel very strongly that we will see bookings growth for the year. We just are not providing guidance as it relates to the year bookings. There's great opportunities out there. In 2015, I see -- very similar around the new business opportunities that we had for 2015, I see the same dynamics at play for 2016. So there's still competitors that are sunsetting solutions. There are competitors that have not kept contemporary architectures, and they don't age like a fine wine. And so those are going to become more and more at play in that. So I feel very good about the EHR market. In addition, there are all the Works pieces of the business and the population health, which continues to get traction. So my expectation is that we will grow bookings in 2016 on a very tough comparable from 2015. We're just looking at Q1 and providing the best guidance that we can as we look at the mix of the opportunities in there. And so the sway of kind of one services piece and one ITWorks deal really shouldn't taint how we feel about the market and does not. So my long-term view of the marketplace and, frankly, short-term view is very, very bullish. And I feel really good about that. And because there has never been a bigger need for health care IT solutions. And so kind of that piece of living in a fee-for-service world and an at-risk model, it's coming slower. But the nice part is you can utilize our population health and solutions to maximize both worlds. And really, we're the only ones doing that, which is really unique, and it's creating a differentiation for us in the marketplace. And that's where, I think, as people begin to understand that, you'll see even accelerated growth on top of the great growth we've seen in that space."

Zane Burke, our President, will follow me with result highlights and marketplace observations. And then Mike Nill, our Chief Operating Officer, will provide some operational highlights. 
Now I'll turn to our results. Q1 was a solid start to the year. Bookings, earnings and cash flow are in our targeted ranges. Revenue was slightly below our targeted range, but our full year outlook remains intact. 
Our bookings revenue in Q1 was $1.17 billion, which is 2% lower than Q1 of '15 in total, but reflects strong growth of 18% when you exclude long-term bookings. As we indicated, Q1 '15 included an all-time high level of long-term bookings at 37%, creating a tough comparable. And this quarter had a very low level of 24%. While this difference lead to total bookings being basically flat, the strong growth in our nonlong-term bookings reflects ongoing strong demand and new footprints, which Zane will discuss. In addition, we have a strong pipeline for works deals, so we expect the mix of long-term bookings to normalize as we move through the year, which will benefit overall bookings. 
Our revenue backlog ended the quarter at $14.6 billion, which is up 12% from $13 billion a year ago. Revenue in the quarter was $1.14 billion, which is up 14% over Q1 '15, and $12 million below our guidance range, due primarily to lower hardware sales. The revenue composition for Q1 was $279 million in system sales, $251 million in support and maintenance, $589 million in services and $19 million in reimbursed travel. System sales revenue for the quarter was up 8% compared to Q1 '15, with growth in software and subscriptions offsetting a large decline in hardware. The lower hardware's reflected in the strong system sales margin percent of 68.1%, which is up over 300 basis points year-over-year..  The lower-than-predicted hardware revenue led to total revenue being slightly below our guidance range. While it is disappointing to be slightly below our guidance range, I believe the growth in software, and the return to strong growth in services revenue, is more indicative of our core business trends.
Moving to services. Total services revenue, including professional and managed services, was up 20% compared to Q1 '15. This is in line with our expectation and reflects good execution by our services organization. Support and maintenance revenue increased 10% over Q1 '15. 
Looking at revenue by geographic segment. Domestic revenue increased 15% over the year-ago quarter to $1.05 billion, and Global revenue grew 6% to $133 million.
Moving to gross margin. Our gross margin for Q1 was 84.6%, which is up from 83.1% in Q1 of '15, reflecting the lower mix of hardware as well as strong levels of service.
Looking at operating spending. Our first quarter non-GAAP operating expenses, which include share-based compensation expense and acquisition-related adjustments were $701 million, which is up 19% compared to adjusted Q1 of '15 operating expenses. This growth was primarily driven by growth in personnel expenses related to revenue generating associates, higher noncash expenses and having an extra month of Health Services expense in Q1 '16 as compared to Q1 '15. The total year-over-year growth for each expense category in Q1 on a non-GAAP basis was 22% for sales and client service, 4% for software development and 25% for G&A. Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles was basically flat.
Moving to operating margins. Our operating margin before share-based compensation expense and acquisition-related adjustments was 23.0% in Q1, which is down slightly from 23.7% in the year-ago period. As previously indicated, we expect margin expansion to be limited in 2016 due in part to growth in noncash expenses. As we laid out at HIMSS, we believe we can expand margins 50 to 100 basis points annually after 2016.
Moving to net earnings and EPS. Our GAAP net earnings in Q1 were $150 million or $0.43 per diluted share. Adjusted net earnings were $182 million, and adjusted diluted EPS was $0.53, which is up 18% compared to Q1 of '15. Adjusted net earnings exclude share-based compensation expense, which had a net impact on GAAP earnings of $13.4 million or $0.04 per diluted share. Adjusted net earnings also reflect adjustments related to Cerner's acquisition of Health Services, including Health Services' acquisition-related amortization, which reduced GAAP net earnings and diluted earnings per share by $13 million and $0.04, respectively. other acquisition-related adjustments, which reduced GAAP net earnings and diluted earnings per share by $2 million and $0.01, respectively; and the acquisition-related deferred revenue adjustment which is not included in GAAP net earnings but increased adjusted net earnings and diluted earnings per share by $4 million and $0.01, respectively. 
The Q1 tax rate for adjusted net earnings was 31%, which is slightly lower than our expected range of 32% to 33%.
Now I'll move to our balance sheet. We ended Q1 with $707 million of total cash and investments, which is up slightly from $686 million in Q4, with most of our free cash flow being used to repurchase shares. 
During the quarter, we executed $150 million of the $300 million stock repurchase program authorized in March of this year, repurchasing 2.8 million shares at an average price of $53.45.
Moving to debt. Our total debt, including capital lease obligations, is $595 million, which is down slightly compared to Q4. Total receivables ended the quarter at $942 million, which is down $92 million from Q4. Our Q1 DSO was 76 days, which is an improvement of 4 days compared to Q4 and in line with our expectations.
Operating cash flow for the quarter was very strong at $327 million, which is second only to our all-time high of $353 million in Q4. 
Q1 capital expenditures were $99 million, and capitalized software was $75 million. Free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures and capitalized software, was $152 million for the quarter, driven by strong operating cash flow. 
As previously indicated, we expect capital expenditures to increase in 2016, primarily due to construction of a new campus. We still expect to generate solid free cash flow with growth in operating cash flow offsetting the increase in capital expenditures. 
Now I'll go through Q2 and full year 2016 guidance. For Q2, we expect revenue between $1.175 billion and $1.25 billion, with the midpoint reflecting growth of 8% over Q2 of '15. Note that we have widened our guidance range to provide cushion given we are below our Q1 guidance due to the hardware. Also we expect revenue growth to be higher in Q3, which is an easier comparable period than Q2. 
For the full year, we continue to expect revenue between $4.9 billion and $5.1 billion, reflecting 13% growth over 2015  at the midpoint. We expect Q2 adjusted EPS before share-based compensation and acquisition-related adjustments to be $0.56 to $0.58 per share, with the midpoint reflecting 10% growth over Q2 '15 adjusted EPS. 
For the full year, we continue to expect adjusted EPS before share-based compensation and acquisition-related adjustments to be $2.30 to $2.40, with the midpoint reflecting 11% growth over 2015. Our estimate for the impact of share-based compensation expense is approximately $0.04 in Q2 and between $0.16 to $0.17 for the full year.
Moving to bookings guidance. We expect bookings revenue in Q2 of $1.35 billion to $1.48 billion, with the midpoint reflecting 10% growth over Q2 of '15. With that, I'll turn the call over to Zane."

Today, I'll provide color on our results and make some marketplace observations. 
Starting with bookings. As Marc indicated, our total bookings were basically flat compared to the year-ago quarter, but our nonlong-term bookings grew at 18%, and we expect long-term bookings to continue to increase as we move through the year. Bookings this year included a strong level of large contracts, with 43 contracts over $5 million, including 18 over $10 million. 
Regarding long-term bookings contributions, we did have solid hosting bookings and a small ITWorks contract, but the total percent from long-term bookings was just 24% compared to approximately 30% to 31% in recent years. This was not a surprise to us as we had indicated our guidance assumes a lower level of long-term bookings, and our total bookings are within our guidance range. Going forward, our pipeline for Works deal is strong, so I expect more contribution from long-term bookings in future quarters. 
Now I'll discuss the drivers of the strong growth in nonlong-term bookings. The main highlight of the quarter was our continued success at gaining new clients. In Q1, 36% of our bookings came from outside our core Millennium install base, driven by an all-time high win rate against our primary competitor. As I've discussed, we believe we are much more effective against our primary competitor for several reasons, including significant improvements in our solutions in recent years, predictable delivery capabilities, lower cost of ownership, ability to deliver value and our Population Health and open platform capabilities. In addition, we believe the heightened awareness of our primary competitors, higher cost of ownership, lack of system openness and limited Population Health care capabilities have contributed to us being more effective against them. 
Looking ahead, our pipeline for new business continues to grow, and other leading indicators, such as referenced activities, are at all-time highs. With 1 major installed base facing a sunsetting of their solution and another with over 3/4 of their base on legacy platforms, we expect the replacement market to remain strong over the next 2 to 3 years. 
Our view of the replacement market and overall opportunity to grow our business was also validated at HIMSS. This year, we interfaced with clients and prospects, representing over $8 billion of pipeline, which is an increase of 40% compared to last year. The EHR replacement market continued to be a large part of these conversations, but we also had a high-volume of discussions with existing and new clients about Other Solutions & Services, such as Revenue Cycle, ambulatory, Population Health and our works businesses. 
Another highlight of the quarter was the strength of our Revenue Cycle business. As Mike will discuss, we continue to have a very high percent of new clients include Revenue Cycle with their EHR purchase and more of our existing clients, including some of our largest, choosing to move to Cerner Revenue Cycle.
Moving to the ambulatory market where we had a very good Q1 with strength in ambulatory EHR, practice management and business office services. This included some of our largest IDN and investor own clients choosing Cerner's clinical and Revenue Cycle solutions for their ambulatory settings. We also continue to see a high attach rate for ambulatory when Health Services clients are migrating to Millennium. 
As we look to the rest of the year, there are many more opportunities to sell ambulatory solutions to the practices affiliated with our major health system clients. In addition, e are starting to see more opportunities at large standalone practices where some of the best-of-breed suppliers continue to falter. We also had a strong quarter in the small hospital market in our Cloud based CommunityWorks offering. Bookings from Community Works were a record for a first quarter and included a combination of standalone opportunities and Health Services migrations.
Now I'd like to provide a quick update on the Department of Defense project. HIMSS proved to be a great opportunity to highlight the promise made by the partnership for defense health. We had a completely full house for all showings of the demonstration that highlighted functionality of the DOD's model system, including some military-specific workflows, first responder applications, mass vaccinations and theater synchronizations. We remain on track for pilot sites to go live late this year.
Moving to Health Services. We continue to have success at migrating Health Services clients to tell Millennium and remain ahead of our original expectations for migration. Operationally and financially remain on track with the objectives we established when we did the acquisition. As I said before, we are pleased with how Cerner and Health Services teams have come together, and I'm impressed with how quickly Health Services associates have been able to add value in key areas of our business. 
Outside of the U.S., we had a solid quarter, but most non-U.S. markets continued to grow slower than our U.S. businesses. In Q1, our Global revenue grew 6%, driven largely by the extra month of Health Services compared to Q1 2015. Longer-term, we remain positive on our Global growth opportunity and believe this business will pick up as global economies strengthen. In addition, we believe global markets represent a significant opportunity for Population Health solutions, and our recently announced Population Health contract with  [indiscernible] Health Partners in U.K. is a good example. 
On that note, I'll now discuss our overall Population Health business. The Healthe Intent platform is increasingly becoming a differentiator, and we compete for new EHR business and also represents a major business opportunity inside and outside our installed base. In Q1, most of our new footprints included Population Health solutions, and I believe our Population Health capabilities are contributing to our increased success against our primary competitor. In addition, the pipeline of our existing clients looking at Healthe Intent remains strong. 
As I've discussed, health systems are increasingly being asked to live in 2 worlds future state driven by reimbursement models aligned to risk and quality outcomes and a current state where fee for service is still the predominant model. We believe Healthe Intent can help our clients compete more effectively on quality and efficiency in today's environment and also prepare them to more actively engage in managed populations in the future state. As a result, it has proven to be very attractive, even to clients who aren't going directly at risk today. 
Additionally, the shift away from traditional fee-for-service is gaining momentum. Most of you are already aware the plan CMS laid out last year to shift 50% of Medicare payments to value-based payment models by the end of 2018 and tie most of the remaining traditional fee-for-service payments to quality measures. More recently, CMS announced the comprehensive primary care plus model, which is yet another push towards more fee for value payment models that directly incent for active Population Health management. There are other reimbursement programs targeted at areas like joint replacement and chronic care management that are contributing to demand for our Population Health solutions. 
In summary, there's a significant amount of change occurring in health care, and this change is creating meaningful opportunity for Cerner. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike."

I want to start by building on some of Zane's comments on Healthe Intent by providing some perspective about the scope and scale. We began building Healthe Intent platform in 2012.

I want to start by building on some of Zane's comments on Healthe Intent by providing some perspective about the scope and scale. We began building Healthe Intent platform in 2012. In September of 2013, we made an on-time delivery of Healthe Registries, the first solution on the platform. We rapidly expanded the number of solutions and data sources connected to Healthe Intent. We now have 6 core solutions with 10 more planned by the end of the decade and have connected nearly 300 data sources from more than 80 unique systems, ranging from EHRs to insurance claim feeds, to device data, to open source environmental data. 
Healthe Intent has already become a very large platform. It currently has 5.5 petabytes of data, 59 million persons and is performing more than 100,000 processing jobs daily across activated client, giving them access to near real-time data. It supports the automation of personalized plans for care and programmable intelligence and enable strategic payer and provider network management that is informed by analytics and research. 
Like Cerner Millennium, Healthe Intent is a platform that enables us family solutions. The solutions are complementary to the function of the EHR and device platforms and have the potential to create a lot of value and mature the platform introduction of solutions are working out well with the timing of the market. We believe Healthe Intent  is unmatched in its scope and scale, and that it would continue to win out over many of the best of breed niche solutions that we compete against today, much like the Millennium platform has proven to be superior in the EHR market.
Moving to Revenue Cycle. As Zane indicated, we had a very strong quarter. We had record bookings, driven by a high attach rate of Revenue Cycle in new EHR business and existing EHR clients choosing to add Revenue Cycle. In addition, we had good contributions from RevWorks extended business office services, which are shorter engagements than full rev cycle for things like staff augmentation, business office management, transition services and other targeted projects. 
One highlight during the quarter was Universal Health Services, one of the largest hospital management companies in the nation, selecting Cerner's Millennium Revenue Cycle solutions. Combined with their existing Cerner clinical solutions, this will create a clinically driven revenue cycle system, which we believe is the best approach in the way almost all health systems are looking to go. 
Our Revenue Cycle pipeline is very strong, with more IDNs and investor own client expected to move to our Revenue Cycle solutions. In addition, Revenue Cycle is part of almost every new client opportunity, and our pipeline for new clients is also very strong, as Zane discussed. 
In summary, our investments and execution in the Revenue Cycle space have led to much stronger competitiveness, contributed meaningfully to our growth and can create a substantial pipeline of opportunities going forward. 
To close, I'd like to comment on the recent increase in headlines related to IT security and healthcare. We take security very seriously and invest heavily in protecting information in our systems. This has resulted in a good track record of protection for our clients' data. This increase in industry issues as related to security and recognition of our clients that we have a strong up it and see and security and is contributing to increased opportunities for remote hosting business. In addition, we believe the industry focus on security could increase opportunities for ITWorks relationships, as our clients look for health and securing information beyond their Cerner Solutions. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call over for questions."

I mean, we started the year talking about the fact that our backlog had a significant amount of 2016 revenue in it, it's 79% of the revenue for the year was going to be coming out of backlog. And actually, based on what we saw in the first quarter,",471,"Sure. I mean, we started the year talking about the fact that our backlog had a significant amount of 2016 revenue in it, it's 79% of the revenue for the year was going to be coming out of backlog. And actually, based on what we saw in the first quarter, that backlog is generating the revenue that we've expected. And as you know, through last year, services was an issue that we were dealing with. This year, services is on track. We've added a lot of people to that organization last year, all revenue-producing associates. And I think they are delivering, they're generating their backlog and they are delivering that backlog as we expected. The thing that hit us this quarter is that 21% that is going to come from current quarter bookings. And most of those feed into the system sales line on the income statement. So when you look at the system sales line, the growth there was pretty low and primarily driven through lower hardware. And as we kind of go through what we think for the year and the remaining quarters, we think hardware will kind of bounce back to the levels that we expected. But we were clearly short in Q1. The business is out there. We certainly, as we forecasted, saw deals, some of which kind of moved out and will help us achieve our targets in Q2 through Q4 on the hardware side. But I think relative to our highly visible revenue, all of those elements of the business are really hitting on all cylinders at this point. I think it's important to note when you kind of look at our revenue growth, to, really it's helpful and I know it's harder because with HS now becoming more and more part of our overall revenue and we are not really even able to break out separately, but I think if you look at kind of revenue growth for Q1, and if you take out, basically look at Q4 HS revenue, which is the $240 million, $245 million range, really Q1 was about a 10% overall revenue growth. And I think that's more indicative of the organic growth of the company. Assuming that HS, Health Services, basically stays kind of flat on a revenue basis and it was similar to what Q4 was, I think you're going to see Q2 be growth in the 12% organic range, and you'll see that continuing to increase, helping drive our overall growth for the year in the 13% revenue range. So I'm not excited that we didn't hit our revenue guidance this quarter, but the fact that it was related to hardware, which is a little bit harder to forecast, comes in and out in the same quarter, doesn't concern me relative to the rest of my business."

So we had of the short fall, the $15 million to $20 million that was kind of the shortfall for hardware, good chunk of that was large clients who host themselves, they were going to do large-scale replacements of computers, so hardware. Another component of it was a slightly lower device resale, but that was actually a smaller component. A lot of it was large hardware deals that likely will happen later in the year, but as clients for whatever reason push off renewing, updating their infrastructure for some period of time. It is something that they have flexibility on. Those machines continue to work. So that's why it's a little bit harder to tie down the exact period it's going to be. As you saw in our guidance for next quarter, I mean, we took the bottom end of our guidance down $25 million to make sure that we meet our guidance range for revenue next quarter. And a lot of that was just to say if hardware is going to be harder to forecast, using our traditional approach to doing that, which is about the only way that we can really do it, we're going to bake that in until we see that hardware starts recovering. Certainly, I expected, as we move through the year, to get back on track and deliver the quarterly numbers that we projected and planned.

So from what's driving the marketplace, overall marketplace trends? From a new business perspective, most everyone wants an integrated clinical as and financial system together. And as you think about a go-forward strategy to prepare for bundled payments, to prepare for really the at-risk models, all the things that are occurring, people are looking for those integrated clinicals and financials. And that's frankly the same thing that's driving the marketplace trend in our own installed base is those organizations want to get prepared for the future and have that sound foundational Revenue Cycle solutions that matches their Clinical Systems from an integrated perspective. So that's one of the marketplace elements. Additionally, you have a number of bases that are being sunsetted. So obviously, one large installed base being sunsetted. You got another installed base that's on a legacy solution has to be migrated and brought to a current platform. And so those are driving a lot of the kind of the macro level of marketplace trends. And it's pretty logical, as you think we're in a post ICD-10 era, that there is some pent-up demand for Revenue Cycle in that side. So I think there is kind of those elements as it relates to that. From our perspective, it's -- we've invested significantly over the last several years in Revenue Cycle from a solution and services point of view. And being able to have that demonstration of those, of that functionality live in our clients, has been very beneficial for us. And that, as we continue to drive across the other continuum of care in our vision of one bill across the continuum of care, I think that is a strong vision that clients are looking for. And as I think in the future, that, that will work for that. I think the UHS conversation is really --  they've been a long-term Health Services client, they've been a long-term of the financial side. They've been a long-term Cerner client on the clinical side. And so putting those together in that same construct of having strong foundational solutions from an integrated perspective, acute and ambulatory, as they move forward, is important to their clinical integration strategy. And so -- and then they also have some expertise from a billing perspective that we really like working with those folks. And that's a big positive for our teams as well because we've done a lot of work on the services and process side. So that -- I feel really good of about where we are and the progress we're making and the trend line and trajectory for Rev Cycle."

So I think the state and local governments will be additional areas of focus for us, and you'll see future announcements in both in those areas. And opening up Cerner into markets where we really haven't participated in the past. So all of those are big drivers for IT and for both core foundational EMRs because you have to have the solid, strong foundational plumbing to succeed in the future world. And then you got to have the tools to be able to attract the information no matter where they are, whether it's the Cerner EMR, whether it's claims data, or whether it's PBM data, all those, whether it's all the federal database themselves, all that needs to come together into a way which people can track information no matter where the person goes and really enhance the ability to manage risk in a better way.

I mean, relative to our total number, it's -- I mean, 5%, 6% of revenue. It's a fairly small number. I think if you look at our slides that we provided at HIMSS, tech resale was probably $330 million in total. So I think that gives you a sense. We don't expect that to grow. But in our world, that $330 million is just ripe for the taking because we have those client relationships. We know who to go to. And we know when they're looking to go acquire that. We don't make a whole lot money on the hardware, so that one doesn't hit the revenue. It doesn't really have much of a bottom-line impact. Selling that the solutions of third-party software has more margin. So the reality is in this quarter, actually below tech resale revenue, we hit our margin. Because of the margin we are driving now the third-party software and the higher margins that comes with it. So but it's not a growing part of our business, but we expect it to kind of continue to drive out at least that kind of level of revenue. And since it's, for us, the dollars that we get from the people that work on that, that small team, probably the highest dollars will drive associate in the company. So it's worth the effort that we spend on it. It's not going to be a material driver of the business. And that's one of the reasons why be short that number in Q1 is not very concerning to me."

Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the call. I will lead off today with a review of the numbers. Zane Burke, our President, will follow me with result highlights and marketplace observations; and then Mike Nill, our Chief Operating Officer, will provide some operational highlights. 
Now I'll turn to our results. Q1 was a solid start to the year. Bookings, earnings and cash flow were in our targeted ranges. Revenue was slightly below our targeted range, but our full year outlook remains intact. 
Our bookings revenue in Q1 was $1.17 billion, which is 2% lower than Q1 of '15 in total, but reflects strong growth of 18% when you exclude long-term bookings. As we indicated, Q1 '15 included an all-time high level of long-term bookings at 37%, creating a tough comparable. And this quarter had a very low level of 24%. While this difference lead to total bookings being basically flat, the strong growth in our non-long-term bookings reflects ongoing strong demand and new footprints, which Zane will discuss. 
In addition, we have a strong pipeline for Works deals, so we expect the mix of long-term bookings to normalize as we move through the year, which will benefit overall bookings. 
Our revenue backlog ended the quarter at $14.6 billion, which is up 12% from $13 billion a year ago. Revenue in the quarter was $1.14 billion, which is up 14% over Q1 '15, but $12 million below our guidance range, due primarily to lower hardware sales. The revenue composition for Q1 was $279 million in system sales, $251 million in support and maintenance, $589 million in services and $19 million in reimbursed travel. 
System sales revenue for the quarter was up 8% compared to Q1 of '15, with growth in software and subscriptions offsetting a large decline in hardware. The lower hardware is reflected in the strong system sales margin percent of 68.1%, which is up over 300 basis points year-over-year. The lower than projected hardware revenue led to total revenue being slightly below our guidance range. While it is disappointing to be slightly below our guidance range, I believe the growth in software and the return to strong growth in services revenue, is more indicative of our core business trends.
Moving to services. Total services revenue, including professional and managed services, was up 20% compared to Q1 of '15. This is in line with our expectation and reflects good execution by our services organization. Support and maintenance revenue increased 10% over Q1 of '15. 
Looking at revenue by geographic segment. Domestic revenue increased 15% over the year ago quarter to $1.05 billion, and global revenue grew 6% to $133 million.
Moving to gross margin. Our gross margin for Q1 was 84.6%, which is up from 83.1% in Q1 of '15, reflecting the lower mix of hardware as well as strong levels of service.
Looking at operating spending. Our first quarter non-GAAP operating expenses, which include share-based compensation expense and acquisition-related adjustments, were $701 million, which is up 19% compared to adjusted Q1 of '15 operating expenses. This growth was primarily driven by growth in personnel expenses related to revenue-generating associates, higher noncash expenses and having an extra month of Health Services expense in Q1 '16 as compared to Q1 '15. The total year-over-year growth for each expense category in Q1 on a non-GAAP basis was 22% for sales and client service, 4% for software development and 25% for G&A. Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles was basically flat.
Moving to operating margins. Our operating margin before share-based compensation expense and acquisition-related adjustments was 23.0% in Q1, which is down slightly from 23.7% in the year ago period. As previously indicated, we expect margin expansion to be limited in 2016 due in part to growth in noncash expenses. As we laid out at HIMSS, we believe we can expand margins 50 to 100 basis points annually after 2016.
Moving to net earnings and EPS. Our GAAP net earnings in Q1 were $150 million or $0.43 per diluted share. Adjusted net earnings were $182 million, and adjusted diluted EPS was $0.53, which is up 18% compared to Q1 of '15. Adjusted net earnings exclude share-based compensation expense, which had a net impact on GAAP earnings of $13.4 million or $0.04 per diluted share. 
Adjusted net earnings also reflect adjustments related to Cerner's acquisition of Health Services, including Health Services' acquisition-related amortization, which reduced GAAP net earnings and diluted earnings per share by $13 million and $0.04, respectively; other acquisition-related adjustments, which reduced GAAP net earnings and diluted earnings per share by $2 million and $0.01, respectively; and the acquisition-related deferred revenue adjustment, which is not included in GAAP net earnings, but increased adjusted net earnings and diluted earnings per share by $4 million and $0.01, respectively. 
The Q1 tax rate for adjusted net earnings was 31%, which is slightly lower than our expected range of 32% to 33%.
Now I'll move to our balance sheet. We ended Q1 with $707 million of total cash and investments, which is up slightly from $686 million in Q4, with most of our free cash flow being used to repurchase shares. 
During the quarter, we executed $150 million out of the $300 million stock repurchase program authorized in March of this year, repurchasing 2.8 million shares at an average price of $53.45.
Moving to debt. Our total debt, including capital lease obligations, is $595 million, which is down slightly compared to Q4. Total receivables ended the quarter at $942 million, which is down $92 million from Q4. Our Q1 DSO was 76 days, which is an improvement of 4 days compared to Q4 and in line with our expectations.
Operating cash flow for the quarter was very strong at $327 million, which is second only to our all-time high of $353 million in Q4. 
Q1 capital expenditures were $99 million and capitalized software was $75 million. Free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures and capitalized software, was $152 million for the quarter, driven by strong operating cash flow. 
As previously indicated, we expect capital expenditures to increase in 2016, primarily due to construction of a new campus. We still expect to generate solid free cash flow with growth in operating cash flow offsetting the increase in capital expenditures. 
Now I'll go through Q2 and full year 2016 guidance. For Q2, we expect revenue between $1.175 billion and $1.25 billion, with the midpoint reflecting growth of 8% over Q2 of '15. Note that we have widened our guidance range to provide cushion, given we were below our Q1 guidance due to the hardware. Also we expect revenue growth to be higher in Q3, which is an easier comparable period than Q2. 
For the full year, we continue to expect revenue between $4.9 billion and $5.1 billion, reflecting 13% growth over 2015 at the midpoint. We expect Q2 adjusted EPS before share-based compensation and acquisition-related adjustments to be $0.56 to $0.58 per share, with the midpoint reflecting 10% growth over Q2 '15 adjusted EPS. 
For the full year, we continue to expect adjusted EPS before share-based compensation and acquisition-related adjustments to be $2.30 to $2.40, with the midpoint reflecting 11% growth over 2015. Our estimate for the impact of share-based compensation expense is approximately $0.04 in Q2 and between $0.16 to $0.17 for the full year.
Moving to bookings guidance. We expect bookings revenue in Q2 of $1.35 billion to $1.48 billion, with the midpoint reflecting 10% growth over Q2 of '15. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Zane."

Today, I'll provide color on our results and make some marketplace observations. 
Starting with bookings. As Marc indicated, our total bookings were basically flat compared to the year ago quarter, but our non-long-term bookings grew at 18%, and we expect long-term bookings to continue to increase as we move through the year. Bookings this year included a strong level of large contracts, with 43 contracts over $5 million, including 18 over $10 million. 
Regarding long-term bookings contributions, we did have solid hosting bookings and a small ITWorks contract, but the total percent from long-term bookings was just 24% compared to approximately 30% to 31% in recent years. This was not a surprise to us as we had indicated our guidance assumed a lower level of long-term bookings, and our total bookings are within our guidance range. Going forward, our pipeline for Works deal is strong, so I expect more contribution from long-term bookings in future quarters. 
Now I'll discuss the drivers of the strong growth in non-long-term bookings. The main highlight of the quarter was our continued success at gaining new clients. In Q1, 36% of our bookings came from outside our core Millennium install base, driven by an all-time high win rate against our primary competitor. As I have discussed, we believe we are much more effective against our primary competitor for several reasons, including significant improvements in our solutions in recent years, predictable delivery capabilities, lower cost of ownership, ability to deliver value and our population health and open platform capabilities. In addition, we believe the heightened awareness of our primary competitors, higher cost of ownership, lack of system openness and limited population health care capabilities have contributed to us being more effective against them. 
Looking ahead, our pipeline for new business continues to grow, and other leading indicators, such as reference activities are at all-time highs. With one major installed base facing a sunsetting of their solution and another with over 3/4 of their base on legacy platforms, we expect the replacement market to remain strong over the next 2 to 3 years. 
Our view of the replacement market and overall opportunity to grow our business was also validated at HIMSS. This year, we interfaced with clients and prospects, representing over $8 billion of pipeline, which is an increase of 40% compared to last year. The EHR replacement market continued to be a large part of these conversations, but we also had a high-volume of discussions with existing and new clients about other solutions and services, such as revenue cycle, ambulatory, population health and our Works businesses. 
Another highlight of the quarter was the strength of our revenue cycle business. As Mike will discuss, we continue to have a very high percent of new clients to include revenue cycle with their EHR purchase and more of our existing clients, including some of our largest, choosing to move to Cerner revenue cycle.
Moving to the ambulatory market where we had a very good Q1 with strength in ambulatory EHR, practice management and business office services. This included some of our largest IDN and investor-owned clients choosing Cerner's clinical and revenue cycle solutions for their ambulatory settings. We also continue to see a high attach rate for ambulatory when Health Services clients are migrating to Millennium. 
As we look to the rest of the year, there are many more opportunities to sell ambulatory solutions to the practices affiliated with our major health system clients. In addition, we are starting to see more opportunities at large stand-alone practices, where some of the best-of-breed suppliers continue to falter. We also had a strong quarter in the small hospital market in our cloud-based CommunityWorks offering. Bookings from CommunityWorks were a record for the first quarter and included a combination of stand-alone opportunities and Health Services migrations.
Now I'd like to provide a quick update on the Department of Defense project. HIMSS proved to be a great opportunity to highlight the progress made by the Leidos partnership for defense health. We had a completely full house for all showings of the demonstration that highlighted the functionality of the DOD's model system, including some military-specific workflows, first responder applications, mass vaccinations and theater synchronizations. We remain on track for pilot sites to go live late this year.
Moving to Health Services. We continue to have success at migrating Health Services clients to Millennium and remain ahead of our original expectations for migrations. Operationally and financially, we remain on track with the objectives we established when we did the acquisition. As I said before, we are pleased with how Cerner and Health Services teams have come together, and I'm impressed with how quickly Health Services associates have been able to add value in key areas of our business. 
Outside of the U.S., we had a solid quarter, but most non-U.S. markets continued to grow slower than our U.S. businesses. In Q1, our Global revenue grew 6%, driven largely by the extra month of Health Services compared to Q1 of 2015. 
Longer-term, we remain positive on our global growth opportunity and believe this business will pick up as global economies strengthen. In addition, we believe global markets represent a significant opportunity for population health solutions, and our recently announced population health contract with  Wirral Health Partners in U.K. is a good example. 
On that note, I'll now discuss our overall population health business. The HealtheIntent platform is increasingly becoming a differentiator, and we compete for new EHR business and also represents a major business opportunity inside and outside our installed base. In Q1, most of our new footprints included population health solutions, and I believe our population health capabilities are contributing to our increased success against our primary competitor. In addition, the pipeline of our existing clients looking at HealtheIntent remains strong. 
As I have discussed, health systems are increasingly being asked to live in 2 worlds: a future state driven by reimbursement models aligned to risk and quality outcomes and a current state where fee-for-service is still the predominant model. We believe HealtheIntent can help our clients compete more effectively on quality and efficiency in today's environment and also prepare them to more actively engage in managed populations in the future state. As a result, it has proven to be very attractive, even to clients who aren't going directly at risk today. 
Additionally, the shift away from traditional fee-for-service is gaining momentum. Most of you are already aware the plan CMS laid out last year to shift 50% of Medicare payments to value-based payment models by the end of 2018 and tie most of the remaining traditional fee-for-service payments to quality measures. 
More recently, CMS announced the Comprehensive Primary Care Plus model, which is yet another push towards more fee-for-value payment models that directly incent for active population health management. There are other reimbursement programs targeted at areas like joint replacement and chronic care management that are contributing to demand for our population health solutions. 
In summary, there is a significant amount of change occurring in health care, and this change is creating meaningful opportunity for Cerner. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike."

I want to start by building on some of Zane's comments on HealtheIntent by providing some perspective about its scope and scale. We began building HealtheIntent platform in 2012. In September of 2013, we made an on-time delivery of Healthe Registries, the first solution on the platform. We rapidly expanded the number of solutions and data sources connected to HealtheIntent. We now have 6 core solutions with 10 more planned by the end of the decade and have connected nearly 300 data sources from more than 80 unique systems, ranging from EHRs to insurance claim feeds, to device data, to open source environmental data. 
HealtheIntent has already become a very large platform. It currently has 5.5 petabytes of data, 59 million persons and is performing more than 100,000 processing jobs daily across activated clients, giving them access to near real-time data. It supports the automation of personalized plans for care and programmable intelligence and enable strategic payer and provider network management that is informed by analytics and research. 
Like Cerner Millennium, HealtheIntent is a platform that enables a family of solutions. The solutions are complementary to the function of the EHR and device platforms, and they have the potential to create a lot of value and the maturity of the platform and introduction of solutions are working out well with the timing of the market. We believe HealtheIntent is unmatched in its scope and scale, and that it will continue to win out over many of the best-of-breed niche solutions that we compete against today, much like our Millennium platform has proven to be superior in the EHR market.
Moving to Revenue Cycle. As Zane indicated, we had a very strong quarter. We had record bookings, driven by a high attach rate of revenue cycle in new EHR business and existing EHR clients choosing to add revenue cycle. In addition, we had good contributions from RevWorks extended business office services, which are shorter engagements than full rev cycle for things like staff augmentation, business office management, transition services and other targeted projects. 
One highlight during the quarter was Universal Health Services, one of the largest hospital management companies in the nation, selecting Cerner's Millennium revenue cycle solutions. Combined with their existing Cerner clinical solutions, this will create a clinically-driven revenue cycle system, which we believe is the best approach in the way almost all health systems are looking to go. 
Our revenue cycle pipeline is very strong, with more IDNs and investor-owned clients expected to move to our revenue cycle solutions. In addition, revenue cycle is part of almost every new client opportunity, and our pipeline for new clients is also very strong, as Zane discussed. 
In summary, our investments and execution in the revenue cycle space have led to much stronger competitiveness, contributed meaningfully to our growth and can created a substantial pipeline of opportunities going forward. 
To close, I'd like to comment on the recent increase in headlines related to IT security and health care. We take security very seriously and invest heavily in protecting information in our systems. This has resulted in a good track record of protection for our clients data. This increase in industry issues has related to security and recognition of our clients that we have a strong competency in security and is contributing to increased opportunities for remote hosting business. 
In addition, we believe the industry focus on security could increase opportunities for ITWorks relationships, as our clients look for health in securing information beyond their Cerner solutions. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call over for questions."

And actually, based on what we saw in the first quarter,",471,"Sure. I mean, we started the year talking about the fact that our backlog had a significant amount of 2016 revenue in it, that 79% of the revenue for the year was going to be coming out of backlog. And actually, based on what we saw in the first quarter, that backlog is generating the revenue that we've expected. And as you know, through last year, services was an issue that we were dealing with. This year, services is on track. We've added a lot of people to that organization last year, all revenue-producing associates. And I think they are delivering, they're generating their backlog and they are delivering that backlog as we expected. The thing that hit us this quarter is that 21% that is going to come from current quarter bookings. And most of those feed into the system sales line on the income statement. So when you look at the system sales line, the growth there was pretty low and primarily driven through lower hardware. And as we kind of go through, what we think for the year and the remaining quarters, we think hardware will kind of bounce back to the levels that we expected, but we were clearly short in Q1. The business is out there. We certainly, as we forecasted, saw deals, some of which kind of moved out and will help us achieve our targets in Q2 through Q4 on the hardware side. But I think relative to our highly visible revenue, all of those elements of the business are really hitting on all cylinders at this point. I think it's important to note when you kind of look at our revenue growth, too, really, it's helpful and I know it's harder because with HS now becoming more and more part of our overall revenue, and we're not really even able to break out separately, but I think if you look at kind of revenue growth for Q1, and if you take out, basically -- look at Q4 HS revenue, which is the $240 million, $245 million range, really Q1 was about a 10% overall revenue growth. And I think that's more indicative of the organic growth of the company assuming that HS, Health Services, basically stays kind of flat on a revenue basis, and it was similar to what Q4 was. I think you're going to see Q2 be growth in the 12% organic range, and you'll see that continuing to increase, helping drive our overall growth for the year in the 13% revenue range. So I'm not excited that we didn't hit our revenue guidance this quarter, but the fact that it was related to hardware, which is a little bit harder to forecast, comes in and out in the same quarter, doesn't concern me relative to the rest of my business."

So we had, of the short fall, the $15 million to $20 million that was kind of the shortfall for hardware. A good chunk of that was large clients that -- who host themselves. They were going to do large-scale replacements of computers, so hardware. Another component of it was a slightly lower device resale, but that was actually a smaller component. A lot of it was large hardware deals that likely will happen later in the year, but as clients, for whatever reason, pushed off renewing -- updating their infrastructure for some period of time. It is something that they have flexibility on. Those machines continue to work. So that's why it's a little bit harder to tie down the exact period it's going to be. As you saw in our guidance for next quarter -- I mean, we took the bottom end of our guidance down $25 million to make sure that we meet our guidance range for revenue next quarter. And a lot of that was just to say if hardware is going to be harder to forecast, using our traditional approach to doing that, which is about -- the only way that we can really do it, we're going to bake that in till we see that hardware starts recovering. Certainly, I expected, as we move through the year, to get back on track and deliver the quarterly numbers that we projected and planned. But Q1 was short, and I don't know that we end up making that up during the year."

So from what's driving the marketplace, overall marketplace trends? From a new business perspective, most everyone wants an integrated clinical and financial system together. And as you think about a go-forward strategy to prepare for bundled payments, to prepare for really the at-risk models, all the things that are occurring, people are looking for those integrated clinicals and financials. And that's frankly the same thing that's driving the marketplace trend in our own installed base is those organizations want to get prepared for the future and have that sound foundational revenue cycle solutions that matches their clinical systems from an integrated perspective. So that's one of the marketplace elements. Additionally, you have a number of bases that are being sunsetted. So those -- obviously, one large installed base being sunsetted, you've got another installed base that's on a legacy solution and has to be migrated and brought to a current platform. And so those are driving a lot of the kind of the macro level of marketplace trends. And it's pretty logical. As you think, we're in a post ICD-10 era, that there was some pent-up demand for revenue cycle on that side. So I think there is kind of those elements as it relates to that. From our perspective, it's the -- we've invested significantly over the last several years in revenue cycle from a solution and services point of view. And being able to have that demonstration of those -- of that functionality live in our clients, has been very beneficial for us. And that, as we continue to drive across the other continuum of care and our vision of one bill across the continuum of care, I think that is a strong vision that clients are looking for. And as I think, in the future, that, that will work for that. I think the UHS conversation is really --  there has -- they've been a long-term Health Services client. They've been a long-term -- on the financial side. They've been a long-term Cerner client on the clinical side. And so putting those together in that same construct of having strong foundational solutions on a -- from a integrated perspective, acute and ambulatory, as they move forward, is important to their clinical integration strategy. And so -- and then they also have some expertise from a billing perspective that we really like working with those folks. And that's a big positive for our teams as well, because we've done a lot of work on those services and process side. So that -- I feel really good about where we are and the progress we're making in the trend line and trajectory for rev cycle."

And you got to have the mechanisms to be able to track it moving forward. The more need for data liquidity across the continuum of care, the more need for solution like HealtheIntent. And so almost every single one of the initiatives has a big value there. There's also a number of state-driven initiatives. So whether it's New York District Program, you look at a number of Medicaid initiatives. We see a big demand in markets where we haven't participated in the past where we see great opportunities for us to participate. So I think the state and local governments will be additional areas of focus for us, and you'll see future announcements in both -- in those areas, and opening up Cerner into markets where we haven't participated in the past. So all of those are big drivers for IT and for both core foundational EMRs, because you have to have the solid, strong foundational plumbing to succeed in the future world. And then you got to have the tools to be able to track the information no matter where they are, whether it's a Cerner EMR, or whether it's claims data, or whether it's PBM data, all those -- whether it's federal database themselves, all that needs to come together into a way which people can track the information no matter where the person goes and really enhance the ability to manage risk in a better way.

Well, we don't make a whole lot money on the hardware, so [indiscernible] yet. That one doesn't hit the revenue. It doesn't really have much of a bottom-line impact. Selling that -- the solutions and third-party software is -- has more margin. So the reality is in this quarter when we were actually below tech resale revenue, we hit our margin number because of the margin we were driving out the third-party software and the higher margins that comes with it. So -- but it's not a growing part of our business, but we expect it to kind of continue to drive out at least that kind of level of revenue. And since it's, for us, the dollars that we get from the people that work on that, that small team are probably the highest dollars we drive that of any associate in the company.

Typically, in a new business situation, there'll be 2 small, I will say, almost pilot-like population health elements. And we can grow with -- even in those 2 segments, because there'll be for a smaller portion of their population. They may say, ""Gosh, I've got a shared savings plan. I've got some -- I'm going to get something that I'm actually actively managing in population. It's a small population, I want to see that."" But often it's things such as registries, so just kind of having the diabetic registries. So there'll be small elements, which gets the framework in place, which is really important for us, because it creates that framework upfront, which allows us to add on at a lower cost as we move forward and really scale out. And so often what you'll see is these kind of small pilot and small starters with 1 or 2 solutions and then growing forward. Our existing clients are taking more of the solutions that are generally available. But very similar to this, they're taking a more practical approach to whatever -- why is that they have at risk or conditions that they want to manage and creating a framework to grow that over time. So we can grow exponentially both within the platform -- within the solution set itself, because we'll add more population to that as well as we'll add more capabilities and functionality, which creates additional sales opportunities for us. And so, for me, it's -- I'm just anxious to really have an opportunity to provide that full-scale enterprise-wide solution set, which is our vision and what many of our clients are purchasing and really will take a lot of the noise out from some of these small niche pop health players that are out there."

Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the call. I will lead off today with a review of the numbers. Zane Burke, our President, will follow me with result highlights and marketplace observations; and then Mike Nill, our Chief Operating Officer, will provide some operational highlights. 
Now I'll turn to our results. Q1 was a solid start to the year. Bookings, earnings and cash flow were in our targeted ranges. Revenue was slightly below our targeted range, but our full year outlook remains intact. 
Our bookings revenue in Q1 was $1.17 billion, which is 2% lower than Q1 of '15 in total, but reflects strong growth of 18% when you exclude long-term bookings. As we indicated, Q1 '15 included an all-time high level of long-term bookings at 37%, creating a tough comparable. And this quarter had a very low level of 24%. While this difference lead to total bookings being basically flat, the strong growth in our non-long-term bookings reflects ongoing strong demand and new footprints, which Zane will discuss. 
In addition, we have a strong pipeline for Works deals, so we expect the mix of long-term bookings to normalize as we move through the year, which will benefit overall bookings. 
Our revenue backlog ended the quarter at $14.6 billion, which is up 12% from $13 billion a year ago. Revenue in the quarter was $1.14 billion, which is up 14% over Q1 '15, but $12 million below our guidance range, due primarily to lower hardware sales. The revenue composition for Q1 was $279 million in system sales, $251 million in support and maintenance, $589 million in services and $19 million in reimbursed travel. 
System sales revenue for the quarter was up 8% compared to Q1 of '15, with growth in software and subscriptions offsetting a large decline in hardware. The lower hardware is reflected in the strong system sales margin percent of 68.1%, which is up over 300 basis points year-over-year. The lower than projected hardware revenue led to total revenue being slightly below our guidance range. While it is disappointing to be slightly below our guidance range, I believe the growth in software and the return to strong growth in services revenue, is more indicative of our core business trends.
Moving to services. Total services revenue, including professional and managed services, was up 20% compared to Q1 of '15. This is in line with our expectation and reflects good execution by our services organization. Support and maintenance revenue increased 10% over Q1 of '15. 
Looking at revenue by geographic segment. Domestic revenue increased 15% over the year ago quarter to $1.05 billion, and global revenue grew 6% to $133 million.
Moving to gross margin. Our gross margin for Q1 was 84.6%, which is up from 83.1% in Q1 of '15, reflecting the lower mix of hardware as well as strong levels of service.
Looking at operating spending. Our first quarter non-GAAP operating expenses, which include share-based compensation expense and acquisition-related adjustments, were $701 million, which is up 19% compared to adjusted Q1 of '15 operating expenses. This growth was primarily driven by growth in personnel expenses related to revenue-generating associates, higher noncash expenses and having an extra month of Health Services expense in Q1 '16 as compared to Q1 '15. The total year-over-year growth for each expense category in Q1 on a non-GAAP basis was 22% for sales and client service, 4% for software development and 25% for G&A. Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles was basically flat.
Moving to operating margins. Our operating margin before share-based compensation expense and acquisition-related adjustments was 23.0% in Q1, which is down slightly from 23.7% in the year ago period. As previously indicated, we expect margin expansion to be limited in 2016 due in part to growth in noncash expenses. As we laid out at HIMSS, we believe we can expand margins 50 to 100 basis points annually after 2016.
Moving to net earnings and EPS. Our GAAP net earnings in Q1 were $150 million or $0.43 per diluted share. Adjusted net earnings were $182 million, and adjusted diluted EPS was $0.53, which is up 18% compared to Q1 of '15. Adjusted net earnings exclude share-based compensation expense, which had a net impact on GAAP earnings of $13.4 million or $0.04 per diluted share. 
Adjusted net earnings also reflect adjustments related to Cerner's acquisition of Health Services, including Health Services' acquisition-related amortization, which reduced GAAP net earnings and diluted earnings per share by $13 million and $0.04, respectively; other acquisition-related adjustments, which reduced GAAP net earnings and diluted earnings per share by $2 million and $0.01, respectively; and the acquisition-related deferred revenue adjustment, which is not included in GAAP net earnings, but increased adjusted net earnings and diluted earnings per share by $4 million and $0.01, respectively. 
The Q1 tax rate for adjusted net earnings was 31%, which is slightly lower than our expected range of 32% to 33%.
Now I'll move to our balance sheet. We ended Q1 with $707 million of total cash and investments, which is up slightly from $686 million in Q4, with most of our free cash flow being used to repurchase shares. 
During the quarter, we executed $150 million out of the $300 million stock repurchase program authorized in March of this year, repurchasing 2.8 million shares at an average price of $53.45.
Moving to debt. Our total debt, including capital lease obligations, is $595 million, which is down slightly compared to Q4. Total receivables ended the quarter at $942 million, which is down $92 million from Q4. Our Q1 DSO was 76 days, which is an improvement of 4 days compared to Q4 and in line with our expectations.
Operating cash flow for the quarter was very strong at $327 million, which is second only to our all-time high of $353 million in Q4. 
Q1 capital expenditures were $99 million and capitalized software was $75 million. Free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures and capitalized software, was $152 million for the quarter, driven by strong operating cash flow. 
As previously indicated, we expect capital expenditures to increase in 2016, primarily due to construction of a new campus. We still expect to generate solid free cash flow with growth in operating cash flow offsetting the increase in capital expenditures. 
Now I'll go through Q2 and full year 2016 guidance. For Q2, we expect revenue between $1.175 billion and $1.25 billion, with the midpoint reflecting growth of 8% over Q2 of '15. Note that we have widened our guidance range to provide cushion, given we were below our Q1 guidance due to the hardware. Also we expect revenue growth to be higher in Q3, which is an easier comparable period than Q2. 
For the full year, we continue to expect revenue between $4.9 billion and $5.1 billion, reflecting 13% growth over 2015 at the midpoint. We expect Q2 adjusted EPS before share-based compensation and acquisition-related adjustments to be $0.56 to $0.58 per share, with the midpoint reflecting 10% growth over Q2 '15 adjusted EPS. 
For the full year, we continue to expect adjusted EPS before share-based compensation and acquisition-related adjustments to be $2.30 to $2.40, with the midpoint reflecting 11% growth over 2015. Our estimate for the impact of share-based compensation expense is approximately $0.04 in Q2 and between $0.16 to $0.17 for the full year.
Moving to bookings guidance. We expect bookings revenue in Q2 of $1.35 billion to $1.48 billion, with the midpoint reflecting 10% growth over Q2 of '15. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Zane."

Today, I'll provide color on our results and make some marketplace observations. 
Starting with bookings. As Marc indicated, our total bookings were basically flat compared to the year ago quarter, but our non-long-term bookings grew at 18%, and we expect long-term bookings to continue to increase as we move through the year. Bookings this year included a strong level of large contracts, with 43 contracts over $5 million, including 18 over $10 million. 
Regarding long-term bookings contributions, we did have solid hosting bookings and a small ITWorks contract, but the total percent from long-term bookings was just 24% compared to approximately 30% to 31% in recent years. This was not a surprise to us as we had indicated our guidance assumed a lower level of long-term bookings, and our total bookings are within our guidance range. Going forward, our pipeline for Works deal is strong, so I expect more contribution from long-term bookings in future quarters. 
Now I'll discuss the drivers of the strong growth in non-long-term bookings. The main highlight of the quarter was our continued success at gaining new clients. In Q1, 36% of our bookings came from outside our core Millennium install base, driven by an all-time high win rate against our primary competitor. As I have discussed, we believe we are much more effective against our primary competitor for several reasons, including significant improvements in our solutions in recent years, predictable delivery capabilities, lower cost of ownership, ability to deliver value and our population health and open platform capabilities. In addition, we believe the heightened awareness of our primary competitors, higher cost of ownership, lack of system openness and limited population health care capabilities have contributed to us being more effective against them. 
Looking ahead, our pipeline for new business continues to grow, and other leading indicators, such as reference activities are at all-time highs. With one major installed base facing a sunsetting of their solution and another with over 3/4 of their base on legacy platforms, we expect the replacement market to remain strong over the next 2 to 3 years. 
Our view of the replacement market and overall opportunity to grow our business was also validated at HIMSS. This year, we interfaced with clients and prospects, representing over $8 billion of pipeline, which is an increase of 40% compared to last year. The EHR replacement market continued to be a large part of these conversations, but we also had a high-volume of discussions with existing and new clients about other solutions and services, such as revenue cycle, ambulatory, population health and our Works businesses. 
Another highlight of the quarter was the strength of our revenue cycle business. As Mike will discuss, we continue to have a very high percent of new clients to include revenue cycle with their EHR purchase and more of our existing clients, including some of our largest, choosing to move to Cerner revenue cycle.
Moving to the ambulatory market where we had a very good Q1 with strength in ambulatory EHR, practice management and business office services. This included some of our largest IDN and investor-owned clients choosing Cerner's clinical and revenue cycle solutions for their ambulatory settings. We also continue to see a high attach rate for ambulatory when Health Services clients are migrating to Millennium. 
As we look to the rest of the year, there are many more opportunities to sell ambulatory solutions to the practices affiliated with our major health system clients. In addition, we are starting to see more opportunities at large stand-alone practices, where some of the best-of-breed suppliers continue to falter. We also had a strong quarter in the small hospital market in our cloud-based CommunityWorks offering. Bookings from CommunityWorks were a record for the first quarter and included a combination of stand-alone opportunities and Health Services migrations.
Now I'd like to provide a quick update on the Department of Defense project. HIMSS proved to be a great opportunity to highlight the progress made by the Leidos partnership for defense health. We had a completely full house for all showings of the demonstration that highlighted the functionality of the DOD's model system, including some military-specific workflows, first responder applications, mass vaccinations and theater synchronizations. We remain on track for pilot sites to go live late this year.
Moving to Health Services. We continue to have success at migrating Health Services clients to Millennium and remain ahead of our original expectations for migrations. Operationally and financially, we remain on track with the objectives we established when we did the acquisition. As I said before, we are pleased with how Cerner and Health Services teams have come together, and I'm impressed with how quickly Health Services associates have been able to add value in key areas of our business. 
Outside of the U.S., we had a solid quarter, but most non-U.S. markets continued to grow slower than our U.S. businesses. In Q1, our Global revenue grew 6%, driven largely by the extra month of Health Services compared to Q1 of 2015. 
Longer-term, we remain positive on our global growth opportunity and believe this business will pick up as global economies strengthen. In addition, we believe global markets represent a significant opportunity for population health solutions, and our recently announced population health contract with  Wirral Health Partners in U.K. is a good example. 
On that note, I'll now discuss our overall population health business. The HealtheIntent platform is increasingly becoming a differentiator when we compete for new EHR business and also represents a major business opportunity inside and outside our installed base. In Q1, most of our new footprints included population health solutions, and I believe our population health capabilities are contributing to our increased success against our primary competitor. In addition, the pipeline of our existing clients looking at HealtheIntent remains strong. 
As I have discussed, health systems are increasingly being asked to live in 2 worlds: a future state driven by reimbursement models aligned to risk and quality outcomes and a current state where fee-for-service is still the predominant model. We believe HealtheIntent can help our clients compete more effectively on quality and efficiency in today's environment and also prepare them to more actively engage in managed populations in the future state. As a result, it has proven to be very attractive, even to clients who aren't going directly at risk today. 
Additionally, the shift away from traditional fee-for-service is gaining momentum. Most of you are already aware the plan CMS laid out last year to shift 50% of Medicare payments to value-based payment models by the end of 2018 and tie most of the remaining traditional fee-for-service payments to quality measures. 
More recently, CMS announced the Comprehensive Primary Care Plus model, which is yet another push towards more fee-for-value payment models that directly incent for active population health management. There are other reimbursement programs targeted at areas like joint replacement and chronic care management that are contributing to demand for our population health solutions. 
In summary, there is a significant amount of change occurring in health care, and this change is creating meaningful opportunity for Cerner. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike."

I want to start by building on some of Zane's comments on HealtheIntent by providing some perspective about its scope and scale. We began building HealtheIntent platform in 2012. In September of 2013, we made an on-time delivery of Healthe Registries, the first solution on the platform. We rapidly expanded the number of solutions and data sources connected to HealtheIntent. We now have 6 core solutions with 10 more planned by the end of the decade and have connected nearly 300 data sources from more than 80 unique systems, ranging from EHRs to insurance claim feeds, to device data, to open source environmental data. 
HealtheIntent has already become a very large platform. It currently has 5.5 petabytes of data, 59 million persons and is performing more than 100,000 processing jobs daily across activated clients, giving them access to near real-time data. It supports the automation of personalized plans for care and programmable intelligence and enable strategic payer and provider network management that is informed by analytics and research. 
Like Cerner Millennium, HealtheIntent is a platform that enables a family of solutions. The solutions are complementary to the function of the EHR and device platforms, and they have the potential to create a lot of value and the maturity of the platform and introduction of solutions are working out well with the timing of the market. We believe HealtheIntent is unmatched in its scope and scale, and that it will continue to win out over many of the best-of-breed niche solutions that we compete against today, much like our Millennium platform has proven to be superior in the EHR market.
Moving to Revenue Cycle. As Zane indicated, we had a very strong quarter. We had record bookings, driven by a high attach rate of revenue cycle in new EHR business and existing EHR clients choosing to add revenue cycle. In addition, we had good contributions from RevWorks extended business office services, which are shorter engagements than full rev cycle for things like staff augmentation, business office management, transition services and other targeted projects. 
One highlight during the quarter was Universal Health Services, one of the largest hospital management companies in the nation, selecting Cerner's Millennium revenue cycle solutions. Combined with their existing Cerner clinical solutions, this will create a clinically-driven revenue cycle system, which we believe is the best approach and the way almost all health systems are looking to go. 
Our revenue cycle pipeline is very strong, with more IDNs and investor-owned clients expected to move to our revenue cycle solutions. In addition, revenue cycle is part of almost every new client opportunity, and our pipeline for new clients is also very strong, as Zane discussed. 
In summary, our investments and execution in the revenue cycle space have led to much stronger competitiveness, contributed meaningfully to our growth and created a substantial pipeline of opportunities going forward. 
To close, I'd like to comment on the recent increase in headlines related to IT security and health care. We take security very seriously and invest heavily in protecting information in our systems. This has resulted in a good track record of protection for our clients data. This increase in industry issues has related to security and recognition of our clients that we have a strong competency in security and is contributing to increased opportunities for remote hosting business. 
In addition, we believe the industry focus on security could increase opportunities for ITWorks relationships, as our clients look for health in securing information beyond their Cerner solutions. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call over for questions."

And actually, based on what we saw in the first quarter,",471,"Sure. I mean, we started the year talking about the fact that our backlog had a significant amount of 2016 revenue in it, that 79% of the revenue for the year was going to be coming out of backlog. And actually, based on what we saw in the first quarter, that backlog is generating the revenue that we've expected. And as you know, through last year, services was an issue that we were dealing with. This year, services is on track. We've added a lot of people to that organization last year, all revenue-producing associates. And I think they are delivering, they're generating their backlog and they are delivering that backlog as we expected. The thing that hit us this quarter is that 21% that is going to come from current quarter bookings. And most of those feed into the system sales line on the income statement. So when you look at the system sales line, the growth there was pretty low and primarily driven through lower hardware. And as we kind of go through, what we think for the year and the remaining quarters, we think hardware will kind of bounce back to the levels that we expected, but we were clearly short in Q1. The business is out there. We certainly, as we forecasted, saw deals, some of which kind of moved out and will help us achieve our targets in Q2 through Q4 on the hardware side. But I think relative to our highly visible revenue, all of those elements of the business are really hitting on all cylinders at this point. I think it's important to note when you kind of look at our revenue growth, too, really, it's helpful and I know it's harder because with HS now becoming more and more part of our overall revenue, and we're not really even able to break out separately, but I think if you look at kind of revenue growth for Q1, and if you take out, basically -- look at Q4 HS revenue, which is the $240 million, $245 million range, really Q1 was about a 10% overall revenue growth. And I think that's more indicative of the organic growth of the company assuming that HS, Health Services, basically stays kind of flat on a revenue basis, and it was similar to what Q4 was. I think you're going to see Q2 be growth in the 12% organic range, and you'll see that continuing to increase, helping drive our overall growth for the year in the 13% revenue range. So I'm not excited that we didn't hit our revenue guidance this quarter, but the fact that it was related to hardware, which is a little bit harder to forecast, comes in and out in the same quarter, doesn't concern me relative to the rest of my business."

So we had, of the short fall, the $15 million to $20 million that was kind of the shortfall for hardware. A good chunk of that was large clients that -- who host themselves that were going to do large-scale replacements of computers, so hardware. Another component of it was a slightly lower device resale, but that was actually a smaller component. A lot of it was large hardware deals that likely will happen later in the year, but as clients, for whatever reason, pushed off renewing -- updating their infrastructure for some period of time. It is something that they have flexibility on. Those machines continue to work. So that's why it's a little bit harder to tie down the exact period it's going to be. As you saw in our guidance for next quarter -- I mean, we took the bottom end of our guidance down $25 million to make sure that we meet our guidance range for revenue next quarter. And a lot of that was just to say if hardware is going to be harder to forecast, using our traditional approach to doing that, which is about -- the only way that we can really do it, we're going to bake that in till we see that hardware starts recovering. Certainly, I expected, as we move through the year, to get back on track and deliver the quarterly numbers that we projected and planned.

And as you think about a go-forward strategy to prepare for bundled payments, to prepare for really the at-risk models, all the things that are occurring, people are looking for those integrated clinicals and financials. And that's frankly the same thing that's driving the marketplace trend in our own installed base is those organizations want to get prepared for the future and have that sound foundational revenue cycle solutions that matches their clinical systems from an integrated perspective. So that's one of the marketplace elements. Additionally, you have a number of bases that are being sunsetted. So those -- obviously, one large installed base being sunsetted, you've got another installed base that's on a legacy solution and has to be migrated and brought to a current platform. And so those are driving a lot of the kind of the macro level of marketplace trends. And it's pretty logical. As you think, we're in a post ICD-10 era, that there was some pent-up demand for revenue cycle on that side. So I think there is kind of those elements as it relates to that. From our perspective, it's the -- we've invested significantly over the last several years in revenue cycle from a solution and services point of view. And being able to have that demonstration of those -- of that functionality live in our clients, has been very beneficial for us. And that, as we continue to drive across the other continuum of care and our vision of one bill across the continuum of care, I think that is a strong vision that clients are looking for. And as I think, in the future, that, that will work for that. I think the UHS conversation is really --  there has -- they've been a long-term Health Services client. They've been a long-term -- on the financial side. They've been a long-term Cerner client on the clinical side. And so putting those together in that same construct of having strong foundational solutions on a -- from a integrated perspective, acute and ambulatory, as they move forward, is important to their clinical integration strategy. And so -- and then they also have some expertise from a billing perspective that we really like working with those folks. And that's a big positive for our teams as well, because we've done a lot of work on those services and process side. So that -- I feel really good about where we are and the progress we're making in the trend line and trajectory for rev cycle."

And take that buzzword out. You just need to have access to the data of that person and that patient, no matter where they are in the continuum of care. And you got to have the mechanisms to be able to track it moving forward. The more need for data liquidity across the continuum of care, the more need for solutions like HealtheIntent. And so almost every single one of the initiatives has a big value there. There's also a number of state-driven initiatives. So whether it's New York District Program, you look at a number of Medicaid initiatives. We see a big demand in markets where we haven't participated in the past where we see great opportunities for us to participate. So I think the state and local governments will be additional areas of focus for us, and you'll see future announcements in both -- in those areas, and opening up Cerner into markets where we haven't participated in the past. So all of those are big drivers for IT and for both core foundational EMRs, because you have to have the solid, strong foundational plumbing to succeed in the future world. And then you got to have the tools to be able to track the information no matter where they are, whether it's a Cerner EMR, or whether it's claims data, or whether it's PBM data, all those -- whether it's federal database themselves, all that needs to come together into a way which people can track the information no matter where the person goes and really enhance the ability to manage risk in a better way.

Well, we don't make a whole lot money on the hardware, so [indiscernible] yet. That one doesn't hit the revenue. It doesn't really have much of a bottom-line impact. Selling that -- the solutions and third-party software is -- has more margin. So the reality is in this quarter when we were actually below tech resale revenue, we hit our margin number because of the margin we were driving out the third-party software and the higher margins that comes with it. So -- but it's not a growing part of our business, but we expect it to kind of continue to drive out at least that kind of level of revenue. And since it's, for us, the dollars that we get from the people that work on that, that small team are probably the highest dollars we drive that of any associate in the company.

I've got some -- I'm going to get something that I'm actually actively managing in population. It's a small population, I want to see that."" But often it's things such as registries, so just kind of having the diabetic registries. So there'll be small elements, which gets the framework in place, which is really important for us, because it creates that framework upfront, which allows us to add on at a lower cost as we move forward and really scale out. And so often what you'll see is these kind of small pilot and small starters with 1 or 2 solutions and then growing forward. Our existing clients are taking more of the solutions that are generally available. But very similar to this, they're taking a more practical approach to whatever lives that they have at risk or conditions that they want to manage and creating a framework to grow that over time.

Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the call.  I will lead off today with a review of the numbers; Neal Patterson, our President, we'll follow me with a results highlights and marketplace observations; and then Mike Nill, our Chief",1190,"Thank you, Howard. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the call.  I will lead off today with a review of the numbers; Neal Patterson, our President, we'll follow me with a results highlights and marketplace observations; and then Mike Nill, our Chief Operating Officer, will provide some additional highlights. 
Now I will turn to our results, which were solid across all key metrics. Our bookings revenue in Q2 is $1.4 billion, which reflects 9% growth over Q2 of '15. Note that this growth was driven on only 28% of bookings coming from long-term contracts in Q2 of '16 compared to 35% in the year ago quarter. 
Our revenue backlog ended the quarter at $15.0 billion, which is up 13% from $13.3 billion a year ago. Revenue in the quarter was $1.22 billion, which is up 8% over Q2 of '15 and in the middle of our guidance range. The revenue composition for Q2 is $333 million in system sales, $257 million in support and maintenance, $604 million in services and $22 million in reimbursed travel. 
System sales revenue for the quarter was up 6% compared to Q2 of '15 with strong growth in software being partially offset by a decline in hardware. While hardware did decline year-over-year against a tough comparable, it was up sequentially and in line with expected levels. 
Looking at systems sales margins, it was up 150 basis points over last year, reflecting strong software and lower hardware. 
Moving to services. Total services revenue, including professional and managed services, was up 12% compared to Q2 of '15. This is in line with our expectations and continues to reflect good execution via service organizations. Support and maintenance revenue increased 1% over Q2 of '15, reflecting the tough comparable. Support and maintenance is up 5% year-to-date, and we expect similar mid single-digit growth for the rest of the year. 
Looking at revenue by geographic segments, domestic revenue increased 8% over the year ago quarter to $1.073 billion and non-U.S. revenue grew 9% to $143 million. 
Moving to gross margin. Our gross margin for Q2 was 83.1%, which is up from 82.9% in Q2 of '15, reflecting strong software and services and lower hardware. Now I'll discuss spending and operating margin and net earnings. 
For these items, we provide both GAAP and adjusted or non-GAAP results. The adjusted results exclude share-based compensation expense, Health Services related to amortization, acquisition-related deferred revenue and other acquisition-related adjustments, which are detailed and reconciled to GAAP net earnings and our earnings release. 
Looking at operating spending, our second quarter GAAP operating expenses were $769 million compared to $762 million in the year ago period. Adjusted operating expenses were $721 million, which is up 9% compared to Q2 of '15. This growth was primarily driven by growth in personnel expense related to revenue-generating Associates. The total year-over-year change for each expense category in Q2 on an adjusted basis was 13% growth for sales and client service, 2% decline in software development, 6% growth for G&A and amortization of acquisition-related intangibles was down 12%.
Moving to operating margins. Our Q2 GAAP operating margin was 19.8% compared to 15.3% in the year-ago period. Our adjusted operating margin was 23.8% in Q2, which is down slightly from 24.2% in the year-ago period. This is in line with our previous indication that we expect margin expansion to be limited in 2016, but we do continue to believe we can expand margins 50 to 100 basis points annually after 2016.
Moving to net earnings and EPS. Our GAAP net earnings in Q2 were $166 million or $0.48 per diluted share. Adjusted net earnings were $199 million and adjusted diluted EPS was $0.58, which is up 12% compared to Q2 of '15. The Q2 tax rate was 32%, which is in line with our expected range of 32% to 33%. Now I'll move to our balance sheet. 
We ended Q2 with $720 million of total cash and investments, which is up slightly from $707 million in Q1 with most of our free cash flow being used to repurchase shares. During the quarter, we executed $50 million in stock repurchases, buying back 938,000 shares at an average price of $53.30. Year-to-date, we purchased 3.7 million shares at an average price of $53.41 for a total of $200 million out of the $300 million stock repurchase program authorized in March of this year.
Moving to debt. Our total debt, including capital lease obligations, is $585 million, which is down slightly compared to Q1. Total receivables ended the quarter at $983 million, which is up $42 million from Q1. Our Q2 DSO was 74 days, which is an improvement of 2 days compared to Q1 and 7 days better than a year ago.
operating cash flow for the quarter was $255 million, up from $109 million in Q2 of '15 and down from $327 million in Q1. The sequential decline is driven mostly by timing of tax payments and extra payroll in Q2. Year-to-date operating cash flow of $582 million reflects strong growth over $323 million of operating cash flow in the first half of last year.
Q2 capital expenditures were $118 million and capitalized software was $80 million. Free cash flow defined as operating cash flow, less capital purchases and capitalized software development cost, was $57 million for the quarter. This is up compared to negative free cash flow in Q2 of '15 and down from a very strong Q1 in '16, due to the lower operating cash flow and higher capital spending related to construction on our new campus. 
Year-to-date free cash flow of $209 million is in line with our expectations, and we expect solid free cash flow for the rest of the year even with spending on our campus remaining elevated. Next year, we expect a decline in capital expenditures resulting in a stronger free cash flow. Now I'll go through Q3 and full year 2016 guidance.
For Q3, we expect revenue between $1.2 billion and $1.275 billion with a mid-point reflecting growth of 10% over Q3 of '15. For the full year, we expect revenue between $4.9 billion and $5.0 billion. This range reflect the tightening of our previous range, mostly to capture the lower hardware revenue in the first half of the year, but still 12% full year growth at the mid-point. We expect Q3 diluted EPS to be $0.59 to $0.61 per share with the mid-point reflecting 11% growth over Q3 of '15.
For the full year, we continue to expect adjusted diluted EPS to be $2.30 to $2.40 with a mid-point reflecting 11% growth over 2015. Moving to bookings guidance, we expect bookings revenue in Q3 of $1.45 billion to $1.6 billion. The mid-point reflects a slight decline from Q3 '15, which was 44% higher than Q3 of '14, is by far the turn comparable period from last year.
The mid-point was still put year-to-date bookings above 2015, and we expect growth in Q4 as well. So we are still on track for our stated goal of 4 year growth of it was a very short 2015. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Zane."

Our bookings were a record for Q2 and only second to our all-time high bookings of Q3 2015. As Marc indicated, our total bookings grew 9% despite lower contributions from long-term bookings than last year. The 28% of Q2 2016 bookings from long-term reflects contributions from both ITWorks and managed services, but were still below the elevated level of 35% in Q2 of 2015. The non long-term portion of Q2 2016 bookings grew 20%, reflecting strong levels of solution and services sales, both into our base and to new clients. Bookings this quarter included several large contracts with 45 contracts over $5 million, including 28 over $10 million.
34% of bookings this quarter came from outside our $4 million install base. This high level of new business is a result of an active replacement market, an ongoing success against our primary competitor. The keys to our success continued to be our improved solutions, delivery capabilities, lower cost of ownership, ability to deliver value and our population health and open platform capabilities. I believe that compared favorably to our primary competitor in all of these areas and this is reflected in our run rate. 
Overall, I believe Cerner is viewed as a safe just bank resolution needs, as well as best part to help clients achieve value from their investments and position of them for success as the market shares from a focus on care to a focus on health and wellness.
A good example to opportunity in the marketplace and our competitiveness was Covenant Health selecting Cerner, which we announced last week. Covenant health is 1,900 bed health system based in Eastern Tennessee with 10 hospitals and nearly 100 and with 20 [ph] facilities. They will be deploying Cerner Millennium EHR and clinically driven revenue type of solutions, as well as the HealtheIntent population health solutions across all venues of care. Cerner's integrated solutions across clinical and revenue cycle and acute and ambulatory, proven ability to deliver value and predictable cost and our population health care capabilities were important differentiators for us when competing for this business.
Looking ahead, we believe the replacement market will remain active, given the high number of hospitals on legacy platforms, many of which are being sunsetted. These opportunities reflecting our leading indicators with our new business pipeline and sales activity at all-time highs. 
Now I'll discuss revenue cycle. We had another great quarter, all new EHR clients included revenue cycles as part of their purchase, reflecting continued focus by the market on clinically driven revenue cycle. This preference is also reflected an ongoing success in our installed base with several more large clients choosing Cerner for acute revenue cycle and a military business office services. 
In addition to a very strong quarter, we also made a great addition to our executive team. As we announced in July, Jeff Hurst will be joining Cerner on September 1 as Senior Vice President of Cerner Revenues Stock of Management and President of Cerner RevWorks. This is a new position and the existing revenue cycle on RevWorks will report to Jeff. Jeff comes with us from Florida Hospital of 2,700 bed acute care medical facility and was a member of the Adventus health System, where he directed all financial and clinical revenue cycle functions and had a responsibility for key organizational strategies. He is respected industry thought leader and proven executive, and he brings an important provider perspective to Cerner.
As you know, we have made significant investments in revenue cycle that have led to very strong growth in recent years. Our hiring Jeff is an indication that we believe we are still in the early stages of a significant growth opportunity as we help our clients navigate the rapidly evolving reimbursement landscape and that we're investing in talent that will help us capitalize on opportunity and to contribute to the success of our clients.
Now I'll shift to discussing our population health business, where we had a great quarter. We added several new clients to the HealtheIntent platform, and we also expanded the scope of population health solutions at some of our largest existing clients. Our comprehensive approach to population health remains differentiated in the marketplace, and we continue to add solutions to the HealtheIntent platform. I believe will continue displaced numeration niche offerings because of the power of the platform and the ability to integrate with the EHR workflow. 
The volume clients that have purchased initial solutions and our HealtheIntent platform is impressive. We recently passed the 100 client milestone. We believe this positions us for a significant ramp in revenue in the coming years as these clients add more solutions and lives to the platform, which will increase the firm member per month rate number of members. We expect to driver of this to been growing shifts and reimbursement that are leading to more risk assumption by our clients. And we believe to shift away from traditional fee-for-service is gaining momentum. With the Medicare access and ship reutilization act or MACRA and the new merit based incentive payment systems, ramping and coming years as CMS continues to focus on value and quality payments.
Moving to the ample market, where we had record results with strengthened ambulatory EHR, practice management and business office services. Similar to recent quarters, our results include some of the largest acute care clients choosing Cerner's clinical and revenue cycle solutions for their ambulatory settings. 
We also had a strong quarter in the small hospital market. Our cloud based community works offering continues to be competitive at once small hospital vendors. A recent noteworthy win for community works was the displacement of a failed attempted go live by a cloud-based vendor that has been making a push in recent years to expand from ambulatory market to hospitals. We have several active opportunities displaced the same competitor in both ambulatory and small hospital settings, suggesting their approach is spending about 3x as much on sales and marketing as they do on research and development may not be the most effective approach for their clients.
Outside the U.S, despite some macroeconomic headwinds, we had a good quarter. Non-U.S. revenue grew 9% year-over-year with noteworthy areas of strength, including Australia, Germany and the Middle East. As Mike will discuss, the Middle East strength included CommunityWorks, which is a positive sign as it highlights a largely untapped global opportunity for ITWorks. 
In summary, I'd please with our execution in Q2 and believe we are well positioned to have a good second half for the year. With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike."

Today, I'm going to discuss ITWorks and Cerner's model experience initiative. I'll start with ITWorks. We had a good quarter with 1 new ITWorks client, a large expansion within existing client and a very strong sales back into our client base. Regarding our new client, this quite is not only new to ITWorks, but they are in new EHR client as well. And the EHR win displaces our primary competitor. 
The client is a new Children's Hospital in Dubai, and we scheduled to implement our primary competitor solution, but concluded Cerner is a better choice to meet their needs. Our ability to work quickly in order to enable them to be ready for the hospital schedule opening date, as well as provide full IT services through ITWorks, were both the key factors in us being selected. In addition, the success we've had with another client in the region was a very helpful and illustrating the value of the ITWorks model, something our competitor does not offer.
Looking ahead, our pipeline for ITWorks is significant and include some very large clients. While the timing of ITWorks deals has been lumpy and will likely continue to be, we're confident that we remain a strong contributor to our growth. The value proposition to our clients is very appealing, especially in an environment where they have pressure on operating cost, limited access to IT talent and increasing pressure in light of the industry issues related to security.
Now I'd like to briefly discuss an initiative we call model experience. The model experience is an extension of the model system, which we have discussed in the past. The Model Experience represents a meaningful shift in our approach to implement our solutions, workflows and standards at our client sites. It presents all of Cerner's standards and content within a controlled environment, where the best practice from workflows and the latest capabilities are captured. NH client systems can be optimized based upon their specific needs. The model experience goes beyond just focusing on the EHR. It also provides clients optimal recommendations for leveraging HealtheIntent, Millennium and careware solutions.
In addition, model experience uses a continued investment approach for adopting recommendations, which ensures our clients will continuously will be able to maximize the value of our solutions.
In summary, I believe the model experience positions us well for our clients to achieve value from the existing environments and keep up with the rapidly evolving health care landscape. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to questions."

Health care is complex the matter how small the organization is. And so having the depth of a Millennium and Cerner full functioning system, our ability to deliver in a cloud-based environment, which allows us to have a lower total cost to ownership and a very fixed and predictable model, is very appealing because they need the full functional solutions sets to be -- able to be delivered in a cost-effective manner.

I think that's still our expectations as we roll through. Obviously, to the extent that we increase our higher-margin elements of the business, software, et cetera, there's a chance to increase the operating margins. But I think, overall, given the mix we have, which feels like pretty good mix between services, software and the rest of our business, I don't know that we're going to have a big change in 2016 relative to margin expansion. I feel very good as we roll into '17 you'll start to see us get back on a track of 50 to 100 basis point of margin expansion that you've seen us historically been able to do. But that's, right now, our view as we look out in the second half of the year, given our guidance for Q3, I think would be relatively flat year-over-year as we continue to see basically low double-digit revenue growth."

I think even in our businesses, as we do the business model slight every year, you see slight increases in conservation margins from a share of those. So if you really just look at our size and the expense components, if you grow R&D's lower than revenue and you grow SG&A slower than revenue, it gives you 50 to 100 basis points.

Keep in mind, certainly, when we bought them and closed, they already a small group of clients that have decided and notified Siemens that they were leading the fold. Every one of those is still writing me their monthly check or others made their monthly check for their contract duration, which can extend from anywhere from 3 to 5 more years. So the impact of a client's making decision to leave actually tails off -- has a very long tail to it. So from our business small perspective and certainly, in the near-term that we've been working through, the synergies primarily as we talked about were costs related. And I think we've done a very good job of delivering on those cost synergies. So I think, overall, if you look at the, kind of the bottom line of HS, we are ahead relative to an OE, slightly ahead of where we would have modeled ourselves. I think we're slightly ahead of where we would have expected from a retention standpoint. So today, we're actually very pleased with how it's modeling out and how these clients are starting to really get into the Cerner mode and see us as their provider moving their allegiance over from the HS book.

Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the call.  I will lead off today with a review of the numbers; Zane Burke, our President, we'll follow me with a results highlights and marketplace observations; and then Mike Nill, our Chief Ope",1191,"Thank you, Howard. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the call.  I will lead off today with a review of the numbers; Zane Burke, our President, we'll follow me with a results highlights and marketplace observations; and then Mike Nill, our Chief Operating Officer will provide some additional highlights. 
Now I will turn to our results, which were solid across all key metrics. Our bookings revenue in Q2 is $1.4 billion, which reflects 9% growth over Q2 of '15. Note that this growth was driven on only 28% of bookings coming from long-term contracts in Q2 of '16 compared to 35% in the year ago quarter. 
Our revenue backlog ended the quarter at $15.0 billion, which is up 13% from $13.3 billion a year ago. Revenue in the quarter was $1.22 billion, which is up 8% over Q2 of '15 and in the middle of our guidance range. The revenue composition for Q2 is $333 million in system sales, $257 million in support and maintenance, $604 million in services and $22 million in reimbursed travel. 
System sales revenue for the quarter was up 6% compared to Q2 of '15 with strong growth in software being partially offset by a decline in hardware. While hardware did decline year-over-year against a tough comparable, it was up sequentially and in line with expected levels. 
Looking at systems sales margins, it was up 150 basis points over last year, reflecting strong software and lower hardware. 
Moving to services. Total services revenue, including professional and managed services, was up 12% compared to Q2 of '15. This is in line with our expectations and continues to reflect good execution via service organizations. Support and maintenance revenue increased 1% over Q2 of '15 reflecting the tough comparable. Support and maintenance is up 5% year-to-date, and we expect similar mid single-digit growth for the rest of the year. 
Looking at revenue by geographic segments, domestic revenue increased 8% over the year-ago quarter to $1.073 billion and non-U.S. revenue grew 9% to $143 million. 
Moving to gross margin. Our gross margin for Q2 was 83.1%, which is up from 82.9% in Q2 of '15, reflecting strong software and services and lower hardware. Now I'll discuss spending and operating margin and net earnings. 
For these items, we provide both GAAP and adjusted or non-GAAP results. The adjusted results exclude share-based compensation expense, Health Services related to amortization, acquisition-related deferred revenue and other acquisition-related adjustments, which are detailed and reconciled to GAAP net earnings in our earnings release. 
Looking at operating spending, our second quarter GAAP operating expenses were $769 million compared to $762 million in the year ago period. Adjusted operating expenses were $721 million which is up 9% compared to Q2 of '15. This growth was primarily driven by growth in personnel expense related to revenue-generating associates. The total year-over-year change for each expense category in Q2 on an adjusted basis was 13% growth for sales and client service, 2% decline in software development, 6% growth for G&A and amortization of acquisition-related intangibles was down 12%.
Moving to operating margins. Our Q2 GAAP operating margin was 19.8% compared to 15.3% in the year-ago period. Our adjusted operating margin was 23.8% in Q2, which is down slightly from 24.2% in the year-ago period. This is in line with our previous indication that we expect margin expansion to be limited in 2016, but we do continue to believe we can expand margins 50 to 100 basis points annually after 2016.
Moving to net earnings and EPS. Our GAAP net earnings in Q2 were $166 million or $0.48 per diluted share. Adjusted net earnings were $199 million and adjusted diluted EPS was $0.58, which is up 12% compared to Q2 of '15. The Q2 tax rate was 32%, which is in line with our expected range of 32% to 33%. 
Now I'll move to our balance sheet.  We ended Q2 with $720 million of total cash and investments, which is up slightly from $707 million in Q1 with most of our free cash flow being used to repurchase shares. During the quarter, we executed $50 million in stock repurchases, buying back 938,000 shares at an average price of $53.30. Year-to-date, we purchased 3.7 million shares at an average price of $53.41 for a total of $200 million out of the $300 million stock repurchase program authorized in March of this year.
Moving to debt. Our total debt, including capital lease obligations is $585 million, which is down slightly compared to Q1. Total receivables ended the quarter at $983 million, which is up $42 million from Q1. Our Q2 DSO was 74 days, which is an improvement of 2 days compared to Q1 and 7 days better than a year ago.  Operating cash flow for the quarter was $255 million up from $109 million in Q2 of '15 and down from $327 million in Q1. The sequential decline is driven mostly by timing of tax payments and extra payroll in Q2. Year-to-date operating cash flow of $582 million reflects strong growth over $323 million of operating cash flow in the first half of last year.
Q2 capital expenditures were $118 million and capitalized software was $80 million. Free cash flow defined as operating cash flow less capital purchases and capitalized software development cost, was $57 million for the quarter. This is up compared to negative free cash flow in Q2 of '15 and down from a very strong Q1 in '16, due to the lower operating cash flow and higher capital spending related to construction on our new campus. 
Year-to-date free cash flow of $209 million is in line with our expectations, and we expect solid free cash flow for the rest of the year even with spending on our campus remaining elevated. Next year, we expect a decline in capital expenditures resulting in a stronger free cash flow. 
Now I'll go through Q3 and full year 2016 guidance.  For Q3, we expect revenue between $1.2 billion and $1.275 billion with a mid-point reflecting growth of 10% over Q3 of '15. For the full year, we expect revenue between $4.9 billion and $5.0 billion. This range reflects the tightening of our previous range, mostly to capture the lower hardware revenue in the first half of the year, but still 12% full year growth at the mid-point. We expect Q3 diluted EPS to be $0.59 to $0.61 per share with the mid-point reflecting 11% growth over Q3 of '15.
For the full year, we continue to expect adjusted diluted EPS to be $2.30 to $2.40 with a mid-point reflecting 11% growth over 2015. 
Moving to bookings guidance. We expect bookings revenue in Q3 of $1.45 billion to $1.6 billion. The mid-point reflects a slight decline from Q3 '15, which was 44% higher than Q3 of '14, and is by far the toughest comparable period from last year.
The mid-point will still put the year-to-date bookings above 2015, and we expect growth in Q4 as well. So we are still on track for our stated goal of 4 year growth over what was a very strong 2015. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Zane."

Today, I'll provide color on our results and make some marketplace observations. Our bookings were a record for Q2 and only second to our all-time high bookings of Q3 2015. As Marc indicated, our total bookings grew",1119,"Thanks, Marc. Good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'll provide color on our results and make some marketplace observations. Our bookings were a record for Q2 and only second to our all-time high bookings of Q3 2015. As Marc indicated, our total bookings grew 9% despite lower contributions from long-term bookings than last year. The 28% of Q2 2016 bookings from long-term reflects contributions from both ITWorks and managed services, but we're still below the elevated level of 35% in Q2 of 2015. The non long-term portion of Q2 2016 bookings grew 20%, reflecting strong levels of solution and services sales both into our base and to new clients. Bookings this quarter included several large contracts with 45 contracts over $5 million, including 28 over $10 million.
34% of bookings this quarter came from outside our $4 million install base. This high level of new business is a result of an active replacement market, an ongoing success against our primary competitor. The keys to our success continued to be our improved solutions, predictable delivery capabilities, lower cost of ownership, ability to deliver value and our population health and open platform capabilities. I believe that compared favorably to our primary competitor in all of these areas and this is reflected in our run rate. 
Overall, I believe Cerner is viewed as a safe choice for our current solution needs as well as best which is required [ph]  To help clients achieve value from their investments and position them for success as the market shares from a focus on care to a focus on health and wellness.
A good example to opportunity in the marketplace and our competitiveness was Covenant Health selecting Cerner, which we announced last week. Covenant health is 1,900 bed health system based in Eastern Tennessee with 10 hospitals and nearly 100 ambulatory facilities. They will be deploying Cerner Millennium EHR and clinically driven revenue cycle solutions, as well as the HealtheIntent population health solutions across all venues of care. Cerner's integrated solutions across clinical and revenue cycle and acute and ambulatory, proven ability to deliver value and predictable cost and our population health care capabilities were important differentiators for us when competing for this business.
Looking ahead, we believe the replacement market will remain active, given the high number of hospitals on legacy platforms, many of which are being sunset. These opportunities reflected in our leading indicators with the new business pipeline and sales activity at all-time highs. 
Now I'll discuss revenue cycle. We had another great quarter. All new EHR clients included revenue cycles as part of their purchase, reflecting continued focus by the market on clinically driven revenue cycle. This preference is also reflected an ongoing success in our installed base with several more large clients choosing Cerner for acute revenue cycle and a military business office services. 
In addition to a very strong quarter, we also made a great addition to our executive team. As we announced in July, Jeff Hurst will be joining Cerner on September 1 as Senior Vice President of Cerner revenue cycle management and President of Cerner RevWorks. This is a new position and the existing revenue cycle and RevWorks will report to Jeff. Jeff comes with us from Florida Hospital of 2,700 bed acute care medical facility and was a member of the Adventist  health System, where he directed all financial and clinical revenue cycle functions and had a responsibility for key organizational strategies. He is respected industry thought leader and proven executive, and he brings an important provider perspective to Cerner.
As you know, we have made significant investments in revenue cycle that have led to very strong growth in recent years. Our hiring Jeff is an indication that we believe we are still in the early stages of a significant growth opportunity as we help our clients navigate the rapidly evolving reimbursement landscape and that we're investing in talent that will help us capitalize on this opportunity and to contribute to the success of our clients.
Now I'll shift to discussing our population health business, where we had a great quarter. We added several new clients to the HealtheIntent platform, and we also expanded the scope of population health solutions at some of our largest existing clients. Our comprehensive approach to population health remains differentiated in the marketplace, and we continue to add solutions to the HealtheIntent platform. I believe we will continue displaced numerous niche offerings because of the power of the platform and the ability to integrate with the EHR workflow. 
The volume of clients that have purchased initial solutions on our HealtheIntent platform is impressive. We recently passed the 100 client milestone. We believe this positions us for a significant ramp in the revenue in the coming years as these clients add more solutions and lives to the platform, which will increase the per member per month rate and number of members. We expect the driver of this to be ongoing shifts in the reimbursement that are leading to more risk assumption by our clients. And we believe the shift away from traditional fee-for-service is gaining momentum. With the Medicare access and CHIP reauthorization act or MACRA and the new merit based incentive payment systems ramping in coming years as CMS continues to focus on value and quality payments.
Moving to the ambulatory market, where we had record results with strengthened ambulatory EHR, practice management and business office services. Similar to recent quarters, our results include some of the largest acute care clients choosing Cerner's clinical and revenue cycle solutions for their ambulatory settings. 
We also had a strong quarter in the small hospital market. Our cloud-based CommunityWorks offering continues to be competitive against all-niche small hospital vendors. A recent noteworthy win for CommunityWorks was the displacement of a failed attempted go live by a cloud-based vendor that has been making a push in recent years to expand from ambulatory market to hospitals. We have several active opportunities despite the same competitor in both ambulatory and small hospital settings, suggesting their approach is spending about 3x as much on sales and marketing as they do on research and development may not be the most effective approach for the clients.
Outside the U.S., despite some macroeconomic headwinds, we had a good quarter. Non-U.S. revenue grew 9% year-over-year with noteworthy areas of strength, including Australia, Germany and the Middle East. As Mike will discuss, the Middle East strength included ITWorks, which is a positive sign as it highlights a largely untapped global opportunity for ITWorks. 
In summary, I'm please with our execution in Q2 and believe we are well positioned to have a good second half for the year. With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike."

Today, I'm going to discuss ITWorks and Cerner's model experience initiative. I'll start with ITWorks. We had a good quarter with 1 new ITWorks client, a large expansion within existing client and a very strong sales back into our client base. Regarding our new client, this client is not only new to ITWorks, but they are a new EHR client as well. And the EHR win displaces our primary competitor. 
The client is a New Children's Hospital in Dubai, and we scheduled to implement our primary competitor solution, but concluded Cerner is a better choice to meet their needs. Our ability to work quickly in order to enable them to be ready for the hospital schedule opening date, as well as provide full IT services through ITWorks, were both the key factors in us being selected. In addition, the success we've had with another client in the region was very helpful in demonstrating the value of the ITWorks model, something our competitor does not offer.
Looking ahead, our pipeline for ITWorks is significant and includes some very large clients. While the timing of ITWorks deals has been lumpy and will likely continue to be, we're confident it will remain a strong contributor to our growth. The value proposition to our clients is very appealing, especially in an environment where they have pressure on operating cost, limited access to IT talent and increasing pressure in light of the industry issues related to security.
Now I'd like to briefly discuss an initiative we call Model Experience. The Model Experience is an extension of the model system, which we have discussed in the past. The Model Experience represents a meaningful shift in our approach to implement our solutions, workflows and standards at our client sites. It presents all of Cerner's standards and content within a controlled environment, where the best practice from workflows and the latest capabilities are captured. Then each client system can be optimized based upon their specific needs. The Model Experience goes beyond just focusing on the EHR. It also provides clients optimal recommendations for leveraging HealtheIntent, Millennium and CareAware solutions.
In addition, the Model Experience uses a continuous advancement approach for adopting recommendations, which ensures our clients will continuously be able to maximize the value of our solutions.
In summary, I believe the Model Experience positions us well for our clients to achieve value from the existing advancements and keep up with the rapidly evolving health care landscape. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to questions."

Health care is complex no matter how small the organization is.

Obviously, to the extent that we increase our higher-margin elements of the business, software, et cetera, there's a chance to increase the operating margins.

Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the call.  I will lead off today with a review of the numbers; Zane Burke, our President, will follow me with results highlights and marketplace observations; and then Mike Nill, our Chief Operat",1189,"Thank you, Howard. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the call.  I will lead off today with a review of the numbers; Zane Burke, our President, will follow me with results highlights and marketplace observations; and then Mike Nill, our Chief Operating Officer will provide some additional highlights. 
Now I will turn to our results, which were solid across all key metrics. Our bookings revenue in Q2 is $1.4 billion, which reflects 9% growth over Q2 of '15. Note that this growth was driven on only 28% of bookings coming from long-term contracts in Q2 of '16 compared to 35% in the year-ago quarter. 
Our revenue backlog ended the quarter at $15.0 billion, which is up 13% from $13.3 billion a year ago. Revenue in the quarter was $1.22 billion, which is up 8% over Q2 of '15 and in the middle of our guidance range. The revenue composition for Q2 is $333 million in system sales, $257 million in support and maintenance, $604 million in services and $22 million in reimbursed travel. 
System sales revenue for the quarter was up 6% compared to Q2 of '15 with strong growth in software being partially offset by a decline in hardware. While hardware did decline year-over-year against a tough comparable, it was up sequentially and in line with expected levels. 
Looking at systems sales margins, it was up 150 basis points over last year, reflecting strong software and lower hardware. 
Moving to services. Total services revenue, including professional and managed services, was up 12% compared to Q2 of '15. This is in line with our expectation and continues to reflect good execution via service organizations. Support and maintenance revenue increased 1% over Q2 of '15 reflecting the tough comparable. Support and maintenance is up 5% year-to-date, and we expect similar mid-single-digit growth for the rest of the year. 
Looking at revenue by geographic segments. Domestic revenue increased 8% over the year-ago quarter to $1.073 billion and non-U.S. revenue grew 9% to $143 million. 
Moving to gross margin. Our gross margin for Q2 was 83.1%, which is up from 82.9% in Q2 of '15, reflecting strong software and services and lower hardware. 
Now I'll discuss spending and operating margin and net earnings. For these items, we provide both GAAP and adjusted or non-GAAP results. The adjusted results exclude share-based compensation expense, Health Services related to amortization, acquisition-related deferred revenue and other acquisition-related adjustments, which are detailed and reconciled to GAAP net earnings in our earnings release. 
Looking at operating spending, our second quarter GAAP operating expenses were $769 million compared to $762 million in the year-ago period. Adjusted operating expenses were $721 million which is up 9% compared to Q2 of '15. This growth was primarily driven by growth in personnel expense related to revenue-generating associates. The total year-over-year change for each expense category in Q2 on an adjusted basis was 13% growth for sales and client service, 2% decline in software development, 6% growth for G&A and amortization of acquisition-related intangibles was down 12%.
Moving to operating margins. Our Q2 GAAP operating margin was 19.8% compared to 15.3% in the year-ago period. Our adjusted operating margin was 23.8% in Q2, which is down slightly from 24.2% in the year-ago period. This is in line with our previous indication that we expect margin expansion to be limited in 2016, but we do continue to believe we can expand margins 50 to 100 basis points annually after 2016.
Moving to net earnings and EPS. Our GAAP net earnings in Q2 were $166 million or $0.48 per diluted share. Adjusted net earnings were $199 million and adjusted diluted EPS was $0.58, which is up 12% compared to Q2 of '15. 
The Q2 tax rate was 32%, which is in line with our expected range of 32% to 33%. 
Now I'll move to our balance sheet.  We ended Q2 with $720 million of total cash and investments, which is up slightly from $707 million in Q1 with most of our free cash flow being used to repurchase shares. During the quarter, we executed $50 million in stock repurchases, buying back 938,000 shares at an average price of $53.30. Year-to-date, we have purchased 3.7 million shares at an average price of $53.41 for a total of $200 million out of the $300 million stock repurchase program authorized in March of this year.
Moving to debt. Our total debt, including capital lease obligations is $585 million, which is down slightly compared to Q1. Total receivables ended the quarter at $983 million, which is up $42 million from Q1. Our Q2 DSO was 74 days, which is an improvement of 2 days compared to Q1 and 7 days better than a year ago. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $255 million up from $109 million in Q2 of '15 and down from $327 million in Q1. The sequential decline is driven mostly by timing of tax payments and extra payroll in Q2. Year-to-date operating cash flow of $582 million reflects strong growth over $323 million of operating cash flow in the first half of last year.
Q2 capital expenditures were $118 million and capitalized software was $80 million. Free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less capital purchases and capitalized software development costs, was $57 million for the quarter. This is up compared to negative free cash flow in Q2 of '15 and down from a very strong Q1 in '16, due to the lower operating cash flow and higher capital spending related to construction on our new campus. 
Year-to-date free cash flow of $209 million is in line with our expectations, and we expect solid free cash flow for the rest of the year even with spending on our campus remaining elevated. Next year, we expect a decline in capital expenditures resulting in a stronger free cash flow. 
Now I'll go through Q3 and full year 2016 guidance. For Q3, we expect revenue between $1.2 billion and $1.275 billion with the mid-point reflecting growth of 10% over Q3 of '15. For the full year, we expect revenue between $4.9 billion and $5.0 billion. This range reflects the tightening of our previous range, mostly to capture the lower hardware revenue in the first half of the year, but is still 12% full year growth at the mid-point. We expect Q3 diluted EPS to be $0.59 to $0.61 per share with the mid-point reflecting 11% growth over Q3 of '15.
For the full year, we continue to expect adjusted diluted EPS to be $2.30 to $2.40 with the mid-point reflecting 11% growth over 2015. 
Moving to bookings guidance. We expect bookings revenue in Q3 of $1.45 billion to $1.6 billion. The mid-point reflects a slight decline from Q3 '15, which was 44% higher than Q3 of '14, and is by far the toughest comparable period from last year.
The mid-point will still put the year-to-date bookings above 2015, and we expect growth in Q4 as well. So we are still on track for our stated goal of full year growth over what was a very strong 2015. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Zane."

Today, I'll provide color on our results and make some marketplace observations. Our bookings were a record for Q2 and only second to our all-time high bookings of Q3 2015. As Marc indicated, our total bookings grew",1123,"Thanks, Marc. Good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'll provide color on our results and make some marketplace observations. Our bookings were a record for Q2 and only second to our all-time high bookings of Q3 2015. As Marc indicated, our total bookings grew 9% despite lower contributions from long-term bookings than last year. The 28% of Q2 2016 bookings from long term reflects contributions from both ITWorks and managed services, but were still below the elevated level of 35% in Q2 of 2015. The non-long term portion of Q2 2016 bookings grew 20%, reflecting strong levels of solution and services sales both into our base and to new clients. 
Bookings this quarter included several large contracts with 45 contracts over $5 million, including 28 over $10 million. 34% of bookings this quarter came from outside our $4 million install base. This high level of new business is a result of an active replacement market and ongoing success against our primary competitor. The keys to our success continue to be our improved solutions, predictable delivery capabilities, lower cost of ownership, ability to deliver value and our population health and open platform capabilities. I believe we compare favorably to our primary competitor in all of these areas and this is reflected in our run rate. 
Overall, I believe Cerner is viewed as the safe choice for our current solution needs, as well as best positioned supplier to help clients achieve value from their investments and position them for success as the market shifts from a focus on care to a focus on health and wellness.
A good example of the opportunity in the marketplace and our competitiveness was Covenant Health selecting Cerner, which we announced last week. Covenant Health is a 1,900 bed health system based in Eastern Tennessee, with 10 hospitals and nearly 100 ambulatory facilities. They will be deploying Cerner Millennium EHR and clinically driven revenue cycle solutions, as well as the HealtheIntent population health solutions across all venues of care. Cerner's integrated solutions across clinical and revenue cycle and acute and ambulatory, proven ability to deliver value at a predictable cost and our population health care capabilities were important differentiators for us when competing for this business.
Looking ahead, we believe the replacement market will remain active, given the high number of hospitals on legacy platforms, many of which are being sunset. This opportunity is reflected in our leading indicators with our new business pipeline and sales activities at all-time highs. 
Now I'll discuss revenue cycle. We had another great quarter. All new EHR clients included revenue cycle as part of their purchase, reflecting continued focus by the market on clinically driven revenue cycle. This preference was also reflected in ongoing success in our installed base with several more large clients choosing Cerner for acute revenue cycle and a military business office services. 
In addition to a very strong quarter, we also made a great addition to our executive team. As we announced in July, Jeff Hurst will be joining Cerner on September 1 as Senior Vice President of Cerner revenue cycle management and President of Cerner RevWorks. This is a new position and the existing revenue cycle and RevWorks teams will report to Jeff. Jeff comes to us from Florida Hospital, a 2,700 bed acute care medical facility that is a member of the Adventist Health System, where he directed all financial and clinical revenue cycle functions and had a responsibility for key organizational strategies. He is respected industry thought leader and a proven executive, and he brings an important provider perspective to Cerner.
As you know, we have made significant investments in revenue cycle that have led to very strong growth in recent years. Our hiring of Jeff is an indication that we believe we are still in the early stages of a significant growth opportunity as we help our clients navigate the rapidly evolving reimbursement landscape and that we're investing in talent that will help us capitalize on this opportunity and to contribute to the success of our clients.
Now I'll shift to discussing our population health business, where we had a great quarter. We added several new clients to the HealtheIntent platform, and we also expanded the scope of population health solutions at some of our largest existing clients. Our comprehensive approach to population health remains differentiated in the marketplace, and we continue to add solutions to the HealtheIntent platform. I believe we'll continue displaced numerous niche offerings because of the power of the platform and the ability to integrate with the EHR workflow. 
The volume of clients that have purchased initial solutions on our HealtheIntent platform is impressive. We recently passed the 100 client milestone. We believe this positions us for a significant ramp in the revenue in the coming years as these clients add more solutions and lives to the platform, which will increase the per member per month rate and number of members. We expect the driver of this to be ongoing shifts in reimbursement that are leading to more risk assumption by our clients. And we believe the shift away from traditional fee-for-service is gaining momentum with the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act or MACRA and the new merit-based incentive payment systems ramping in coming years as CMS continues to focus on value and quality payments.
Moving to the ambulatory market, where we had record results with strengthened ambulatory EHR, practice management and business office services. Similar to the recent quarters, our results include some of the largest acute care clients choosing Cerner's clinical and revenue cycle solutions for their ambulatory settings. 
We also had a strong quarter in the small hospital market. Our cloud-based CommunityWorks offering continues to be competitive against all-niche small hospital vendors. A recent noteworthy win for CommunityWorks was the displacement of a failed attempted go live by a cloud-based vendor that has been making a push in recent years to expand from ambulatory market to hospitals. We have several active opportunities displace the same competitor in both ambulatory and small hospital settings, suggesting their approach of spending about 3x as much on sales and marketing as they do on research and development may not be the most effective approach for the client.
Outside the U.S., despite some macroeconomic headwinds, we had a good quarter. Non-U.S. revenue grew 9% year-over-year with noteworthy areas of strength, including Australia, Germany and the Middle East. As Mike will discuss, the Middle East strength included ITWorks, which is a positive sign as it highlights a largely untapped global opportunity for ITWorks. 
In summary, I'm pleased with our execution in Q2 and believe we are well positioned to have a good second half for the year. With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike."

Today, I'm going to discuss ITWorks and Cerner's model experience initiative. I'll start with ITWorks. We had a good quarter with 1 new ITWorks client, a large expansion with an existing client and a very strong sales back into our client base. Regarding our new client, this client is not only new to ITWorks, but they are a new EHR client as well. And the EHR win displaces our primary competitor. 
The client is the new children's hospital in Dubai, and was scheduled to implement our primary competitor's solution, but concluded Cerner is a better choice to meet their needs. Our ability to work quickly in order to enable them to be ready for the hospital schedule opening date, as well as provide full IT services through ITWorks, were both key factors in us being selected. In addition, the success we've had with another client in the region was very helpful in demonstrating the value of the ITWorks model, something our competitor does not offer.
Looking ahead, our pipeline for ITWorks is significant and includes some very large clients. While the timing of ITWorks deals has been lumpy and will likely continue to be, we're confident it will remain a strong contributor to our growth. The value proposition to our clients is very appealing, especially in an environment where they have pressure on operating cost, limited access to IT talent and increasing pressure in light of the industry issues related to security.
Now I'd like to briefly discuss an initiative we call Model Experience. The Model Experience is an extension of the model system, which we have discussed in the past. The Model Experience represents a meaningful shift in our approach to implement our solutions, workflows and standards at our client sites. It presents all of Cerner's standards and content within a controlled environment, where the best practice for workflows and the latest capabilities are captured, then each client system can be optimized based upon their specific needs. The Model Experience goes beyond just focusing on the EHR. It also provides clients optimal recommendations for leveraging HealtheIntent, Millennium and CareAware solutions.
In addition, the Model Experience uses a continuous advancement approach for adopting recommendations, which ensures our clients will continuously be able to maximize the value of our solutions.
In summary, I believe the Model Experience positions us well for our clients to achieve value from their existing investments and keep up with the rapidly evolving health care landscape. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to questions."

I think the key thing relative to the revenue guidance was taking out kind of the hardware component, the lower hardware that we'd seen earlier in the year, and then flowing that through the rest. And that's why we took the higher end off the revenue. I think as we roll forward, we still have a year where we expect that our margins to be relatively flat year-over-year, and I think that's kind of what we're seeing and what we're delivering. I think that's still our expectations as we roll through. Obviously, to the extent that we increase our higher-margin elements of the business, software, et cetera, there's a chance to increase the operating margins. But I think, overall, given the mix we have, which feels like a pretty good mix between services, software and the rest of our business, I don't know that we're going to have a big change in 2016 relative to margin expansion. I feel very good as we roll into '17, you'll start to see us get back on a track of the 50 to 100 basis points of margin expansion that you've seen us historically be able to do. But that's, right now, our view as we look out at the second half of the year, given our guidance for Q3, I think would be relatively flat year-over-year as we continue to see basically low double-digit revenue growth."

If hardware continues to be at the current level, once we get through, that's assuming we can continue to grow the margin as double digit, which we expect to do, that should improve the overall margins. Historically, you've seen us leverage our spend. You've seen us leverage R&D, growth relative to revenue growth. And those are kind of the drivers that will kind of kick in that you've seen traditionally from -- for us that are driving some of that growth. I think even in our businesses as we do the business model slide every year, you see slight increases in contribution margins from each of those. So if you really just look at our size and the expense components, if you grow R&D slower than revenue and you grow SG&A slower than revenue, it gives you 50 to 100 basis points.

Well, keep in mind that, certainly, when we bought them and closed, they were already a small group of clients that had decided and notified Siemens that they were leaving the fold. Every one of those is still writing me their monthly check or owes me their monthly check for their contract duration, which can extend from anywhere from 3 to 5 more years. So the impact of a client making the decision to leave actually tails off -- has a very long tail to it. So from a -- from our business model perspective and certainly, in the nearer term that we've been working through, the synergies, primarily as we talked about, were cost related. And I think we've done a very good job of delivering on those cost synergies. So I think, overall, if you look at the kind of the bottom line of HS, we are ahead relative to an OE, slightly ahead of where we would have modeled ourselves. I think we're slightly ahead of where we would have expected from a retention standpoint. So today, we're actually very pleased at how it's modeling out and how these clients are starting to really get into the Cerner mode and see us as their provider, moving their allegiance over from the HS folks. So today, things are working very well."

Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the call.  I will lead off today with a review of the numbers; Zane Burke, our President, will follow me with results highlights and marketplace observations; and then Mike Nill, our Chief Operat",1189,"Thank you, Howard. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the call.  I will lead off today with a review of the numbers; Zane Burke, our President, will follow me with results highlights and marketplace observations; and then Mike Nill, our Chief Operating Officer will provide some additional highlights. 
Now I will turn to our results, which were solid across all key metrics. Our bookings revenue in Q2 is $1.4 billion, which reflects 9% growth over Q2 of '15. Note that this growth was driven on only 28% of bookings coming from long-term contracts in Q2 of '16 compared to 35% in the year-ago quarter. 
Our revenue backlog ended the quarter at $15.0 billion, which is up 13% from $13.3 billion a year ago. Revenue in the quarter was $1.22 billion, which is up 8% over Q2 of '15 and in the middle of our guidance range. The revenue composition for Q2 is $333 million in system sales, $257 million in support and maintenance, $604 million in services and $22 million in reimbursed travel. 
System sales revenue for the quarter was up 6% compared to Q2 of '15 with strong growth in software being partially offset by a decline in hardware. While hardware did decline year-over-year against a tough comparable, it was up sequentially and in line with expected levels. 
Looking at systems sales margins, it was up 150 basis points over last year, reflecting strong software and lower hardware. 
Moving to services. Total services revenue, including professional and managed services, was up 12% compared to Q2 of '15. This is in line with our expectation and continues to reflect good execution via service organizations. Support and maintenance revenue increased 1% over Q2 of '15 reflecting the tough comparable. Support and maintenance is up 5% year-to-date, and we expect similar mid-single-digit growth for the rest of the year. 
Looking at revenue by geographic segments. Domestic revenue increased 8% over the year-ago quarter to $1.073 billion and non-U.S. revenue grew 9% to $143 million. 
Moving to gross margin. Our gross margin for Q2 was 83.1%, which is up from 82.9% in Q2 of '15, reflecting strong software and services and lower hardware. 
Now I'll discuss spending and operating margin and net earnings. For these items, we provide both GAAP and adjusted or non-GAAP results. The adjusted results exclude share-based compensation expense, Health Services related to amortization, acquisition-related deferred revenue and other acquisition-related adjustments, which are detailed and reconciled to GAAP net earnings in our earnings release. 
Looking at operating spending, our second quarter GAAP operating expenses were $769 million compared to $762 million in the year-ago period. Adjusted operating expenses were $721 million which is up 9% compared to Q2 of '15. This growth was primarily driven by growth in personnel expense related to revenue-generating associates. The total year-over-year change for each expense category in Q2 on an adjusted basis was 13% growth for sales and client service, 2% decline in software development, 6% growth for G&A and amortization of acquisition-related intangibles was down 12%.
Moving to operating margins. Our Q2 GAAP operating margin was 19.8% compared to 15.3% in the year-ago period. Our adjusted operating margin was 23.8% in Q2, which is down slightly from 24.2% in the year-ago period. This is in line with our previous indication that we expect margin expansion to be limited in 2016, but we do continue to believe we can expand margins 50 to 100 basis points annually after 2016.
Moving to net earnings and EPS. Our GAAP net earnings in Q2 were $166 million or $0.48 per diluted share. Adjusted net earnings were $199 million and adjusted diluted EPS was $0.58, which is up 12% compared to Q2 of '15. 
The Q2 tax rate was 32%, which is in line with our expected range of 32% to 33%. 
Now I'll move to our balance sheet.  We ended Q2 with $720 million of total cash and investments, which is up slightly from $707 million in Q1 with most of our free cash flow being used to repurchase shares. During the quarter, we executed $50 million in stock repurchases, buying back 938,000 shares at an average price of $53.30. Year-to-date, we have purchased 3.7 million shares at an average price of $53.41 for a total of $200 million out of the $300 million stock repurchase program authorized in March of this year.
Moving to debt. Our total debt, including capital lease obligations is $585 million, which is down slightly compared to Q1. Total receivables ended the quarter at $983 million, which is up $42 million from Q1. Our Q2 DSO was 74 days, which is an improvement of 2 days compared to Q1 and 7 days better than a year ago. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $255 million up from $109 million in Q2 of '15 and down from $327 million in Q1. The sequential decline is driven mostly by timing of tax payments and extra payroll in Q2. Year-to-date operating cash flow of $582 million reflects strong growth over $323 million of operating cash flow in the first half of last year.
Q2 capital expenditures were $118 million and capitalized software was $80 million. Free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less capital purchases and capitalized software development costs, was $57 million for the quarter. This is up compared to negative free cash flow in Q2 of '15 and down from a very strong Q1 in '16, due to the lower operating cash flow and higher capital spending related to construction on our new campus. 
Year-to-date free cash flow of $209 million is in line with our expectations, and we expect solid free cash flow for the rest of the year even with spending on our campus remaining elevated. Next year, we expect a decline in capital expenditures resulting in a stronger free cash flow. 
Now I'll go through Q3 and full year 2016 guidance. For Q3, we expect revenue between $1.2 billion and $1.275 billion with the mid-point reflecting growth of 10% over Q3 of '15. For the full year, we expect revenue between $4.9 billion and $5.0 billion. This range reflects the tightening of our previous range, mostly to capture the lower hardware revenue in the first half of the year, but is still 12% full year growth at the mid-point. We expect Q3 diluted EPS to be $0.59 to $0.61 per share with the mid-point reflecting 11% growth over Q3 of '15.
For the full year, we continue to expect adjusted diluted EPS to be $2.30 to $2.40 with the mid-point reflecting 11% growth over 2015. 
Moving to bookings guidance. We expect bookings revenue in Q3 of $1.45 billion to $1.6 billion. The mid-point reflects a slight decline from Q3 '15, which was 44% higher than Q3 of '14, and is by far the toughest comparable period from last year.
The mid-point will still put the year-to-date bookings above 2015, and we expect growth in Q4 as well. So we are still on track for our stated goal of full year growth over what was a very strong 2015. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Zane."

Today, I'll provide color on our results and make some marketplace observations. Our bookings were a record for Q2 and only second to our all-time high bookings of Q3 2015. As Marc indicated, our total bookings grew",1123,"Thanks, Marc. Good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'll provide color on our results and make some marketplace observations. Our bookings were a record for Q2 and only second to our all-time high bookings of Q3 2015. As Marc indicated, our total bookings grew 9% despite lower contributions from long-term bookings than last year. The 28% of Q2 2016 bookings from long term reflects contributions from both ITWorks and managed services, but were still below the elevated level of 35% in Q2 of 2015. The non-long term portion of Q2 2016 bookings grew 20%, reflecting strong levels of solution and services sales both into our base and to new clients. 
Bookings this quarter included several large contracts with 45 contracts over $5 million, including 28 over $10 million. 34% of bookings this quarter came from outside our $4 million install base. This high level of new business is a result of an active replacement market and ongoing success against our primary competitor. The keys to our success continue to be our improved solutions, predictable delivery capabilities, lower cost of ownership, ability to deliver value and our population health and open platform capabilities. I believe we compare favorably to our primary competitor in all of these areas and this is reflected in our run rate. 
Overall, I believe Cerner is viewed as the safe choice for our current solution needs, as well as best positioned supplier to help clients achieve value from their investments and position them for success as the market shifts from a focus on care to a focus on health and wellness.
A good example of the opportunity in the marketplace and our competitiveness was Covenant Health selecting Cerner, which we announced last week. Covenant Health is a 1,900 bed health system based in Eastern Tennessee, with 10 hospitals and nearly 100 ambulatory facilities. They will be deploying Cerner Millennium EHR and clinically driven revenue cycle solutions, as well as the HealtheIntent population health solutions across all venues of care. Cerner's integrated solutions across clinical and revenue cycle and acute and ambulatory, proven ability to deliver value at a predictable cost and our population health care capabilities were important differentiators for us when competing for this business.
Looking ahead, we believe the replacement market will remain active, given the high number of hospitals on legacy platforms, many of which are being sunset. This opportunity is reflected in our leading indicators with our new business pipeline and sales activities at all-time highs. 
Now I'll discuss revenue cycle. We had another great quarter. All new EHR clients included revenue cycle as part of their purchase, reflecting continued focus by the market on clinically driven revenue cycle. This preference was also reflected in ongoing success in our installed base with several more large clients choosing Cerner for acute revenue cycle and a military business office services. 
In addition to a very strong quarter, we also made a great addition to our executive team. As we announced in July, Jeff Hurst will be joining Cerner on September 1 as Senior Vice President of Cerner revenue cycle management and President of Cerner RevWorks. This is a new position and the existing revenue cycle and RevWorks teams will report to Jeff. Jeff comes to us from Florida Hospital, a 2,700 bed acute care medical facility that is a member of the Adventist Health System, where he directed all financial and clinical revenue cycle functions and had a responsibility for key organizational strategies. He is respected industry thought leader and a proven executive, and he brings an important provider perspective to Cerner.
As you know, we have made significant investments in revenue cycle that have led to very strong growth in recent years. Our hiring of Jeff is an indication that we believe we are still in the early stages of a significant growth opportunity as we help our clients navigate the rapidly evolving reimbursement landscape and that we're investing in talent that will help us capitalize on this opportunity and to contribute to the success of our clients.
Now I'll shift to discussing our population health business, where we had a great quarter. We added several new clients to the HealtheIntent platform, and we also expanded the scope of population health solutions at some of our largest existing clients. Our comprehensive approach to population health remains differentiated in the marketplace, and we continue to add solutions to the HealtheIntent platform. I believe we'll continue displaced numerous niche offerings because of the power of the platform and the ability to integrate with the EHR workflow. 
The volume of clients that have purchased initial solutions on our HealtheIntent platform is impressive. We recently passed the 100 client milestone. We believe this positions us for a significant ramp in the revenue in the coming years as these clients add more solutions and lives to the platform, which will increase the per member per month rate and number of members. We expect the driver of this to be ongoing shifts in reimbursement that are leading to more risk assumption by our clients. And we believe the shift away from traditional fee-for-service is gaining momentum with the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act or MACRA and the new merit-based incentive payment systems ramping in coming years as CMS continues to focus on value and quality payments.
Moving to the ambulatory market, where we had record results with strengthened ambulatory EHR, practice management and business office services. Similar to the recent quarters, our results include some of the largest acute care clients choosing Cerner's clinical and revenue cycle solutions for their ambulatory settings. 
We also had a strong quarter in the small hospital market. Our cloud-based CommunityWorks offering continues to be competitive against all-niche small hospital vendors. A recent noteworthy win for CommunityWorks was the displacement of a failed attempted go live by a cloud-based vendor that has been making a push in recent years to expand from ambulatory market to hospitals. We have several active opportunities displace the same competitor in both ambulatory and small hospital settings, suggesting their approach of spending about 3x as much on sales and marketing as they do on research and development may not be the most effective approach for the client.
Outside the U.S., despite some macroeconomic headwinds, we had a good quarter. Non-U.S. revenue grew 9% year-over-year with noteworthy areas of strength, including Australia, Germany and the Middle East. As Mike will discuss, the Middle East strength included ITWorks, which is a positive sign as it highlights a largely untapped global opportunity for ITWorks. 
In summary, I'm pleased with our execution in Q2 and believe we are well positioned to have a good second half for the year. With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike."

Today, I'm going to discuss ITWorks and Cerner's model experience initiative. I'll start with ITWorks. We had a good quarter with 1 new ITWorks client, a large expansion with an existing client and a very strong sales back into our client base. Regarding our new client, this client is not only new to ITWorks, but they are a new EHR client as well. And the EHR win displaces our primary competitor. 
The client is the new children's hospital in Dubai, and was scheduled to implement our primary competitor's solution, but concluded Cerner is a better choice to meet their needs. Our ability to work quickly in order to enable them to be ready for the hospital schedule opening date, as well as provide full IT services through ITWorks, were both key factors in us being selected. In addition, the success we've had with another client in the region was very helpful in demonstrating the value of the ITWorks model, something our competitor does not offer.
Looking ahead, our pipeline for ITWorks is significant and includes some very large clients. While the timing of ITWorks deals has been lumpy and will likely continue to be, we're confident it will remain a strong contributor to our growth. The value proposition to our clients is very appealing, especially in an environment where they have pressure on operating cost, limited access to IT talent and increasing pressure in light of the industry issues related to security.
Now I'd like to briefly discuss an initiative we call Model Experience. The Model Experience is an extension of the model system, which we have discussed in the past. The Model Experience represents a meaningful shift in our approach to implement our solutions, workflows and standards at our client sites. It presents all of Cerner's standards and content within a controlled environment, where the best practice for workflows and the latest capabilities are captured, then each client system can be optimized based upon their specific needs. The Model Experience goes beyond just focusing on the EHR. It also provides clients optimal recommendations for leveraging HealtheIntent, Millennium and CareAware solutions.
In addition, the Model Experience uses a continuous advancement approach for adopting recommendations, which ensures our clients will continuously be able to maximize the value of our solutions.
In summary, I believe the Model Experience positions us well for our clients to achieve value from their existing investments and keep up with the rapidly evolving health care landscape. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to questions."

Health care is complex no matter how small the organization is.

I think that's still our expectations as we roll through. Obviously, to the extent that we increase our higher-margin elements of the business, software, et cetera, there's a chance to increase the operating margins. But I think, overall, given the mix we have, which feels like a pretty good mix between services, software and the rest of our business, I don't know that we're going to have a big change in 2016 relative to margin expansion. I feel very good as we roll into '17, you'll start to see us get back on a track of the 50 to 100 basis points of margin expansion that you've seen us historically be able to do. But that's, right now, our view as we look out at the second half of the year, given our guidance for Q3, I think would be relatively flat year-over-year as we continue to see basically low double-digit revenue growth."

Well, keep in mind that, certainly, when we bought them and closed, they were already a small group of clients that had decided and notified Siemens that they were leaving the fold.

So the impact of a client making the decision to leave actually tails off -- has a very long tail to it. So from a -- from our business model perspective and certainly, in the nearer term that we've been working through, the synergies, primarily as we talked about, were cost related. And I think we've done a very good job of delivering on those cost synergies. So I think, overall, if you look at the kind of the bottom line of HS, we are ahead relative to an OE, slightly ahead of where we would have modeled ourselves. I think we're slightly ahead of where we would have expected from a retention standpoint.

Zane Burke, our President, will follow me with results, highlights and marketplace observations. And then then Mike Nill, our Chief Operating Officer, will provide some operational highlights. Now I will turn to our results. 
While solid overall, our results included bookings and revenues slightly below our guidance range and earnings at the low end of our range. Starting with bookings. Our bookings revenue in Q3 was $1.434 billion, which reflects a 10% decrease from the very difficult comparable in Q3 of '15 on bookings were an all-time high and have grown 44% over the prior year. Relative to our guidance, bookings were $16 million below the low end of our range, but Q3 was still our second-highest bookings quarter ever. 
Our revenue backlog ended the quarter at $15.471 billion, which is up 11% from $13.876 billion a year ago. Revenue in the quarter was $1.185 billion, which is up 5% over Q3 of '15, but $15 million below the low end of our guidance range of $1.2 million to $1.275 billion. 
The revenue shortfall was mainly system sales and was a result of lower-than-expected technology resale in software bookings for the quarter. The revenue composition for Q3 was $301 million in system sales, $253 million in support and maintenance, $608 million in services and $22 million in reimbursed travel. 
System sales revenue for the quarter was down 7% compared to Q3 of '15 with technology resale declining 21% and license software declining 12%, partially offset by 10% growth in subscriptions. System sales margin percent increased 150 basis points year-over-year to 69%, reflecting lower technology resale mix as well as lower commissions.
Moving to services. Total services revenue, including professional and managed services, was up 13% compared to Q3 of '15. This is in line with our expectations and continues to reflect good execution by our services organizations. Support and maintenance revenue increased 3% over Q3 of '15, slightly below our expectation of mid-single-digit growth due mostly to lower equipment maintenance revenue related to our lower technology resale.
Looking at revenue by geographic segment. Domestic revenue increased 6% over the year ago quarter to $1.06 billion and non-U.S. Revenue was flat year-over-year at $130 million. 
Moving to gross margin. Gross margin for Q3 was 84.6%, which is up from 83.1% in Q3 of '15 due mostly to the lower mix of technology resale and better services margins versus the year-ago period. Now I will discuss spending, operating margin and net earnings.
For these items, we provide both GAAP and adjusted or non-GAAP results. The adjusted results exclude share-based compensation expense, Health Services acquisition-related amortization, acquisition-related deferred revenue and other acquisition-related adjustments, which are detailed and reconciled to GAAP in our earnings release. Looking at operating spending, our third quarter GAAP operating expenses were $759 million compared to $722 million in the year-ago period. 
Adjusted operating expenses were $713 million, which is up 8% compared to Q3 of '15. This growth was primarily driven by growth in personnel expense related to revenue growth generating associates, which is reflected in the sales and client service expense line that increased 11%. Software development increased 3%. G&A was basically flat and amortization of acquisition-related intangibles was down 30%. This represents only $1 million decline from $3 million to $2 million as this line excludes Health Services acquisition-related amortization and the non-GAAP field. 
Moving to operating margins. Our Q3 GAAP operating margin was 20.4% compared to 19.1% in the year-ago period. Our adjusted operating margin was 24.4% in Q3, which is essentially flat to the year-ago period. This is in line with our previous indication that we expect margin expansion to be limited in 2016, but we do continue to believe we can expand margins 50 plus basis points annually after 2016.
Moving to net earnings and EPS. Our GAAP net earnings in Q3 were $170 million, $0.49 per diluted share. Adjusted net earnings were $203 million and adjusted diluted EPS was $0.59, which is up 9% compared to Q3 of '15.
Q3 tax rate was 30%, which is slightly below our expected rate. The benefit of this was largely offset by a $3.7 million write-off of a venture capital investment that is reflected in the other income line. Now I'd like to preview and expense we expect to incur in Q4. We recently offered a new voluntary separation plan, or BSP, to eligible associates. Similar to our program fiber a lesser, the BSP was made available to us associates to meet the minimum level of combined days of 10-year. The irrevocable acceptance period for most associates electing to participate in the BSP ends in December. 
Based on the number of eligible associates and our estimated participation, we expect the corresponding pretax charge in the fourth quarter of 2016 to be approximately $30 million. Similar to our last VSP, we believe will be able to fill may of the positons by participating associates with existing associates, which should create efficiencies in the future while also creating career growth opportunities for our associates.
This completely voluntary program has a very small impact on our total headcount as a number of eligible associates we expect accept the offer revs and less than 2% of our total associates. Also, they should not be viewed as I lay off or a sign we don't expect to grow. We've grown our headcount by over 2,000 people this year and expect to grow headcount next year as well. Now move to our balance sheet.
We ended Q3 with $837 million of total cash and investments, which is up from $720 million in Q2. We did not repurchase stock during the quarter, which means $100 million still remains available for repurchase and the stock repurchase program authorized in March of this year.
Moving to debt. Our total debt, including capital lease obligations, is $573 million, which is down slightly compared to Q2. Total receivables ended the quarter at $985 million, which is essentially flat to Q2. Our Q3 DSO was 76 days, which is down 9 days from 85 in the year-ago period. 
Operating cash flow for the quarter was $240 million, down from $272 million in Q3 of '15. Year-to-date operating cash flow of $822 million still reflect strong growth over the $594 million of operating cash flows for the first 3 quarters of last year. We also expect strong Q4 cash flow. Q3 capital expenditures were $110 million and capitalized software was $74 million.
Free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less capital purchases and capitalized software development cost, was $56 million for the quarter. This is flat compared to Q2 and down compared to Q3 of '15. You today, free cash flow of $266 million is nearly double $134 million generated in the first 3 quarters of last year. Next year, we continue to expect a decline in capital expenditures, which we expect to drive stronger free cash flow. Now I'll go through guidance.
We expect revenue in Q4 to be between $1.225 billion and $1.3 billion with the mid-point reflecting growth of 7% over Q4 of '15. Our guidance reflect our expectation that system sales will increase sequentially compared to Q3, but still be below our original target for the quarter with a lower expected software and hardware. 
We expect Q4 diluted EPS, adjusted diluted EPS, to be $0.60 to $0.62 per share, which is below our original expectation due to the impact of lower system sales. The mid-point of this range is flat compared to Q4 of '15, but recall, we had a $0.03 tax benefit last year.
Moving to bookings guidance. We expect bookings revenue in Q4 of $1.425 billion to $1.575 billion, and the mid-point reflects 11% growth over Q4 of '15. When added, to year-to-date actuals, the mid-point of our Q4 guidance in place of the following expected full year 2016 results. 
Revenue of $4.8 billion compared to a guidance range of $4.9 billion to $5.0 billion; diluted -- adjusted diluted EPS of $2.31 compared to guidance of $2.30 to $2.40; and bookings of $5.5 billion compared to our stated target of exceeding 2015 bookings of $5.4 billion. 
With comparative guidance we provided a year ago, revenue was the only key metric projected to be below our previously guided range. Recall that I shared at our Investor Day in March, approximately 79% of the $5 billion mid-point of our original revenue guidance was scheduled to come out of backlog that existed at the beginning of 26 and. These means that we expect that about $4 billion a revenue will come from backlog that exited the beginning of the year and the remaining $1 billion will come from current year bookings. So far this year, our conversion of backlog is that almost right our targeted levels, and we expect that to continue where we have missed has been on contra vision of bookings to current your revenue, which is reflected in the lower system sales.
Personally, much more of this miss have been due to hardware and software, which is the main reason we still expect to be at the full year adjusted diluted EPS guidance range. Also, while below our initial range, our 2016 revenue is still expected to be 8% to 9% higher than 2015, which is a very tough comparable as it is 30% over 2014.
Now I'd like to provide initial expectations for 2015 -- 2017. We'll provide more formal guidance after we report Q4 results and finalized our 2017 plan. But based on the initial version of our planned we currently expect, 2017 revenue between $5.2 billion and $5.45 billion, reflecting 11% growth at the mid-point. In 2017, adjusted diluted EPS between $2.50 and $2.70, reflecting 13% growth at the mid-point. Current consensus estimates for both revenue and adjusted diluted EPS are at the high end of these guidance ranges largely reflecting the consensus was formed before our Q3 results and Q4 guidance. With that, I will turn the call over to Zane."

Today, I'll provide color in our results and make some marketplace observations. I'll start with bookings. 
While our Q3 bookings were slightly below our guidance range, it was still the second-highest level of bookings in our history, second only to Q3 of 2015. In addition, we expect to return the strong bookings growth in Q4. Looking at mix. 34% of bookings in the quarter were from long-term contracts, reflecting one new ITWorks client and strong managed services bookings. This is in a more normal range for long-term bookings but our year-to-date mix is still lower than normal because of the lower long-term bookings in the first half of the year. Bookings this quarter included several large contracts with 35 contracts over $5 million, including 26 over $10 million. From a new client perspective, 34% of bookings this quarter came from outside our core millennial and soul base. This high level of new business reports our ongoing competitiveness and good market activity. 
Looking ahead, we continue to believe the replacement market will remain active given the high number of hospitals on legacy platforms, some of that are being sunset, while yet others preparing for future regulatory and bowed models that made legacy platforms are not well-equipped battle because we a previous of discuss, the timing of these contracts have proven to be less printable, which I will discuss more in a minute.
First, I'll provide some highlights of the quarter. I'll start with revenue cycle, which continues to be strong contributor to our results. The market remains very focused on clinically driven revenue cycle, which is revving strong sales into our base as well as inclusion in new HR deals. We also had good contribution from RevWorks services in the quarter with an expansion in existing relationship and good contribution from our acute and ambulatory revenue cycle services offerings. Our competitiveness in revenue cycle continues to improve across both acute and ambulatory, and this is reflected in fact, that we have displacement end different competitor so far this year. Looking ahead, we remain optimistic that revenue cycle continued to be strong contributor to our growth. We still have a significant life space on solution penetration and opportunities for our consulting services remain high.
Now I'll shift to population health, where we continue to do very well. Our comprehensive approach to population health remains differentiated in the marketplace. The power of our platform and ability to integrate with EHR work flow remain key differentiators, but also continued to strengthen our competitiveness against the niche competitors we face across different categories such as registries, Enterprise Data Warehouse, analytics and care management. 
We are very pleased with our overall progress in population health. Just 2.5 years after our first HealtheIntent solution went live. We have now sold solutions to over 100 client and the HealtheIntent platform is over 300 data connections from more than 80 unique sources. As we've discussed, the scope with many initial population health contracts was mall because most clients are not at risk for large portions of their populations. But we expect to that ongoing shifts in reimbursement will lead to broader risk assumption, which should lead to adoption a more solutions and more lives being managed on a per member per month model. Addition, we are discovering through these of our solution that system or data will enhance our client fee-for-service models. 
Also, our addressable market for population health goes beyond our traditional EHR clients to include ACO's, health plans, governments and employers. In addition, the opportunity goes beyond module to help the intent platform as their significant market provides higher value services that complement our solution offerings. Mike will provide an example of their we are doing this.
Moving to the ambler Tori market where we have another very good quarter. This quarter again included multiple competitive strong contributions from many -- from an blitzer EHR practice management and business office services. In noteworthy ambulatory when during the quarter was being selected to replace our primary cloud-based competitor for ambulatory EHR and business office services at a large investor own IDN it that we believe is there largest client. We signed for one market in Q3 and anticipate expanding it into other markets in the future. This was 1 of 3 displacements of this competitor in the quarter. 
We also had a good quarter in the small hospital market. Our competitiveness in this market remains strong, and we are having success against all competitors. In Q3, we added a community hospitals with head-to-head wins against 5 different competitors. 
Outside the U.S, our revenue was flat year-over-year. Non-U.S. Revenue represents about 11% of our total revenue. So the flat revenue in the quarter didn't really impact our total results. Despite some current macro headwinds, we do expect the non-U.S. Market to become a more meaningful contributor to our results over the long term given the relatively untapped HR solution and services market. Bills believe there will be a large market for our publishing health platform outside the U.S. Now I'd like to provide some perspective on our results and observations on the marketplace. Despite what was in most ways of solid quarter, we are always this pointed if we don't deliver against that is we established. So I'd like to comment about what they think are some of the elements country bidding to results being somewhat less predictable. 
While our part line has continued to increase of this year, and is it record levels, it appeared with a time of closing opportunities has been more challenging. In the EHR replacement market, there continues to be significant number of replacement opportunities, and we continue to win a majority of them. However, the reduced number of our deadlines tied to regulatory mandates have impacted the client sense of margin C. As I indicated, I believe this is primarily timing issue as deals in our forecasts are changing from a calendar perspective and not be lost. 
We have also have less contribution from our ITWorks and RevWorks businesses this year despite a strong pipeline of opportunities. These opportunities remain, I believe, will see much stronger contributions from these businesses in 2017. 
Overall, I feel good about our ability to grow bookings in 2017 given the pipeline for larger works contracts, ongoing EHR replacement opportunities and an expected continuation of the ramp of contributions population health. And as Marc discuss, our initial view of 2015 reflects good and top and bottom line growth. In summary, our results were slightly below our guidance range for revenue because, I still view our results as solid and strong pipeline in place and we remain position for growth going forward. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike."

Like most of our ITWorks line, they added additional solutions to the roadmap as part of their agreement. In this case, they'll be adding critical care, oncology and cardiology solutions. 
In addition, they're adding HealtheIntent population health solutions as well. As Zane mentioned, we've had less ITWorks activity so far this year than expected, but our pipeline remains strong and include some clients that                                                                                       are much  larger  than  any  of  our                                                                                                                                                                                                                        existing   ITWorks  client,   which is why we're are confident about the growth in ITWorks bookings for 2017. The value proposition to our clients remain very appealing, especially in an environment where they had pressure on operating cost, limited access to IT talent and increasing pressures in light of the industry issues related to security.
Now I'd like to discuss a new partnerships between Cerner, large employer in Memorial Hermann. Together, the 3 of us have collaborated to create high performance health network for employers. Employers are looking for strategies to improve quality, cost and experience. Leading health systems are creating and looking to grow their insurance offerings. As this emerging market takes shape, Cerner's investing in new capabilities to address this market opportunity. We think the chance to possibly disrupt and drive revenue is compelling. 
Cerner and Houston based Memorial Hermann had a long history of collaboration and innovation. In addition to broad adoption of Cerner Millennium Solutions, they're an early adopter initial HealtheIntent population health solutions have been certainly adopting more solutions and replacing niche suppliers over the past 3 years. This has contributed to their success of running one of the largest best-performing ACOs in the country. 
Memorial Hermann also has its own health plan build our other best provider network in Houston. Within their plan, they've created their own cost and, fully-insured product for a Fortune 500 employer. Country's member services that we will tightly integrated to the health plans and health system helping members maximize the benefits.
We are also providing the technology for the consumer engagement platform, which brings disparate patient and member portals into an organized consolidated experience. As you know, we have administered our own health plan for the past naked, which is allowed us to reduce the growth in our health care costs will also waiting to a better health experience for our associates.
By leveraging this experience and partner with an innovative world-class provider like Memorial Hermann and large forward thinking employer, we are building an approach to value-based credit care that can be a model for other markets. We believe large health systems are uniquely positioned to play a role in helping please move to our value based care. Be offering performance networks -- high-performance networks comprised of high-quality doctors that can provide plans that help employers than the cost curve while also providing a better overall experience and improving the health of their workforce. We look forward to sharing more about this collaboration as we move through the enrollment in large -- in the launch of this offering and then expand these capabilities to other leading health systems, employers and markets.

And in fact, we had a very strong new business quarter overall. So we did very well. We just anticipated doing slightly better, and there were a couple of opportunities that moved and mostly from just a pure timing perspective. So it's not a question of if they're going to do it, if they win. And without the challenges are without the regulatory elements behind it, the regulatory mandate times behind it, some of those clients are moving a little bit slower than they have in the past. So the budgets are there. The activity is there and we're -- we had a high performance quarter in terms of numbers. We had -- that did not our expectations on what we had anticipated to come through for the quarter. So as we look forward, we see our pipeline of activity and those that are in the pipe is very strong and record levels of activity there. And as those of you who have followed us for a long time know we go through our rigorous process in terms of how we qualify those opportunities, how they run through the -- our forecasting process, and that's helped us to provide good predictability historically around the closing of those -- some of those opportunities. In this case, as I have discussed previously, there are some timing gaps. So the activity remain strong. The ability to accurately predict within the number of week, days it's a row, on how we close of the business was not where we have seen it previously. So does that make sense?"

As we go through the process, the process will remain as it's only swimming. We will look at the business. We won't make any assumptions that we're going to grow bookings. We will expect bookings to be relatively flat and mix to be relatively similar. And we will then look at our forecast that goes out fourth quarter to see if that forecast supports those assumptions. We'll do all things we do relative to look at spending and looking at opportunities. I would expect, while I don't have the number today, that a material component similar to what we saw coming in '16, which was in the 80%, 79% range, that we would see that same contribution from backlog as we roll into next year. I don't know what the number exactly is going to be. But I think we're going to have that visibility. Once again, I think it will be a focus on the 20% that we've got to go drive, a lot of which comes through system sales. And that's going to be -- we're going to be focus on relative to our forecasting and our assumptions. 
But my philosophy is we're going to do all the work and then we're going to provide you guidance based on our best work. So we can't really -- as I said, we can't really -- as I said, we can't -- my planning process assumes certain things. one of which is what bookings. I don't expect to have flat bookings. Next year, we're basically guiding today that we're going to be relatively flat for bookings. But I think what -- as we look next year, we will certainly, expect to get back on uptick after coming off a very challenging year with a significant increase in bookings last year exceeding that very tough market. This year, is actually did accomplish meant, but we'd expect to get back on track to growing bookings in a similar pace that we have seen in the past. So once again, my comments on plan is to what we've traditionally always done from a actual expectation of bookings. The business expects to grow our bookings. Especially Zane talked about in 2015, the works businesses or 2016, the works businesses weren't an integral part of a lot of our bookings number. We didn't do a lot of big ITWorks deal. In the pipeline, there are more opportunities in that space. And given that and the size of those bookings, gives us kind of a higher level of confidence that '17 bookings are going to be stronger than '16."

So we see bookings growing next year. My point is relative to us doing a plan, the question kind of came at is their level of conservatism? And for us, we don't expect -- we don't plan the bookings are going to grow. We expect them to grow. But by not building that into the plan, that gives us some degree of cushion should they not grow to deliver the numbers that we provided in our guidance. And so I think that's our expectation. Expect bookings the group it was a and expect bookings to grow. The opportunities are there. So we will see higher bookings in '17. But relative to giving you guidance, especially preliminary guidance, we're not going to go build growth in bookings into those preliminary numbers. 
When we come back to you after Q4 ends with a completely built backlog and has our best view, then we'll certainly tie down those numbers. But at this point, based on our normal process, which was done every year, we're comfortable with the guidance we're providing relative to a first look at '17 and once again, realizing we got to get to our planning process to tie down."

I think what we're seeing is move -- some of those things moving through the pipeline a little bit faster in terms of -- not faster, but just maturing more appropriately through there. And so what's really going on is when you make this move, it's a combination of things. So there's always a how to grow faster. And so when you look at MACRA and MIPS, our clients are going to have a need to be able to measure and monitor a number of different metrics to beginning to prepare for that. And when they look at what the pressure there under front for MACRA, MIPS, those kind of things are going to drive additional behavior around ITWorks in addition to decreasing reimbursement environment creates a costs strain at a time when they need access to more data. They need more IT to actually be able to answer all these questions. So the combination of the -- those regulatory elements at a capital and operating constrained environment at a point in time whether trying to just flat out execute what we offer for our clients is provide that kind of leverage. And I think what we saw in '16 is there was almost a catch your breadth mentality in that we did not have any of those major elements around Meaningful Use. In the current year, we didn't have the MACRA MIPS, and in addition, the bottom lines for our clients were still pretty strong. What you're seeing, as you go to the back half of the year, is a little bit of weakness with the bottom line, and that regulatory environment is coming on. That's actually a really big positive for the IT -- for the works programs themselves. But revenue cycle and ITWorks. And so in the conversations that we're having, they're continuing along. And I feel like those are going to mature in a good way in '17 that we just didn't see in '16 with that kind of catch your breadth element in some of those areas."

The -- around the international marketplaces, there are a few markets that feel very positive as we look at it. There are some who are investing more and help charity, like Belgium, like Sweden and you see that like Australia. And then, there's some interesting ones where you look at as the country like the U.K, which is under incredible cost pressure. And that pressure really forces the change. It forces the need for no more IT, frankly. And we were -- you maybe aware we were awarded 6 of our 13 -- or clients were awarded 6 of the 13 clients grand around innovation. So GBP 10 billion innovation bounce by, which she they are charged with figuring out ways to use IT to lower cost and improve efficiencies in the U.K. And so I look at a couple of markets where there's recognition for -- they're doing well economically and they want to go invest in health care structures, like Belgium, like Sweden, or they're struggling and it's going to force of the change, like the U.K. And I think we're well positioned in those marketplace to have some good success. I also think Canada has the opportunity in 2017 and 2018 to be a very strong marketplace as they look at some more eventually wide procurements.

So from our view, Q3 was a little bit of a unique circumstance in that, Zane talked about, there was a lot of business in the quarter and a lot of software opportunities that because of -- the timing issues that we're seeing didn't get down in Q3. We see that rebounded in Q4, expect to get back kind of to more traditional levels. The reason I always talked about softer before is that it really hasn't been different enough to highlight, the tech resales has been different enough that it's been a cause of a difference. So that's one reasons. The variance between subscription and license, it really just Benson how we're selling it and how the clients buy it. We will -- as we go-to-market, we'll go-to-market in a right-of-ways. They want to buy the software, want to buy has a time, term license that's more of a subscription. If they want on the health side, a lot of it much of with this month per member per month. So much more of like a ASP or subscription basis. So I don't know that, that mix is relevant to our business as a Q3 for some of those opportunities because some of them -- size have look to a different period. But I think overall, we're a software company, we expect that to rebound. Our pipeline is strong, and we have the opportunity to go sell software. People are still buying softer in this marketplace. So I think the -- our opportunities. And then we just got to get to the point where we can -- and we are at that point where we can effectively deliver on a fixed fee basis. The technology they need, Zane made a really good point earlier about MACRA and the impact of that has a just a general desire for technology.
Thing, I see stock and other existing client base, what they're needing. Some of that is going to be driven by their desire to have all of the data that's going to be required under MACRA make sure that they have a single line of proof to go get abated in be able to go get the data they need. Yes, I don't know how we sell it image months more different. We still solved, sell it. Q3, I think, was a low number. We've highlighted it because that's we want to be transparent.

We talked coming to this year that we expected to have noncash expenses on some of the amortization on that, hitting this in 2016, has hit us, it didn't -- has not hit us as much as we had originally expected. So I think you will see some carryover impact on the '17 R&D expenses as that amortization starts ramps up early next year. We continue to deliver the code. We're doing it on an tamely basis. In some cases, we get to Jaime require testing by our client partners. And sometimes that time and gets -- is not exactly within our schedule that we would do amortization. So I think you'll see next year similar level of capitalization because we are still working on new stuff. The overall expense will take a slightly from the amortization element of being slightly higher for the mall that bit in get it into the number this year. So R&D expense basically is likely, as we look at it, goes up a little bit as we head into 2017, but not significant adjustments.

Keep in mind that if you look at year-to-date, in 2015, long-term bookings were 34% of our total bookings. If you look at this year, it's been about 29% because actually, for us to be relatively flat or and we're looking to be slightly up over a year, we are actively not getting the support from the long-term bookings, which we talked about from the work deals. I think that's actually a point that should go unnoticed. But I think from -- welcome to the overall contracts, every contract has some degree of these aren't simple, but they aren't -- they're not rocket science, right? They want to buy stuff. We want to sell stuff. There's a lot of parameters are on that. But we have a lot of the space but we also talk but the contract together. So I do think the complexity of contracts is delaying the timing of the contracts. I think the delay -- I think that is just more a matter of the organization's timing and focus and strategic planning and they don't have an outside regulatory timeline they have to go meet for some of these things. MACRA could change that. MACRA may make them do more -- be more focused on making sure they have the solutions throughout all of their departments so that they can get day-to-day daily to do that reporting. But I think that -- so I think the complexity has been somewhat complex. It's just a matter of the timing of the client. To do that, the money is there. As Zane says within our pipeline, it's just time down the 90-day period at which is going to actually sign is a little limit more traditional to what it was prior to having Meaningful Use in all of those regulatory things have occurred."

Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the call. I'll lead off today with a review of the numbers. Zane Burke, our President, will follow me with the results, highlights and marketplace observations. And then",1695,"Thank you, Michelle. This is Marc Naughton. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the call. I'll lead off today with a review of the numbers. Zane Burke, our President, will follow me with the results, highlights and marketplace observations. And then Mike Nill, our Chief Operating Officer, will provide some operational highlights. Now I will turn to our results. 
While solid overall, our results included bookings and revenues slightly below our guidance range and earnings at the low end of our range. 
Starting with bookings. Our bookings revenue in Q3 was $1.434 billion, which reflects a 10% decrease from the very difficult comparable in Q3 of '15 when bookings were an all-time high and had grown 44% over the prior year. Relative to our guidance, bookings were $16 million below the low end of our range, but Q3 was still our second-highest bookings quarter ever. 
Our revenue backlog ended the quarter at $15.471 billion, which is up 11% from $13.876 billion a year ago. Revenue in the quarter was $1.185 billion, which is up 5% over Q3 of '15 but $15 million below the low end of our guidance range of $1.2 million to $1.275 billion. 
The revenue shortfall was mainly in system sales and was a result of lower-than-expected technology resale in software bookings for the quarter. The revenue composition for Q3 was $301 million in system sales, $253 million in support and maintenance, $608 million in services and $22 million in reimbursed travel. 
System sales revenue for the quarter was down 7% compared to Q3 of '15, with technology resale declining 21% and license software declining 12%, partially offset by 10% growth in subscriptions. System sales margin percent increased 150 basis points year-over-year to 69%, reflecting lower technology resale mix as well as lower commissions.
Moving to services. Total services revenue, including professional and managed services, was up 13% compared to Q3 of '15. This is in line with our expectations and continues to reflect good execution by our services organizations. Support and maintenance revenue increased 3% over Q3 of '15, slightly below our expectation of mid-single-digit growth due mostly to lower equipment maintenance revenue related to our lower technology resale.
Looking at revenue by geographic segment. Domestic revenue increased 6% over the year ago quarter to $1.06 billion, and non-U.S. revenue was flat year-over-year at $130 million. 
Moving to gross margin. Gross margin for Q3 was 84.6%, which is up from 83.1% in Q3 of '15 due mostly to the lower mix of technology resale and better services margins versus the year-ago period. Now I will discuss spending, operating margin and net earnings.
For these items, we provide both GAAP and adjusted or non-GAAP results. The adjusted results exclude share-based compensation expense, Health Services acquisition-related amortization, acquisition-related deferred revenue and other acquisition-related adjustments, which are detailed and reconciled to GAAP in our earnings release. Looking at operating spending, our third quarter GAAP operating expenses were $759 million compared to $722 million in the year-ago period. 
Adjusted operating expenses were $713 million, which is up 8% compared to Q3 of '15. This growth was primarily driven by growth in personnel expense related to revenue-generating associates, which is reflected in the sales and client service expense line that increased 11%. Software development increased 3%, G&A was basically flat and amortization of acquisition-related intangibles was down 30%. But this represents only a $1 million decline from $3 million to $2 million as this line excludes Health Services acquisition-related amortization in the non-GAAP view.
Moving to operating margins. Our Q3 GAAP operating margin was 20.4% compared to 19.1% in the year-ago period. Our adjusted operating margin was 24.4% in Q3, which is essentially flat to the year-ago period. This is in line with our previous indication that we expect margin expansion to be limited in 2016, but we do continue to believe we can expand margins 50-plus basis points annually after 2016.
Moving to net earnings and EPS. Our GAAP net earnings in Q3 were $170 million, $0.49 per diluted share. Adjusted net earnings were $203 million and adjusted diluted EPS was $0.59, which is up 9% compared to Q3 of '15.
Q3 tax rate was 30%, which is slightly below our expected rate. The benefit of this was largely offset by a $3.7 million write-off of a venture capital investment that is reflected in the other income line. 
Now I'd like to preview an expense we expect to incur in Q4. We recently offered a new voluntary separation plan, or VSP, to eligible associates. Similar to our program in February of last year, the VSP was made available to U.S. associates who meet a minimum level of combined days in tenure. The irrevocable acceptance period for most associates electing to participate in the VSP ends in December. 
Based on the number of eligible associates and our estimate of participation, we expect the corresponding pretax charge in the fourth quarter of 2016 to be approximately $30 million. Similar to our last VSP, we believe we'll be able to fill many of the positons vacated by participating associates with existing associates, which should create efficiencies in the future while also creating career growth opportunities for our associates.
This completely voluntary program will have a very small impact on our total headcount as the number of eligible associates we expect to accept the offer represents less than 2% of our total associates. Also, this should not be viewed as a layoff or a sign we don't expect to grow. We've grown our headcount by over 2,000 people this year and expect to grow headcount next year as well. 
Now I move to our balance sheet. We ended Q3 with $837 million of total cash and investments, which is up from $720 million in Q2. We did not repurchase stock during the quarter, which means $100 million still remains available for repurchase on the stock repurchase program authorized in March of this year.
Moving to debt. Our total debt, including capital lease obligations, is $573 million, which is down slightly compared to Q2. Total receivables ended the quarter at $985 million, which is essentially flat to Q2. Our Q3 DSO was 76 days, which is down 9 days from 85 in the year-ago period. 
Operating cash flow for the quarter was $240 million, down from $272 million in Q3 of '15. Year-to-date operating cash flow of $822 million still reflects strong growth over the $594 million of operating cash flows for the first 3 quarters of last year. We also expect a strong Q4 cash flow. Q3 capital expenditures were $110 million and capitalized software was $74 million.
Free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less capital purchases and capitalized software development cost, was $56 million for the quarter. This is flat compared to Q2 and down compared to Q3 of '15. Year-to-date, free cash flow of $266 million is nearly double the $134 million generated in the first 3 quarters of last year. Next year, we continue to expect a decline in capital expenditures, which we expect to drive stronger free cash flow. 
Now I'll go through guidance. We expect revenue in Q4 to be between $1.225 billion and $1.3 billion, with the midpoint reflecting growth of 7% over Q4 of '15. Our guidance reflects our expectation that system sales will increase sequentially compared to Q3 but will still be below our original target for the quarter due to lower expected software and hardware. 
We expect Q4 diluted EPS -- adjusted diluted EPS to be $0.60 to $0.62 per share, which is below our original expectations due to the impact of lower system sales. The midpoint of this range is flat compared to Q4 of '15 but recall, we had a $0.03 tax benefit last year.
Moving to bookings guidance. We expect bookings revenue in Q4 of $1.425 billion to $1.575 billion, and the midpoint reflects 11% growth over Q4 of '15. When added to year-to-date actuals, the midpoint of our Q4 guidance implies the following expected full year 2016 results: revenue of $4.8 billion compared to a guidance range of $4.9 billion to $5.0 billion, diluted -- adjusted diluted EPS of $2.31 compared to guidance of $2.30 to $2.40 and bookings of $5.5 billion compared to our stated target of exceeding 2015 bookings of $5.4 billion. 
When comparing to guidance we provided a year ago, revenue was the only key metric projected to be below our previously guided range. Recall that I shared at our Investor Day in March that approximately 79% of the $5 billion midpoint of our original revenue guidance was scheduled to come out of backlog that existed at the beginning of 2016. This means that we expect that about $4 billion of revenue will come from backlog that existed at the beginning of the year and the remaining $1 billion to come from current year bookings. So far this year, our conversion of backlog has been almost right at targeted levels, and we expect that to continue. Where we have missed has been on contribution of bookings to current year revenue, which is reflected in the lower system sales.
Fortunately, much more of this miss has been due to hardware than software, which is the main reason we still expect to be in our full year adjusted diluted EPS guidance range. Also, while below our initial range, our 2016 revenue is still expected to be 8% to 9% higher than 2015. This is a very tough comparable as it is 30% over 2014.
Now I'd like to provide initial expectations for 2017. We'll provide more formal guidance after we report Q4 results and finalize our 2017 plan. But based on the initial version of our plan, we currently expect 2017 revenue between $5.2 billion and $5.45 billion, reflecting 11% growth at the midpoint; and 2017 adjusted diluted EPS between $2.50 and $2.70, reflecting 13% growth at the midpoint. Current consensus estimates for both revenue and adjusted diluted EPS are at the high end of these guidance ranges, largely reflecting the fact the consensus was formed before our Q3 results and Q4 guidance. With that, I will turn the call over to Zane."

While our Q3 bookings were slightly below our guidance range, it was still the second-highest level of boo",1132,"Thanks, Marc. Good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'll provide color on our results and make some marketplace observations. I'll start with bookings. 
While our Q3 bookings were slightly below our guidance range, it was still the second-highest level of bookings in our history, second only to Q3 of 2015. In addition, we expect to return a strong bookings growth in Q4. 
Looking at mix. 34% of bookings in the quarter were from long-term contracts, reflecting one new ITWorks client and strong managed services bookings. This is in a more normal range for long-term bookings but our year-to-date mix is still lower than normal because of the lower long-term bookings in the first half of the year. Bookings this quarter included several large contracts, with 35 contracts over $5 million, including 26 over $10 million. From a new client perspective, 34% of bookings this quarter came from outside our core Millennium installed base. This high level of new business reflects our ongoing competitiveness and good market activity. 
Looking ahead, we continue to believe the replacement market will remain active given the high number of hospitals on legacy platforms, some that are being sunset, while yet others are preparing for future regulatory and payment models that many legacy platforms are not well equipped to handle. As we have previously discussed, the timing of these contracts have has to be less predictable, which I will discuss more in a minute.
First, I'll provide some more highlights on the quarter. I'll start with revenue cycle, which continues to be a strong contributor to our results. The market remains very focused on clinically-driven revenue cycle, which is driving strong sales into our base as well as inclusion in new EHR deals. We also had good contribution from RevWorks services in the quarter, with an expansion of an existing relationship and good contribution from our acute and ambulatory revenue cycle services offerings. Our competitiveness in revenue cycle continues to improve across both acute and ambulatory, and this is reflected in the fact that we've displaced more than 10 different competitors so far this year. Looking ahead, we remain optimistic that revenue cycle will continue to be a strong contributor to our growth. We still have significant whitespace on solution penetration, and opportunities for our consulting services remains high.
Now I'll shift to population health, where we continue to do very well. Our comprehensive approach to population health remains differentiated in the marketplace. The power of our platform and ability to integrate with the EHR workflow remain key differentiators, but we also continue to strengthen our competitiveness against the niche competitors we face across different categories such as registries, Enterprise Data Warehouse, analytics and care management. 
We are very pleased with our overall progress in population health. Just 2.5 years after our first HealtheIntent solution went live, we have now sold solutions to over 100 clients, and the HealtheIntent platform has over 300 data connections from more than 80 unique sources. As we have discussed, the scope of many initial population health contracts was small because most clients are not at risk for large portions of their populations, but we expect that ongoing shifts in reimbursement will lead to broader risk assumption, which should lead to adoption of more solutions and more lives being managed on a per member per month model. Additionally, we're discovering through the use of our solutions the access to more data will enhance our clients' fee-for-service models. 
Also, our addressable market for population health goes beyond our traditional EHR clients to include ACOs, health plans, governments and employers. In addition, the opportunity goes beyond modules of the HealtheIntent platform as their significant markets provide high-value services that complement our solution offerings. Mike will discuss an example of where we are doing this.
Moving to the ambulatory market where we had another very good quarter. This quarter again included multiple competitor displacements and strong contributions from many -- from ambulatory EHR practice management and business office services. A noteworthy ambulatory win during the quarter was being selected to replace our primary cloud-based competitor for ambulatory EHR and business office services at a large investor-owned IDN that we believe is their largest client. We signed for one market in Q3 and anticipate expanding it to other markets in the future. This was one of 3 displacements of this competitor in the quarter. 
We also had a good quarter in the small hospital market. Our competitiveness in this market remains strong, and we are having success against all competitors. In Q3, we added 8 community hospitals with head-to-head wins against 5 different competitors. 
Outside the U.S., our revenue was flat year-over-year. Non-U.S. revenue represents about 11% of our total revenue, so the flat revenue in the quarter didn't really impact our total results. Despite some current macro headwinds, we do expect the non-U.S. market to become a more meaningful contributor to our results over the long term, given a relatively untapped EHR solution and services market. We also believe there will be a large market for our population health platform outside the U.S. 
Now I'd like to provide some perspective on our results and observations on the marketplace. Despite what was, in most ways, a solid quarter, we are always disappointed if we don't deliver against the guidance we established. So I'd like to comment about what I think are some of the elements contributing to results being somewhat less predictable. 
While our pipeline has continued to increase this year and is at record levels, we're in a period where the timing of closing opportunities has been more challenging. In the EHR replacement market, there continues to be a significant number of replacement opportunities, and we continue to win a majority of them. However, the reduced number of hard deadlines tied to regulatory mandates has impacted the client's sense of urgency. As I indicated, I believe this is primarily a timing issue as deals in our forecasts are changing from a calendar perspective but not being lost. 
We have also had less contribution from our ITWorks and RevWorks businesses this year despite a strong pipeline of opportunities. These opportunities remain, and I believe we'll see much stronger contributions from these businesses in 2017. 
Overall, I feel good about our ability to grow bookings in 2017 given the pipeline for larger Works contracts, ongoing EHR replacement opportunities and an expected continuation in the ramp of contributions from population health. And as Marc discussed, our initial view of 2015 reflects good top and bottom line growth. 
In summary, while our results were slightly below our guidance range for revenue bookings, I still view results as solid and a strong pipeline in place where we remain well positioned for growth going forward. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike."

We had a good quarter with 1 new ITWorks client and a strong sales back into",591,"Thanks, Zane. Good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'm going to discuss ITWorks and service collaboration with a large employer and leading health system. 
I'll start with ITWorks. We had a good quarter with 1 new ITWorks client and a strong sales back into our client base. Our new client in the quarter was a community hospital that also has 6 clinics. Like most of our ITWorks clients, they added additional solutions to the road map as part of their agreement. In this case, they'll be adding critical care, oncology and cardiology solutions. 
In addition, they're adding HealtheIntent population health solutions as well. As Zane mentioned, we've had less ITWorks activity so far this year than expected, but our pipeline remains strong and include some clients that are much larger than any  of our existing ITWorks client, which is why we are confident about the growth in ITWorks bookings for 2017. 
The value proposition to our clients remains very appealing, especially in an environment where they have pressure on operating cost, limited access to IT talent and increasing pressures in light of the industry issues related to security.
Now I'd like to discuss a new partnership between Cerner, a large employer and Memorial Hermann. Together, the 3 of us have collaborated to create a high-performance health network for employers. Employers are looking for strategies to improve quality, cost and experience. Leading health systems are creating and looking to grow their insurance offerings. As this emerging market takes shape, Cerner's investing in new capabilities to address this market opportunity. We think the chance to possibly disrupt and drive revenue is compelling. 
Cerner and Houston-based Memorial Hermann had a long history of collaboration and innovation. In addition to broad adoption of Cerner Millennium solutions, they're an early adopter of our initial HealtheIntent population health solutions have been steadily adopting more solutions and replacing niche suppliers over the past 3 years. This has contributed to their success of running one of the largest best-performing ACOs in the country. 
Memorial Hermann also has its own health plan built around their vast provider network in Houston. Within their plan, they've created their own custom, fully-insured product for a Fortune 500 employer. As part of the overall approach, Cerner's providing a concierge member services that will be tightly integrated into the health plans and health system, helping members maximize their benefits.
We are also providing the technology for the consumer engagement platform, which brings disparate patient and member portals into an organized consolidated experience. As you know, we have administered our own health plan for the past decade, which has allowed us to reduce the growth in our health care costs while also leading to a better health experience for our associates.
By leveraging this experience and partnering with an innovative world-class provider like Memorial Hermann and a large forward-thinking employer, we are building an approach to value-based care that can be a model for other markets. We believe large health systems are uniquely positioned to play a role in helping employers move toward value-based care by offering performance networks -- high-performance networks comprised of high-quality doctors that can provide plans that help employers bend the cost curve while also providing a better overall experience and improving the health of their workforce. We look forward to sharing more about this collaboration as we move through the enrollment and launch this -- in the launch of this offering and then expand these capabilities to other leading health systems, employers and markets. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to questions."

We just had anticipated doing slightly better, and there were a couple of opportunities that moved, and mostly from a -- just a pure timing perspective. So it's not a question of if they're going to do it, it's a when. And without the challenges of -- or without the regulatory elements behind it, the regulatory mandate times behind it, some of those clients are moving a little bit slower than they have in the past. So the budgets are there. The activity is there, and we're -- we had a high performance quarter in terms of numbers. We had -- we did not meet our expectations on what we had anticipated to come through for the quarter. So as we look forward, we see our pipeline of activity, and those that are in the pipe, as very strong and record levels of activity there. And as those of you who have followed us for a long time know, we go through a rigorous process in terms of how we qualify those opportunities, how they run through the -- our forecasting process, and that's helped us to provide good predictability historically around the closing of those -- some of those opportunities. In this case, as I have discussed previously, there are some timing gaps. So the activity remained strong. The ability to accurately predict within the number of weeks, days, et cetera, on how we close our business was not where we have seen it previously. So I -- does that make sense?"

As we go through the process, the process will remain as it's always remained. We will look at the business. We won't make any assumptions that we're going to grow bookings. We will expect bookings to be relatively flat and mix to be relatively similar. And we will then look at our forecast that goes out 4 quarters to see if that forecast supports those assumptions. We'll do all the things that we do relative to looking at spending and looking at opportunities. I would expect, while I don't have a number today, that a material component similar to what we saw coming into '16, which was in the 80%, 79% range, that we would see that same contribution from backlog as we roll into next year. I don't know that, that -- what that number exactly is going to be, but I think we're going to have that visibility. Once again, I think it will be a focus on the 20% that we've got to go drive, a lot of which comes through system sales. And that's going to be what we're going to focus on relative to our forecasting and our assumptions. But my philosophy is I'm going to do -- we're going to do all the work, and then we're going to provide you guidance based on our best work. So we can't really -- as I said, we can't -- my planning process assumes certain things, one of which is flat bookings. I don't expect to have flat bookings next year. We're basically guiding today that we're going to be relatively flat for bookings. But I think what -- as we look next year, we will certainly expect to get back on an uptick after coming off a very challenging year with a significant increase in bookings last year. Exceeding that very tough mark this year is actually a good accomplishment, but we'd expect to get back on track to growing bookings at a similar pace that we've seen in the past. So once again, my comments on plan is what we've traditionally always done from an actual expectation of bookings. The business expects to grow our bookings. Especially, as Zane talked about, in 2015, the Works businesses -- or 2016, the Works businesses were an integral part of a lot of our bookings number. We didn't do a lot of big ITWorks deals. In the pipeline, there are more opportunities in that space. And given that and the size of those bookings, gives us kind of a higher level of confidence that '17 bookings are going to be stronger than '16."

And for us, we don't expect -- we don't plan the bookings are going to grow. We expect them to grow, but by not building that into the plan, that gives us some degree of cushion should they not grow to deliver the numbers that we provide in our guidance. And so I think that's our expectation. I expect bookings to grow, Zane expects bookings to grow. The opportunities are there. So we will see higher bookings in '17. But relative to giving you guidance, especially preliminary guidance, we're not going to go build growth in bookings into those preliminary numbers. When we come back to you after Q4 ends with a completely built backlog and has -- have our best view, then we'll certainly tie down those numbers.

I think what we're seeing is move -- some of those things moving through the pipeline a little bit faster in terms of -- or not faster, but just maturing more appropriately through there. And so what's really going on is when you make this move, it's a combination of things. So there's always a -- how to go faster. And so when you look at MACRA and MIPS, our clients are going to have a need to be able to measure and monitor a number of different metrics and to begin to prepare for that. And when they look at the -- what the pressure they're under from Meaningful Use, from MACRA and MIPS, those kinds of things are going to drive additional behavior around ITWorks. In addition, the decreasing reimbursement environment creates a cost strain at a time when they need access to more data. They need more IT to actually be able to answer all these questions. So the combination of the -- those regulatory elements in a capital- and operating-constrained environment at a point in time when they're trying to just flat out execute, what we offer for our clients is provide that kind of leverage. And I think what we saw in '16 is there was almost a catch-your-breath mentality, in that we did not have any of those major elements around Meaningful Use. In the current year, we didn't have the MACRA, MIPS. And in addition, the bottom lines for our clients were still pretty strong. What you're seeing, as you go to the back half of the year, is a little bit of weakness with the bottom lines. And that regulatory environment's coming on. That's actually a really big positive for the IT -- for the Works programs themselves, both revenue cycle and ITWorks. And so in the conversations that we're having, they're continuing along. And I feel like those are going to mature in a good way in '17 that we just didn't see in '16 with that kind of catch-your-breath element in the -- in some of those areas."

So I think that's an important element to think of first when you're thinking about the health of where we are. As far as certain areas of strength in the marketplace, certainly, if you look at community hospitals, that's a very strong marketplace for us. The small-hospital marketplace is very strong. Some places where we uniquely compete, around the investor-owned segment, around the government, both from a federal and a state and local perspective.

Half of that came out this quarter as a result of lower system sales, right? We did not contemplate hardware decreasing 21%. We didn't contemplate software decreasing. The business is out there. As Zane has talked, it's primarily timing issues. But once those things hit a quarter, so you're down -- half of that $150 million you're out this quarter, that's going to have a carryover effect. So even in our Q4 guidance, where we expect system sales to rebound and get back to good levels, you've got the follow-on impact of that. So that's going to impact, basically, take you down the $150 million, just in the last half of the year. So I think that's the material amount, obviously. When we were giving guidance, we were looking for a pretty significant uptick as we went through. And if you look at our Q4 guidance, I mean, we're looking at a $78 million uptick at the midpoint of our revenue guidance range. So we are still looking to get a significant bump in revenue as we get to Q4. So I think, relative to what we saw at the beginning of the year, the backlog has played out just like we expected it to.

The -- and then, there are some interesting ones where you look at a country like the U.K., which is under incredible cost pressure.

And we were -- you may be aware, we were awarded 6 of the 13 -- our clients were awarded 6 of the 13 challenge grants around innovation. So GBP 10 billion innovation grants by which they are charged with figuring out ways to use IT to lower cost and improve efficiencies in the U.K. And so I look at a couple of markets where there's recognition for -- they're doing well economically, and they want to go invest in health care structures like Belgium, like Sweden, or they're struggling and it's going to force the change, like the U.K. And I think we're well positioned in those marketplaces to have some good success.

So from our view, Q3 was a little bit of a unique circumstance, in that, as Zane talked about, there was a lot of business in the quarter and a lot of software opportunities that, because of the timing issues that we're seeing, didn't get down in Q3. We see that rebounding in Q4 and expect to get back kind of to more traditional levels. The reason you haven't talked -- heard us talk about software before is it really hasn't been different enough to highlight. The tech resales has been different enough that it's been a cause of the difference. So that's one reason. The variance between subscription and license, it really just depends on how we're selling it and how the clients buy it. We will -- as we go to market, we'll go to market in a variety of ways. They want to buy the software, want to buy it as a time -- term license that's more of a subscription, if they want on the pop health side, a lot of it is -- much of it's bought per member per month, so much more like a ASP or subscription basis. So I don't know that, that mix is relevant to our business as -- Q3 for some of those opportunities. Some of them of size have moved to a different period. But I think the -- I think, overall, we're a software company. We expect that to rebound. Our pipeline is strong, and we have the opportunity to go sell software. People are still buying software in this marketplace. So I think that our opportunities are there, and we just got to get to the point where we can -- and we are at that point where we can effectively deliver on a fixed-fee basis the technology they need. Zane made a really good point earlier about MACRA and the impact that has on just the general desire for technology. I think, as he was talking about the existing client base, what they're needing, some of that's going to be driven by their desire to have all of the data that's going to be required under MACRA and make sure that they have a single point of truth to go get that data, and they'd be able to get all the data that they need. So yes, I don't know how we sell it makes much difference. We still solve it -- sell it. Q3, I think, was a low number. We've highlighted it because that's -- we want to be transparent. Q4, we don't think that's going to be an issue."

We're continually delivering the code. We're doing it on a timely basis. In some cases, to get to GA [ph], we require some testing by our client partners, and sometimes that timing gets -- is not exactly within our schedule that we would do amortization. So I think you'll see next year a similar level of capitalization because we are still working on new stuff.

We are -- we still have opportunities. We are still using some of the acquired resources to work and get to a point on some of the HS solutions. And so those people will become available as we roll forward. And we are investing heavily in our India campuses, so our expectation there is that we will be bringing online more IP resources in that environment, which, from a headcount perspective, will increase but from a cost perspective will fit in with that single -- mid-single-digit future growth."

I know that you talked about -- on the call about MACRA and Meaningful Use, but it seems that, that size of contract, the long -- the bigger the contract is, seems to me, it's more complicated and, therefore, slower to convert. That's question one.

Keep in mind that if you look at year-to-date, in 2015, long-term bookings were 34% of our total bookings. If you look at this year, it's been about 29%. So actually, for us to be relatively flat or -- and looking to be slightly up over a [ph] year, where we're actually not getting the support from the long-term bookings, which we talked about from the Works deals, I think that's actually a point that shouldn't go unnoticed. But I think the -- from a -- relative to the overall contracts, all -- every contract has some degree of -- these aren't simple, but they aren't -- they're not rocket science, right? I mean, they want to buy stuff, and we want to sell stuff. There's a lot of parameters around that, but there are a lot of -- we have a lot of experience, they have a lot of experience. They also have a facility [ph] that helps them put the contract together. So I do think the complexity of the contracts is delaying the -- these signing of the contracts. I think the delay -- the -- I think that is just more a matter of the organization's timing and focus and strategic planning, and they don't have an outside regulatory time line that they have to go meet for some of these things. MACRA could change that. MACRA may make them do -- be more focused on making sure they have these solutions throughout all of their departments so that they can get the data they need to do that reporting. But I think the -- so I don't think the complexity -- these have always been somewhat complex. It's just a matter of the timing of the client to do that. The money is there. As Zane says, they're in our pipeline. It's just timing -- tying down the 90-day period at which it's going to go and actually sign is a little bit more traditional than what it was prior to having Meaningful Use and all those regulatory things that occurred."

Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the call. I'll lead off today with a review of the numbers. Zane Burke, our President, will follow me with the results, highlights and marketplace observations. And then Mike Nill, our Chief Operating Officer, will provide some operational highlights. Now I will turn to our results. 
While solid overall, our results included bookings and revenues slightly below our guidance range and earnings at the low end of our range. 
Starting with bookings. Our bookings revenue in Q3 was $1.434 billion, which reflects a 10% decrease from the very difficult comparable in Q3 of '15 when bookings were an all-time high and had grown 44% over the prior year. Relative to our guidance, bookings were $16 million below the low end of our range, but Q3 was still our second-highest bookings quarter ever. 
Our revenue backlog ended the quarter at $15.471 billion, which is up 11% from $13.876 billion a year ago. Revenue in the quarter was $1.185 billion, which is up 5% over Q3 of '15 but $15 million below the low end of our guidance range of $1.2 million to $1.275 billion. 
The revenue shortfall was mainly in system sales and was a result of lower-than-expected technology resale in software bookings for the quarter. The revenue composition for Q3 was $301 million in system sales, $253 million in support and maintenance, $608 million in services and $22 million in reimbursed travel. 
System sales revenue for the quarter was down 7% compared to Q3 of '15, with technology resale declining 21% and license software declining 12%, partially offset by 10% growth in subscriptions. System sales margin percent increased 150 basis points year-over-year to 69%, reflecting lower technology resale mix as well as lower commissions.
Moving to services. Total services revenue, including professional and managed services, was up 13% compared to Q3 of '15. This is in line with our expectations and continues to reflect good execution by our services organizations. Support and maintenance revenue increased 3% over Q3 of '15, slightly below our expectation of mid-single-digit growth due mostly to lower equipment maintenance revenue related to our lower technology resale.
Looking at revenue by geographic segment. Domestic revenue increased 6% over the year ago quarter to $1.06 billion, and non-U.S. revenue was flat year-over-year at $130 million. 
Moving to gross margin. Gross margin for Q3 was 84.6%, which is up from 83.1% in Q3 of '15 due mostly to the lower mix of technology resale and better services margins versus the year-ago period. Now I will discuss spending, operating margin and net earnings.
For these items, we provide both GAAP and adjusted or non-GAAP results. The adjusted results exclude share-based compensation expense, Health Services acquisition-related amortization, acquisition-related deferred revenue and other acquisition-related adjustments, which are detailed and reconciled to GAAP in our earnings release. Looking at operating spending, our third quarter GAAP operating expenses were $759 million compared to $722 million in the year-ago period. 
Adjusted operating expenses were $713 million, which is up 8% compared to Q3 of '15. This growth was primarily driven by growth in personnel expense related to revenue-generating associates, which is reflected in the sales and client service expense line that increased 11%. Software development increased 3%, G&A was basically flat and amortization of acquisition-related intangibles was down 30%. But this represents only a $1 million decline from $3 million to $2 million as this line excludes Health Services acquisition-related amortization in the non-GAAP view.
Moving to operating margins. Our Q3 GAAP operating margin was 20.4% compared to 19.1% in the year-ago period. Our adjusted operating margin was 24.4% in Q3, which is essentially flat to the year-ago period. This is in line with our previous indication that we expect margin expansion to be limited in 2016, but we do continue to believe we can expand margins 50-plus basis points annually after 2016.
Moving to net earnings and EPS. Our GAAP net earnings in Q3 were $170 million, $0.49 per diluted share. Adjusted net earnings were $203 million and adjusted diluted EPS was $0.59, which is up 9% compared to Q3 of '15.
Q3 tax rate was 30%, which is slightly below our expected rate. The benefit of this was largely offset by a $3.7 million write-off of a venture capital investment that is reflected in the other income line. 
Now I'd like to preview an expense we expect to incur in Q4. We recently offered a new voluntary separation plan, or VSP, to eligible associates. Similar to our program in February of last year, the VSP was made available to U.S. associates who meet a minimum level of combined age and tenure. The irrevocable acceptance period for most associates electing to participate in the VSP ends in December. 
Based on the number of eligible associates and our estimate of participation, we expect the corresponding pretax charge in the fourth quarter of 2016 to be approximately $30 million. Similar to our last VSP, we believe we'll be able to fill many of the positons vacated by participating associates with existing associates, which should create efficiencies in the future while also creating career growth opportunities for our associates.
This completely voluntary program will have a very small impact on our total headcount as the number of eligible associates we expect to accept the offer represents less than 2% of our total associates. Also, this should not be viewed as a layoff or a sign we don't expect to grow. We've grown our headcount by over 2,000 people this year and expect to grow headcount next year as well. 
Now I move to our balance sheet. We ended Q3 with $837 million of total cash and investments, which is up from $720 million in Q2. We did not repurchase stock during the quarter, which means $100 million still remains available for repurchase on the stock repurchase program authorized in March of this year.
Moving to debt. Our total debt, including capital lease obligations, is $573 million, which is down slightly compared to Q2. Total receivables ended the quarter at $985 million, which is essentially flat to Q2. Our Q3 DSO was 76 days, which is down 9 days from 85 in the year-ago period. 
Operating cash flow for the quarter was $240 million, down from $272 million in Q3 of '15. Year-to-date operating cash flow of $822 million still reflects strong growth over the $594 million of operating cash flows for the first 3 quarters of last year. We also expect a strong Q4 cash flow. Q3 capital expenditures were $110 million and capitalized software was $74 million.
Free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less capital purchases and capitalized software development cost, was $56 million for the quarter. This is flat compared to Q2 and down compared to Q3 of '15. Year-to-date, free cash flow of $266 million is nearly double the $134 million generated in the first 3 quarters of last year. Next year, we continue to expect a decline in capital expenditures, which we expect to drive stronger free cash flow. 
Now I'll go through guidance. We expect revenue in Q4 to be between $1.225 billion and $1.3 billion, with the midpoint reflecting growth of 7% over Q4 of '15. Our guidance reflects our expectation that system sales will increase sequentially compared to Q3 but will still be below our original target for the quarter due to lower expected software and hardware. 
We expect Q4 diluted EPS -- adjusted diluted EPS to be $0.60 to $0.62 per share, which is below our original expectations due to the impact of lower system sales. The midpoint of this range is flat compared to Q4 of '15 but recall, we had a $0.03 tax benefit last year.
Moving to bookings guidance. We expect bookings revenue in Q4 of $1.425 billion to $1.575 billion, and the midpoint reflects 11% growth over Q4 of '15. When added to year-to-date actuals, the midpoint of our Q4 guidance implies the following expected full year 2016 results: revenue of $4.8 billion compared to a guidance range of $4.9 billion to $5.0 billion, diluted -- adjusted diluted EPS of $2.31 compared to guidance of $2.30 to $2.40 and bookings of $5.5 billion compared to our stated target of exceeding 2015 bookings of $5.4 billion. 
When comparing to guidance we provided a year ago, revenue was the only key metric projected to be below our previously guided range. Recall that I shared at our Investor Day in March that approximately 79% of the $5 billion midpoint of our original revenue guidance was scheduled to come out of backlog that existed at the beginning of 2016. This means that we expect that about $4 billion of revenue will come from backlog that existed at the beginning of the year and the remaining $1 billion to come from current year bookings. So far this year, our conversion of backlog has been almost right at targeted levels, and we expect that to continue. Where we have missed has been on contribution of bookings to current year revenue, which is reflected in the lower system sales.
Fortunately, much more of this miss has been due to hardware than software, which is the main reason we still expect to be in our full year adjusted diluted EPS guidance range. Also, while below our initial range, our 2016 revenue is still expected to be 8% to 9% higher than 2015. This is a very tough comparable as it is 30% over 2014.
Now I'd like to provide initial expectations for 2017. We'll provide more formal guidance after we report Q4 results and finalize our 2017 plan. But based on the initial version of our plan, we currently expect 2017 revenue between $5.2 billion and $5.45 billion, reflecting 11% growth at the midpoint; and 2017 adjusted diluted EPS between $2.50 and $2.70, reflecting 13% growth at the midpoint. Current consensus estimates for both revenue and adjusted diluted EPS are at the high end of these guidance ranges, largely reflecting the fact the consensus was formed before our Q3 results and Q4 guidance. With that, I will turn the call over to Zane."

Today, I'll provide color on our results and make some marketplace observations. I'll start with bookings. 
While our Q3 bookings were slightly below our guidance range, it was still the second-highest level of bookings in our history, second only to Q3 of 2015. In addition, we expect to return to strong bookings growth in Q4. 
Looking at mix. 34% of bookings in the quarter were from long-term contracts, reflecting one new ITWorks client and strong managed services bookings. This is in a more normal range for long-term bookings but our year-to-date mix is still lower than normal because of the lower long-term bookings in the first half of the year. Bookings this quarter included several large contracts, with 35 contracts over $5 million, including 26 over $10 million. From a new client perspective, 34% of bookings this quarter came from outside our core Millennium installed base. This high level of new business reflects our ongoing competitiveness and good market activity. 
Looking ahead, we continue to believe the replacement market will remain active given the high number of hospitals on legacy platforms, some that are being sunset, while yet others are preparing for future regulatory and payment models that many legacy platforms are not well equipped to handle. As we have previously discussed, the timing of these contracts have has proven to be less predictable, which I will discuss more in a minute.
First, I'll provide some more highlights on the quarter. I'll start with revenue cycle, which continues to be a strong contributor to our results. The market remains very focused on clinically-driven revenue cycle, which is driving strong sales into our base as well as inclusion in new EHR deals. We also had good contribution from RevWorks services in the quarter, with an expansion of an existing relationship and good contribution from our acute and ambulatory revenue cycle services offerings. Our competitiveness in revenue cycle continues to improve across both acute and ambulatory, and this is reflected in the fact that we've displaced more than 10 different competitors so far this year. Looking ahead, we remain optimistic that revenue cycle will continue to be a strong contributor to our growth. We still have significant whitespace on solution penetration, and opportunities for our consulting services remains high.
Now I'll shift to population health, where we continue to do very well. Our comprehensive approach to population health remains differentiated in the marketplace. The power of our platform and ability to integrate with the EHR workflow remain key differentiators, but we also continue to strengthen our competitiveness against the niche competitors we face across different categories such as registries, Enterprise Data Warehouse, analytics and care management. 
We are very pleased with our overall progress in population health. Just 2.5 years after our first HealtheIntent solution went live, we have now sold solutions to over 100 clients, and the HealtheIntent platform has over 300 data connections from more than 80 unique sources. As we have discussed, the scope of many initial population health contracts was small because most clients are not at risk for large portions of their populations, but we expect that ongoing shifts in reimbursement will lead to broader risk assumption, which should lead to adoption of more solutions and more lives being managed on a per member per month model. Additionally, we're discovering through the use of our solutions the access to more data will enhance our clients' fee-for-service models. 
Also, our addressable market for population health goes beyond our traditional EHR clients to include ACOs, health plans, governments and employers. In addition, the opportunity goes beyond modules to HealtheIntent platform as their significant markets provide high-value services that complement our solution offerings. Mike will discuss an example of where we are doing this.
Moving to the ambulatory market where we had another very good quarter. This quarter again included multiple competitor displacements and strong contributions from many -- from ambulatory EHR practice management and business office services. A noteworthy ambulatory win during the quarter was being selected to replace our primary cloud-based competitor for ambulatory EHR and business office services at a large investor-owned IDN that we believe is their largest client. We signed for one market in Q3 and anticipate expanding it to other markets in the future. This was one of 3 displacements of this competitor in the quarter. 
We also had a good quarter in the small hospital market. Our competitiveness in this market remains strong, and we are having success against all competitors. In Q3, we added 8 community hospitals with head-to-head wins against 5 different competitors. 
Outside the U.S., our revenue was flat year-over-year. Non-U.S. revenue represents about 11% of our total revenue, so the flat revenue in the quarter didn't really impact our total results. Despite some current macro headwinds, we do expect the non-U.S. market to become a more meaningful contributor to our results over the long term, given a relatively untapped EHR solution and services market. We also believe there will be a large market for our population health platform outside the U.S. 
Now I'd like to provide some perspective on our results and observations on the marketplace. Despite what was, in most ways, a solid quarter, we are always disappointed if we don't deliver against the guidance we established. So I'd like to comment about what I think are some of the elements contributing to results being somewhat less predictable. 
While our pipeline has continued to increase this year and is at record levels, we're in a period where the timing of closing opportunities has been more challenging. In the EHR replacement market, there continues to be a significant number of replacement opportunities, and we continue to win a majority of them. However, the reduced number of hard deadlines tied to regulatory mandates has impacted the client's sense of urgency. As I indicated, I believe this is primarily a timing issue as deals in our forecasts are changing from a calendar perspective but not being lost. 
We have also had less contribution from our ITWorks and RevWorks businesses this year despite a strong pipeline of opportunities. These opportunities remain, and I believe we'll see much stronger contributions from these businesses in 2017. 
Overall, I feel good about our ability to grow bookings in 2017 given the pipeline for larger Works contracts, ongoing EHR replacement opportunities and an expected continuation in the ramp of contributions from population health. And as Marc discussed, our initial view of 2015 reflects good top and bottom line growth. 
In summary, while our results were slightly below our guidance range for revenue bookings, I still view results as solid and a strong pipeline in place where we remain well positioned for growth going forward. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike."

Today, I'm going to discuss ITWorks and service collaboration with a large employer and leading health system. 
I'll start with ITWorks. We had a good quarter with 1 new ITWorks client and a strong sales back into our client base. Our new client in the quarter was a community hospital that also has 6 clinics. Like most of our ITWorks clients, they added additional solutions to the road map as part of their agreement. In this case, they'll be adding critical care, oncology and cardiology solutions. 
In addition, they're adding HealtheIntent population health solutions as well. As Zane mentioned, we've had less ITWorks activity so far this year than expected, but our pipeline remains strong and include some clients that are much larger than any  of our existing ITWorks client, which is why we are confident about the growth in ITWorks bookings for 2017. 
The value proposition to our clients remains very appealing, especially in an environment where they have pressure on operating cost, limited access to IT talent and increasing pressures in light of the industry issues related to security.
Now I'd like to discuss a new partnership between Cerner, a large employer and Memorial Hermann. Together, the 3 of us have collaborated to create a high-performance health network for employers. Employers are looking for strategies to improve quality, cost and experience. Leading health systems are creating and looking to grow their insurance offerings. As this emerging market takes shape, Cerner's investing in new capabilities to address this market opportunity. We think the chance to possibly disrupt and drive revenue is compelling. 
Cerner and Houston-based Memorial Hermann had a long history of collaboration and innovation. In addition to broad adoption of Cerner Millennium solutions, they're an early adopter of our initial HealtheIntent population health solutions have been steadily adopting more solutions and replacing niche suppliers over the past 3 years. This has contributed to their success of running one of the largest best-performing ACOs in the country. 
Memorial Hermann also has its own health plan built around their vast provider network in Houston. Within their plan, they've created their own custom, fully-insured product for a Fortune 500 employer. As part of the overall approach, Cerner's providing a concierge member services that will be tightly integrated into the health plans and health system, helping members maximize their benefits.
We are also providing the technology for the consumer engagement platform, which brings disparate patient and member portals into an organized consolidated experience. As you know, we have administered our own health plan for the past decade, which has allowed us to reduce the growth in our health care costs while also leading to a better health experience for our associates.
By leveraging this experience and partnering with an innovative world-class provider like Memorial Hermann and a large forward-thinking employer, we are building an approach to value-based care that can be a model for other markets. We believe large health systems are uniquely positioned to play a role in helping employers move toward value-based care by offering performance networks -- high-performance networks comprised of high-quality doctors that can provide plans that help employers bend the cost curve while also providing a better overall experience and improving the health of their workforce. We look forward to sharing more about this collaboration as we move through the enrollment and launch this -- in the launch of this offering and then expand these capabilities to other leading health systems, employers and markets. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to questions."

So it's not a question of if they're going to do it, it's a when. And without the challenges of -- or without the regulatory elements behind it, the regulatory mandate times behind it, some of those clients are moving a little bit slower than they have in the past. So the budgets are there. The activity is there, and we're -- we had a high performance quarter in terms of numbers. We had -- we did not meet our expectations on what we had anticipated to come through for the quarter. So as we look forward, we see our pipeline of activity, and those that are in the pipe, as very strong and record levels of activity there. And as those of you who have followed us for a long time know, we go through a rigorous process in terms of how we qualify those opportunities, how they run through the -- our forecasting process, and that's helped us to provide good predictability historically around the closing of those -- some of those opportunities. In this case, as I have discussed previously, there are some timing gaps. So the activity remained strong. The ability to accurately predict within the number of weeks, days, et cetera, on how we close our business was not where we have seen it previously. So I -- does that make sense?"

As we go through the process, the process will remain as it's always remained. We will look at the business. We won't make any assumptions that we're going to grow bookings. We will expect bookings to be relatively flat and mix to be relatively similar. And we will then look at our forecast that goes out 4 quarters to see if that forecast supports those assumptions. We'll do all the things that we do relative to looking at spending and looking at opportunities. I would expect, while I don't have a number today, that a material component similar to what we saw coming into '16, which was in the 80%, 79% range, that we would see that same contribution from backlog as we roll into next year. I don't know that, that -- what that number exactly is going to be, but I think we're going to have that visibility. Once again, I think it will be a focus on the 20% that we've got to go drive, a lot of which comes through system sales. And that's going to be what we're going to focus on relative to our forecasting and our assumptions. But my philosophy is I'm going to do -- we're going to do all the work, and then we're going to provide you guidance based on our best work. So we can't really -- as I said, we can't -- my planning process assumes certain things, one of which is flat bookings. I don't expect to have flat bookings next year. We're basically guiding today that we're going to be relatively flat for bookings. But I think what -- as we look next year, we will certainly expect to get back on an uptick after coming off a very challenging year with a significant increase in bookings last year. Exceeding that very tough mark this year is actually a good accomplishment, but we'd expect to get back on track to growing bookings at a similar pace that we've seen in the past. So once again, my comments on plan is what we've traditionally always done from an actual expectation of bookings. The business expects to grow our bookings. Especially, as Zane talked about, in 2015, the Works businesses -- or 2016, the Works businesses weren't an integral part of a lot of our bookings number. We didn't do a lot of big ITWorks deals. In the pipeline, there are more opportunities in that space. And given that and the size of those bookings, gives us kind of a higher level of confidence that '17 bookings are going to be stronger than '16."

And as Zane said, it's at record levels. So we see bookings growing next year. My point is, relative to us doing a plan, the question kind of came up as, is their level of conservatism? And for us, we don't expect -- we don't plan the bookings are going to grow. We expect them to grow, but by not building that into the plan, that gives us some degree of cushion should they not grow to deliver the numbers that we provide in our guidance. And so I think that's our expectation. I expect bookings to grow, Zane expects bookings to grow. The opportunities are there. So we will see higher bookings in '17. But relative to giving you guidance, especially preliminary guidance, we're not going to go build growth in bookings into those preliminary numbers. When we come back to you after Q4 ends with a completely built backlog and has -- have our best view, then we'll certainly tie down those numbers. But at this point, based on our normal process, which we've done every year, we're comfortable with the guidance we're providing relative to a first look at '17 and, once again, realizing we got to get through our planning process to tie it down."

I think what we're seeing is move -- some of those things moving through the pipeline a little bit faster in terms of -- or not faster, but just maturing more appropriately through there. And so what's really going on is when you make this move, it's a combination of things. So there's always a -- how to go faster. And so when you look at MACRA and MIPS, our clients are going to have a need to be able to measure and monitor a number of different metrics and to begin to prepare for that. And when they look at the -- what the pressure they're under from Meaningful Use, from MACRA and MIPS, those kinds of things are going to drive additional behavior around ITWorks. In addition, the decreasing reimbursement environment creates a cost strain at a time when they need access to more data. They need more IT to actually be able to answer all these questions. So the combination of the -- those regulatory elements in a capital- and operating-constrained environment at a point in time when they're trying to just flat out execute, what we offer for our clients is provide that kind of leverage. And I think what we saw in '16 is there was almost a catch-your-breath mentality, in that we did not have any of those major elements around Meaningful Use. In the current year, we didn't have the MACRA, MIPS. And in addition, the bottom lines for our clients were still pretty strong. What you're seeing, as you go to the back half of the year, is a little bit of weakness with the bottom lines. And that regulatory environment's coming on. That's actually a really big positive for the IT -- for the Works programs themselves, both revenue cycle and ITWorks. And so in the conversations that we're having, they're continuing along. And I feel like those are going to mature in a good way in '17 that we just didn't see in '16 with that kind of catch-your-breath element in the -- in some of those areas."

And should we be called upon to respond to that and get asked, we'd be excited to perform. I think our best model is to continue to perform on the DoD, which we are performing very well on, and the follow-on opportunities for that are quite significant in and of themselves. So as you think about '17 and '18 and the future, we have a unique position, both from the DOD perspective, obviously, the additional opportunities that are not yet booked as part of that opportunity, but also to set us up to be in good position to think about competing well around the VA. And so our motto is put our head down, be very successful with the DoD. That will yield a lot of positive results for 2017 in terms of system sales for Cerner Corporation that are unique to Cerner as well as position us for the VA."

So even in our Q4 guidance, where we expect system sales to rebound and get back to good levels, you've got the follow-on impact of that. So that's going to impact, basically, take you down the $150 million, just in the last half of the year. So I think that's the material amount, obviously.

The -- around the international marketplaces, there are a few markets that feel very positive as we look at it. There are some who are investing more in Healthcare IT like Belgium, like Sweden, and you see that like Australia. The -- and then, there are some interesting ones where you look at a country like the U.K., which is under incredible cost pressure. And that pressure really forces the change and forces the need for more IT, frankly. And we were -- you may be aware, we were awarded 6 of the 13 -- our clients were awarded 6 of the 13 challenge grants around innovation. So GBP 10 billion innovation grants by which they are charged with figuring out ways to use IT to lower cost and improve efficiencies in the U.K. And so I look at a couple of markets where there's recognition for -- they're doing well economically, and they want to go invest in health care structures like Belgium, like Sweden, or they're struggling and it's going to force the change, like the U.K. And I think we're well positioned in those marketplaces to have some good success. I also think Canada has the opportunity in 2017 and 2018 to be a very strong marketplace as they look at some more provincially wide procurements. And those tend to take time and are very challenging in which to predict how those will come to closure. But there's a -- I feel very good about how we're positioned in many of the -- those strong marketplaces."

So from our view, Q3 was a little bit of a unique circumstance, in that, as Zane talked about, there was a lot of business in the quarter and a lot of software opportunities that, because of the timing issues that we're seeing, didn't get done in Q3. We see that rebounding in Q4 and expect to get back kind of to more traditional levels. The reason you haven't talked -- heard us talk about software before is it really hasn't been different enough to highlight. The tech resales has been different enough that it's been a cause of the difference. So that's one reason. The variance between subscription and license, it really just depends on how we're selling it and how the clients buy it. We will -- as we go to market, we'll go to market in a variety of ways. They want to buy the software, want to buy it as a time -- term license that's more of a subscription, if they want on the pop health side, a lot of it is -- much of it's bought per member per month, so much more like a ASP or subscription basis. So I don't know that, that mix is relevant to our business as -- Q3 for some of those opportunities. Some of them of size have moved to a different period. But I think the -- I think, overall, we're a software company. We expect that to rebound. Our pipeline is strong, and we have the opportunity to go sell software. People are still buying software in this marketplace. So I think that our opportunities are there, and we just got to get to the point where we can -- and we are at that point where we can effectively deliver on a fixed-fee basis the technology they need. Zane made a really good point earlier about MACRA and the impact that has on just the general desire for technology. I think, as he was talking about the existing client base, what they're needing, some of that's going to be driven by their desire to have all of the data that's going to be required under MACRA and make sure that they have a single point of truth to go get that data, and they'd be able to get all the data that they need. So yes, I don't know how we sell it makes much difference. We still sell it. Q3, I think, was a low number. We've highlighted it because that's -- we want to be transparent. Q4, we don't think that's going to be an issue."

We're continually delivering the code. We're doing it on a timely basis. In some cases, to get to GA, we require some testing by our client partners, and sometimes that timing gets -- is not exactly within our schedule that we would do amortization. So I think you'll see next year a similar level of capitalization because we are still working on new stuff. The overall expense will take a slight hit from the amortization element of being slightly higher for the amount that didn't get hit into the number this year. So R&D expense basically is -- likely, as we look at it, goes up a little bit as we head into 2017, but not significant adjustments.

Keep in mind that if you look at year-to-date, in 2015, long-term bookings were 34% of our total bookings. If you look at this year, it's been about 29%. So actually, for us to be relatively flat or -- and looking to be slightly up over a year, where we're actually not getting the support from the long-term bookings, which we talked about from the Works deals, I think that's actually a point that shouldn't go unnoticed. But I think the -- from a -- relative to the overall contracts, all -- every contract has some degree of -- these aren't simple, but they aren't -- they're not rocket science, right? I mean, they want to buy stuff, and we want to sell stuff. There's a lot of parameters around that, but there are a lot of -- we have a lot of experience, they have a lot of experience. They also have a facility [ph] that helps them put the contract together. So I do think the complexity of the contracts is delaying the -- these signing of the contracts. I think the delay -- the -- I think that is just more a matter of the organization's timing and focus and strategic planning, and they don't have an outside regulatory time line that they have to go meet for some of these things. MACRA could change that. MACRA may make them do -- be more focused on making sure they have these solutions throughout all of their departments so that they can get the data they need to do that reporting. But I think the -- so I don't think the complexity -- these have always been somewhat complex. It's just a matter of the timing of the client to do that. The money is there. As Zane says, they're in our pipeline. It's just timing -- tying down the 90-day period at which it's going to go and actually sign is a little bit more traditional than what it was prior to having Meaningful Use and all those regulatory things that occurred."

Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the call. I'll lead off today with a review of the numbers.

Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the call. I'll lead off today with a review of the numbers. Zane Burke, our President, will follow me with the results, highlights and marketplace observations. And then Mike Nill, our Chief Operating Officer, will provide some operational highlights. Now I will turn to our results. 
While solid overall, our results included bookings and revenues slightly below our guidance range and earnings at the low end of our range. 
Starting with bookings. Our bookings revenue in Q3 was $1.434 billion, which reflects a 10% decrease from the very difficult comparable in Q3 of '15 when bookings were an all-time high and had grown 44% over the prior year. Relative to our guidance, bookings were $16 million below the low end of our range, but Q3 was still our second-highest bookings quarter ever. 
Our revenue backlog ended the quarter at $15.471 billion, which is up 11% from $13.876 billion a year ago. Revenue in the quarter was $1.185 billion, which is up 5% over Q3 of '15 but $15 million below the low end of our guidance range of $1.2 million to $1.275 billion. 
The revenue shortfall was mainly in system sales and was a result of lower-than-expected technology resale in software bookings for the quarter. The revenue composition for Q3 was $301 million in system sales, $253 million in support and maintenance, $608 million in services and $22 million in reimbursed travel. 
System sales revenue for the quarter was down 7% compared to Q3 of '15, with technology resale declining 21% and license software declining 12%, partially offset by 10% growth in subscriptions. System sales margin percent increased 150 basis points year-over-year to 69%, reflecting lower technology resale mix as well as lower commissions.
Moving to services. Total services revenue, including professional and managed services, was up 13% compared to Q3 of '15. This is in line with our expectations and continues to reflect good execution by our services organizations. Support and maintenance revenue increased 3% over Q3 of '15, slightly below our expectation of mid-single-digit growth due mostly to lower equipment maintenance revenue related to our lower technology resale.
Looking at revenue by geographic segment. Domestic revenue increased 6% over the year ago quarter to $1.06 billion, and non-U.S. revenue was flat year-over-year at $130 million. 
Moving to gross margin. Gross margin for Q3 was 84.6%, which is up from 83.1% in Q3 of '15 due mostly to the lower mix of technology resale and better services margins versus the year-ago period. Now I will discuss spending, operating margin and net earnings.
For these items, we provide both GAAP and adjusted or non-GAAP results. The adjusted results exclude share-based compensation expense, Health Services acquisition-related amortization, acquisition-related deferred revenue and other acquisition-related adjustments, which are detailed and reconciled to GAAP in our earnings release. Looking at operating spending, our third quarter GAAP operating expenses were $759 million compared to $722 million in the year-ago period. 
Adjusted operating expenses were $713 million, which is up 8% compared to Q3 of '15. This growth was primarily driven by growth in personnel expense related to revenue-generating associates, which is reflected in the sales and client service expense line that increased 11%. Software development increased 3%, G&A was basically flat and amortization of acquisition-related intangibles was down 30%. But this represents only a $1 million decline from $3 million to $2 million as this line excludes Health Services acquisition-related amortization in the non-GAAP view.
Moving to operating margins. Our Q3 GAAP operating margin was 20.4% compared to 19.1% in the year-ago period. Our adjusted operating margin was 24.4% in Q3, which is essentially flat to the year-ago period. This is in line with our previous indication that we expect margin expansion to be limited in 2016, but we do continue to believe we can expand margins 50-plus basis points annually after 2016.
Moving to net earnings and EPS. Our GAAP net earnings in Q3 were $170 million, $0.49 per diluted share. Adjusted net earnings were $203 million and adjusted diluted EPS was $0.59, which is up 9% compared to Q3 of '15.
Q3 tax rate was 30%, which is slightly below our expected rate. The benefit of this was largely offset by a $3.7 million write-off of a venture capital investment that is reflected in the other income line. 
Now I'd like to preview an expense we expect to incur in Q4. We recently offered a new voluntary separation plan, or VSP, to eligible associates. Similar to our program in February of last year, the VSP was made available to U.S. associates who meet a minimum level of combined age and tenure. The irrevocable acceptance period for most associates electing to participate in the VSP ends in December. 
Based on the number of eligible associates and our estimate of participation, we expect the corresponding pretax charge in the fourth quarter of 2016 to be approximately $30 million. Similar to our last VSP, we believe we'll be able to fill many of the positions vacated by participating associates with existing associates, which should create efficiencies in the future while also creating career growth opportunities for our associates.
This completely voluntary program will have a very small impact on our total headcount as the number of eligible associates we expect to accept the offer represents less than 2% of our total associates. Also, this should not be viewed as a layoff or a sign we don't expect to grow. We've grown our headcount by over 2,000 people this year and expect to grow headcount next year as well. 
Now I move to our balance sheet. We ended Q3 with $837 million of total cash and investments, which is up from $720 million in Q2. We did not repurchase stock during the quarter, which means $100 million still remains available for repurchase on the stock repurchase program authorized in March of this year.
Moving to debt. Our total debt, including capital lease obligations, is $573 million, which is down slightly compared to Q2. Total receivables ended the quarter at $985 million, which is essentially flat to Q2. Our Q3 DSO was 76 days, which is down 9 days from 85 in the year-ago period. 
Operating cash flow for the quarter was $240 million, down from $272 million in Q3 of '15. Year-to-date operating cash flow of $822 million still reflects strong growth over the $594 million of operating cash flows for the first 3 quarters of last year. We also expect a strong Q4 cash flow. Q3 capital expenditures were $110 million and capitalized software was $74 million.
Free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less capital purchases and capitalized software development cost, was $56 million for the quarter. This is flat compared to Q2 and down compared to Q3 of '15. Year-to-date, free cash flow of $266 million is nearly double the $134 million generated in the first 3 quarters of last year. Next year, we continue to expect a decline in capital expenditures, which we expect to drive stronger free cash flow. 
Now I'll go through guidance. We expect revenue in Q4 to be between $1.225 billion and $1.3 billion, with the midpoint reflecting growth of 7% over Q4 of '15. Our guidance reflects our expectation that system sales will increase sequentially compared to Q3 but will still be below our original target for the quarter due to lower expected software and hardware. 
We expect Q4 diluted EPS -- adjusted diluted EPS to be $0.60 to $0.62 per share, which is below our original expectations due to the impact of lower system sales. The midpoint of this range is flat compared to Q4 of '15 but recall, we had a $0.03 tax benefit last year.
Moving to bookings guidance. We expect bookings revenue in Q4 of $1.425 billion to $1.575 billion, and the midpoint reflects 11% growth over Q4 of '15. When added to year-to-date actuals, the midpoint of our Q4 guidance implies the following expected full year 2016 results: revenue of $4.8 billion compared to a guidance range of $4.9 billion to $5.0 billion, diluted -- adjusted diluted EPS of $2.31 compared to guidance of $2.30 to $2.40 and bookings of $5.5 billion compared to our stated target of exceeding 2015 bookings of $5.4 billion. 
When comparing to guidance we provided a year ago, revenue was the only key metric projected to be below our previously guided range. Recall that I shared at our Investor Day in March that approximately 79% of the $5 billion midpoint of our original revenue guidance was scheduled to come out of backlog that existed at the beginning of 2016. This means that we expect that about $4 billion of revenue will come from backlog that existed at the beginning of the year and the remaining $1 billion to come from current year bookings. So far this year, our conversion of backlog has been almost right at targeted levels, and we expect that to continue. Where we have missed has been on contribution of bookings to current year revenue, which is reflected in the lower system sales.
Fortunately, much more of this miss has been due to hardware than software, which is the main reason we still expect to be in our full year adjusted diluted EPS guidance range. Also, while below our initial range, our 2016 revenue is still expected to be 8% to 9% higher than 2015. This is a very tough comparable as it is 30% over 2014.
Now I'd like to provide initial expectations for 2017. We'll provide more formal guidance after we report Q4 results and finalize our 2017 plan. But based on the initial version of our plan, we currently expect 2017 revenue between $5.2 billion and $5.45 billion, reflecting 11% growth at the midpoint; and 2017 adjusted diluted EPS between $2.50 and $2.70, reflecting 13% growth at the midpoint. Current consensus estimates for both revenue and adjusted diluted EPS are at the high end of these guidance ranges, largely reflecting the fact the consensus was formed before our Q3 results and Q4 guidance. With that, I will turn the call over to Zane."

While our Q3 bookings were slightly below our guidance range, it was still the second-highest level of boo",1132,"Thanks, Marc. Good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'll provide color on our results and make some marketplace observations. I'll start with bookings. 
While our Q3 bookings were slightly below our guidance range, it was still the second-highest level of bookings in our history, second only to Q3 of 2015. In addition, we expect to return to strong bookings growth in Q4. 
Looking at mix. 34% of bookings in the quarter were from long-term contracts, reflecting one new ITWorks client and strong managed services bookings. This is in a more normal range for long-term bookings but our year-to-date mix is still lower than normal because of the lower long-term bookings in the first half of the year. Bookings this quarter included several large contracts, with 35 contracts over $5 million, including 26 over $10 million. From a new client perspective, 34% of bookings this quarter came from outside our core Millennium installed base. This high level of new business reflects our ongoing competitiveness and good market activity. 
Looking ahead, we continue to believe the replacement market will remain active given the high number of hospitals on legacy platforms, some that are being sunset, while yet others are preparing for future regulatory and payment models that many legacy platforms are not well equipped to handle. As we have previously discussed, the timing of these contracts have has proven to be less predictable, which I will discuss more in a minute.
First, I'll provide some more highlights on the quarter. I'll start with revenue cycle, which continues to be a strong contributor to our results. The market remains very focused on clinically-driven revenue cycle, which is driving strong sales into our base as well as inclusion in new EHR deals. We also had good contribution from RevWorks services in the quarter, with an expansion of an existing relationship and good contribution from our acute and ambulatory revenue cycle services offerings. Our competitiveness in revenue cycle continues to improve across both acute and ambulatory, and this is reflected in the fact that we've displaced more than 10 different competitors so far this year. Looking ahead, we remain optimistic that revenue cycle will continue to be a strong contributor to our growth. We still have significant whitespace on solution penetration, and opportunities for our consulting services remains high.
Now I'll shift to population health, where we continue to do very well. Our comprehensive approach to population health remains differentiated in the marketplace. The power of our platform and ability to integrate with the EHR workflow remain key differentiators, but we also continue to strengthen our competitiveness against the niche competitors we face across different categories such as registries, Enterprise Data Warehouse, analytics and care management. 
We are very pleased with our overall progress in population health. Just 2.5 years after our first HealtheIntent solution went live, we have now sold solutions to over 100 clients, and the HealtheIntent platform has over 300 data connections from more than 80 unique sources. As we have discussed, the scope of many initial population health contracts was small because most clients are not at risk for large portions of their populations, but we expect that ongoing shifts in reimbursement will lead to broader risk assumption, which should lead to adoption of more solutions and more lives being managed on a per member per month model. Additionally, we're discovering through the use of our solutions the access to more data will enhance our clients' fee-for-service models. 
Also, our addressable market for population health goes beyond our traditional EHR clients to include ACOs, health plans, governments and employers. In addition, the opportunity goes beyond modules to HealtheIntent platform as their significant markets provide high-value services that complement our solution offerings. Mike will discuss an example of where we are doing this.
Moving to the ambulatory market where we had another very good quarter. This quarter again included multiple competitor displacements and strong contributions from many -- from ambulatory EHR practice management and business office services. A noteworthy ambulatory win during the quarter was being selected to replace our primary cloud-based competitor for ambulatory EHR and business office services at a large investor-owned IDN that we believe is their largest client. We signed for one market in Q3 and anticipate expanding it to other markets in the future. This was one of 3 displacements of this competitor in the quarter. 
We also had a good quarter in the small hospital market. Our competitiveness in this market remains strong, and we are having success against all competitors. In Q3, we added 8 community hospitals with head-to-head wins against 5 different competitors. 
Outside the U.S., our revenue was flat year-over-year. Non-U.S. revenue represents about 11% of our total revenue, so the flat revenue in the quarter didn't really impact our total results. Despite some current macro headwinds, we do expect the non-U.S. market to become a more meaningful contributor to our results over the long term, given a relatively untapped EHR solution and services market. We also believe there will be a large market for our population health platform outside the U.S. 
Now I'd like to provide some perspective on our results and observations on the marketplace. Despite what was, in most ways, a solid quarter, we are always disappointed if we don't deliver against the guidance we established. So I'd like to comment about what I think are some of the elements contributing to results being somewhat less predictable. 
While our pipeline has continued to increase this year and is at record levels, we're in a period where the timing of closing opportunities has been more challenging. In the EHR replacement market, there continues to be a significant number of replacement opportunities, and we continue to win a majority of them. However, the reduced number of hard deadlines tied to regulatory mandates has impacted the client's sense of urgency. As I indicated, I believe this is primarily a timing issue as deals in our forecasts are changing from a calendar perspective but not being lost. 
We have also had less contribution from our ITWorks and RevWorks businesses this year despite a strong pipeline of opportunities. These opportunities remain, and I believe we'll see much stronger contributions from these businesses in 2017. 
Overall, I feel good about our ability to grow bookings in 2017 given the pipeline for larger Works contracts, ongoing EHR replacement opportunities and an expected continuation in the ramp of contributions from population health. And as Marc discussed, our initial view of 2015 reflects good top and bottom line growth. 
In summary, while our results were slightly below our guidance range for revenue bookings, I still view results as solid and a strong pipeline in place where we remain well positioned for growth going forward. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike."

Today, I'm going to discuss ITWorks and service collaboration with a large employer and leading health system. I'll start with ITWorks. We had a good quarter with 1 new ITWorks client and a strong sales back into",591,"Thanks, Zane. Good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'm going to discuss ITWorks and service collaboration with a large employer and leading health system. 
I'll start with ITWorks. We had a good quarter with 1 new ITWorks client and a strong sales back into our client base. Our new client in the quarter was a community hospital that also has 6 clinics. Like most of our ITWorks clients, they added additional solutions to the road map as part of their agreement. In this case, they'll be adding critical care, oncology and cardiology solutions. 
In addition, they're adding HealtheIntent population health solutions as well. As Zane mentioned, we've had less ITWorks activity so far this year than expected, but our pipeline remains strong and include some clients that are much larger than any  of our existing ITWorks client, which is why we are confident about the growth in ITWorks bookings for 2017. 
The value proposition to our clients remains very appealing, especially in an environment where they have pressure on operating cost, limited access to IT talent and increasing pressures in light of the industry issues related to security.
Now I'd like to discuss a new partnership between Cerner, a large employer and Memorial Hermann. Together, the 3 of us have collaborated to create a high-performance health network for employers. Employers are looking for strategies to improve quality, cost and experience. Leading health systems are creating and looking to grow their insurance offerings. As this emerging market takes shape, Cerner's investing in new capabilities to address this market opportunity. We think the chance to possibly disrupt and drive revenue is compelling. 
Cerner and Houston-based Memorial Hermann had a long history of collaboration and innovation. In addition to broad adoption of Cerner Millennium solutions, they're an early adopter of our initial HealtheIntent population health solutions have been steadily adopting more solutions and replacing niche suppliers over the past 3 years. This has contributed to their success of running one of the largest best-performing ACOs in the country. 
Memorial Hermann also has its own health plan built around their vast provider network in Houston. Within their plan, they've created their own custom, fully-insured product for a Fortune 500 employer. As part of the overall approach, Cerner's providing a concierge member services that will be tightly integrated into the health plans and health system, helping members maximize their benefits.
We are also providing the technology for the consumer engagement platform, which brings disparate patient and member portals into an organized consolidated experience. As you know, we have administered our own health plan for the past decade, which has allowed us to reduce the growth in our health care costs while also leading to a better health experience for our associates.
By leveraging this experience and partnering with an innovative world-class provider like Memorial Hermann and a large forward-thinking employer, we are building an approach to value-based care that can be a model for other markets. We believe large health systems are uniquely positioned to play a role in helping employers move toward value-based care by offering performance networks -- high-performance networks comprised of high-quality doctors that can provide plans that help employers bend the cost curve while also providing a better overall experience and improving the health of their workforce. We look forward to sharing more about this collaboration as we move through the enrollment and launch this -- in the launch of this offering and then expand these capabilities to other leading health systems, employers and markets. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to questions."

So the activity levels are incredibly good, and in fact, we had a very strong new business quarter overall. So we did very well. We just had anticipated doing slightly better, and there were a couple of opportunities that moved, and mostly from a -- just a pure timing perspective. So it's not a question of if they're going to do it, it's a when. And without the challenges of -- or without the regulatory elements behind it, the regulatory mandate times behind it, some of those clients are moving a little bit slower than they have in the past. So the budgets are there. The activity is there, and we're -- we had a high performance quarter in terms of numbers. We had -- we did not meet our expectations on what we had anticipated to come through for the quarter. So as we look forward, we see our pipeline of activity, and those that are in the pipe, as very strong and record levels of activity there. And as those of you who have followed us for a long time know, we go through a rigorous process in terms of how we qualify those opportunities, how they run through the -- our forecasting process, and that's helped us to provide good predictability historically around the closing of those -- some of those opportunities. In this case, as I have discussed previously, there are some timing gaps. So the activity remained strong. The ability to accurately predict within the number of weeks, days, et cetera, on how we close our business was not where we have seen it previously. So I -- does that make sense?"

As we go through the process, the process will remain as it's always remained. We will look at the business. We won't make any assumptions that we're going to grow bookings. We will expect bookings to be relatively flat and mix to be relatively similar. And we will then look at our forecast that goes out 4 quarters to see if that forecast supports those assumptions. We'll do all the things that we do relative to looking at spending and looking at opportunities. I would expect, while I don't have a number today, that a material component similar to what we saw coming into '16, which was in the 80%, 79% range, that we would see that same contribution from backlog as we roll into next year. I don't know that, that -- what that number exactly is going to be, but I think we're going to have that visibility. Once again, I think it will be a focus on the 20% that we've got to go drive, a lot of which comes through system sales. And that's going to be what we're going to focus on relative to our forecasting and our assumptions. But my philosophy is I'm going to do -- we're going to do all the work, and then we're going to provide you guidance based on our best work. So we can't really -- as I said, we can't -- my planning process assumes certain things, one of which is flat bookings. I don't expect to have flat bookings next year. We're basically guiding today that we're going to be relatively flat for bookings. But I think what -- as we look next year, we will certainly expect to get back on an uptick after coming off a very challenging year with a significant increase in bookings last year. Exceeding that very tough mark this year is actually a good accomplishment, but we'd expect to get back on track to growing bookings at a similar pace that we've seen in the past. So once again, my comments on plan is what we've traditionally always done from an actual expectation of bookings. The business expects to grow our bookings. Especially, as Zane talked about, in 2015, the Works businesses -- or 2016, the Works businesses weren't an integral part of a lot of our bookings number. We didn't do a lot of big ITWorks deals. In the pipeline, there are more opportunities in that space. And given that and the size of those bookings, gives us kind of a higher level of confidence that '17 bookings are going to be stronger than '16."

And for us, we don't expect -- we don't plan the bookings are going to grow. We expect them to grow, but by not building that into the plan, that gives us some degree of cushion should they not grow to deliver the numbers that we provide in our guidance. And so I think that's our expectation. I expect bookings to grow, Zane expects bookings to grow. The opportunities are there. So we will see higher bookings in '17. But relative to giving you guidance, especially preliminary guidance, we're not going to go build growth in bookings into those preliminary numbers. When we come back to you after Q4 ends with a completely built backlog and has -- have our best view, then we'll certainly tie down those numbers.

I think what we're seeing is move -- some of those things moving through the pipeline a little bit faster in terms of -- or not faster, but just maturing more appropriately through there. And so what's really going on is when you make this move, it's a combination of things. So there's always a -- how to go faster. And so when you look at MACRA and MIPS, our clients are going to have a need to be able to measure and monitor a number of different metrics and to begin to prepare for that. And when they look at the -- what the pressure they're under from Meaningful Use, from MACRA and MIPS, those kinds of things are going to drive additional behavior around ITWorks. In addition, the decreasing reimbursement environment creates a cost strain at a time when they need access to more data. They need more IT to actually be able to answer all these questions. So the combination of the -- those regulatory elements in a capital- and operating-constrained environment at a point in time when they're trying to just flat out execute, what we offer for our clients is provide that kind of leverage. And I think what we saw in '16 is there was almost a catch-your-breath mentality, in that we did not have any of those major elements around Meaningful Use. In the current year, we didn't have the MACRA, MIPS. And in addition, the bottom lines for our clients were still pretty strong. What you're seeing, as you go to the back half of the year, is a little bit of weakness with the bottom lines. And that regulatory environment's coming on. That's actually a really big positive for the IT -- for the Works programs themselves, both revenue cycle and ITWorks. And so in the conversations that we're having, they're continuing along. And I feel like those are going to mature in a good way in '17 that we just didn't see in '16 with that kind of catch-your-breath element in the -- in some of those areas."

So I think that's an important element to think of first when you're thinking about the health of where we are. As far as certain areas of strength in the marketplace, certainly, if you look at community hospitals, that's a very strong marketplace for us. The small-hospital marketplace is very strong. Some places where we uniquely compete, around the investor-owned segment, around the government, both from a federal and a state and local perspective.

Half of that came out this quarter as a result of lower system sales, right? We did not contemplate hardware decreasing 21%. We didn't contemplate software decreasing. The business is out there. As Zane has talked, it's primarily timing issues. But once those things hit a quarter, so you're down -- half of that $150 million you're out this quarter, that's going to have a carryover effect. So even in our Q4 guidance, where we expect system sales to rebound and get back to good levels, you've got the follow-on impact of that. So that's going to impact, basically, take you down the $150 million, just in the last half of the year. So I think that's the material amount, obviously. When we were giving guidance, we were looking for a pretty significant uptick as we went through. And if you look at our Q4 guidance, I mean, we're looking at a $78 million uptick at the midpoint of our revenue guidance range. So we are still looking to get a significant bump in revenue as we get to Q4. So I think, relative to what we saw at the beginning of the year, the backlog has played out just like we expected it to.

And we were -- you may be aware, we were awarded 6 of the 13 -- our clients were awarded 6 of the 13 challenge grants around innovation. So GBP 10 billion innovation grants by which they are charged with figuring out ways to use IT to lower cost and improve efficiencies in the U.K. And so I look at a couple of markets where there's recognition for -- they're doing well economically, and they want to go invest in health care structures like Belgium, like Sweden, or they're struggling and it's going to force the change, like the U.K. And I think we're well positioned in those marketplaces to have some good success.

So from our view, Q3 was a little bit of a unique circumstance, in that, as Zane talked about, there was a lot of business in the quarter and a lot of software opportunities that, because of the timing issues that we're seeing, didn't get done in Q3. We see that rebounding in Q4 and expect to get back kind of to more traditional levels. The reason you haven't talked -- heard us talk about software before is it really hasn't been different enough to highlight. The tech resales has been different enough that it's been a cause of the difference. So that's one reason. The variance between subscription and license, it really just depends on how we're selling it and how the clients buy it. We will -- as we go to market, we'll go to market in a variety of ways. They want to buy the software, want to buy it as a time -- term license that's more of a subscription, if they want on the pop health side, a lot of it is -- much of it's bought per member per month, so much more like a ASP or subscription basis. So I don't know that, that mix is relevant to our business as -- Q3 for some of those opportunities. Some of them of size have moved to a different period. But I think the -- I think, overall, we're a software company. We expect that to rebound. Our pipeline is strong, and we have the opportunity to go sell software. People are still buying software in this marketplace. So I think that our opportunities are there, and we just got to get to the point where we can -- and we are at that point where we can effectively deliver on a fixed-fee basis the technology they need. Zane made a really good point earlier about MACRA and the impact that has on just the general desire for technology. I think, as he was talking about the existing client base, what they're needing, some of that's going to be driven by their desire to have all of the data that's going to be required under MACRA and make sure that they have a single point of truth to go get that data, and they'd be able to get all the data that they need. So yes, I don't know how we sell it makes much difference. We still sell it. Q3, I think, was a low number. We've highlighted it because that's -- we want to be transparent. Q4, we don't think that's going to be an issue."

We're continually delivering the code. We're doing it on a timely basis. In some cases, to get to GA, we require some testing by our client partners, and sometimes that timing gets -- is not exactly within our schedule that we would do amortization. So I think you'll see next year a similar level of capitalization because we are still working on new stuff. The overall expense will take a slight hit from the amortization element of being slightly higher for the amount that didn't get hit into the number this year.

No, I think that's definitely a part of our plan, that you're going to -- the goal was around the $700 million, so that should be enough for us to go deliver on what we're trying to do. At the very worst, any gross changes should be kind of low single digit, so definitely growing at a rate lower than our revenue is growing. But I think, long term, if you're just looking at kind of ordinary increases, kind of mid-single-digit growth would be something that would be along the lines our expectation. We are -- we still have opportunities. We are still using some of the acquired resources to work and get to a point on some of the HS solutions. And so those people will become available as we roll forward. And we are investing heavily in our India campuses, so our expectation there is that we will be bringing online more IP resources in that environment, which, from a headcount perspective, will increase but from a cost perspective will fit in with that single -- mid-single-digit future growth."

So first of all, when we look at the contract history, right, it seems that, this quarter, the percent of contracts from -- that are long term in nature is the highest it's been since Q2. So shouldn't we think about this as a leading indicator for just, again, a step-down in booking conversion in 2017? I know that you talked about -- on the call about MACRA and Meaningful Use, but it seems that, that size of contract, the long -- the bigger the contract is, seems to me, it's more complicated and, therefore, slower to convert. That's question one. And then, second of all, if you can give us some sense of booking growth, what percent came from pop health and what percent from these big international contracts you've talked about?"

Keep in mind that if you look at year-to-date, in 2015, long-term bookings were 34% of our total bookings. If you look at this year, it's been about 29%. So actually, for us to be relatively flat or -- and looking to be slightly up over a year, where we're actually not getting the support from the long-term bookings, which we talked about from the Works deals, I think that's actually a point that shouldn't go unnoticed. But I think the -- from a -- relative to the overall contracts, all -- every contract has some degree of -- these aren't simple, but they aren't -- they're not rocket science, right? I mean, they want to buy stuff, and we want to sell stuff. There's a lot of parameters around that, but there are a lot of -- we have a lot of experience, they have a lot of experience. They also have a facility [ph] that helps them put the contract together. So I do think the complexity of the contracts is delaying the -- these signing of the contracts. I think the delay -- the -- I think that is just more a matter of the organization's timing and focus and strategic planning, and they don't have an outside regulatory time line that they have to go meet for some of these things. MACRA could change that. MACRA may make them do -- be more focused on making sure they have these solutions throughout all of their departments so that they can get the data they need to do that reporting. But I think the -- so I don't think the complexity -- these have always been somewhat complex. It's just a matter of the timing of the client to do that. The money is there. As Zane says, they're in our pipeline. It's just timing -- tying down the 90-day period at which it's going to go and actually sign is a little bit more traditional than what it was prior to having Meaningful Use and all those regulatory things that occurred."

I mean, it's -- we have some -- today, with the pilot version of pop health, a $5 million booking is a good-sized population health booking. So it's not moving the meter on a $1 billion bookings number. And relative to global, those bookings have been basically relatively flat if not a little bit lower. Over the last year, as Zane said, there are some opportunities going forward, especially in Canada and some other countries, that look like demand is beginning to pick up. So we think that will help the global side. But most of the bookings and most of the stuff growth you're seeing is not pop health, not international. It is our core, core businesses that we've always been in.
Well, I want to thank everybody for their time. I think we're still on pace to grow bookings and revenue this year over a very tough comp, and I think we're all absolutely on path to grow revenue and earnings double digit in 2017. 
So I think, based on our pipeline, based on the ITWorks opportunities we have, we do continue to expect to grow bookings year-over-year in 2017. 
With that, I will thank you for your attendance and bid you good day."
