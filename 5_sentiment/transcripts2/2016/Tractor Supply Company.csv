On the call with me today are Tony Crudele, our EVP and Chief Financial Officer; and Steve Barbarick, our EVP of Merchandising, Marketing and Supply Chain. 
As we previously reported, the fourth quarter fell below our expectations, due principally to the record warm temperatures across most of the company -- of the country. Our team managed the business to the best of their capabilities throughout the quarter and over the past several weeks, we have experienced improvement in our sales trends for cold water products as the weather and temperatures have normalized. As the most dependable supplier of every day basic products for the rural lifestyle, our customers shop our stores regularly for their basic needs. Those basic needs include: food and food for their pets, livestock and other animals; repair parts for their fence lines and animal containment; and maintenance products to ensure their equipment is properly serviced. This past quarter, with the unseasonably warm temperatures across many regions of the country, the need for cold weather products, such as insulated outerwear, snow blowers and heating products, just did not materialize as we had planned. Despite the warmer temperatures negatively affecting the sales of cold weather products, our sales of every day basic products in non-seasonal categories continue to perform well in the quarter, increasing in the low to mid-single digits on a comparable store basis. Sales in the Western region, where weather was more normalized, did experience high single digit comparable store sales and we delivered our 31st consecutive quarter of transaction count growth as a company. We believe this performance reinforces the resiliency of our model and our ability to meet the needs of our customers. We also feel that we are well-positioned with the current mix and depth of products to address our customers' ongoing seasonal and basic needs as we soon begin the transition for the spring selling season. 
Now, let me touch on a few operating highlights and key initiatives in the quarter and for the upcoming year. Our new customer loyalty program, Neighbor's Club, was rolled out to 140 stores in October, and the fourth quarter was our first full quarter with the program in place. While it is early and the program is still being tested, we are pleased with enrollment, which is running ahead of our initial projections, and our customer attribution rates continue to improve. Our customers appreciate the ability to stay connected with us and we are excited about the opportunity to use the data we're collecting to speak to them in more direct and relevant ways. We will continue to monitor the results from the initial test and determine next steps with the program later this year. 
In omnichannel, we made several enhancements to the platform in the fourth quarter. We increased the number of products and vendors available for dropship, we expanded our delivery capabilities for larger, heavier items, and we implemented new tools at the store level to improve the customer experience. And since introducing the fully responsive website, we have noted a steady increase in the amount of mobile traffic as well. Customers are choosing mobile to find their nearest store, check availability of product and view informational videos. We now have over 150 dropship vendors fully implemented and more customers are choosing the buy online and ship to store option. Later this year, we will be testing the buy online and pick up at store option. We are currently testing mobile devices as well in a select number of stores to assist our team members with faster availability of product information and improved checkout speed for our customers. Thus far, the feedback from both our team members and the customer has been positive. At less than 1% of our sales, omnichannel is still a very small part of the business, but it is growing rapidly, and we are delighted with the progress we have made with our offerings of content, community and commerce. 
With respect to merchandising and store operations, we will continue to test new products, raise the level of execution and improve our customer service in our stores. We continue to score best-in-class on our customer satisfaction surveys and look to further enhance their shopping experience. Our focus in 2016 will continue to be on new and differentiated products across the store, as well as opportunities to increase our exclusive brand penetration, always being mindful of the need to positioning for key national bands that our customers expect to find within our assortments. We are improving our in-store special order process in 2016 to enable our team members to better assist customers in locating the hard-to-find products through expanding our product offerings with our dropship vendors. And also, in 2016, we expect to begin implementation of a new product information management software tool. This will help us standardize product information across all selling channels and will improve the quality of images, product descriptions and the speed with which we can add additional dropship vendors to our omnichannel commerce capability. We are currently performing a comprehensive reset of our pet food area to better align our product selection with more relevant brand assortments at a localized level. Our recent announcement regarding our partnership with Save Our Shelter on the CW's television channel reinforces our commitment to pets and through the support of animal shelters, we hope to provide a healthy and happy environment for pets that are awaiting adoption. 
In our supply chain, we began shipping to stores some of the new Casa Grande, Arizona distribution center in the fourth quarter. This new DC will service the growing base of Western stores and will, over time, reduce outbound stem miles while improving our delivery capabilities. The facility has the capacity to service upwards of 250 stores and should be shipping to approximately 120 stores by the middle of this year. As part of our continuous improvement culture, we are also performing a comprehensive network analysis in 2016 to ensure that we have the plans in place to support our future growth. This is something we have completed every 3 to 4 years as a company as we've grown our store base. We will continue to reduce our impact on the environment through our stewardship program, and we are proud to have achieved our second lead Silver certification, with the opening of our distribution center in Casa Grande, Arizona. And in 2016 and 2017, we will be embarking on our largest environmental sustainability project to date, as we retrofit the entire store base with new LED lighting, which will substantially lower our future store lighting energy costs. 
In closing, let me extend my thanks to all of the hard-working team members of our Tractor Supply Company, who go the country mile everyday for our customers. It is our people who are the driving force behind the success of this company. 
With that said, I'd now like to turn the call over to Tony for a more detailed commentary on our fourth quarter results and an initial look to 2016."

Net income decreased 0.3% to $111.7 million and EPS increased 1.2% to $0.82 per diluted share. Comp",2371,"Thanks, Greg, and good afternoon, everyone. For the quarter ended December 26, 2015, on a year-over-year basis, net sales increased 3.9% to $1.65 billion. Net income decreased 0.3% to $111.7 million and EPS increased 1.2% to $0.82 per diluted share. Comp store sales decreased 1.4% in the fourth quarter compared to an increase of 5.3% in the last year's fourth quarter. Comp transaction count increased through the 31st consecutive quarter, gaining 0.6% on top of a 3% increase last year. Comparable transactions were driven by the continuous strength of our Q and everyday items. Average comp ticket decreased by 190 basis points compared to last year's 230 basis point increase. 
As a follow-up to the information previously provided our business update press release, comparable store sales in the fourth quarter were negatively impacted by the warm winter weather. Outside of seasonal, the quarter basic performed very well. Specifically, the livestock and pet category experienced a mid-single-digit same-store sales increase. Sales softness was primarily isolated to the cold weather seasonal categories of heating, specifically stoves and fuel, and installed outer wear, particularly in the Northeast and Midwest regions. The decline in these categories alone impact the comp sales by nearly 400 basis points. Since the business update press release, sales in cold weather categories have continued to improve. Sales were also impacted by softness in seasonal big-ticket items such as snow blowers, log splitters and generators. Big-ticket sales declined approximately 6%. However, we did see strong sales in trailers and other nonseasonal-related outdoor power equipment. We estimate the big-ticket had a negative impact on average ticket of 70 basis points. Sales in the Northeast and Midwest were the most impacted by the unseasonably warm weather. Excluding these regions, the remaining regions [indiscernible] countries aggregated in low single-digit same-store sales increase. The company had high single-digit comp sales in growth in the Western region, with seasonal [indiscernible] more normalized and the store base is less mature. 
In addition to the points highlighted in the business update, with respect to sales cadence through the quarter, November was the only month in which we experienced the comp sales decline as we are cycling at double-digit comp sales increase last year. Although still a small percent of sales, e-commerce sales increased 30% in Q4. Inflation continued to moderate and we estimated impact to sales negatively by approximately 15 basis points in the quarter. Overall, Texas stores performed at chain average. However, the delta in the performance of Texas oil patch stores widened relative to the chain average. When comparing only to the southern stores to just for the winter sales impact, Texas store sales performed approximately 350 basis points below that store group. Comp transactions for Texas were positive and performed consistent with the southern stores. The variance in performance primarily associated with products specific to the oil industry business that carry a higher average ticket and to a lesser extent, the related decline in traffic normally generated by these categories. 
Now turning to gross margin, which was essentially flat at 34.1% on top of last year's increase to 16 basis points. the merchandise team did a great job in managing gross margin during a difficult sales environment. While we are slightly more promotional with clearance than in the prior year, rate did not have a significant impact as we had very strong price management and [indiscernible] in other categories and strong market management related to several in-store events. The mix of merchandise had a negative impact of 11 basis points on gross margin. This was driven by the strong sales in key product, specifically animal feed and pet food, which are below chain average margin categories. The weakness in the winter seasonal sales did not have a material impact on gross margin as the soft sales in low-margin categories such as heating, were offset by the soft sales in high-margin categories, such as insulated outerwear. [indiscernible] was slightly unfavorable. Lower diesel prices offset the stem mile increase from our Western store expansion, but the higher mix of animal feed and pet food lead to modest increase in freight expense. We estimate that deflation had a minimal impact on gross margin as deflation continued to decline in the feed category. Import purchases in the quarter increased 22.3%, as some of the spring receipts came in early than last year. Imports represented 5.5% of the sales mix. Also, exclusive brand sales increased 3.9% and were approximately 29.4% of the sales mix. 
For the quarter, SG&A, including depreciation and amortization, was 23.6% of sales, an increase of 71 basis points over the prior year's quarter. We estimate that comp sales decline had an overall deleveraging impact on SG&A of approximately 35 basis points. We are very pleased with our payroll management in Q4 as the team reacted well in allocated payroll appropriately with the sales trends. We are essentially flat year-over-year as a percent of sales. We did incur startup expenses for our Southwest distribution center and the two mixing centers. Operational comps of these facilities, as well as the Hagerstown, DC expansion resulted in deleveraging of approximately 25 basis points. We also experienced slightly higher rental average for the new stores as they ramped to maturity. This was driven primarily by the Western store openings, which, as we discussed, generally open with the higher rent to sales ratio. The deleverage was offset by incentive compensation as a result of the Q4 performance was well below the run rate of the previous quarters. We estimate the year-over-year leverage was 37 basis points. Certain occupancy, costs, such as utilities and common area maintenance, decreased as a percent of sales as a result of the warmer winter. The tax rate for the quarter was 35.4% compared to 36.7% last year due to additional state and federal tax credits and a reduction in the FIN 48 reserve. 
Turning to the balance sheet. At the end of the year, we had a cash balance of $62.8 million and $150 million outstanding debt compared to a cash balance of $51.1 million and no outstanding debt at the end of last year. Since our revolver is due to mature in October this year, $150 million outstanding debt is shown as a current liability. In the event that we refinance this obligation before the issuance of our 10-K, a portion of or the entire amount may be classified as long-term. During the fourth quarter on the stock repurchase program, we acquired 565,000 shares for $48.7 million. Inventory per store, including inventory in transit, increased by approximately 7%. In transit merchandises included in the calculation to be more comparable as we had several Q1 receipts in December that were in transit at last year end. An increase in cold-weather seasonal categories accounted for 250 basis points of the increase while the inventory build at our new Southwest DC was approximately 100 basis points of the increase. The remaining increase is principally from investment in key categories to support the core sales. Capital expenditures for the year were $236.5 million compared to $160.6 million last year. We opened 26 stores and closed 2 Del's stores and 1 TSC store in the fourth quarter compared to 22 new stores opened and one Del's store closed in the fourth quarter of 2014. For the year, we opened 114 stores and closed 5 Del's stores and 3 TSC stores. The CapEx increase this year relates to the construction expenditures of our Southwest DC and the two mixing centers, three incremental soft developed new stores related to Del's transition and various IT projects and related hardware. 
Turning our attention to 2016. As Greg mentioned, we will continue to fund our ongoing operational initiatives, such as logistics, merchandise systems and omnichannel to position the company for future growth and at the same time, manage the business to deliver our targeted mid-teens EPS growth. We expect full year sales range from $6.9 billion to $7 billion. We have forecast the comp sales range between 3.5% and 5%. We're targeting 20 to 25 basis point improvement in EBIT margin compared to 2015. We anticipate net income to range from approximately $455 million to $467 million or $3.40 to $3.48 per diluted share. We expect to open between 115 and 120 new stores, with approximately 50% scheduled to open in the first half of the year. We will continue to transition Del's stores to Tractor Supply markets and we expect to close 15 Del's stores as we backfill the Northwest. Additionally, we forecast that our effective tax rate will be approximately 36.9%. We are initially targeting $230 million to $250 million of capital expenditures in 2016. As we've stated in over long-term capital plan, we look to manage annual capital expenditures in the $230 million to $280 million range and in order to be ratable in our allocation of capital and leverage depreciation expense over the next several years. In 2016, we will not have the significant cash investment of a distribution center. The key initiatives we have identified for 2016 include: LED lighting retrofit for half the chain and other store energy saving initiatives; store sales initiatives and resets; and new store capital related to higher number of retrofit stores. We plan to continue to make purchases under our share repurchase program as part of our long-term balanced approach to shareholder return. We expect to be in a ball position at the end of each quarter and target the year-end deposition to range between $200 million and $250 million. For modeling purposes, we estimate the diluted shares outstanding, inclusive of option grant and share repurchase activity, will be between $134 million to $134.5 million for the full year. 
Let me discuss some of the assumptions that helped us form our projection for 2016. Although our customer may have more discretionary income as a result of lower gas prices, we believe the consumer is more cautious as they are concerned about the direction of the economy and world events. As a retailer that serves our customers' everyday basic needs, we believe that we'll be able to continue to serve a key segment of our customers' lifestyle. As I mentioned on our third quarter call, fiscal year 2016 will be the year that we add a 53rd week to our retail fiscal year. The fourth quarter will also have an additional comparable sales day as a result of this calendar shift. Based on our current modeling, we estimate the EPS benefit in Q4 to be approximately $0.03 to $0.04. Last year, deflation moderated and averaged approximately 35 basis points. This year, we expect deflation to be less of a headwind, ranging between 20 basis points early in the year and flat in the second half of the year. Although we expect the oil patch stores to continue to perform below chain average, it is difficult to estimate the overall impact to sales in earnings as lower oil prices should have a favorable impact on transportation costs and consumer disposable income, which could favorably impact the remaining 90% of the chain. Other than the extremely warm weather in Q4, there were no significant weather events that we will be cycling. As we stated in the past, we generally benefit from an early spring. We are hopeful that the weather pattern as a result of [indiscernible] will bring an early start to spring. Although the first quarter have gone up to a solid start, let me remind you that March is the most impactful month in the quarter and is very dependent on spring weather. As we've emphasized in the past, we believe our the business can be more accurately set by focusing on the half, not the quarters. We would expect improvement in gross margin rate to come from the execution of our key gross margin initiatives, including price management, continued strong markdown in inventory management, strategic sourcing and exclusive brands. [indiscernible] expense should benefit from the lower diesel prices and the reduction of outbound stem miles as a result of opening the Southwest DC, which should be substantially offset by increased inbound transportation costs. We are targeting 20 to 25 basis point improvement in gross margin for the full year, net of the expected headwind from increased transportation costs and the mix of merchandise. In terms of cadence for gross margin percent improvement, we forecast a year-over-year improvement each quarter, with Q4 showing smallest increase. Additionally, we are more comfortable in our ability to improve [indiscernible] margins as the cold weather in late January have provided improved sell-through of winter merchandise. Although the January sales have reduced the carryover of some of the winter season merchandise, it's still may be challenging to improve inventory turns. We will not sacrifice in-stock levels for improved turns and we will continue to invest in key merchandise categories to drive sales and traffic. 
With respect to SG&A. We continue to target maintaining SG&A growth in line with our sales growth. We may have slight SG&A to leverage this year and estimate that we need at least a 4% comp sales increased to leverage SG&A year in 2016. Two factors to consider are: this will be the first year of operations of the southwest distribution center, this will increase SG&A on a year-over-year basis while improving gross margin through reduced transportation expense. We expect a net EPS decrease of approximately $0.04. We will continue to transition the did Del's stores to Tractor Supply stores. We expect to close 15 Del's stores, which will negatively impact EPS $0.1.5, allocating $0.05 to Q1 and $0.01 to Q4. With respect to SG&A by quarter, we believe that Q1 will be the most difficult quarter to leverage SG&A as it has a lower sales base and will be operating the new Southwest distribution center and have not yet cycled to mixing centers in our Hagertown DC operations. We expect SG&A year-over-year growth will be the largest in Q4 as a result of the incremental year-over-year incentive compensation and Del's' closings. 
As in the past, we'll provide more color regarding our expectations for the subsequent period at each quarterly conference call. 
That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we will now turn the call over for questions."

We're just basically giving you some data points for the quarter itself. As we look forward in the modeling, as you can estimate, we're somewhere in about the 400 to 450 basis points difference or delta between the oil patch stores and the base core stores themselves and/or the control groups that we compare to. And generally, that's what we are modeling for 2016. When it comes to any other type of dependencies relative to commodities, we really don't have any significant categories that we would be related to. And again, as in the past, for us, it's generally driven by unemployment in any particular economy. So if a plant goes out of business in a particular market, that would affect the store. But I don't think there's any specific dependency on the commodity itself."

Obviously, the chain, because of the cold weather up north, the overall chain comp was fairly low. So we felt that if we compared to the southern stores, it will be a more fair comparison. So that's all we're trying to highlight there. We felt that the South did relatively well. It was a positive comp and we thought a very reasonable comp relative to the performance of the company. Generally, when we talk south, we're talking pretty much Florida through Georgia, all the way through Louisiana. So we think that it's a reasonable comparison. We've also done some additional detail analysis where we try to identify what we believe are good control stores and we came up generally with the same delta between the oil patch stores and the chain. Generally -- the general direction again is, there is a delta between the oil patch stores and it -- but Texas as a whole, I think some of the key messaging around it is that, not oil patch Texas stores perform well and the write up there, actually, slightly above chain average, as well as the transactions are positives across the board as well. So even in some of the oil patch stores were driving transactions. And that's what brings us to our assessment that it's really relates more to the oil related merchandise, which tends to be higher [indiscernible]. And that we're still getting the transactions and the footsteps coming to the stores. So we feel pretty good about Texas and the way it's performing, given what we hear relative to some of the other companies that are struggling in the oil patch areas."

So as we look overall at productivity, what's important to us is, as we approve the stores that they live up to the pro forma that the we've designed for each store. And generally, over the years, we open up stores somewhere between $2.8 million and $3.2 million. Each groups of stores are going to vary, but will generally be in that range. So I would expect, as our chain continues to grow substantially, that the productivity will sort of stay in this range or at times, flatten out a bit. But relative to 2014, 2015, the -- there's nothing in that mix of stores that caused any sort of differentiation to how the stores have performed in the past."

On the call with me today are Tony Crudele, our EVP and Chief Financial Officer; and Steve Barbarick, our EVP of Merchandising, Marketing and Supply Chain. 
As we previously reported, the fourth quarter fell below our expectations, due principally to the record warm temperatures across most of the company -- of the country. Our team managed the business to the best of their capabilities throughout the quarter and over the past several weeks, we have experienced improvement in our sales trends for cold weather products as the weather and temperatures have normalized. As the most dependable supplier of every day basic products for the rural lifestyle, our customers shop our stores regularly for their basic needs. Those basic needs include: food and food for their pets, livestock and other animals; repair parts for their fence lines and animal containment; and maintenance products to ensure their equipment is properly serviced. This past quarter, with the unseasonably warm temperatures across many regions of the country, the need for cold weather products, such as insulated outerwear, snow blowers and heating products, just did not materialize as we had planned. 
Despite the warmer temperatures negatively affecting the sales of cold weather products, our sales of every day basic products in non-seasonal categories continued to perform well in the quarter, increasing in the low to mid-single digits on a comparable store basis. Sales in the Western region, where weather was more normalized, did experience high single digit comparable store sales and we delivered our 31st consecutive quarter of transaction count growth as a company. 
We believe this performance reinforces the resiliency of our model and our ability to meet the needs of our customers. We also feel that we are well positioned with the current mix and depth of products to address our customers' ongoing seasonal and basic needs as we soon begin the transition for the spring selling season. 
Now, let me touch on a few operating highlights and key initiatives in the quarter and for the upcoming year. Our new customer loyalty program, Neighbor's Club, was rolled out to 140 stores in October, and the fourth quarter was our first full quarter with the program in place. While it is early and the program is still being tested, we are pleased with enrollment, which is running ahead of our initial projections, and our customer attribution rates continue to improve. Our customers appreciate the ability to stay connected with us and we are excited about the opportunity to use the data we are collecting to speak to them in more direct and relevant ways. We will continue to monitor the results from the initial test and determine next steps with the program later this year. 
In omnichannel, we made several enhancements to the platform in the fourth quarter. We increased the number of products and vendors available for drop-ship, we expanded our delivery capabilities for larger, heavier items and we implemented new tools at the store level to improve the customer experience. And since introducing the fully responsive website, we have noted a steady increase in the amount of mobile traffic as well. Customers are choosing mobile to find their nearest store, check availability of product and view informational videos. We now have over 150 drop-ship vendors fully implemented and more customers are choosing the buy online and ship to store option. Later this year, we will be testing the buy online and pick up at store option. We are currently testing mobile devices as well in a select number of stores to assist our team members with faster availability of product information and improved checkout speed for our customers. Thus far, the feedback from both our team members and the customer has been positive. At less than 1% of our sales, omnichannel is still a very small part of the business, but it is growing rapidly and we are delighted with the progress we have made with our offerings of content, community and commerce. 
With respect to merchandising and store operations, we will continue to test new products, raise the level of execution and improve our customer service in our stores. We continue to score best-in-class on our customer satisfaction surveys and look to further enhance their shopping experience. Our focus in 2016 will continue to be on new and differentiated products across the store as well as opportunities to increase our exclusive brand penetration, always being mindful of the need to positioning for key national bands that our customers expect to find within our assortments. 
We are improving our in-store special order process in 2016 to enable our team members to better assist customers in locating the hard-to-find products through expanding our product offerings with our drop-ship vendors. And also in 2016, we expect to begin implementation of a new product information management software tool. This will help us standardize product information across all selling channels and will improve the quality of images, product descriptions and the speed with which we can add additional drop-ship vendors to our omnichannel commerce capability. We are currently performing a comprehensive reset of our pet food area to better align our product selection with more relevant brand assortments at a localized level. Our recent announcement regarding our partnership with Save Our Shelter on the CW's television channel reinforces our commitment to pets. And through the support of animal shelters, we hope to provide a healthy and happy environment for pets that are awaiting adoption. 
In our supply chain, we began shipping to stores from the new Casa Grande, Arizona distribution center in the fourth quarter. This new DC will service the growing base of Western stores and will, over time, reduce outbound stem miles while improving our delivery capabilities. The facility has the capacity to service upwards of 250 stores and should be shipping to approximately 120 stores by the middle of this year. As part of our continuous improvement culture, we are also performing a comprehensive network analysis in 2016 to ensure that we have the plans in place to support our future growth. This is something we have completed every 3 to 4 years as a company as we've grown our store base. We will continue to reduce our impact on the environment through our stewardship program, and we are proud to have achieved our second LEED Silver certification, with the opening of our distribution center in Casa Grande, Arizona. And in 2016 and 2017, we will be embarking on our largest environmental sustainability project to date, as we retrofit the entire store base with new LED lighting, which will substantially lower our future store lighting energy costs. 
In closing, let me extend my thanks to all of the hard-working team members of our Tractor Supply family, who go the country mile everyday for our customers. It is our people who are the driving force behind the success of our company. 
With that said, I'd now like to turn the call over to Tony for a more detailed commentary on our fourth quarter results and an initial look to 2016."

For the quarter ended December 26, 2015, on a year-over-year basis, net sales increased 3.9% to $1.65 billion. Net income decreased 0.3% to $111.7 million and EPS increased 1.2% to $0.82 per diluted share. Comp",2384,"Thanks, Greg, and good afternoon, everyone. For the quarter ended December 26, 2015, on a year-over-year basis, net sales increased 3.9% to $1.65 billion. Net income decreased 0.3% to $111.7 million and EPS increased 1.2% to $0.82 per diluted share. Comp store sales decreased 1.4% in the fourth quarter compared to an increase of 5.3% in the last year's fourth quarter. Comp transaction count increased for the 31st consecutive quarter, gaining 0.6% on top of a 3% increase last year. Comparable transactions were driven by the continued strength of our Q and everyday items. Average comp ticket decreased by 190 basis points compared to last year's 230-basis-point increase. 
As a follow-up to the information previously provided in our business update, press release, comparable store sales in the fourth quarter were negatively impacted by the warm winter weather. Outside of seasonal, the core basic business performed very well. Specifically, the livestock and pet category experienced a mid-single-digit same-store sales increase. Sales softness was primarily isolated to the cold weather seasonal categories of heating, specifically stoves and fuel, and installed outerwear, particularly in the Northeast and Midwest regions. The decline in these categories alone impact the comp sales by nearly 400 basis points. Since the business update press release, sales in cold weather categories have continued to improve. Sales were also impacted by softness in seasonal big-ticket items, such as snow blowers, log splitters and generators. Big-ticket sales declined approximately 6%. However, we did see strong sales in trailers and other nonseasonal-related outdoor power equipment. We estimate the big-ticket had a negative impact on average ticket of 70 basis points. Sales in the Northeast and Midwest were the most impacted by the unseasonably warm weather. Excluding these regions, the remaining regions of the country aggregated a low single-digit same-store sales increase. The company had high single-digit comp sales in growth in the Western region, with a seasonal chance for more normalized and the store base is less mature. 
In addition to the points highlighted in the business update, with respect to sales cadence through the quarter, November was the only month in which we experienced the comp sales decline as we are cycling at double-digit comp sales increase last year. Although still a small percent of sales, e-commerce sales increased 30% in Q4. Inflation continued to moderate and we estimate it impacted sales negatively by approximately 15 basis points in the quarter. 
Overall, Texas stores performed at chain average. However, the delta in the performance of the Texas oil patch stores widened relative to the chain average. When comparing only to the southern stores to adjust for the winter sales impact, Texas store sales performed approximately 350 basis points below that store group. Comp transactions for Texas were positive and performed consistent with the southern stores. The variance in performance is primarily associated with products specific to the oil industry business that carry a higher average ticket and to a lesser extent, the related decline in traffic normally generated by these categories. 
Now turning to gross margin, which was essentially flat at 34.1% on top of last year's increase of 16 basis points. The merchandise team did a great job in managing gross margin during a difficult sales environment. While we were slightly more promotional with clearance than in the prior year, rate did not have a significant impact as we had a very strong price management in feed and other categories and strong market management related to several in-store events. The mix of merchandise had a negative impact of 11 basis points on gross margin. This was driven by the strong sales in queue product, specifically animal feed and pet food, which are below chain average margin categories. The weakness in the winter seasonal sales did not have a material impact on gross margin as the soft sales in low-margin categories such as heating, were offset by the soft sales in high-margin categories, such as insulated outerwear. 
Freight was slightly unfavorable. Lower diesel prices offset the stem mile increase from our Western store expansion, but the higher mix of animal feed and pet food led to modest increase in freight expense. We estimate that deflation had a minimal impact on gross margin as deflation continued to decline in the feed category. Import purchases in the quarter increased 22.3%, as some of the spring receipts came in early than last year. Imports represented 5.5% of the sales mix. Also, exclusive brand sales increased 3.9% and were approximately 29.4% of the sales mix. 
For the quarter, SG&A, including depreciation and amortization, was 23.6% of sales, an increase of 71 basis points over the prior year's quarter. We estimate that comp sales decline had an overall deleveraging impact on SG&A of approximately 35 basis points. We are very pleased with our payroll management in Q4 as the team reacted well and allocated payroll appropriately with the sales trends. We were essentially flat year-over-year as a percent of sales. 
We did incur startup expenses for our Southwest distribution center and the 2 mixing centers. Operational costs of these facilities as well as the Hagerstown DC expansion resulted in deleveraging of approximately 25 basis points. We also experienced slightly higher rental average from the new stores as they ramped to maturity. This was driven primarily by the Western store openings, which, as we discussed, generally open with the higher rent-to-sales ratio. The deleverage was offset by incentive compensation as a result of the Q4 performance was well below the run rate of the previous quarters. We estimate the year-over-year leverage was 37 basis points. Certain occupancy costs, such as utilities and common area maintenance, decreased as a percent of sales as a result of the warmer winter. The tax rate for the quarter was 35.4% compared to 36.7% last year due to additional state and federal tax credits and a reduction in the FIN 48 reserve. 
Turning to the balance sheet. At the end of the year, we had a cash balance of $63.8 million and $150 million outstanding debt compared to a cash balance of $51.1 million and no outstanding debt at the end of last year. Since our revolver is due to mature in October this year, $150 million outstanding debt is shown as a current liability. In the event that we refinance this obligation before the issuance of our 10-K, a portion of or the entire amount may be classified as long term. 
During the fourth quarter on the stock repurchase program, we acquired 565,000 shares for $48.7 million. Inventory per store, including inventory in-transit, increased by approximately 7%. In-transit merchandise is included in the calculation to be more comparable as we had several Q1 receipts in December that were in transit at last year end. An increase in cold weather seasonal categories accounted for 250 basis points of the increase while the inventory build at our Southwest -- at our new Southwest DC was approximately 100 basis points of the increase. The remaining increase is principally from the investment in key categories to support the core sales. Capital expenditures for the year were $236.5 million compared to $160.6 million last year. We opened 26 stores and closed 2 Del's stores and 1 TSC store in the fourth quarter compared to 22 new stores opened and 1 Del's store closed in the fourth quarter of 2014. For the year, we opened 114 stores and closed 5 Del's stores and 3 TSC stores. The CapEx increase this year relates to the construction expenditures of our Southwest DC and the 2 mixing centers, 3 incremental self-developed new stores related to Del's transition and various IT projects and related hardware. 
Turning our attention to 2016. As Greg mentioned, we will continue to fund our ongoing operational initiatives, such as logistics, merchandise systems and omnichannel to position the company for future growth and at the same time, manage the business to deliver our target of mid-teens EPS growth. We expect full year sales to range from $6.9 billion to $7 billion. We have forecast the comp sales range between 3.5% and 5%. We are targeting 20 to 25-basis-point improvement in EBIT margin compared to 2015. We anticipate net income to range from approximately $455 million to $467 million or $3.40 to $3.48 per diluted share. We expect to open between 115 and 120 new stores, with approximately 50% scheduled to open in the first half of the year. We will continue to transition Del's stores to Tractor Supply markets and we expect to close 15 Del's stores as we backfill the Northwest. Additionally, we forecast that our effective tax rate will be approximately 36.9%. We are initially targeting $230 million to $250 million of capital expenditures in 2016. As we've stated in our long-term capital plan, we look to manage annual capital expenditures in the $230 million to $280 million range in order to be ratable in our allocation of capital and leverage depreciation expense over the next several years. In 2016, we will now have the significant cash investment of a distribution center. The key initiatives we have identified for 2016 include: LED lighting retrofit for half the chain and other store energy saving initiatives; store sales initiatives and resets; and new store capital related to higher number of retrofit stores. We plan to continue to make purchases under our share repurchase program as part of our long-term balanced approach to shareholder return. We expect to be in a borrow position at the end of each quarter and target the year-end deposition to range between $200 million and $250 million. For modeling purposes, we estimate the diluted shares outstanding, inclusive of option grant and share repurchase activity, will be between $134 million to $134.5 million for the full year. 
Let me discuss some of the assumptions that helped us form our projection for 2016. Although our customer may have more discretionary income as a result of lower gas prices, we believe the consumer is more cautious as they are concerned about the direction of the economy and world events. As a retailer that serves our customers' everyday basic needs, we believe that we'll be able to continue to serve a key segment of our customer's lifestyle. 
As I mentioned on our third quarter call, fiscal year 2016 will be the year that we add a 53rd week to our retail fiscal year. The fourth quarter will also have an additional comparable sales day as a result of this calendar shift. Based on our current modeling, we estimate the EPS benefit in Q4 to be approximately $0.03 to $0.04. Last year, deflation moderated and averaged approximately 35 basis points. This year, we expect deflation to be less of a headwind, ranging between 20 basis points early in the year and flat in the second half of the year. Although we expect the oil patch stores to continue to perform below chain average, it is difficult to estimate the overall impact to sales in earnings as lower oil prices should have a favorable impact on transportation costs and consumer disposable income, which could be favorably -- which could favorably impact the remaining 90% of the chain. 
Other than the extremely warm weather in Q4, there were no significant weather events that we will be cycling. As we stated in the past, we generally benefit from an early spring. We are hopeful that the weather pattern as a result of El Niño will bring an early start to spring. Although the first quarter have gone up to a solid start, let me remind you that March is the most impactful month in the quarter and is very dependent on spring weather. As we've emphasized in the past, we believe our the business can be more accurately assessed by focusing on the halfs, not the quarters. 
We would expect improvement in gross margin rate to come from the execution of our key gross margin initiatives, including price management, continued strong markdown in inventory management, strategic sourcing and exclusive brands. 
 
Trade expense should benefit from the lower diesel prices and the reduction of outbound stem miles as a result of opening the Southwest DC, which should be substantially offset by increased inbound transportation costs. We are targeting 20 to 25-basis-point improvement in gross margin for the full year, net of the expected headwind from increased transportation costs and the mix of merchandise. In terms of cadence for gross margin percent improvement, we forecast a year-over-year improvement each quarter, with Q4 showing the smallest increase. Additionally, we are more comfortable in our ability to improve Q1 margins as the cold weather in late January have provided improved sell-through of winter merchandise. Although the January sales have reduced the carryover of some of the winter season merchandise, it still may be challenging to improve inventory turns. We will not sacrifice in-stock levels for improved turns and we will continue to invest in key merchandise categories to drive sales and traffic. 
With respect to SG&A. We continue to target maintaining SG&A growth in line with our sales growth. We may have slight SG&A to leverage this year and estimate that we would need at least a 4% comp sales increase to leverage SG&A in 2016. Two factors to consider are: this will be the first year of operations of the southwest distribution center, this will increase SG&A on a year-over-year basis while improving gross margin through reduced transportation expense. We expect a net EPS decrease of approximately $0.04. We will continue to transition the Del's stores to Tractor Supply stores. We expect to close 15 Del's stores, which will negatively impact EPS $0.015, allocating $0.05 to Q1 and $0.01 to Q4. With respect to SG&A by quarter, we believe that Q1 will be the most difficult quarter to leverage SG&A as it has a lower sales base and will be operating the new Southwest distribution center and have not yet cycled to mixing centers in our Hagerstown DC operations. We expect SG&A year-over-year growth will be the largest in Q4 as a result of the incremental year-over-year incentive compensation and Del's closings.

The information that we're providing, we generally tend not to give too specific geographic information, but we have been getting a lot of questions, obviously, on Texas and the economy down in Texas. What we've noticed is that it's been a slow decline over the past few quarters. I -- we can't necessarily project whether that will continue. We're just basically giving you some data points for the quarter itself. As we look forward in the modeling, as you can estimate, we're somewhere in about the 400 to 450-basis-point difference or delta between the oil patch stores and the base core stores themselves and/or the control groups that we compare to. And generally, that's what we are modeling for 2016. When it comes to any other type of dependencies relative to commodities, we really don't have any significant categories that we would be related to. And again, as in the past, for us, it's generally driven by unemployment in any particular economy. So if a plant goes out of business in a particular market, that would affect the store. But I don't think there's any specific dependency on the commodity itself."

Generally, when we talk south, we're talking pretty much Florida through Georgia, all the way through Louisiana. So we think that it's a reasonable comparison. We've also done some additional detail analysis where we try to identify what we believe are good control stores and we came up generally with the same delta between the oil patch stores and the chain. Generally -- the general direction again is, there is a delta between the oil patch stores and it -- but Texas, as a whole, I think some of the key messaging around it is that, not all oil patch Texas stores perform well and the write-up there, actually, slightly above chain average, as well as the transactions are positives across the board as well. So even in some of the oil patch stores, we're driving transactions. And that's what brings us to our assessment that it really relates more to the oil-related merchandise, which tends to be higher ticket, and that we're still getting the transactions and the footsteps coming through the stores. So we feel pretty good about Texas and the way it's performing, given what we hear relative to some of the other companies that are struggling in the oil patch areas."

We're excited about the launch. We know that there's some pretty good market share out there today. And that product will be rolling in, in the next couple of weeks. And we also look at, like I said earlier, about our 4health line, which continues to perform very, very well. And I would tell you, we believe it's bringing in, even new customers that have never shopped our stores before, because it's got a good penetration nationally at this point. So a lot of work being done. We continue to dense pack the footage that we're using inside the store. And we're getting better dollars and profit per square foot as a result."

We can't give them pick up at store. And there's a difference. One is shipping it to the store from a DC or from a third-party.

A couple of things we noticed. They have no issue, no problem at all buying large ticket, big ticket items, because we have a delivery process that we can get the product to them, basically drop shipping it or taking it LTL, whether it's a safe or a riding lawn mower, what have you. They don't have that advantage necessarily when they buy at the store. That's typically bring your own truck, bring your trailer, or you we can arrange for deliveries from the store to your property. So that kind of surprised, I think, all of us. We still have a high component of footwear and apparel that's coming through. But they're buying across the store, ironically. And I think the more that we put product content out there and we're able to draw that in and expand the envelope in the files and some categories of things, whether it's Tractor parts or some of that hard to find type of items that only Tractor will probably have versus some other store, that's where the real opportunity is going to be. It's a true area for destination for us as we can evolve this. And I think it's quite exciting. We're not doing things like feed and food necessarily in a big way. We are selling some ped food, but this is really the kind of things that only Tractor Supply sells or that the customer is saying, ""Boy, it's easier for me just to buy it online and have it delivered to my property."""

We lock in the order, here's the price it's being sold at. Here's the ETA of delivery to your home or to store for pickup.

If someone comes in for a [indiscernible]  On a particular piece of equipment and we have maybe 20 in the store but they want 100, that's something you can go ahead and just place as a special order and give it to them.

So I'm excited about it. I don't -- I can't tell you how large that can be over time, but I do think that our guys in IT have done a wonderful job working with the stores to understand the need, to understand how this needs to work, take the work out of it from both them and the customer, make it easy.

There are some pockets, in particular, in one of our new markets that we went into over the last 1.5 years. Utah has come out slower than we had anticipated, so that's pulled the numbers down a little bit. And so sometimes, in some markets, it's going to take a while to build and strengthen our positioning in particular markets. But the one thing that we really like is how the stores have comped, particularly in the West as well. So in some cases, the stores may come out a little bit lighter in sales than we have anticipated. But overall, they're coming out consistent with our pro forma and they are ramping at a nice clip. So as we look overall at productivity, what's important to us is, as we approve the stores that they live up to the pro forma that we've designed for each store. And generally, over the years, we open up stores somewhere between $2.8 million and $3.2 million. Each year's groups of stores are going to vary but will generally be in that range. So I would expect, as our chain continues to grow substantially, that the productivity will sort of stay in this range or at times flatten out a bit.

On the call with me today are Tony Crudele, our EVP and Chief Financial Officer; and Steve Barbarick, our EVP of Merchandising, Marketing and Supply Chain. 
As we previously reported, the fourth quarter fell below our expectations, due principally to the record warm temperatures across most of the company -- of the country. Our team managed the business to the best of their capabilities throughout the quarter and over the past several weeks, we have experienced improvement in our sales trends for cold weather products as the weather and temperatures have normalized. As the most dependable supplier of everyday basic products for the rural lifestyle, our customers shop our stores regularly for their basic needs. Those basic needs include: food and food for their pets, livestock and other animals; repair parts for their fence lines and animal containment; and maintenance products to ensure their equipment is properly serviced. This past quarter, with the unseasonably warm temperatures across many regions of the country, the need for cold weather products, such as insulated outerwear, snow blowers and heating products, just did not materialize as we had planned. 
Despite the warmer temperatures negatively affecting the sales of cold weather products, our sales of everyday basic products in non-seasonal categories continued to perform well in the quarter, increasing in the low to mid-single digits on a comparable store basis. Sales in the Western region, where weather was more normalized, did experience high single-digit comparable store sales and we delivered our 31st consecutive quarter of transaction count growth as a company. 
We believe this performance reinforces the resiliency of our model and our ability to meet the needs of our customers. We also feel that we are well positioned with the current mix and depth of products to address our customers' ongoing seasonal and basic needs as we soon begin the transition for the spring selling season. 
Now let me touch on a few operating highlights and key initiatives in the quarter and for the upcoming year. Our new customer loyalty program, Neighbor's Club, was rolled out to 140 stores in October, and the fourth quarter was our first full quarter with the program in place. While it is early and the program is still being tested, we are pleased with the enrollment, which is running ahead of our initial projections, and our customer attribution rates continue to improve. Our customers appreciate the ability to stay connected with us and we are excited about the opportunity to use the data we are collecting to speak to them in more direct and relevant ways. We will continue to monitor the results from the initial test and determine next steps with the program later this year. 
In omnichannel, we made several enhancements to the platform in the fourth quarter. We increased the number of products and vendors available for drop-ship, we expanded our delivery capabilities for larger, heavier items and we implemented new tools at the store level to improve the customer experience. And since introducing the fully responsive website, we have noted a steady increase in the amount of mobile traffic as well. Customers are choosing mobile to find their nearest store, check availability of product and view informational videos. We now have over 150 drop-ship vendors fully implemented and more customers are choosing the buy online and ship to store option. Later this year, we will be testing the buy online and pick up at store option. We are currently testing mobile devices as well in a select number of stores to assist our team members with faster availability of product information and improved checkout speed for our customers. Thus far, the feedback from both our team members and the customer has been positive. At less than 1% of our sales, omnichannel is still a very small part of the business, but it is growing rapidly and we are delighted with the progress we have made with our offerings of content, community and commerce. 
With respect to merchandising and store operations, we will continue to test new products, raise the level of execution and improve our customer service in our stores. We continue to score best-in-class on our customer satisfaction surveys and look to further enhance their shopping experience. Our focus in 2016 will continue to be on new and differentiated products across the store as well as opportunities to increase our exclusive brand penetration, always being mindful of the need to positioning for key national bands that our customers expect to find within our assortments. 
We are improving our in-store special order process in 2016 to enable our team members to better assist customers in locating the hard-to-find products through expanding our product offerings with our drop-ship vendors. And also in 2016, we expect to begin implementation of a new product information management software tool. This will help us standardize product information across all selling channels and will improve the quality of images, product descriptions and the speed with which we can add additional drop-ship vendors to our omnichannel commerce capability. We are currently performing a comprehensive reset of our pet food area to better align our product selection with more relevant brand assortments at a localized level. Our recent announcement regarding our partnership with Save Our Shelter on the CW's television channel reinforces our commitment to pets. And through the support of animal shelters, we hope to provide a healthy and happy environment for pets that are awaiting adoption. 
In our supply chain, we began shipping to stores from the new Casa Grande, Arizona distribution center in the fourth quarter. This new DC will service the growing base of Western stores and will, over time, reduce outbound stem miles while improving our delivery capabilities. The facility has the capacity to service upwards of 250 stores and should be shipping to approximately 120 stores by the middle of this year. As part of our continuous improvement culture, we are also performing a comprehensive network analysis in 2016 to ensure that we have the plans in place to support our future growth. This is something we have completed every 3 to 4 years as a company as we've grown our store base. We will continue to reduce our impact on the environment through our stewardship program, and we are proud to have achieved our second LEED Silver Certification, with the opening of our distribution center in Casa Grande, Arizona. And in 2016 and 2017, we will be embarking on our largest environmental sustainability project to date, as we retrofit the entire store base with new LED lighting, which will substantially lower our future store lighting energy costs. 
In closing, let me extend my thanks to all of the hard-working team members of our Tractor Supply family, who go the country mile every day for our customers. It is our people who are the driving force behind the success of our company. 
With that said, I'd now like to turn the call over to Tony for a more detailed commentary on our fourth quarter results and an initial look for 2016."

For the quarter ended December 26, 2015, on a year-over-year basis, net sales increased 3.9% to $1.65 billion. Net income decreased 0.3% to $111.7 million and EPS increased 1.2% to $0.82 per diluted share. Comp",2387,"Thanks, Greg, and good afternoon, everyone. For the quarter ended December 26, 2015, on a year-over-year basis, net sales increased 3.9% to $1.65 billion. Net income decreased 0.3% to $111.7 million and EPS increased 1.2% to $0.82 per diluted share. Comp store sales decreased 1.4% in the fourth quarter, compared to an increase of 5.3% in the last year's fourth quarter. Comp transaction count increased for the 31st consecutive quarter, gaining 0.6% on top of a 3% increase last year. Comparable transactions were driven by the continued strength of our C.U.E. and everyday items. Average comp ticket decreased by 190 basis points compared to last year's 230-basis-point increase. 
As a follow-up to the information previously provided in our business update press release, comparable store sales in the fourth quarter were negatively impacted by the warm winter weather. Outside of seasonal, the core basic business performed very well. Specifically, the livestock and pet category experienced a mid-single-digit same-store sales increase. Sales softness was primarily isolated to the cold weather seasonal categories of heating, specifically stoves and fuel, and installed (sic) [ insulated ] outerwear, particularly in the Northeast and Midwest regions. The decline in these categories alone impacted comp sales by nearly 400 basis points. Since the business update press release, sales in cold weather categories have continued to improve. Sales were also impacted by softness in seasonal big ticket items, such as snow blowers, log splitters and generators. Big ticket sales declined approximately 6%. However, we did see strong sales in trailers and other nonseasonal-related outdoor power equipment. We estimate that big ticket had a negative impact on average ticket of 70 basis points. Sales in the Northeast and Midwest were the most impacted by the unseasonably warm weather. Excluding these regions, the remaining regions of the country aggregated a low single-digit same-store sales increase. The company had high single-digit comp sales in growth in the Western region, where the seasonal trends were more normalized and the store base is less mature. 
In addition to the points highlighted in the business update, with respect to sales cadence through the quarter, November was the only month in which we experienced a comp sales decline, as we are cycling a double-digit comp sales increase last year. Although still a small percent of sales, e-commerce sales increased 30% in Q4. Deflation continued to moderate and we estimate impacted sales negatively by approximately 15 basis points in the quarter. 
Overall, Texas stores performed at chain average. However, the delta in the performance of the Texas oil patch stores widened relative to the chain average. When comparing only to the Southern stores to adjust for the winter sales impact, Texas store sales performed approximately 350 basis points below that store group. Comp transactions for Texas were positive and performed consistent with the Southern stores. The variance in performance is primarily associated with products specific to the oil industry business that carry a higher average ticket and to a lesser extent, the related decline in traffic normally generated by these categories. 
Now turning to gross margin, which was essentially flat at 34.1% on top of last year's increase of 16 basis points. The merchandise team did a great job in managing gross margin during a difficult sales environment. While we were slightly more promotional with clearance than in the prior year, rate did not have a significant impact as we had very strong price management in feed and other categories and strong markdown management related to several in-store events. The mix of merchandise had a negative impact of 11 basis points on gross margin. This was driven by the strong sales in C.U.E. product, specifically animal feed and pet food, which are below chain average margin categories. The weakness in winter seasonal sales did not have a material impact on gross margin, as the soft sales in low-margin categories such as heating, were offset by the soft sales in high-margin categories, such as insulated outerwear. 
Freight was slightly unfavorable. Lower diesel prices offset the stem mile increase from our Western store expansion, but the higher mix of animal feed and pet food led to modest increase in freight expense. We estimate that deflation had a minimal impact on gross margin as deflation continued to decline in the feed category. Import purchases in the quarter increased 22.3%, as some of the spring receipts came in early than last year. Imports represented 5.5% of the sales mix. Also, exclusive brand sales increased 3.9% and were approximately 29.4% of the sales mix. 
For the quarter, SG&A, including depreciation and amortization, was 23.6% of sales, an increase of 71 basis points over the prior year's quarter. We estimate the comp sales decline had an overall deleveraging impact on SG&A of approximately 35 basis points. We are very pleased with our payroll management in Q4 as the team reacted well and allocated payroll appropriately with the sales trends. We were essentially flat year-over-year as a percent of sales. 
We did incur startup expenses for our Southwest distribution center and the 2 mixing centers. Operational costs of these facilities as well as the Hagerstown DC expansion resulted in deleveraging of approximately 25 basis points. We also experienced slightly higher rental leverage from the new stores as they ramped to maturity. This was driven primarily by the Western store openings, which, as we discussed, generally open with a higher rent-to-sales ratio. The deleverage was offset by incentive compensation as a result of the Q4 performance was well below the run rate of the previous quarters. We estimate the year-over-year leverage was 37 basis points. Certain occupancy costs, such as utilities and common area maintenance, decreased as a percent of sales as a result of the warmer winter. The tax rate for the quarter was 35.4%, compared to 36.7% last year due to additional state and federal tax credits and a reduction in the FIN 48 reserve. 
Turning to the balance sheet. At the end of the year, we had a cash balance of $63.8 million and $150 million outstanding debt compared to a cash balance of $51.1 million and no outstanding debt at the end of last year. Since our revolver is due to mature in October this year, the $150 million outstanding debt is shown as a current liability. In the event that we refinance this obligation before the issuance of our 10-K, a portion of or the entire amount may be classified as long term. 
During the fourth quarter on the stock repurchase program, we acquired 565,000 shares for $48.7 million. Inventory per store, including inventory in transit, increased by approximately 7%. In-transit merchandise is included in the calculation to be more comparable as we had several Q1 receipts in December that were in transit at last year end. An increase in cold weather seasonal categories accounted for 250 basis points of the increase, while the inventory build at our Southwest -- at our new Southwest DC was approximately 100 basis points of the increase. The remaining increase is principally from investment in key categories to support the core sales. Capital expenditures for the year were $236.5 million, compared to $160.6 million last year. We opened 26 stores and closed 2 Del's stores and 1 TSC store in the fourth quarter, compared to 22 new stores opened and 1 Del's store closed in the fourth quarter of 2014. For the year, we opened 114 stores and closed 5 Del's stores and 3 TSC stores. The CapEx increase this year relates to the construction expenditures of our Southwest DC and the 2 mixing centers, 3 incremental self-developed new stores related to the Del's transition and various IT projects and related hardware. 
Turning our attention to 2016. As Greg mentioned, we will continue to fund our ongoing operational initiatives, such as logistics, merchandise systems and omnichannel to position the company for future growth and at the same time, manage the business to deliver our target of mid-teens EPS growth. We expect full year sales to range from $6.9 billion to $7 billion. We have forecasted comp sales to range between 3.5% and 5%. We are targeting 20 to 25-basis-point improvement in EBIT margin compared to 2015. We anticipate net income to range from approximately $455 million to $467 million or $3.40 to $3.48 per diluted share. We expect to open between 115 and 120 new stores, with approximately 50% scheduled to open in the first half of the year. We will continue to transition Del's stores to Tractor Supply markets and we expect to close 15 Del's stores as we backfill the Northwest. Additionally, we forecast that our effective tax rate will be approximately 36.9%. We are initially targeting $230 million to $250 million of capital expenditures in 2016. As we've stated in our long-term capital plan, we look to manage annual capital expenditures in the $230 million to $280 million range in order to be ratable in our allocation of capital and leverage depreciation expense over the next several years. In 2016, we will not have the significant cash investment of a distribution center. The key initiatives we have identified for 2016 include: LED lighting retrofit for half the chain and other store energy-saving initiatives; store sales initiatives and resets; and new store capital related to higher number of retrofit stores. We plan to continue to make purchases under our share repurchase program as part of our long-term balanced approach to shareholder return. We expect to be in a borrow position at the end of each quarter and target the year-end debt position to range between $200 million and $250 million. For modeling purposes, we estimate the diluted shares outstanding, inclusive of option grant and share repurchase activity, will be between 134 million to 134.5 million for the full year. 
Let me discuss some of the assumptions that helped us form our projection for 2016. Although our customer may have more discretionary income as a result of lower gas prices, we believe the consumer is more cautious as they are concerned about the direction of the economy and world events. As a retailer that serves our customers' everyday basic needs, we believe that we'll be able to continue to serve a key segment of our customer's lifestyle. 
As I mentioned on our third quarter call, fiscal year 2016 will be the year that we add a 53rd week to our retail fiscal year. The fourth quarter will also have an additional comparable sales day as a result of this calendar shift. Based on our current modeling, we estimate the EPS benefit in Q4 to be approximately $0.03 to $0.04. Last year, deflation moderated and averaged approximately 35 basis points. This year, we expect deflation to be less of a headwind, ranging between 20 basis points early in the year and flat in the second half of the year. Although we expect the oil patch stores to continue to perform below chain average, it is difficult to estimate the overall impact to sales and earnings as lower oil prices should have a favorable impact on transportation costs and consumer disposable income, which could be favorably -- which could favorably impact the remaining 90% of the chain. 
Other than the extremely warm weather in Q4, there were no significant weather events that we will be cycling. As we've stated in the past, we generally benefit from an early spring. We are hopeful that the weather pattern as a result of El Niño will bring an early start to spring. Although the first quarter has gotten off to a solid start, let me remind you that March is the most impactful month in the quarter and is very dependent on spring weather. As we've emphasized in the past, we believe our business can be more accurately assessed by focusing on the halfs, not the quarters. 
We would expect improvement in gross margin rate to come from the execution of our key gross margin initiatives, including price management, continued strong markdown and inventory management, strategic sourcing and exclusive brands. 
 
Freight expense should benefit from the lower diesel prices and the reduction of outbound stem miles as a result of opening the Southwest DC, which should be substantially offset by increased inbound transportation costs. We are targeting 20 to 25-basis-point improvement in gross margin for the full year, net of the expected headwind from increased transportation costs and the mix of merchandise. In terms of cadence for gross margin percent improvement, we forecast a year-over-year improvement each quarter, with Q4 showing the smallest increase. Additionally, we are more comfortable in our ability to improve Q1 margins as the cold weather in late January has provided improved sell-through of winter merchandise. Although the January sales have reduced the carryover of some of the winter season merchandise, it still may be challenging to improve inventory turns. We will not sacrifice in-stock levels for improved turns and we will continue to invest in key merchandise categories to drive sales and traffic. 
With respect to SG&A, we continue to target maintaining SG&A growth in line with our sales growth. We may have slight SG&A deleverage this year and estimate that we would need at least a 4% comp sales increase to leverage SG&A in 2016. Two factors to consider are: this will be the first year of operations of the Southwest distribution center. This will increase SG&A on a year-over-year basis while improving gross margin through reduced transportation expense. We expect a net EPS decrease of approximately $0.04. We will continue to transition the Del's stores to Tractor Supply stores. We expect to close 15 Del's stores, which will negatively impact EPS $0.015, allocating $0.005 to Q1 and $0.01 to Q4. With respect to SG&A by quarter, we believe that Q1 will be the most difficult quarter to leverage SG&A, as it has a lower sales base and we'll be operating the new Southwest distribution center and have not yet cycled 2 mixing centers and our Hagerstown DC operations. We expect SG&A year-over-year growth will be the largest in Q4 as a result of the incremental year-over-year incentive compensation and Del's closings. 
As in the past, we will provide more color regarding our expectations for the subsequent period at each quarterly conference call. That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we will now turn the call over for questions."

The information that we're providing, we generally tend not to give too specific geographic information, but we have been getting a lot of questions, obviously, on Texas and the economy down in Texas. What we've noticed is that it's been a slow decline over the past few quarters. I -- we can't necessarily project whether that will continue. We're just basically giving you some data points for the quarter itself. As we look forward in the modeling, as you can estimate, we're somewhere in about the 400 to 450-basis-point difference or delta between the oil patch stores and the base core stores themselves and/or the control groups that we compare to. And generally, that's what we are modeling for 2016. When it comes to any other type of dependencies relative to commodities, we really don't have any significant categories that we would be related to. And again, as in the past, for us, it's generally driven by unemployment in any particular economy. So if a plant goes out of business in a particular market, that would affect the store. But I don't think there's any specific dependency on the commodity itself."

So that's all we're trying to highlight there. We felt that the South did relatively well. It was a positive comp and we thought a very reasonable comp relative to the performance of the company. Generally, when we talk South, we're talking pretty much Florida through Georgia, all the way to Louisiana. So we think that it's a reasonable comparison. We've also done some additional detail analysis where we try to identify what we believe are good control stores and we came up generally with the same delta between the oil patch stores and the chain. Generally -- the general direction, again, is there is a delta between the oil patch stores and it -- but Texas as a whole, I think some of the key messaging around it is that non-oil patch Texas stores performed well and they're right up there, actually, slightly above chain average, as well as the transactions are positives across the board as well. So even in some of the oil patch stores, we're driving transactions. And that's what brings us to our assessment that it really relates more to the oil-related merchandise, which tends to be higher ticket, and that we're still getting the transactions and the footsteps coming through the stores. So we feel pretty good about Texas and the way it's performing, given what we hear relative to some of the other companies that are struggling in the oil patch areas."

As we enter in -- obviously, reading on the economy and on the consumer, it appears that this consumer confidence is starting to wane a little bit. So we understand that they're going to be more cautious. But I think our perspective really is that they have basic needs and they continue to fulfill those needs and that we feel that we're properly positioned as that supplier of everyday basic needs for the rural lifestyle."

And if there's something that happens within their sales trends that needs to be addressed more readily than once a week, like trucks moving from Waco or from Waverly, that's the big advantage. The distance between our store and our DC now is much closer. We can push goods to those stores much faster. And we'll learn from the replenishment cycles here how many days we can take off of that. But being closer has its advantages, particularly if there's a weather event or something that we have to react to when business tends to trend faster than what maybe we've seen from a steady-state before. So that's the advantage. I can't tell you how much sales it will or won't bring. That's a hard thing to judge at this point. We've only got 50-some odd stores running today.

So I said it's less than 1%. It's growing rapidly. We had to get the new platform up. Rob Mills' team did a wonderful job working with Letitia, who is our VP in that area, really getting this platform up and running. We've still got some tooling to do to it. What we're seeing is customers are going to the web to research. And then from the web, they're starting to look at the option of buying it online, picking it up at the store or having it shipped to the store. Right now, we can give them the option of ship to store. We can't give them pick up at store. And there's a difference. One is shipping it to the store from a DC or from a third party. The other is, it's actually being held there at the store for the customer when they buy it online. So we're seeing that, and then this whole special order component that's coming online later this year I'm very excited about. It's one of the areas that our stores struggle with daily, trying to leaf through books and catalogs and that, that'll take all of that out of the way and they'll be able to go to the screen there at the service center that's in the middle of the store and pull things, pull information up, address the customer, customer can transact there. And we'll be able to even give them the ETA of when it's going to be there and so on. No one in our space is doing anything quite like this and it's pretty exciting. But how big will it be over time?

The new process will be very fast, very easy for both the team member and the customer at the store. They can transact at the store. And it's going to give us real-time data. We lock in the order, here's the price it's being sold at. Here's the ETA of delivery to your home or to our store for pickup. We think it's going to be used primarily, again, for the kinds of things that you can't find in the store or the kinds of quantities of things that you're buying that you need quite a few of. If someone comes in for rake teeth on a particular piece of equipment and we have maybe 20 in the store but they want 100, that's something you can go ahead and just place as a special order and get it to them. Or if it's a -- we carry 5 SKUs of a category and we now have the ability through the longer tail to have all 50 SKUs, the customer has the choice to be able to buy deeper into that category or from that vendor. So I'm excited about it. I don't -- I can't tell you how large that can be over time, but I do think that our guys in IT have done a wonderful job working with the stores to understand the need, to understand how this needs to work, take the work out of it for both them and the customer, make it easy.

There are some pockets, in particular, in one of our new markets that we went into over the last 1.5 years, Utah, has come out slower than we had anticipated, so that's pulled the numbers down a little bit. And so sometimes, in some markets, it's going to take a while to build and strengthen our positioning in particular markets. But the one thing that we really like is how the stores have comped, particularly in the West as well. So in some cases, the stores may come out a little bit lighter in sales than we had anticipated. But overall, they're coming out consistent with our pro forma and they are ramping at a nice clip. So as we look overall at productivity, what's important to us is, as we approve the stores, that they live up to the pro forma that we've designed for each store. And generally, over the years, we open up stores somewhere between $2.8 million and $3.2 million. Each year's groups of stores is going to vary but will generally be in that range. So I would expect, as our chain continues to grow substantially, that the productivity will sort of stay in this range or at times flatten out a bit. But relative to 2014 -- 2015, there's nothing in that mix of stores that caused any sort of differentiation to how the stores have performed in the past."

On the call with me today are Tony Crudele, our EVP and Chief Financial Officer; and Steve Barbarick, our EVP and Chief Merchandising, Marketing and Supply Chain Officer. 
We are pleased with our results and execution of our business in the first quarter. Comparable store sales increased 4.9% and were driven by increases in both traffic and ticket. This was our 32nd consecutive quarter of positive comparable transaction counts. Our sales were balanced across product categories and regions, with all of our major product categories and geographic regions generating positive comparable store sales. Once again, the Tractor Supply team did an excellent job managing the business this quarter, and we believe our results demonstrate the resiliency of our business model.
Our customers rely on us to be the most dependable supplier of everyday basic products for their rural lifestyle needs. They shop our stores regularly, and they buy what they need when they need it for their pets, animals, land and equipment. Some of their needs are year-round, some are seasonal and some are weather-related. We know the seasons and weather can influence the timing of when our customers shop certain products, and we also know it's our job to manage our inventory accordingly. 
One change that we implemented in the first quarter of this year was the flow of our seasonal inventory into our stores. Last year, we had 3 regional set dates for spring merchandise, which ranged from mid-January through early February. Acting on feedback from our store managers and analyzing sales and inventory data, we changed our approach for 2016 and moved to 5 set dates this year, starting with the South in late December and ending with the North in late February, early March. This allowed us to capture early spring sales in the South and additional late winter sales in the North. Combining this with our clearance pricing tool from Revionics, we were able to drive sales, preserve margin and reduce inventory levels as we transitioned our business during the first quarter.
This quarter, we did have a little help from mother nature. And we had the right products in stock to meet our customers' needs in both seasonal and everyday Q products. When the snow and cold finally arrived in many of our markets in January, we had the inventory to meet those customer needs, and we sold through a good portion of our winter season merchandise. 
Similarly, when spring-like conditions developed in a number of our southern markets in March, we were again ready, and our continued investments in everyday Q products kept us positioned to drive this segment of our business throughout the quarter as well. As a result, we experienced solid sales across both everyday and seasonal products for the quarter.
This year's Chick Days event, which was another success generating strong traffic driving sales and growing awareness regarding backyard poultry across a wide range of customers. The event features live chicks and ducklings, along with all the necessary products for their care and maintenance. This is one of our most popular events of the year and positions Tractor Supply as an authority in the areas of animal care and sustainable living. It speaks to the self-reliance and sustainability trend that we continue to see in our marketplace and is a great example of how we are appealing to a wider consumer base.
As we discussed briefly at our Investment Community Day in February, we have identified broad consumer trends around 4 areas of our business, those being pets, services, my land and sustainable living. We believe these are go-forward areas of opportunity for Tractor Supply, and we are developing and testing strategies for products and events that will address these trends.
Another area of growing importance is the application of technology into our business, including systems involving inventory management, allocation, customer information capture and mobile. We continue to improve our processes to better manage inventory, enhance our assortments and grow the business longer term. 
One example is our new planogram facility, which we call our Merchandise Innovation Center or MIC. This facility enables our teams and vendors to work in a simulated store environment as we plan changes through assortment mix and store visuals and overall flow changes within the four-wall store. 
In addition to the MIC, enhancements across our planning and allocation systems are important tools that we are utilizing to improve our business to meet the ever-evolving needs of our customers. And as we look ahead to the remainder of 2016, we will continue to enhance our omnichannel platform, customer relationship marketing and our IT security across the entire organization. We're also in the process of implementing the EMV chip and signature platform in our stores, with completion expected by mid of this year.
On the merchandising side, our focus will continue to be on new and differentiated products across the store as well as opportunities to expand our offerings and exclusive brands, always being mindful of the positioning for the key national brands that our customers expect to find within our assortments.
On the store operations side of our business, we are improving our in-store special ordering process and making it easier for our team members to assist customers in locating hard-to-find products to expanded product offerings, utilizing our dropship vendors. 
And we are embarking on the largest store sustainability project to date with the retrofitting of the entire store base with new LED lighting in 2016 and 2017. Thus far, we have converted 1/3 of our stores planned for 2016 with LED lighting, and those stores are benefiting from improved lighting quality as well as lower energy and maintenance costs. 
So in closing, let me extend my sincere thanks to all of the hard-working dedicated team members of Tractor Supply. And it is really our people who serve our customers every day and execute our business strategies that drive our continued success as a company.
With that said, I'd like to turn the call over to Tony now for a more detailed commentary on our first quarter results and our outlook for 2016. Tony?"
329501,331035502,960222,"Tractor Supply Company, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 20, 2016",2016-04-20,"Earnings Calls","Tractor Supply Company","Executives","Thanks, Greg, and good afternoon, everyone. For the quarter ended March 26, 2016, on a year-over-year basis, net sales increased 10.2% to $1.47 billion, net income increased 16.6% to $66.7 million and EPS increased 19% to $0.50 per diluted share. Comp s",1421,"Thanks, Greg, and good afternoon, everyone. For the quarter ended March 26, 2016, on a year-over-year basis, net sales increased 10.2% to $1.47 billion, net income increased 16.6% to $66.7 million and EPS increased 19% to $0.50 per diluted share. 
Comp store sales increased 4.9% in the first quarter compared to an increase of 5.7% in last year's first quarter. Comp transaction count increased for the 32nd consecutive quarter, gaining 4.2% on top of a 4.8% increase last year. As Greg mentioned, sales trends were broad-based in both from a product and a geographic perspective. Everyday items continued to perform well and were a key driver of the comp transaction increase. Average comp ticket increased by 73 basis points on top of last year's 84 basis point increase. The increase was driven principally by an increase in the number of SKUs per transaction, partially offset by deflation.
Sale of spring seasonal merchandise were also strong in the quarter as we experienced a March that was warmer than average and also warmer than last year. Spring seasonal categories such as lawn and garden, riding lawn mowers, fencing, animal health and fly control performed very well. 
Winter seasonal sales were strong in January as the cold weather rolled in, but sales softened in February, which was much warmer than last year. Cold weather in January gave us the opportunity to clear most of our winter clothing, specifically insulated outerwear. However, the cold weather was too brief to drive significant sales in certain hardline categories such as heating and log splitters. 
Other comments regarding sales in the quarter. Comp sales were positive across all regions and major product categories, with the strongest sales coming in the Southeast, which was impacted less by the mild winter season. Big-ticket comp sales increased slightly but below chain average and were driven by early spring season, riding lawn mower and trailer sales, partially offset by soft sales in winter power equipment and log splitters. 
Transactions drove the increase in the big-ticket comps, but overall, the increase in big-ticket did that materially impact overall company comps. We estimate that deflation impacted sales by approximately 25 basis points, driven principally by livestock feed, lubricant and propane categories. 
As I mentioned, mild March temperatures benefited the sale of early spring merchandise. Also, Easter was 1 week earlier than last year, thereby shifting the strong Friday and Saturday sales days into our first quarter. We estimate that these 2 factors positively impacted first quarter results by pulling forward approximately $18 million in sales and $0.02 per diluted share.
The oil patch stores continued to comp positive but below chain average, consistent with the trend in Q4. Transaction count remained firm in these stores. We're expecting that the impact will moderate through the year as we begin to cycle the trend from last year. 
Now turning to gross margin, which increased 30 basis points to 33.7% versus a decrease of 8 basis points last year. The merchandise team did a great job driving gross margin while managing through our winter seasonal clearance. We benefited from our key margin initiatives of price management, imports and exclusive brands. The benefit of these initiatives more than offset the impact from heavier clearance sales of winter seasonal merchandise. 
The merchandise team continues to work diligently with our vendor community on both the product development and cost sides of the business, which is improving margin. We also benefited from vendor support programs associated with the initial stocking of our new Arizona DC. While we loaded the DC with inventory late last year, we began shipping to stores in late December and recognizing the benefit as we sold through the merchandise in Q1. We estimate this positively impacted gross margin by approximately 15 basis points. We estimate that deflation had a minimal impact on gross margin as deflation continued to decline in the feed category. 
Lower diesel prices and the decrease in outbound miles to our Western stores were more than offset by an increase in inbound miles to our Arizona DC and a higher mix of freight-intensive categories. The mix of merchandise had a slight negative impact in gross margin. Higher sales of riding lawn mowers were offset by lower sales of heating products, both of which carry below chain average margins. 
For the quarter, SG&A, including depreciation and amortization, was 26.3% of sales, an improvement of 11 basis points over the prior year's quarter. Overall, SG&A benefited from a strong comp sales increase. However, we are very pleased with the expense control and leverage that we achieved, given that we had an estimated headwind of $3.5 million or approximately 24 basis points from the startup of our Arizona DC and the 2 mixing centers that were not in operation last year at this time.
We are very pleased with our payroll management in Q1 as the team reacted well and allocated payroll appropriately with the sales trends, resulting in leverage in the quarter. Medical and related payroll expenses levered as well. We also leveraged occupancy as we benefited from lower utilities and store winter maintenance expense as a result of the mild winter weather. This benefit was partially offset by the winter leverage that we experienced as we opened new stores. 
Incentive compensation did not have a material impact on SG&A in this quarter. The tax rate for the quarter was 36.8% compared to 36.9% last year due to additional state tax credits. Both periods include onetime state tax credits that we do not anticipate receiving at the same level in subsequent years.
Now turning to the balance sheet. At the end of Q1, we had a cash balance of $74.5 million and $230 million in outstanding debt compared to cash balance of $57 million and $60 million in outstanding debt last year. During the first quarter, under our stock repurchase program, we acquired close to 1.2 million shares for $99.1 million. 
Inventory per store increased 1% and annualized inventory turns decreased to 2.94. We had anticipated that turns would decrease in Q1 as we began the quarter heavy with winter seasonal merchandise as well as stocking our new Arizona DC. We are pleased how the team managed the markdown cadence and inventory purchases, bringing the quarter-end balances down essentially to last year's levels. We believe we're well positioned as we head into the second quarter.
Capital expenditures for the quarter were $36.7 million compared to $48.8 million last year. We opened 36 stores and closed 3 Del's stores in the first quarter compared to 41 new stores opened and 1 Del's store closed in the first quarter of 2015. 
So with respect to our financial expectations for the full year 2016, as noted in today's press release, we have reiterated our previous guidance. While our Q1 performance was strong, there's still a lot of business ahead of us in the spring and summer season. As we have said in the past, it is best to evaluate our performance by the half as we see the spring season play out in full. Therefore, we believe it's prudent to revisit our guidance at the end of the second quarter.
As a reminder, we expect full year sales to range from $6.9 billion to $7 billion. We have forecasted comp sales to range between 3.5% and 5%. We are targeting a 20 to 25 basis point improvement in EBIT margin compared to 2015. We anticipate net income to range from approximately $455 million to $467 million or $3.40 to $3.48 per diluted share. We expect to open between 115 to 120 new stores, with approximately 50% [ph] scheduled to be opened in the first half of the year. Additionally, we forecast our effective tax rate will be approximately 36.9%.
While we still expect capital expenditures in 2016 to range between $230 million to $250 million, and we're making good progress on our LED lighting retrofit expect to be completing this year's target of half of the chain by mid-third quarter. 
We'll continue to make purchases on the share repurchase program as part of our long-term balanced approach to shareholder return. We expect to be in a borrow position at the end of each quarter and target year-end debt position to be approximately $200 million. We continue to expect deflation to be less of a headwind, ranging between 20 basis points early in the year and flat in the second half of the year. 
So that concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we will now turn the call over for questions."

So we don't see it being a significant increase relative to an appetite. I think that one of the biggest drivers is the share repurchase program, and so that would be a driver. And again, given how we set up the program using the matrix and how the stock price move dictate how much we attribute to that program, and that would drive some of the outstanding debt on the balance sheet. So I think we clearly would like to support the stock and continue to do so. But we have a lot of flexibility when it comes to the capital structure because of the repurchase program."

So it does relate -- it does impact the timing of the sales. Now when we make an assessment as to what the pull forward is, we do our best to look at some of the key categories, and we look at sort of the slope of the sales line to try to understand if it was accelerated and try to project what that means to a quarter.

And we go through a pretty rigorous category management review of the pet aisle, supplies, treats as well as pet food every year and in some cases, twice a year. We are seeing growth. We've got -- we look at 3 different segments. We look at the grocery segment, we look at the segment we look at the premium -- superpremium segment. And I would tell you we're seeing growth in all 3 of those segments. We put a lot of our real estate as well as some of our marketing into the superpremium side of the business and our investments. And we think we're getting a very nice payoff. Customers are responding favorably and I think that's one of the things that may be growing our transaction count. We talked a lot about Q needs and this will be a good example of that."

On the call with me today are Tony Crudele, our EVP and Chief Financial Officer; and Steve Barbarick, our EVP and Chief Merchandising, Marketing and Supply Chain Officer. 
We are pleased with our results and execution of our business in the first quarter. Comparable store sales increased 4.9% and were driven by increases in both traffic and ticket. This was our 32nd consecutive quarter of positive comparable transaction counts. Our sales were balanced across product categories and regions, with all of our major product categories and geographic regions generating positive comparable store sales. Once again, the Tractor Supply team did an excellent job managing the business this quarter, and we believe our results demonstrate the resiliency of our business model.
Our customers rely on us to be the most dependable supplier of everyday basic products for their rural lifestyle needs. They shop our stores regularly, and they buy what they need when they need it, for their pets, animals, land and equipment. Some of their needs are year-round, some are seasonal, and some are weather related. We know the seasons and weather can influence the timing of when our customers shop certain products, and we also know it's our job to manage our inventory accordingly. 
One change that we implemented in the first quarter of this year was the flow of our seasonal inventory into our stores. Last year, we had 3 regional set dates for spring merchandise, which ranged from mid-January through early February. Acting on feedback from our store managers and analyzing sales and the inventory data, we changed our approach for 2016 and moved to 5 set dates this year, starting with the South in late December and ending with the North in late February, early March. This allowed us to capture early spring sales in the South and additional late winter sales in the North. Combining this with our clearance pricing tool from Revionics, we were able to drive sales, preserve margin and reduce inventory levels as we transitioned our business during the first quarter.
This quarter, we did have a little help from mother nature. And we had the right products in stock to meet our customers' needs in both seasonal and everyday queue products. When the snow and cold finally arrived in many of our markets in January, we had the inventory to meet those customer needs, and we sold through a good portion of our winter seasonal merchandise. 
Similarly, when spring-like conditions developed in a number of our southern markets in March, we were again ready, and our continued investments in everyday queue products kept us positioned to drive this segment of our business throughout the quarter as well. As a result, we experienced solid sales across both everyday and seasonal products for the quarter.
This year's Chick Days event, which was another success, generating strong traffic, driving sales and growing awareness regarding backyard poultry across a wide range of customers. The event features live chicks and ducklings, along with all the necessary products for their care and maintenance. This is one of our most popular events of the year and positions Tractor Supply as an authority in the areas of animal care and sustainable living. It speaks to the self reliance and sustainability trend that we continue to see in our marketplace and is a great example of how we are appealing to a wider consumer base.
As we discussed briefly at our Investment Community Day in February, we have identified broad consumer trends around 4 areas of our business, those being pets, services, my land and sustainable living. We believe these are go-forward areas of opportunity for Tractor Supply, and we are developing and testing strategies for products and events that will address these trends.
Another area of growing importance is the application of technology into our business, including systems involving inventory management, allocation, customer information capture and mobile. We continue to improve our processes to better manage inventory, enhance our assortments and grow the business longer term. 
One example is our new planogram facility, which we call our Merchandise Innovation Center, (sic) [Merchandising Innovation Center] or MIC. This facility enables our teams and vendors to work in a simulated store environment as we plan changes through assortment mix, in-store visuals and overall flow changes within the 4-wall store. 
In addition to the MIC, enhancements across our planning and allocation systems are important tools that we are utilizing to improve our business to meet the ever-evolving needs of our customers. 
And as we look ahead to the remainder of 2016, we will continue to enhance our omnichannel platform, customer relationship marketing and our IT security across the entire organization. We're also in the process of implementing the EMV chip-and-signature platform in our stores, with completion expected by mid of this year.
On the merchandising side, our focus will continue to be on new and differentiated products across the store as well as opportunities to expand our offerings and exclusive brands, always being mindful of the positioning for the key national brands that our customers expect to find within our assortments.
On the store operations side of our business, we are improving our in-store special ordering process and making it easier for our team members to assist customers in locating hard-to-find products, to expanded product offerings, utilizing our Drop Ship Vendors. 
And we are embarking on the largest store sustainability project to date with the retrofitting of the entire store base with new LED lighting in 2016 and 2017. Thus far, we have converted 1/3 of our stores planned for 2016 with LED lighting, and those stores are benefiting from improved lighting quality as well as lower energy and maintenance costs. 
So in closing, let me extend my sincere thanks to all of the hard-working dedicated team members of Tractor Supply. And it is really our people who serve our customers everyday and execute our business strategies that drive our continued success as a company.
With that said, I'd like to turn the call over to Tony now for a more detailed commentary on our first quarter results and our outlook for 2016. Tony?"

For the quarter ended March 26, 2016, on a year-over-year basis, net sales increased 10.2% to $1.47 billion, net income increased 16.6% to $66.7 million, and EPS increased 19% to $0.50 per diluted share. Comp",1421,"Thanks, Greg, and good afternoon, everyone. For the quarter ended March 26, 2016, on a year-over-year basis, net sales increased 10.2% to $1.47 billion, net income increased 16.6% to $66.7 million, and EPS increased 19% to $0.50 per diluted share. 
Comp store sales increased 4.9% in the first quarter compared to an increase of 5.7% in last year's first quarter. Comp transaction count increased for the 32nd consecutive quarter, gaining 4.2% on top of a 4.8% increase last year. 
As Greg mentioned, sales trends were broad-based, both from a product and a geographic perspective. Everyday items continued to perform well and were a key driver of the comp transaction increase. 
Average comp ticket increased by 73 basis points on top of last year's 84 basis point increase. The increase was driven principally by an increase in the number of SKUs per transaction, partially offset by deflation.
Sale of spring seasonal merchandise were also strong in the quarter as we experienced a March that was warmer than average and also warmer than last year. Spring seasonal categories, such as lawn and garden, riding lawn mowers, fencing, animal health and fly control performed very well. 
Winter seasonal sales were strong in January as the cold weather rolled in, but sales softened in February, which was much warmer than last year. Cold weather in January gave us the opportunity to clear most of our winter clothing, specifically insulated outerwear. However, the cold weather was too brief to drive significant sales in certain hardline categories such as heating and log splitters. 
Other comments regarding sales in the quarter. Comp sales were positive across all regions and major product categories, with the strongest sales coming in the Southeast, which was impacted less by the mild winter season. 
Big-ticket comp sales increased slightly, but below chain average and were driven by early spring season, riding lawn mower and trailer sales, partially offset by soft sales in winter power equipment and log splitters. 
Transactions drove the increase in the big-ticket comps, but overall, the increase in big-ticket did not materially impact overall company comps. 
We estimate that deflation impacted sales by approximately 25 basis points, driven principally by livestock feed, lubricant and propane categories. 
As I mentioned, mild March temperatures benefited the sale of early spring merchandise. Also, Easter was 1 week earlier than last year, thereby shifting the strong Friday and Saturday sales days into our first quarter. We estimate that these 2 factors positively impacted first quarter results by pulling forward approximately $18 million in sales and $0.02 per diluted share.
The oil patch stores continued to comp positive but below chain average, consistent with the trend in Q4. Transaction count remained firm in these stores. We are expecting that the impact will moderate through the year as we begin to cycle the trend from last year. 
Now turning to gross margin, which increased 30 basis points to 33.7% versus a decrease of 8 basis points last year. The merchandise team did a great job driving gross margin while managing through our winter seasonal clearance. We benefited from our key margin initiatives of price management, imports and exclusive brands. The benefit of these initiatives more than offset the impact from heavier clearance sales of winter seasonal merchandise. 
The merchandise team continues to work diligently with our vendor community on both the product development and cost sides of the business, which is improving margin. We also benefited from vendor support programs associated with the initial stocking of our new Arizona DC. 
While we loaded the DC with inventory late last year, we began shipping to stores in late December and recognizing the benefit as we sold through the merchandise in Q1. We estimate this positively impacted gross margin by approximately 15 basis points. 
We estimate that deflation had a minimal impact on gross margin as deflation continued to decline in the feed category. 
Lower diesel prices and the decrease in outbound stem miles to our Western stores were more than offset by an increase in inbound miles to our Arizona DC and a higher mix of freight-intensive categories. The mix of merchandise had a slight negative impact in gross margin. Higher sales of riding lawn mowers were offset by lower sales of heating products, both of which carried below chain average margins. 
For the quarter, SG&A, including depreciation and amortization, was 26.3% of sales, an improvement of 11 basis points over the prior year's quarter. Overall, SG&A benefited from a strong comp sales increase. However, we are very pleased with the expense control and leverage that we achieved, given that we had an estimated headwind of $3.5 million or approximately 24 basis points from the startup of our Arizona DC and the 2 mixing centers that were not in operation last year at this time.
We are very pleased with our payroll management in Q1 as the team reacted well and allocated payroll appropriately with the sales trends, resulting in leverage in the quarter. Medical and related payroll expenses levered as well. We also leveraged occupancy as we benefited from lower utilities and store winter maintenance expense as a result of the mild winter weather. This benefit was partially offset by the rental leverage that we experienced as we opened new stores. 
Incentive compensation did not have a material impact on SG&A in this quarter. 
The tax rate for the quarter was 36.8% compared to 36.9% last year due to additional state tax credits. Both periods include onetime state tax credits that we do not anticipate receiving at the same level in subsequent years.
Now turning to the balance sheet. At the end of Q1, we had a cash balance of $74.5 million and $230 million in outstanding debt compared to cash balance of $57 million and $60 million in outstanding debt last year. 
During the first quarter, under our stock repurchase program, we acquired close to 1.2 million shares for $99.1 million. 
Inventory per store increased 1%, and annualized inventory turns decreased to 2.94. We had anticipated that turns would decrease in Q1 as we began the quarter heavy with winter seasonal merchandise as well as stocking our new Arizona DC. 
We are pleased how the team managed the markdown cadence and inventory purchases, bringing the quarter-end balances down essentially to last year's levels. We believe we're well positioned as we head into the second quarter.
Capital expenditures for the quarter were $36.7 million compared to $48.8 million last year. 
We opened 36 stores and closed 3 Del's stores in the first quarter compared to 41 new stores opened and 1 Del's store closed in the first quarter of 2015. 
So with respect to our financial expectations for the full year 2016, as noted in today's press release, we have reiterated our previous guidance. 
While our Q1 performance was strong, there's still a lot of business ahead of us in the spring and summer season. As we have said in the past, it is best to evaluate our performance by the half as we see the spring season play out in full. Therefore, we believe it's prudent to revisit our guidance at the end of the second quarter.
As a reminder, we expect full year sales to range from $6.9 billion to $7 billion. We have forecasted comp sales to range between 3.5% and 5%. We are targeting a 20 to 25 basis point improvement in EBIT margin compared to 2015. We anticipate net income to range from approximately $455 million to $467 million or $3.40 to $3.48 per diluted share. We expect to open between 115 to 120 new stores, with approximately 50% scheduled to be opened in the first half of the year. Additionally, we forecast our effective tax rate will be approximately 36.9%.
While we still expect capital expenditures in 2016 to range between $230 million to $250 million, and we're making good progress on our LED lighting retrofit, expect to be completing this year's target of half of the chain by mid-third quarter. 
We'll continue to make purchases on the share repurchase program as part of our long-term balanced approach to shareholder return. We expect to be in a borrowed position at the end of each quarter, and target year-end debt position to be approximately $200 million. We continue to expect deflation to be less of a headwind, ranging between 20 basis points early in the year and flat in the second half of the year. 
So that concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we will now turn the call over for questions."

So we don't see it being a significant increase relative to an appetite. I think that one of the biggest drivers is the share repurchase program, and so that would be a driver. And again, given how we set up the program using the matrix and how the stock price moves dictate how much we attribute to that program, and that would drive some of the outstanding debt on the balance sheet. So I think we clearly would like to support the stock and continue to do so. But we have a lot of flexibility when it comes to the capital structure because of the repurchase program."

In the stores that we've had it in, we've seen nice attribution increases in understanding how our customer is and getting a deeper knowledge. And I'll just give you a couple of examples. In the stores where we've got the Neighbor's Club program, from a transaction standpoint, we've met one from really about mid-30s to mid-50s. So we've seen a nice increase in transaction attribution. And in sales attribution, that number has gone from the low 50s to the mid-60s. We're using that data now, because the goal of this was to collect information and then start personalizing communication out to them using e-mail. And we've been doing just that. We've got now a record of the response rates from our customers and the communication back and forth regarding either content our special offers or trying to get them to shop across the stores.

On the call with me today are Tony Crudele, our EVP and Chief Financial Officer; and Steve Barbarick, our EVP and Chief Merchandising, Marketing and Supply Chain Officer. 
We are pleased with our results and execution of our business in the first quarter. Comparable store sales increased 4.9% and were driven by increases in both traffic and ticket. This was our 32nd consecutive quarter of positive comparable transaction counts. Our sales were balanced across product categories and regions, with all of our major product categories and geographic regions generating positive comparable store sales. Once again, the Tractor Supply team did an excellent job managing the business this quarter, and we believe our results demonstrate the resiliency of our business model.
Our customers rely on us to be the most dependable supplier of everyday basic products for their rural lifestyle needs. They shop our stores regularly, and they buy what they need when they need it, for their pets, animals, land and equipment. Some of their needs are year-round, some are seasonal, and some are weather related. We know the seasons and weather can influence the timing of when our customers shop certain products, and we also know it's our job to manage our inventory accordingly. 
One change that we implemented in the first quarter of this year was the flow of our seasonal inventory into our stores. Last year, we had 3 regional set dates for spring merchandise, which ranged from mid-January through early February. Acting on feedback from our store managers and analyzing sales and inventory data, we changed our approach for 2016 and moved to 5 set dates this year, starting with the South in late December and ending with the North in late February, early March. This allowed us to capture early spring sales in the South and additional late winter sales in the North. Combining this with our clearance pricing tool from Revionics, we were able to drive sales, preserve margin and reduce inventory levels as we transitioned our business during the first quarter.
This quarter, we did have a little help from mother nature. And we had the right products in stock to meet our customers' needs in both seasonal and everyday queue products. When the snow and cold finally arrived in many of our markets in January, we had the inventory to meet those customer needs, and we sold through a good portion of our winter seasonal merchandise. 
Similarly, when spring-like conditions developed in a number of our Southern markets in March, we were again ready, and our continued investments in everyday queue products kept us positioned to drive this segment of our business throughout the quarter as well. As a result, we experienced solid sales across both everyday and seasonal products for the quarter.
This year's Chick Days event, which was another success, generating strong traffic, driving sales and growing awareness regarding backyard poultry across a wide range of customers. The event features live chicks and ducklings, along with all the necessary products for their care and maintenance. This is one of our most popular events of the year and positions Tractor Supply as an authority in the areas of animal care and sustainable living. It speaks to the self reliance and sustainability trend that we continue to see in our marketplace and is a great example of how we are appealing to a wider consumer base.
As we discussed briefly at our Investment Community Day in February, we have identified broad consumer trends around 4 areas of our business, those being pets, services, my land and sustainable living. We believe these are go-forward areas of opportunity for Tractor Supply, and we are developing and testing strategies for products and events that will address these trends.
Another area of growing importance is the application of technology into our business, including systems involving inventory management, allocation, customer information capture and mobile. We continue to improve our processes to better manage inventory, enhance our assortments and grow the business longer term. 
One example is our new planogram facility, which we call our Merchandise Innovation Center, (sic) [Merchandising Innovation Center] or MIC. This facility enables our teams and vendors to work in a simulated store environment as we plan changes through assortment mix, in-store visuals and overall flow changes within the 4-wall store. 
In addition to the MIC, enhancements across our planning and allocation systems are important tools that we are utilizing to improve our business to meet the ever-evolving needs of our customers. 
And as we look ahead to the remainder of 2016, we will continue to enhance our omnichannel platform, customer relationship marketing and our IT security across the entire organization. We're also in the process of implementing the EMV chip-and-signature platform in our stores, with completion expected by mid of this year.
On the merchandising side, our focus will continue to be on new and differentiated products across the store as well as opportunities to expand our offerings and exclusive brands, always being mindful of the positioning for the key national brands that our customers expect to find within our assortments.
On the store operations side of our business, we are improving our in-store special ordering process and making it easier for our team members to assist customers in locating hard-to-find products, to expanded product offerings, utilizing our Drop Ship Vendors. 
And we are embarking on the largest store sustainability project to date with the retrofitting of the entire store base with new LED lighting in 2016 and 2017. Thus far, we have converted 1/3 of our stores planned for 2016 with LED lighting, and those stores are benefiting from improved lighting quality as well as lower energy and maintenance costs. 
So in closing, let me extend my sincere thanks to all of the hard-working dedicated team members of Tractor Supply. And it is really our people who serve our customers everyday and execute our business strategies that drive our continued success as a company.
With that said, I'd like to turn the call over to Tony now for a more detailed commentary on our first quarter results and our outlook for 2016. Tony?"

Comp",1422,"Thanks, Greg, and good afternoon, everyone. For the quarter ended March 26, 2016, on a year-over-year basis, net sales increased 10.2% to $1.47 billion, net income increased 16.6% to $66.7 million, and EPS increased 19% to $0.50 per diluted share. 
Comp store sales increased 4.9% in the first quarter compared to an increase of 5.7% in last year's first quarter. Comp transaction count increased for the 32nd consecutive quarter, gaining 4.2% on top of a 4.8% increase last year. 
As Greg mentioned, sale trends were broad-based, both from a product and a geographic perspective. Everyday items continued to perform well and were a key driver of the comp transaction increase. 
Average comp ticket increased by 73 basis points on top of last year's 84 basis point increase. The increase was driven principally by an increase in the number of SKUs per transaction, partially offset by deflation.
Sale of spring seasonal merchandise were also strong in the quarter as we experienced a March that was warmer than average and also warmer than last year. Spring seasonal categories, such as lawn and garden, riding lawn mowers, fencing, animal health and fly control performed very well. 
Winter seasonal sales were strong in January as the cold weather rolled in, but sales softened in February, which was much warmer than last year. Cold weather in January gave us the opportunity to clear most of our winter clothing, specifically insulated outerwear. However, the cold weather was too brief to drive significant sales in certain hardline categories such as heating and log splitters. 
Other comments regarding sales in the quarter. Comp sales were positive across all regions and major product categories, with the strongest sales coming in the Southeast, which was impacted less by the mild winter season. 
Big-ticket comp sales increased slightly, but below chain average and were driven by early spring season riding lawn mower and trailer sales, partially offset by soft sales in winter power equipment and log splitters. 
Transactions drove the increase in the big-ticket comps, but overall, the increase in big-ticket did not materially impact overall company comps. 
We estimate that deflation impacted sales by approximately 25 basis points, driven principally by livestock feed, lubricant and propane categories. 
As I mentioned, mild March temperatures benefited the sale of early spring merchandise. Also, Easter was 1 week earlier than last year, thereby shifting the strong Friday and Saturday sales days into our first quarter. We estimate that these 2 factors positively impacted first quarter results by pulling forward approximately $18 million in sales and $0.02 per diluted share.
The oil patch stores continued to comp positive but below chain average, consistent with the trend in Q4. Transaction count remained firm in these stores. We are expecting that the impact will moderate through the year as we begin to cycle the trend from last year. 
Now turning to gross margin, which increased 30 basis points to 33.7% versus a decrease of 8 basis points last year. The merchandise team did a great job driving gross margin while managing through our winter seasonal clearance. We benefited from our key margin initiatives of price management, imports and exclusive brands. The benefit of these initiatives more than offset the impact from heavier clearance sales of winter seasonal merchandise. 
The merchandise team continues to work diligently with our vendor community on both the product development and cost sides of the business; which is improving margin. We also benefited from vendor support programs associated with the initial stocking of our new Arizona DC. 
While we loaded the DC with inventory late last year, we began shipping the stores in late December and recognizing the benefit as we sold through the merchandise in Q1. We estimate this positively impacted gross margin by approximately 15 basis points. 
We estimate that deflation had a minimal impact on gross margin as deflation continued to decline in the feed category. 
Lower diesel prices and the decrease in outbound stem miles to our Western stores were more than offset by an increase in inbound miles to our Arizona DC and a higher mix of freight-intensive categories. The mix of merchandise had a slight negative impact in gross margin. Higher sales of riding lawn mowers were offset by lower sales of heating products, both of which carry below chain average margins. 
For the quarter, SG&A, including depreciation and amortization, was 26.3% of sales, an improvement of 11 basis points over the prior year's quarter. Overall, SG&A benefited from a strong comp sales increase. However, we are very pleased with the expense control and leverage that we achieved, given that we had an estimated headwind of $3.5 million or approximately 24 basis points from the startup of our Arizona DC and the 2 mixing centers that were not in operation last year at this time.
We are very pleased with our payroll management in Q1 as the team reacted well and allocated payroll appropriately with the sales trends, resulting in leverage in the quarter. Medical and related payroll expenses levered as well. We also leveraged occupancy as we benefited from lower utilities and store winter maintenance expense as a result of the mild winter weather. This benefit was partially offset by the rental leverage that we experienced as we opened new stores. 
Incentive compensation did not have a material impact on SG&A in this quarter. 
The tax rate for the quarter was 36.8% compared to 36.9% last year due to additional state tax credits. Both periods include onetime state tax credits that we do not anticipate receiving at the same level in subsequent years.
Now turning to the balance sheet. At the end of Q1, we had a cash balance of $74.5 million and $250 million in outstanding debt compared to a cash balance of $57 million and $60 million in outstanding debt last year. 
During the first quarter, under our stock repurchase program, we acquired close to 1.2 million shares for $99.1 million. 
Inventory per store increased 1%, and annualized inventory turns decreased to 2.94. We had anticipated that turns would decrease in Q1 as we began the quarter heavy with winter seasonal merchandise as well as stocking our new Arizona DC. 
We are pleased how the team managed the markdown cadence and inventory purchases, bringing the quarter-end balances down essentially to last year's levels. We believe we're well positioned as we head into the second quarter.
Capital expenditures for the quarter were $36.7 million compared to $48.8 million last year. 
We opened 36 stores and closed 3 Del's stores in the first quarter compared to 41 new stores opened and 1 Del's store closed in the first quarter of 2015. 
So with respect to our financial expectations for the full year 2016, as noted in today's press release, we have reiterated our previous guidance. 
While our Q1 performance was strong, there's still a lot of business ahead of us in the spring and summer season. As we have said in the past, it is best to evaluate our performance by the half as we see the spring season play out in full. Therefore, we believe it's prudent to revisit our guidance at the end of the second quarter.
As a reminder, we expect full year sales to range from $6.9 billion to $7 billion. We have forecasted comp sales to range between 3.5% and 5%. We are targeting a 20 to 25 basis point improvement in EBIT margin compared to 2015. We anticipate net income to range from approximately $455 million to $467 million or $3.40 to $3.48 per diluted share. We expect to open between 115 to 120 new stores, with approximately 50% scheduled to be opened in the first half of the year. Additionally, we forecast our effective tax rate will be approximately 36.9%.
While we still expect capital expenditures in 2016 to range between $230 million to $250 million, and we're making good progress on our LED lighting retrofit; expect to be completing this year's target of half of the chain by mid-third quarter. 
We'll continue to make purchases on the share repurchase program as part of our long-term balanced approach to shareholder return. We expect to be in a borrow position at the end of each quarter, and target year-end debt position to be approximately $200 million. We continue to expect deflation to be less of a headwind, ranging between 20 basis points early in the year and flat in the second half of the year. 
So that concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we will now turn the call over for questions."

So we don't see it being a significant increase relative to an appetite. I think that one of the biggest drivers is the share repurchase program, and so that would be a driver.

Now when we make an assessment as to what the pull forward is, we do our best to look at some of the key categories, and we look at sort of the slope of the sales line to try to understand if it was accelerated and try to project what that means to a quarter.

We're seeing some improvements in our regular price pricing and how we can stay competitive in markets. And it's really -- we needed this system because of all the different pricing strategies we've got throughout the country -- we're in 49 states -- we're not a single regular price on everything and every state being the same.

There's product that we bought for Christmas that is not necessarily cold product-related, and we sold through that really well. It was the more seasonal clearance that we ended up carrying over. And I believe at the last call, we talked about the percentage that we carried over. A lot of retailers would have probably taken markdowns a lot quicker and panicked, to some degree. But a lot of the product that we have are whole goods that are pretty much standbys year-to-year. And we took a very disciplined approach. We didn't panic in Q4. We took methodical markdowns where we could. We do have a clearance price-optimization tool that looks specifically at clearance by individual location so we can cluster those type of products. When we got into the first quarter, we had the benefit of that winter. Colder weather hit us in January. And we had enough of merchandise up North, knowing that we went to this 5 waves of allocation, and it really paid off for us. Now we still are carrying some of that inventory over. I don't want to say that we sold completely through, but it's good inventory that we can bring out for next year. And the carryover is minimal compared to the total inventory investment that we have out there today. So the team did a really nice job. I think it was a disciplined approach. We used both art and science based on some of what we were looking at and we came out of it really well."

In the stores where we've got the Neighbor's Club program, from a transaction standpoint, we've met -- went from really about mid-30s to mid-50s. So we've seen a nice increase in transaction attribution. And in sales attribution, that number has gone from the low 50s to the mid-60s. We're using that data now, because the goal of this was to collect information and then start personalizing communication out to them using e-mail. And we've been doing just that.

On the call with me today are Tony Crudele, our EVP and Chief Financial Officer; and Steve Barbarick, our EVP and Chief Merchandising, Marketing and Supply Chain Officer. 
We are pleased with our results and execution of our business in the first quarter. Comparable store sales increased 4.9% and were driven by increases in both traffic and ticket. This was our 32nd consecutive quarter of positive comparable transaction counts. Our sales were balanced across product categories and regions, with all of our major product categories and geographic regions generating positive comparable store sales. Once again, the Tractor Supply team did an excellent job managing the business this quarter, and we believe our results demonstrate the resiliency of our business model.
Our customers rely on us to be the most dependable supplier of everyday basic products for their rural lifestyle needs. They shop our stores regularly, and they buy what they need when they need it, for their pets, animals, land and equipment. Some of their needs are year-round, some are seasonal, and some are weather related. We know the seasons and weather can influence the timing of when our customers shop certain products, and we also know it's our job to manage our inventory accordingly. 
One change that we implemented in the first quarter of this year was the flow of our seasonal inventory into our stores. Last year, we had 3 regional set dates for spring merchandise, which ranged from mid-January through early February. Acting on feedback from our store managers and analyzing sales and inventory data, we changed our approach for 2016 and moved to 5 set dates this year, starting with the South in late December and ending with the North in late February, early March. This allowed us to capture early spring sales in the South and additional late winter sales in the North. Combining this with our clearance pricing tool from Revionics, we were able to drive sales, preserve margin and reduce inventory levels as we transitioned our business during the first quarter.
This quarter, we did have a little help from mother nature. And we had the right products in stock to meet our customers' needs in both seasonal and everyday queue products. When the snow and cold finally arrived in many of our markets in January, we had the inventory to meet those customer needs, and we sold through a good portion of our winter seasonal merchandise. 
Similarly, when spring-like conditions developed in a number of our Southern markets in March, we were again ready, and our continued investments in everyday queue products kept us positioned to drive this segment of our business throughout the quarter as well. As a result, we experienced solid sales across both everyday and seasonal products for the quarter.
This year's Chick Days event, which was another success, generating strong traffic, driving sales and growing awareness regarding backyard poultry across a wide range of customers. The event features live chicks and ducklings, along with all the necessary products for their care and maintenance. This is one of our most popular events of the year and positions Tractor Supply as an authority in the areas of animal care and sustainable living. It speaks to the self reliance and sustainability trend that we continue to see in our marketplace and is a great example of how we are appealing to a wider consumer base.
As we discussed briefly at our Investment Community Day in February, we have identified broad consumer trends around 4 areas of our business, those being pets, services, my land and sustainable living. We believe these are go-forward areas of opportunity for Tractor Supply, and we are developing and testing strategies for products and events that will address these trends.
Another area of growing importance is the application of technology into our business, including systems involving inventory management, allocation, customer information capture and mobile. We continue to improve our processes to better manage inventory, enhance our assortments and grow the business longer term. 
One example is our new planogram facility, which we call our Merchandise Innovation Center, (sic) [Merchandising Innovation Center] or MIC. This facility enables our teams and vendors to work in a simulated store environment as we plan changes through assortment mix, in-store visuals and overall flow changes within the 4-wall store. 
In addition to the MIC, enhancements across our planning and allocation systems are important tools that we are utilizing to improve our business to meet the ever-evolving needs of our customers. 
And as we look ahead to the remainder of 2016, we will continue to enhance our omnichannel platform, customer relationship marketing and our IT security across the entire organization. We're also in the process of implementing the EMV chip-and-signature platform in our stores, with completion expected by mid of this year.
On the merchandising side, our focus will continue to be on new and differentiated products across the store as well as opportunities to expand our offerings and exclusive brands, always being mindful of the positioning for the key national brands that our customers expect to find within our assortments.
On the store operations side of our business, we are improving our in-store special ordering process and making it easier for our team members to assist customers in locating hard-to-find products, to expanded product offerings, utilizing our Drop Ship Vendors. 
And we are embarking on the largest store sustainability project to date with the retrofitting of the entire store base with new LED lighting in 2016 and 2017. Thus far, we have converted 1/3 of our stores planned for 2016 with LED lighting, and those stores are benefiting from improved lighting quality as well as lower energy and maintenance costs. 
So in closing, let me extend my sincere thanks to all of the hard-working dedicated team members of Tractor Supply. And it is really our people who serve our customers everyday and execute our business strategies that drive our continued success as a company.
With that said, I'd like to turn the call over to Tony now for a more detailed commentary on our first quarter results and our outlook for 2016. Tony?"

For the quarter ended March 26, 2016, on a year-over-year basis, net sales increased 10.2% to $1.47 billion, net income increased 16.6% to $66.7 million, and EPS increased 19% to $0.50 per diluted share. 
Comp store sales increased 4.9% in the first quarter compared to an increase of 5.7% in last year's first quarter. Comp transaction count increased for the 32nd consecutive quarter, gaining 4.2% on top of a 4.8% increase last year. 
As Greg mentioned, sale trends were broad-based, both from a product and a geographic perspective. Everyday items continued to perform well and were a key driver of the comp transaction increase. 
Average comp ticket increased by 73 basis points on top of last year's 84 basis point increase. The increase was driven principally by an increase in the number of SKUs per transaction, partially offset by deflation.
Sale of spring seasonal merchandise were also strong in the quarter as we experienced a March that was warmer than average and also warmer than last year. Spring seasonal categories, such as lawn and garden, riding lawn mowers, fencing, animal health and fly control performed very well. 
Winter seasonal sales were strong in January as the cold weather rolled in, but sales softened in February, which was much warmer than last year. Cold weather in January gave us the opportunity to clear most of our winter clothing, specifically insulated outerwear. However, the cold weather was too brief to drive significant sales in certain hardline categories such as heating and log splitters. 
Other comments regarding sales in the quarter. Comp sales were positive across all regions and major product categories, with the strongest sales coming in the Southeast, which was impacted less by the mild winter season. 
Big-ticket comp sales increased slightly, but below chain average and were driven by early spring season riding lawn mower and trailer sales, partially offset by soft sales in winter power equipment and log splitters. 
Transactions drove the increase in the big-ticket comps, but overall, the increase in big-ticket did not materially impact overall company comps. 
We estimate that deflation impacted sales by approximately 25 basis points, driven principally by livestock feed, lubricant and propane categories. 
As I mentioned, mild March temperatures benefited the sale of early spring merchandise. Also, Easter was 1 week earlier than last year, thereby shifting the strong Friday and Saturday sales days into our first quarter. We estimate that these 2 factors positively impacted first quarter results by pulling forward approximately $18 million in sales and $0.02 per diluted share.
The oil patch stores continued to comp positive but below chain average, consistent with the trend in Q4. Transaction count remained firm in these stores. We are expecting that the impact will moderate through the year as we begin to cycle the trend from last year. 
Now turning to gross margin, which increased 30 basis points to 33.7% versus a decrease of 8 basis points last year. The merchandise team did a great job driving gross margin while managing through our winter seasonal clearance. We benefited from our key margin initiatives of price management, imports and exclusive brands. The benefit of these initiatives more than offset the impact from heavier clearance sales of winter seasonal merchandise. 
The merchandise team continues to work diligently with our vendor community on both the product development and cost sides of the business; which is improving margin. We also benefited from vendor support programs associated with the initial stocking of our new Arizona DC. 
While we loaded the DC with inventory late last year, we began shipping the stores in late December and recognizing the benefit as we sold through the merchandise in Q1. We estimate this positively impacted gross margin by approximately 15 basis points. 
We estimate that deflation had a minimal impact on gross margin as deflation continued to decline in the feed category. 
Lower diesel prices and the decrease in outbound stem miles to our Western stores were more than offset by an increase in inbound miles to our Arizona DC and a higher mix of freight-intensive categories. The mix of merchandise had a slight negative impact in gross margin. Higher sales of riding lawn mowers were offset by lower sales of heating products, both of which carry below chain average margins. 
For the quarter, SG&A, including depreciation and amortization, was 26.3% of sales, an improvement of 11 basis points over the prior year's quarter. Overall, SG&A benefited from a strong comp sales increase. However, we are very pleased with the expense control and leverage that we achieved, given that we had an estimated headwind of $3.5 million or approximately 24 basis points from the startup of our Arizona DC and the 2 mixing centers that were not in operation last year at this time.
We are very pleased with our payroll management in Q1 as the team reacted well and allocated payroll appropriately with the sales trends, resulting in leverage in the quarter. Medical and related payroll expenses levered as well. We also leveraged occupancy as we benefited from lower utilities and store winter maintenance expense as a result of the mild winter weather. This benefit was partially offset by the rental leverage that we experienced as we opened new stores. 
Incentive compensation did not have a material impact on SG&A in this quarter. 
The tax rate for the quarter was 36.8% compared to 36.9% last year due to additional state tax credits. Both periods include onetime state tax credits that we do not anticipate receiving at the same level in subsequent years.
Now turning to the balance sheet. At the end of Q1, we had a cash balance of $74.5 million and $250 million in outstanding debt compared to a cash balance of $57 million and $60 million in outstanding debt last year. 
During the first quarter, under our stock repurchase program, we acquired close to 1.2 million shares for $99.1 million. 
Inventory per store increased 1%, and annualized inventory turns decreased to 2.94. We had anticipated that turns would decrease in Q1 as we began the quarter heavy with winter seasonal merchandise as well as stocking our new Arizona DC. 
We are pleased how the team managed the markdown cadence and inventory purchases, bringing the quarter-end balances down essentially to last year's levels. We believe we're well positioned as we head into the second quarter.
Capital expenditures for the quarter were $36.7 million compared to $48.8 million last year. 
We opened 36 stores and closed 3 Del's stores in the first quarter compared to 41 new stores opened and 1 Del's store closed in the first quarter of 2015. 
So with respect to our financial expectations for the full year 2016, as noted in today's press release, we have reiterated our previous guidance. 
While our Q1 performance was strong, there's still a lot of business ahead of us in the spring and summer season. As we have said in the past, it is best to evaluate our performance by the half as we see the spring season play out in full. Therefore, we believe it's prudent to revisit our guidance at the end of the second quarter.
As a reminder, we expect full year sales to range from $6.9 billion to $7 billion. We have forecasted comp sales to range between 3.5% and 5%. We are targeting a 20 to 25 basis point improvement in EBIT margin compared to 2015. We anticipate net income to range from approximately $455 million to $467 million or $3.40 to $3.48 per diluted share. We expect to open between 115 to 120 new stores, with approximately 50% scheduled to be opened in the first half of the year. Additionally, we forecast our effective tax rate will be approximately 36.9%.
While we still expect capital expenditures in 2016 to range between $230 million to $250 million, and we're making good progress on our LED lighting retrofit; expect to be completing this year's target of half of the chain by mid-third quarter. 
We'll continue to make purchases on the share repurchase program as part of our long-term balanced approach to shareholder return. We expect to be in a borrow position at the end of each quarter, and target year-end debt position to be approximately $200 million. We continue to expect deflation to be less of a headwind, ranging between 20 basis points early in the year and flat in the second half of the year. 
So that concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we will now turn the call over for questions."

So we don't see it being a significant increase relative to an appetite. I think that one of the biggest drivers is the share repurchase program, and so that would be a driver. And again, given how we set up the program using the matrix and how the stock price moves, dictate how much we attribute to that program, and that would drive some of the outstanding debt on the balance sheet. So I think we clearly would like to support the stock and continue to do so. But we have a lot of flexibility when it comes to the capital structure because of the repurchase program."

Now when we make an assessment as to what the pull forward is, we do our best to look at some of the key categories, and we look at sort of the slope of the sales line to try to understand if it was accelerated and try to project what that means to a quarter.

Or did the gap, relative to the control group or however you want to say it, actually stabilize at the level that you saw in the fourth quarter? And then can you talk about how you're seeing new store productivity in the stores out West?"

And we have an executive trip that we make every quarter with the teams, and we chose this past quarter to make the trip out to the West. We were in Phoenix markets, Utah markets, some other Western markets. And I must tell you, we feel very strongly that it's an awareness issue. And as we're seeing these stores ramp, we're feeling very good about our future prospects out there. It's about market awareness, it's about how we position. There's been some competition in those markets as we've come into them that it takes a little longer. And I think we saw this a few years back when we were first entering the Florida market and the Louisiana market. So we're feeling good about it. I think the mix of our business out there is a little different than we had seen in other markets, but we are figuring that out. We're rebalancing some of the store inventories. And now with the Southwest DC in position, we can react a lot faster. So we're feeling very good, actually, about the West right now."

There are a couple of things that are unique in some of these markets from a merch standpoint that we've learned, and we've addressed that now. And I think we've become very good listeners to our teams out there. And what we're doing, from a local market presence, and that could be interacting with local rodeos, with different 4-H and FFA groups. So there's a heightened, what I would call, awareness out there, who we are now versus our initial approach. And it's a little different than maybe what we've done in some of the markets where we have an existing presence. It's not overbearing, but those learnings, we're applying."

There's product that we bought for Christmas that is not necessarily cold product-related, and we sold through that really well. It was the more seasonal clearance that we ended up carrying over. And I believe at the last call, we talked about the percentage that we carried over. A lot of retailers would have probably taken markdowns a lot quicker and panicked, to some degree. But a lot of the product that we have are whole goods that are pretty much standbys year-to-year. And we took a very disciplined approach. We didn't panic in Q4. We took methodical markdowns where we could. We do have a clearance price-optimization tool that looks specifically at clearance by individual location so we can cluster those type of products. When we got into the first quarter, we had the benefit of that winter. Colder weather hit us in January. And we had enough of merchandise up North, knowing that we went to this 5 waves of allocation, and it really paid off for us. Now we still are carrying some of that inventory over. I don't want to say that we sold completely through, but it's good inventory that we can bring out for next year. And the carryover is minimal compared to the total inventory investment that we have out there today. So the team did a really nice job. I think it was a disciplined approach.

On the call with me today are Tony Crudele, our EVP and Chief Financial Officer; and Steve Barbarick, our President and Chief Merchandising Officer.As you are all aware from our prerelease on",1094,"Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. On the call with me today are Tony Crudele, our EVP and Chief Financial Officer; and Steve Barbarick, our President and Chief Merchandising Officer.
As you are all aware from our prerelease on June 29, we had a challenging second quarter. Not the typical Tractor Supply performance. And clearly, the weather was not favorable. The bottom line is, our business was heavily influenced by weather in Q2. We have worked very hard to be the most dependable supplier of products to the rural lifestyle customers. And the fact remains that some of those products, being seasonal in nature, can be impacted by weather.
Weather has always been a factor in our business and we know it's our job to manage around those external factors. However, we generally have not experienced the extreme conditions in variability in the weather from region to region like we saw in this second quarter. Hot and dry in the West, cold and wet in the East and Midwest and severe flooding and damage in the South Central. Just about every region experienced some form of weather variance and the conditions were very different from region to region.
When the weather began to normalize in June, so did our business. But the turn was not enough to offset the weakness in April and May. And not enough for us to anticipate that a significant shift in seasonal sales will occur coming into the third quarter. As a result, we have become a bit more cautious in our outlook for the remainder of the year, although last year's sales comparisons are more favorable than the second half.
During the quarter, very strong demand for our core animal and pet offerings continued, and we believe we are gaining share in these areas. We also saw continued momentum with events that directly support the sustainable lifestyle. Chick Days and our garden event both experienced strong year-over-year growth. We saw healthy demand for outdoor furniture, pest-control products, barbecue grills. But unfavorable weather and a difficult year-over-year sales comparisons challenged our ability to drive sales providing lawnmowers, lawn and garden products and utility vehicles.
We did see increased demand in departments where we continued to innovate and introduce newness such as truck lighting and accessories, trailers and outdoor water recreation. Our inventory and planning teams did an excellent job reacting to the softer sales trends in the quarter. And through a balance approach, managed the sales margin and inventory investment in relationship to customer demand. Tractor Supply will continue to invest in our business to drive sales, shorten our supply chain timeline and increase our overall productivity and profitability as a company.
In addition to implementing an improved allocation system, we are continuing our test and learn process on the merchandise side, expanding our new customer loyalty program pilot, growing our store mobile point-of-sale test and conducting a comprehensive DC network analysis. And we are pleased with the progress we are making on all of these initiatives.
Just this month, we expanded test of our Neighbor's Club customer loyalty program to the California market, and now have over 190 stores participating. While still early in the process, the initial enrollment rates continue to be ahead of our expectations. We are finding that our Neighbor's Club members are highly engaged to a tractor, and we are experiencing higher open and click-through rates on our targeted e-mails and communications to them.
We have now completed the implementation of our new allocation system. The new system is designed to improve efficiency and accuracy of our allocation process, and is scalable to support our long-term store growth targets. We continue to expand the test of mobile POS devices into our stores. And as the functionality has improved, the adaptation from our team members and customers have also increased. This capability will enable us and our team members to sell and assist customers with products from any point in or outside our stores.
And lastly, we are continuing the analysis of our DC network and systems, which we believe will be critical in supporting our growth to 2,500 stores, and evolving our supply chain strategy and capability for the longer-term.
Overall, we believe these and other investments have made our business more nimble and less susceptible to external factors. But recent results remind us that extreme weather conditions from region to region can impact our business in the short-term, and this is not likely to change. We continue to manage the business with the future in mind, and believe continuous improvement in our product and service offerings in addition to improving systems and efficiencies will keep Tractor Supply well positioned for growth.
Looking forward into the second half of the year, we are a bit more cautious. Despite the more normalized trends in June, we do not believe that we will see much of an extended spring selling season to recoup the sales lost in the second quarter. We revised our full year guidance in our June 29 business update press release and are reiterating that guidance today. Tony will take you through this in greater detail in a moment.
From a product and inventory perspective, we believe we are in a solid position to meet the needs of our customers as we transitioned the business from summer to fall. 
And before I wrap up, I want to thank the nearly 23,000 members of the Tractor Supply team for their continued hard work and dedication to our customers and our overall business. I also want to congratulate Tony on his planned retirement and Kurt Barton on his planned promotion to CFO. As we announced in today's earnings press release, Tony has notified the company that he plans to retire during the first quarter of fiscal 2017. Kurt Barton, the company's Senior Vice President and Corporate Controller, will succeed Tony as Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. Kurt has been with Tractor Supply for 17 years and is a talented financial leader with a proven track record of creating value. We all have the utmost confidence in his ability to continue leading the financial team forward. To ensure a smooth transition of duties, Kurt and Tony will work together over the next 7 months, with Kurt increasing his interface with the investment community to investors meetings and calls in the back half of the year.
I'll now turn the call over to Tony for more detailed commentary on our second quarter results and outlook for the remainder of 2016."

For the quarter ended June 25, 2016, on a year-over-year basis, net sales increased 4.5% to $1.85 billion, net income grew 2% to $156.4 million and EPS increased 3.6% to $1.16 per diluted share.Comp store sale",1396,"Thanks, Greg, and good afternoon, everyone. For the quarter ended June 25, 2016, on a year-over-year basis, net sales increased 4.5% to $1.85 billion, net income grew 2% to $156.4 million and EPS increased 3.6% to $1.16 per diluted share.
Comp store sales decreased 0.5% in the second quarter compared to a very strong increase of 5.6% in last year's second quarter. Comp store sales were challenged throughout the quarter, with April and May impacted primarily from unfavorable weather patterns and tough comparisons from prior year. Beginning with Memorial Day weekend and warmer weather, seasonal sales trends normalized and comp store sales were in line with our expectations in the month of June.
Sales were the weakest in the northern regions of the country where unseasonably cool temperatures reduced demand for many spring items. The southern regions, which were less impacted by the cooler weather, performed more consistently with our expectations and had positive comps, except for the Texas region.
In addition to the impact of the oil patch economy, certain areas of Texas were negatively impacted by heavy rains and flooding, which limited some of the spring season activities. Comp transaction count increased for the 33rd consecutive quarter, gaining 1.5% on top of a 4.2% increase last year. As C.U.E. items such as pet and animal food continued to post high single-digit comps.
Average comp ticket decreased by 190 basis points compared to last year's 130 basis point increase. Big ticket drove last year's increase and was the principal driver of this year's average ticket decrease. Comparable sales of big ticket items declined approximately 8.5% as big ticket items such as riding lawnmowers and utility vehicles were challenged due to strong comparisons through last year and this year's unfavorable selling conditions. Deflation also had a slight impact on average ticket and contributed approximately 25 basis points to the decrease.
Now turning to gross margin, which decreased 22 basis points to 35% compared to a 50-basis-point improvement in last year's second quarter. Product mix had a negative impact on margin, although margin benefited from soft sales of some of the key big ticket items such as riding lawnmowers, this benefit was more than offset by the soft sales in other high margin departments and the strong sales of lower margin C.U.E. items. 
With respect to margin rate, while promotion cadence was relatively consistent with last year with the exception of a friends and neighbors events, we were slightly sharper on price to drive sales.
Freight was unfavorable as an increase in inbound transportation cost more than offset the benefits from lower diesel prices and a reduction in the outbound stem miles. We estimate deflation had a slight favorable impact on gross margin.
For the quarter, SG&A, including depreciation and amortization as a percentage of sales delevered by 15 basis points to 21.6% of sales compared to 21.4% of sales in the prior year's quarter. SG&A growth was impacted by several factors: the deleverage was primarily due to the lower comparable sales results as SG&A expense grew only 5.2% from the prior year. Excluding incentive compensation expense, SG&A expense increased 6.7%, which is below the SG&A growth rate of the past several quarters.
We experienced strong cost control in personnel, including store level, distribution center and store support payroll as well as medical expense.
Occupancy expense was well managed as we began to benefit from our LED lighting retrofit. The a strong expense management was achieved against the headwind from our Arizona distribution center that was not open at this time last year. We estimate the deleverage from the center's operation to be approximately 15 basis points.
Our effective income tax rate decreased to 36.8% in Q2 compared to 37.2% last year due to additional federal and the state tax credits.
Turning to the balance sheet. At the end of Q2 this year, we had cash balance of $151.1 million and $196.2 million in outstanding debt, principally comprised of the term loan compared to a cash balance of $56 million and no outstanding debt last year.
During the second quarter, we have limited purchases under our stock repurchase program. Average inventory levels per store decreased 1.2% compared to a 4.1% increase in last year's second quarter and inventory turns decreased compared to last year. We had strong inventory management in the quarter considering the soft sales environment. The transition between second and third quarters generally does not have significant markdown exposure. We are comfortable with our seasonal inventory as we move into the third quarter and we expect a normal markdown cadence exiting the season.
Capital expenditures for the quarter were $64.3 million compared to $48.2 million last year. We opened 22 stores and closed 1 Del's store in the second quarter compared to 17 new stores and 1 closed store in the second quarter of 2015.
The CapEx increase relates to our new store expansion, which includes an emphasis on retrofit locations that generally require renovation capital and our LED lighting retrofit project.
Now looking ahead, based on the trends and results for the first half of the year, we revised our outlook for the full year fiscal 2016 in our June 29 business update. We are reiterating that outlook today. We expect full year sales to range from $6.8 billion to $6.9 billion, comparable store sales to increase between 2.5% and 3.5% and net income to range between $451 million to $456 million with earnings per diluted share to be $3.35 to $3.40.
Assumed in this guidance is an EBIT margin improvement of about 10 to 15 basis points, a tax rate of 36.8% and capital expenditures of $230 million to $250 million. We will continue to make purchases under our share repurchase program and currently project full year diluted shares outstanding to be approximately $134.5 million to $134.8 million. 
In our June 29 business update, we stated that although June sales were more normalized, we did not expect a shift of spring sales into the third quarter. While it is still early in the third quarter, the trends through the first few weeks of July would appear to support this expectation. From a comparison standpoint in the third quarter, we face our toughest year-over-year comparison in July and our easiest comparison in September.
As a reminder, we had a record mild winter last year, and therefore, we believe that any upside in our forecast will be in the fourth quarter. We also have our 53rd week and an additional comp sales day in the fourth quarter. The additional sales week will provide incremental expense leverage in the fourth quarter and we estimate that the additional week will provide $0.03 to $0.04 increase to EPS, which is contained in our guidance.
In our original full year guidance, we forecasted a $0.01 negative EPS impact from the closing of several Del's stores in the fourth quarter as part of our transition to Tractor Supply stores in Washington state. We have now made a decision to close to those stores closer to their lease expiration with most of them expiring in 2017. We are pleased with the performance to date of the Tractor Supply stores that we have opened in the former Del's markets.
We continue to expect limited deflation in the back half of the year in the 15 to 20 basis points range. As we look at the back half of the year, we expect improvement of EBIT margin driven principally by improved gross margin in both the third and fourth quarters and expense leverage from the 53rd week. While transportation expenses will continue to be a headwind as we cycle the decline in diesel prices, we expect our gross margin initiatives to continue to drive improvement.
With respect to SG&A, we were very pleased with our expense management in Q2. We will continue to drive cost saving programs in the back half and we'll react accordingly to sales trends but we would expect year-over-year increase in SG&A to track closer to the overall growth in sales. We expect to maintain the appropriate payroll allocation to drive sales in the back half and incur a more normalized incentive compensation expense. We will continue to have the headwind of the Arizona distribution center until we cycle its opening in late December.
That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we will now turn the call over fore questions."

Everyone who signs up, we will give some time too. And so we don't really narrow it down  in any 1 given category. In terms of what we're looking at in the box itself to move our business forward, we've talked a lot about the C.U.E. business and you'll see a number of resets that are going to take place in the back half of this year that will support that, whether it'd be what we're doing in feed with the launch of our DuMOR equine program or we're going to see in terms of Blue Seal, which will expand out to another couple of hundred stores in the Northeast and down the corridor. So there's a lot of things that are happening within the box right now, not just in terms of resets but also events such as deer feeding that we've got out there right now that's doing particularly well or the stock or shop tool event.

Massive flooding, a lot of destruction. That will take time for that market to come back. It's not -- it doesn't snap back tomorrow. So our feeling was, let's be a little more conservative as we go into the second half. We know it's going to take some time for a large market like that where we have 170-plus stores to recover. And as we talked amongst ourselves, our feeling was, we're always kind of a conservative group here. We would rather be more conservative and give ourselves an opportunity to exceed that than to say, well, we think -- we can't forecast the future.

So we expect it'll be limited as we move through the rest of the quarter. And obviously, our easiest compare is in the September timeframe and a lot of that can be driven by cooler weather as people start to ramp up for the winter season. And right now, we expect that it will be cooler in September than last year, but still will be warmer than normal. So obviously, it's just too early to have an indication as to the third quarter."

I would tell you that it makes it more challenging for us to understand sometimes how these ebb and flows will affect the overall business on an annual basis.

And I'm convinced that we can kind of pushing this thing back on this growth trajectory that is kind of expected from Tractor. I mean, we're a test and learn company. We learn over time. There's no lack of newness, as Steve mentioned earlier. We continue to introduce new products and those are the things that really drive our footsteps and then were getting far better in this localization component.

On the call with me today are Tony Crudele, our EVP and Chief Financial Officer; and Steve Barbarick, our President and Chief Merchandising Officer.As you are all aware from our prerelease on",1104,"Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. On the call with me today are Tony Crudele, our EVP and Chief Financial Officer; and Steve Barbarick, our President and Chief Merchandising Officer.
As you are all aware from our prerelease on June 29th, we had a challenging second quarter, not the typical Tractor Supply performance. And clearly, the weather was not favorable. The bottom line is, our business was heavily influenced by weather in Q2. 
We have worked very hard to be the most dependable supplier of products to the rural lifestyle customer. And the fact remains that some of those products, being seasonal in nature, can be impacted by weather.
Weather has always been a factor in our business, and we know it's our job to manage around those external factors. However, we generally have not experienced the extreme conditions in variability in the weather from region to region like we saw in this second quarter. 
Hot and dry in the West, cold and wet in the East and Midwest and severe flooding and damage in the South Central. Just about every region experienced some form of weather variance, and the conditions were very different from region to region.
When the weather began to normalize in June, so did our business. But the turn was not enough to offset the weakness in April and May and not enough for us to anticipate that a significant shift in seasonal sales will occur coming into the third quarter. As a result, we have become a bit more cautious in our outlook for the remainder of the year, although last year's sales comparisons are more favorable than the second half.
During the quarter, very strong demand for our core animal and pet offerings continued, and we believe we are gaining share in these areas. We also saw continued momentum with events that directly support the sustainable lifestyle. Chick Days and our garden event both experienced strong year-over-year growth. 
We saw healthy demand for outdoor furniture, pest and rodent control products, barbecue grills. But unfavorable weather and a difficult year-over-year sales comparison challenged our ability to drive sales providing lawnmowers, lawn and garden products and utility vehicles.
We did see increased demand in departments where we continued to innovate and introduce newness such as truck lighting and accessories, trailers and outdoor water recreation. Our inventory and planning teams did an excellent job reacting to the softer sales trends in the quarter, and through a balanced approach, managed the sales margin and inventory investment in relationship to customer demand. 
Tractor Supply will continue to invest in our business to drive sales, shorten our supply chain time line and increase our overall productivity and profitability as a company.
In addition to implementing an improved allocation system, we are continuing our test and learn process on the merchandise side, expanding our new customer loyalty program pilot, growing our store mobile point-of-sale test and conducting a comprehensive DC network analysis. And we are pleased with the progress we are making on all of these initiatives.
Just this month, we expanded the test of our Neighbor's Club customer loyalty program to the California market, and now have over 190 stores participating. While still early in the process, the initial enrollment rates continue to be ahead of our expectations. 
We are finding that our Neighbor's Club members are highly engaged to a tractor, and we are experiencing higher open and click-through rates on our targeted e-mails and communications to them.
We have now completed the implementation of our new allocation system. The new system is designed to improve the efficiency and accuracy of our allocation process and is scalable to support our long-term store growth targets. We continue to expand the test of mobile POS devices into our stores. 
And as the functionality has improved, the adaptation from our team members and customers have also increased. This capability will enable us and our team members to sell and assist customers with products from any point in or outside our stores.
And lastly, we are continuing the analysis of our DC network and systems, which we believe will be critical in supporting our growth to 2,500 stores and evolving our supply chain strategy and capability for the longer term.
Overall, we believe these and other investments have made our business more nimble and less susceptible to external factors. But recent results remind us that extreme weather conditions from region to region can impact our business in the short term, and this is not likely to change. 
We continue to manage the business with the future in mind, and believe continuous improvement in our product and service offerings in addition to improving systems and efficiencies will keep Tractor Supply well positioned for growth.
Looking forward into the second half of the year, we are a bit more cautious. Despite the more normalized trends in June, we do not believe that we will see much of an extended spring selling season to recoup the sales lost in the second quarter. We revised our full year guidance in our June 29 business update press release and are reiterating that guidance today. Tony will take you through this in greater detail in a moment.
From a product and inventory perspective, we believe we are in a solid position to meet the needs of our customers as we transition the business from summer to fall. 
And before I wrap up, I want to thank the nearly 23,000 members of the Tractor Supply team for their continued hard work and dedication to our customers and our overall business. I also want to congratulate Tony on his planned retirement and Kurt Barton on his planned promotion to CFO. 
As we announced in today's earnings press release, Tony has notified the company that he plans to retire during the first quarter of fiscal 2017. Kurt Barton, the company's Senior Vice President and Corporate Controller, will succeed Tony as Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. 
Kurt has been with Tractor Supply for 17 years and is a talented financial leader with a proven track record of creating value. We all have the utmost confidence in his ability to continue leading the financial team forward. To ensure a smooth transition of duties, Kurt and Tony will work together over the next 7 months, with Kurt increasing his interface with the investment community through investor meetings and calls in the back half of the year.
I will now turn the call over to Tony for a more detailed commentary on our second quarter results and outlook for the remainder of 2016."

Sales were the weakest in the Northern regions of the country, where unseasonably cool temperatures reduced demand for many spring items. The Southern regions, which were less impacted by the cooler weather, performed more consistently with our expectations and had positive comps except for the Texas region.
In addition to the impact of the oil patch economy, certain areas of Texas were negatively impacted by heavy rains and flooding, which limited some of the spring season activities. Comp transaction count increased for the 33rd consecutive quarter, gaining 1.5% on top of a 4.2% increase last year. As C.U.E. items such as pet and animal food continued to post high single-digit comps.
Average comp ticket decreased by 190 basis points compared to last year's 130-basis-point increase. Big ticket drove last year's increase and was the principal driver of this year's average ticket decrease. Comparable sales of big ticket items declined approximately 8.5% as big ticket items such as riding lawnmowers and utility vehicles were challenged due to strong comparisons to last year and this year's unfavorable selling conditions. Deflation also had a slight impact on average ticket and contributed approximately 25 basis points to the decrease.
Now turning to gross margin, which decreased 23 basis points to 35% compared to a 50-basis-point improvement in last year's second quarter. Product mix had a negative impact on margin. Although margin benefited from soft sales of some of the key big ticket items such as riding lawnmowers, this benefit was more than offset by the soft sales in other high-margin departments and the strong sales of lower-margin C.U.E. items. 
With respect to margin rate, while promotion cadence was relatively consistent with last year with the exception of a friends and neighbors event, we were slightly sharper on price to drive sales.
Freight was unfavorable as an increase in inbound transportation cost more than offset the benefits from lower diesel prices and a reduction in the outbound stem miles. We estimate deflation had a slight favorable impact on gross margin.
For the quarter, SG&A, including depreciation and amortization as a percentage of sales delevered by 15 basis points to 21.6% of sales compared to 21.4% of sales in the prior year's quarter. SG&A growth was impacted by several factors. The deleverage was primarily due to the lower comparable sales results as SG&A expense grew only 5.2% from the prior year. Excluding incentive compensation expense, SG&A expense increased 6.7%, which is below the SG&A growth rate over the past several quarters.
We experienced strong cost control in personnel, including store level, distribution center and store support payroll as well as medical expense.
Occupancy expense was well managed as we began to benefit from our LED lighting retrofit. The strong expense management was achieved against the headwind from our Arizona distribution center that was not open at this time last year. We estimate the deleverage from the center's operation to be approximately 15 basis points.
Our effective income tax rate decreased to 36.8% in Q2 compared to 37.2% last year due to additional federal and the state tax credits.
Turning to the balance sheet. At the end of Q2 this year, we had cash balance of $151.1 million and $196.2 million in outstanding debt, principally comprised of the term loan compared to a cash balance of $56 million and no outstanding debt last year.
During the second quarter, we had limited purchases under our stock repurchase program. Average inventory levels per store decreased 1.2% compared to a 4.1% increase in last year's second quarter, and inventory turns decreased compared to last year. 
We had strong inventory management in the quarter considering the soft sales environment. The transition between second and third quarters generally does not have significant markdown exposure. We are comfortable with our seasonal inventory as we move into the third quarter, and we expect a normal markdown cadence exiting the season.
Capital expenditures for the quarter were $64.3 million compared to $48.2 million last year. We opened 22 stores and closed 1 Del's store in the second quarter compared to 17 new stores and 1 closed store in the second quarter of 2015.
The CapEx increase relates to our new store expansion, which includes an emphasis on retrofit locations that generally require renovation capital and our LED lighting retrofit project.
Now looking ahead, based on the trends and results for the first half of the year, we revised our outlook for the full year fiscal 2016 in our June 29th business update. We are reiterating that outlook today. 
We expect full year sales to range from $6.8 billion to $6.9 billion, comparable store sales to increase between 2.5% and 3.5% and net income to range from $451 million to $456 million with earnings per diluted share to be $3.35 to $3.40.
Assumed in this guidance is an EBIT margin improvement of about 10 to 15 basis points, a tax rate of 36.8% and capital expenditures of $230 million to $250 million. We will continue to make purchases under our share repurchase program and currently project full year diluted shares outstanding to be approximately $134.5 million to $134.8 million. 
In our June 29th business update, we stated that although June sales were more normalized, we did not expect a shift of spring sales into the third quarter. While it is still early in the third quarter, the trends through the first few weeks of July would appear to support this expectation. From a comparison standpoint in the third quarter, we face our toughest year-over-year comparison in July and our easiest comparison is in September.
As a reminder, we had a record mild winter last year, and therefore, we believe that any upside in our forecast will be in the fourth quarter. We also have our 53rd week and an additional comp sales day in the fourth quarter. The additional sales week will provide incremental expense leverage in the fourth quarter, and we estimate that the additional week will provide $0.03 to $0.04 increase to EPS, which is contained in our guidance.
In our original full year guidance, we've forecasted a $0.01 negative EPS impact from the closing of several Del's stores in the fourth quarter as part of our transition to Tractor Supply stores in Washington state. 
We have now made the decision to close those stores closer to their lease expiration, with most of them expiring in 2017. We are pleased with the performance to date of the Tractor Supply stores that we have opened in the former Del's markets.
We continue to expect limited deflation in the back half of the year in the 15- to 20-basis-point range. As we look at the back half of the year, we expect improvement of EBIT margin driven principally by improved gross margin in both the third and fourth quarters and expense leverage from the 53rd week. While transportation expenses will continue to be a headwind as we cycle the decline in diesel prices, we expect our gross margin initiatives to continue to drive improvement.
With respect to SG&A, we were very pleased with our expense management in Q2. We will continue to drive cost saving programs in the back half and we'll react accordingly to sales trends, but we would expect year-over-year increase in SG&A to track closer to the overall growth in sales. 
We expect to maintain the appropriate payroll allocation to drive sales in the back half and incur a more normalized incentive compensation expense. We will continue to have the headwind of the Arizona distribution center until we cycle its opening in late December.
That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we will now turn the call over for questions."

Everyone who signs up, we will give some time, too. And so we don't really narrow it down in any one given category. In terms of what we're looking at in the box itself to move our business forward, we've talked a lot about the C.U.E. business.

So there's a lot of things that are happening within the box right now, not just in terms of resets but also events such as deer feeding that we've got out there right now that's doing particularly well or the Stock Your Shop tool event.

A couple of things to note. The second quarter was difficult. And there was just incredibly, I'll say, challenging weather in some other regions of the country, where we have typically been able to weather those storms in the past, but -- I'll give you an example. In Texas, very, very difficult, massive flooding, a lot of destruction. That will take time for that market to come back. It's not -- it doesn't snap back tomorrow. So our feeling was, let's be a little more conservative as we go in the second half. We know it's going to take some time for a large market like that where we have 170-plus stores to recover. And we -- and as we talked amongst ourselves, our feeling was, we're always kind of a conservative group here. We would rather be more conservative and give ourselves an opportunity to exceed that than to say, well, we think -- we can't forecast the future. We could only kind of deal with the past and try to look at that and understand what could be in front of us.

There's plenty of newness, plenty of things that we're bringing to the customer. But we we've all looked back and did some studying of the last several years of weather trends and things. And it's just become a little bit more, I'll call it, unpredictable, meaning that it's moving the sales around a little bit more than we thought. And so we're reacting to that fairly well, keeping our inventories in control and moving our assortments to the product categories of the customers willing to buy and want to buy. But no, I don't think the size has anything really to do with it. We're still as nimble as we were. We saw plenty of newness. So I think this is us learning something new about how we need to react as these -- I think what we're going to see is more and more of this type of weather patterning, and it's a new learning to be very honest."

It's fundamentally they're still buying the things they need, they're still shopping for us, our traffic counts are up.

But I can't underestimate and we used to -- I think that we could control more things around some of the weather patterning across the country. But as we've gotten now into 49 states, and that store dispersion is a good thing generally, I would tell you that it makes it more challenging for us to understand sometimes how these ebb and flows will affect the overall business on an annual basis. We typically can work our way through some of these slight, if you call it, troubled spots where we have, I will say, less-than-ideal weather and less-than-ideal conditions for selling certain products. But we're in a new learning curve here, I believe, as we look at some of these things moving forward. And the team has done some great work as we forecast forward through the second half and into next year. And I'm convinced that we can kind of push this thing back on this growth trajectory that is kind of expected from Tractor. I mean, we're a test and learn company. We learn all the time. There's no lack of newness, as Steve mentioned earlier. We continue to introduce new products, and those are things that really drive all the footsteps. And then we're getting far better at this localization component, and that's going to be a key as we go forward because that helps us defend ourselves when conditions are less than ideal for selling some products. I can't reiterate enough, our customers buy to demand or to need. They don't buy early, and they haven't been for a long time."

We look to see that in both quarters, we anticipate improving our gross margin, which will help us drive the EBIT margin improvement for the overall company and in the back half of the year."

And then on the expense line, I mean, so that is one thing that really sort of has changed quite a bit over the last 3 years, not only has sales, but a little bit as you pulled back your square footage and as you've lost the very significant benefit of inflation that you had several years ago. But your SG&A is now running up closer to 10% a year versus maybe 6%, 7%, 8%, 9% a year, and then that's converged with sales. So obviously, there's a need to continue to invest in the business. But at the same time, sort of what is the thought process around what can be done perhaps to try and get a little bit of a greater spread between sales, dollar growth and SG&A dollar growth?"

And we have some key initiatives looking at all levels of expense structure. So when you look at the increase, we believe that it really is very focused on growth areas and areas that we need to make investment in. And as I alluded to in our prepared remarks, as much as we only ran about a 6% increase year-over-year, net of the incentive compensation, we do expect, as we continue to move forward, to be in -- somewhere in the 9% to 10% range, consistent with our growth in sales, in particular, because some of the investments that we made last year that we're cycling, in particular, the Arizona distribution center and the mixing centers."

On the call with me today are Tony Crudele, our EVP and Chief Financial Officer; and Steve Barbarick, our President and Chief Merchandising Officer.As you are all aware from our prerelease on",1104,"Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. On the call with me today are Tony Crudele, our EVP and Chief Financial Officer; and Steve Barbarick, our President and Chief Merchandising Officer.
As you are all aware from our prerelease on June 29th, we had a challenging second quarter, not the typical Tractor Supply performance. And clearly, the weather was not favorable. The bottom line is, our business was heavily influenced by weather in Q2. 
We have worked very hard to be the most dependable supplier of products to the rural lifestyle customer. And the fact remains that some of those products, being seasonal in nature, can be impacted by weather.
Weather has always been a factor in our business, and we know it's our job to manage around those external factors. However, we generally have not experienced the extreme conditions in variability in the weather from region to region like we saw in this second quarter. 
Hot and dry in the West, cold and wet in the East and Midwest and severe flooding and damage in the South Central. Just about every region experienced some form of weather variance, and the conditions were very different from region to region.
When the weather began to normalize in June, so did our business. But the turn was not enough to offset the weakness in April and May and not enough for us to anticipate that a significant shift in seasonal sales will occur coming into the third quarter. As a result, we have become a bit more cautious in our outlook for the remainder of the year, although last year's sales comparisons are more favorable in the second half.
During the quarter, very strong demand for our core animal and pet offerings continued, and we believe we are gaining share in these areas. We also saw continued momentum with events that directly support the sustainable lifestyle. Chick Days and our garden event both experienced strong year-over-year growth. 
We saw healthy demand for outdoor furniture, pest and rodent control products, barbecue grills. But unfavorable weather and a difficult year-over-year sales comparison challenged our ability to drive sales providing lawnmowers, lawn and garden products and utility vehicles.
We did see increased demand in departments where we continued to innovate and introduce newness such as truck lighting and accessories, trailers and outdoor water recreation. Our inventory and planning teams did an excellent job reacting to the softer sales trends in the quarter, and through a balanced approach, managed the sales margin and inventory investment in relationship to customer demand. 
Tractor Supply will continue to invest in our business to drive sales, shorten our supply chain time line and increase our overall productivity and profitability as a company.
In addition to implementing an improved allocation system, we are continuing our test and learn process on the merchandise side, expanding our new customer loyalty program pilot, growing our store mobile point-of-sale test and conducting a comprehensive DC network analysis. And we are pleased with the progress we are making on all of these initiatives.
Just this month, we expanded the test of our Neighbor's Club customer loyalty program to the California market, and now have over 190 stores participating. While still early in the process, the initial enrollment rates continue to be ahead of our expectations. 
We are finding that our Neighbor's Club members are highly engaged to a tractor, and we are experiencing higher open and click-through rates on our targeted e-mails and communications to them.
We have now completed the implementation of our new allocation system. The new system is designed to improve the efficiency and accuracy of our allocation process and is scalable to support our long-term store growth targets. We continue to expand the test of mobile POS devices into our stores. 
And as the functionality has improved, the adaptation from our team members and customers have also increased. This capability will enable us and our team members to sell and assist customers with products from any point in or outside our stores.
And lastly, we are continuing the analysis of our DC network and systems, which we believe will be critical in supporting our growth to 2,500 stores and evolving our supply chain strategy and capability for the longer term.
Overall, we believe these and other investments have made our business more nimble and less susceptible to external factors. But recent results remind us that extreme weather conditions from region to region can impact our business in the short term, and this is not likely to change. 
We continue to manage the business with the future in mind, and believe continuous improvement in our product and service offerings in addition to improving systems and efficiencies will keep Tractor Supply well positioned for growth.
Looking forward into the second half of the year, we are a bit more cautious. Despite the more normalized trends in June, we do not believe that we will see much of an extended spring selling season to recoup the sales loss in the second quarter. We revised our full year guidance in our June 29 business update press release and are reiterating that guidance today. Tony will take you through this in greater detail in a moment.
From a product and inventory perspective, we believe we are in a solid position to meet the needs of our customers as we transition the business from summer to fall. 
And before I wrap up, I want to thank the nearly 23,000 members of the Tractor Supply team for their continued hard work and dedication to our customers and our overall business. I also want to congratulate Tony on his planned retirement and Kurt Barton on his planned promotion to CFO. 
As we announced in today's earnings press release, Tony has notified the company that he plans to retire during the first quarter of fiscal 2017. Kurt Barton, the company's Senior Vice President and Corporate Controller, will succeed Tony as Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. 
Kurt has been with Tractor Supply for 17 years and is a talented financial leader with a proven track record of creating value. We all have the utmost confidence in his ability to continue leading the financial team forward. To ensure a smooth transition of duties, Kurt and Tony will work together over the next 7 months, with Kurt increasing his interface with the investment community through investor meetings and calls in the back half of the year.
I will now turn the call over to Tony for a more detailed commentary on our second quarter results and outlook for the remainder of 2016."

For the quarter ended June 25, 2016, on a year-over-year basis, net sales increased 4.5% to $1.85 billion, net income grew 2% to $156.4 million and EPS increased 3.6% to $1.16 per diluted share.Comp store sale",1388,"Thanks, Greg, and good afternoon, everyone. For the quarter ended June 25, 2016, on a year-over-year basis, net sales increased 4.5% to $1.85 billion, net income grew 2% to $156.4 million and EPS increased 3.6% to $1.16 per diluted share.
Comp store sales decreased 0.5% in the second quarter compared to a very strong increase of 5.6% in last year's second quarter. Comp store sales were challenged throughout the quarter, with April and May impacted primarily from unfavorable weather patterns and tough comparisons from prior year. 
Beginning with Memorial Day weekend and warmer weather, seasonal sales trends normalized and comp store sales were in line with our expectations in the month of June.
Sales were the weakest in the Northern regions of the country, where unseasonably cool temperatures reduced demand for many spring items. The Southern regions, which were less impacted by the cooler weather, performed more consistently with our expectations and had positive comps except for the Texas region.
In addition to the impact of the oil patch economy, certain areas of Texas were negatively impacted by heavy rains and flooding, which limited some of the spring season activities. Comp transaction count increased for the 33rd consecutive quarter, gaining 1.5% on top of a 4.2% increase last year. As C.U.E. items such as pet and animal food continued to post high single-digit comps.
Average comp ticket decreased by 190 basis points compared to last year's 130-basis-point increase. Big ticket drove last year's increase and was the principal driver of this year's average ticket decrease. Comparable sales of big ticket items declined approximately 8.5% as big ticket items such as riding lawnmowers and utility vehicles were challenged due to strong comparisons to last year and this year's unfavorable selling conditions. Deflation also had a slight impact on average ticket and contributed approximately 25 basis points to the decrease.
Now turning to gross margin, which decreased 23 basis points to 35% compared to a 50-basis-point improvement in last year's second quarter. Product mix had a negative impact on margin. Although margin benefited from soft sales of some of the key big ticket items such as riding lawnmowers, this benefit was more than offset by the soft sales in other high-margin departments and the strong sales of lower-margin C.U.E. items. 
With respect to margin rate, while promotion cadence was relatively consistent with last year with the exception of a friends and neighbors event, we were slightly sharper on price to drive sales.
Freight was unfavorable as an increase in inbound transportation cost more than offset the benefits from lower diesel prices and a reduction in the outbound stem miles. We estimate deflation had a slight favorable impact on gross margin.
For the quarter, SG&A, including depreciation and amortization as a percentage of sales delevered by 15 basis points to 21.6% of sales compared to 21.4% of sales in the prior year's quarter. SG&A growth was impacted by several factors. The deleverage was primarily due to the lower comparable sales results as SG&A expense grew only 5.2% from the prior year. Excluding incentive compensation expense, SG&A expense increased 6.7%, which is below the SG&A growth rate over the past several quarters.
We experienced strong cost control in personnel, including store level, distribution center and store support payroll as well as medical expense.
Occupancy expense was well managed as we began to benefit from our LED lighting retrofit. The strong expense management was achieved against the headwind from our Arizona distribution center that was not open at this time last year. We estimate the deleverage from the center's operation to be approximately 15 basis points.
Our effective income tax rate decreased to 36.8% in Q2 compared to 37.2% last year due to additional federal and state tax credits.
Turning to the balance sheet. At the end of Q2 this year, we had cash balance of $151.1 million and $196.2 million in outstanding debt, principally comprised of the term loan compared to a cash balance of $56 million and no outstanding debt last year.
During the second quarter, we had limited purchases under our stock repurchase program. Average inventory levels per store decreased 1.2% compared to a 4.1% increase in last year's second quarter, and inventory turns decreased compared to last year. 
We had strong inventory management in the quarter considering the soft sales environment. The transition between second and third quarters generally does not have significant markdown exposure. We are comfortable with our seasonal inventory as we move into the third quarter, and we expect a normal markdown cadence exiting the season.
Capital expenditures for the quarter were $64.3 million compared to $48.2 million last year. We opened 22 stores and closed 1 Del's store in the second quarter compared to 17 new stores and 1 closed store in the second quarter of 2015.
The CapEx increase relates to our new store expansion, which includes an emphasis on retrofit locations that generally require renovation capital and our LED lighting retrofit project.
Now looking ahead, based on the trends and results for the first half of the year, we revised our outlook for the full year fiscal 2016 in our June 29th business update. We are reiterating that outlook today. 
We expect full year sales to range from $6.8 billion to $6.9 billion, comparable store sales to increase between 2.5% and 3.5% and net income to range from $451 million to $456 million with earnings per diluted share to be $3.35 to $3.40.
Assumed in this guidance is an EBIT margin improvement of about 10 to 15 basis points, a tax rate of 36.8% and capital expenditures of $230 million to $250 million. We will continue to make purchases under our share repurchase program and currently project full year diluted shares outstanding to be approximately $134.5 million to $134.8 million. 
In our June 29th business update, we stated that although June sales were more normalized, we did not expect a shift of spring sales into the third quarter. While it is still early in the third quarter, the trends through the first few weeks of July would appear to support this expectation. From a comparison standpoint in the third quarter, we face our toughest year-over-year comparison in July and our easiest comparison is in September.
As a reminder, we had a record mild winter last year, and therefore, we believe that any upside in our forecast will be in the fourth quarter. We also have our 53rd week and an additional comp sales day in the fourth quarter. The additional sales week will provide incremental expense leverage in the fourth quarter, and we estimate that the additional week will provide $0.03 to $0.04 increase to EPS, which is contained in our guidance.
In our original full year guidance, we forecasted a $0.01 negative EPS impact from the closing of several Del's stores in the fourth quarter as part of our transition to Tractor Supply stores in Washington state. 
We have now made the decision to close those stores closer to their lease expiration, with most of them expiring in 2017. We are pleased with the performance to date of the Tractor Supply stores that we have opened in the former Del's markets.
We continue to expect limited deflation in the back half of the year in the 15- to 20-basis-point range. As we look at the back half of the year, we expect improvement of EBIT margin driven principally by improved gross margin in both the third and fourth quarters and expense leverage from the 53rd week. While transportation expenses will continue to be a headwind as we cycle the decline in diesel prices, we expect our gross margin initiatives to continue to drive improvement.
With respect to SG&A, we were very pleased with our expense management in Q2. We will continue to drive cost saving programs in the back half and we'll react accordingly to sales trends, but we would expect year-over-year increase in SG&A to track closer to the overall growth in sales. 
We expect to maintain the appropriate payroll allocation to drive sales in the back half and incur a more normalized incentive compensation expense. We will continue to have the headwind of the Arizona distribution center until we cycle its opening in late December.
That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we will now turn the call over for questions."

Everyone who signs up, we will give some time to. And so we don't really narrow it down in any one given category. In terms of what we're looking at in the box itself to move our business forward, we've talked a lot about the C.U.E. business. And you'll see a number of resets that are going to take place in the back half of this year that will support that, whether it'd be what we're doing in feed with the launch of our DuMOR equine program or what we're going to see in terms of Blue Seal, which will expand out to another couple of hundred stores in the Northeast and down the corridor. So there's a lot of things that are happening within the box right now, not just in terms of resets but also events such as deer feeding that we've got out there right now that's doing particularly well or the Stock Your Shop tool event. And in that event itself, we're going to have about 60% new products that we didn't have a year ago to really give our customers a treasure hunt experience. So I could go on and on about all the things that we're working on, but I would say across the board, we've got a lot of things cooking."

A couple of things to note. The second quarter was difficult. And there was just incredibly, I'll say, challenging weather in some other regions of the country, where we have typically been able to weather those storms in the past, but -- I'll give you an example. In Texas, very, very difficult, massive flooding, a lot of destruction. That will take time for that market to come back. It's not -- it doesn't snap back tomorrow. So our feeling was, let's be a little more conservative as we go in the second half. We know it's going to take some time for a large market like that where we have 170-plus stores to recover. And we -- and as we talked amongst ourselves, our feeling was, we're always kind of a conservative group here. We would rather be more conservative and give ourselves an opportunity to exceed that than to say, well, we think -- we can't forecast the future. We could only kind of deal with the past and try to look at that and understand what could be in front of us.

As we look forward, we're going to continue to use all the arrows in our quiver to best support the business. And whether that be using inventory to help move our business forward, it could be looking at additional promotional pieces and it could be a variety of things. Maybe it's getting more targeted around some of the C.U.E. businesses. Another thing that we're doing is local presentation. So right now, where it's hot and dry out West, we've got our store teams out there, putting together water movement and fans and things that we're doing down in Texas. So we're constantly moving the business around based on the needs of the consumer.

So we thought, well, that's just going to be a trade-off between a couple of months. But as we said in the 29th update, we really haven't seen anything significant with the customers' use of credit or shift to spending and so on and so forth at this point. It's fundamentally they're still buying the things they need, they're still shopping for us, our traffic counts are up. So it was a bit of a tough pill to swallow when we saw the business just not developed and then, again, a little warmness in June and we saw a nice push again in the business.

But I can't underestimate and we used to -- I think that we could control more things around some of the weather patterning across the country. But as we've gotten now into 49 states, and that store dispersion is a good thing generally, I would tell you that it makes it more challenging for us to understand sometimes how these ebb and flows will affect the overall business on an annual basis. We typically can work our way through some of these slight, if you call it, troubled spots where we have, I will say, less-than-ideal weather and less-than-ideal conditions for selling certain products. But we're in a new learning curve here, I believe, as we look at some of these things moving forward. And the team has done some great work as we forecast forward through the second half and into next year. And I'm convinced that we can kind of push this thing back on this growth trajectory that is kind of expected from Tractor. I mean, we're a test and learn company. We learn all the time. There's no lack of newness, as Steve mentioned earlier. We continue to introduce new products, and those are things that really drive all the footsteps. And then we're getting far better at this localization component, and that's going to be a key as we go forward because that helps us defend ourselves when conditions are less than ideal for selling some products. I can't reiterate enough, our customers buy to demand or to need. They don't buy early, and they haven't been for a long time."

Our units in terms of SKU products, we're still seeing strong comp store units movement, and we really track units as much as we do sales in many cases.

But the more stores that we put out there in the landscape, the more often and more chances we have to win customers over. So I think our plans as we go forward are solid.

On the call with me today are Tony Crudele, our EVP and Chief Financial Officer; and Steve Barbarick, our President and Chief Merchandising Officer.As you are all aware from our prerelease on",1104,"Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. On the call with me today are Tony Crudele, our EVP and Chief Financial Officer; and Steve Barbarick, our President and Chief Merchandising Officer.
As you are all aware from our prerelease on June 29th, we had a challenging second quarter, not the typical Tractor Supply performance. And clearly, the weather was not favorable. The bottom line is, our business was heavily influenced by weather in Q2. 
We have worked very hard to be the most dependable supplier of products to the rural lifestyle customer. And the fact remains that some of those products, being seasonal in nature, can be impacted by weather.
Weather has always been a factor in our business, and we know it's our job to manage around those external factors. However, we generally have not experienced the extreme conditions in variability in the weather from region to region like we saw in this second quarter. 
Hot and dry in the West, cold and wet in the East and Midwest and severe flooding and damage in the South Central. Just about every region experienced some form of weather variance, and the conditions were very different from region to region.
When the weather began to normalize in June, so did our business. But the turn was not enough to offset the weakness in April and May and not enough for us to anticipate that a significant shift in seasonal sales will occur coming into the third quarter. As a result, we have become a bit more cautious in our outlook for the remainder of the year, although last year's sales comparisons are more favorable in the second half.
During the quarter, very strong demand for our core animal and pet offerings continued, and we believe we are gaining share in these areas. We also saw continued momentum with events that directly support the sustainable lifestyle. Chick Days and our garden event both experienced strong year-over-year growth. 
We saw healthy demand for outdoor furniture, pest and rodent control products, barbecue grills. But unfavorable weather and a difficult year-over-year sales comparison challenged our ability to drive sales providing lawnmowers, lawn and garden products and utility vehicles.
We did see increased demand in departments where we continued to innovate and introduce newness such as truck lighting and accessories, trailers and outdoor water recreation. Our inventory and planning teams did an excellent job reacting to the softer sales trends in the quarter, and through a balanced approach, managed the sales margin and inventory investment in relationship to customer demand. 
Tractor Supply will continue to invest in our business to drive sales, shorten our supply chain time line and increase our overall productivity and profitability as a company.
In addition to implementing an improved allocation system, we are continuing our test and learn process on the merchandise side, expanding our new customer loyalty program pilot, growing our store mobile point-of-sale test and conducting a comprehensive DC network analysis. And we are pleased with the progress we are making on all of these initiatives.
Just this month, we expanded the test of our Neighbor's Club customer loyalty program to the California market, and now have over 190 stores participating. While still early in the process, the initial enrollment rates continue to be ahead of our expectations. 
We are finding that our Neighbor's Club members are highly engaged to a tractor, and we are experiencing higher open and click-through rates on our targeted e-mails and communications to them.
We have now completed the implementation of our new allocation system. The new system is designed to improve the efficiency and accuracy of our allocation process and is scalable to support our long-term store growth targets. We continue to expand the test of mobile POS devices into our stores. 
And as the functionality has improved, the adaptation from our team members and customers have also increased. This capability will enable us and our team members to sell and assist customers with products from any point in or outside our stores.
And lastly, we are continuing the analysis of our DC network and systems, which we believe will be critical in supporting our growth to 2,500 stores and evolving our supply chain strategy and capability for the longer term.
Overall, we believe these and other investments have made our business more nimble and less susceptible to external factors. But recent results remind us that extreme weather conditions from region to region can impact our business in the short term, and this is not likely to change. 
We continue to manage the business with the future in mind, and believe continuous improvement in our product and service offerings in addition to improving systems and efficiencies will keep Tractor Supply well positioned for growth.
Looking forward into the second half of the year, we are a bit more cautious. Despite the more normalized trends in June, we do not believe that we will see much of an extended spring selling season to recoup the sales loss in the second quarter. We revised our full year guidance in our June 29 business update press release and are reiterating that guidance today. Tony will take you through this in greater detail in a moment.
From a product and inventory perspective, we believe we are in a solid position to meet the needs of our customers as we transition the business from summer to fall. 
And before I wrap up, I want to thank the nearly 23,000 members of the Tractor Supply team for their continued hard work and dedication to our customers and our overall business. I also want to congratulate Tony on his planned retirement and Kurt Barton on his planned promotion to CFO. 
As we announced in today's earnings press release, Tony has notified the company that he plans to retire during the first quarter of fiscal 2017. Kurt Barton, the company's Senior Vice President and Corporate Controller, will succeed Tony as Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. 
Kurt has been with Tractor Supply for 17 years and is a talented financial leader with a proven track record of creating value. We all have the utmost confidence in his ability to continue leading the financial team forward. To ensure a smooth transition of duties, Kurt and Tony will work together over the next 7 months, with Kurt increasing his interface with the investment community through investor meetings and calls in the back half of the year.
I will now turn the call over to Tony for a more detailed commentary on our second quarter results and outlook for the remainder of 2016."

For the quarter ended June 25, 2016, on a year-over-year basis, net sales increased 4.5% to $1.85 billion, net income grew 2% to $156.4 million and EPS increased 3.6% to $1.16 per diluted share.Comp store sale",1388,"Thanks, Greg, and good afternoon, everyone. For the quarter ended June 25, 2016, on a year-over-year basis, net sales increased 4.5% to $1.85 billion, net income grew 2% to $156.4 million and EPS increased 3.6% to $1.16 per diluted share.
Comp store sales decreased 0.5% in the second quarter compared to a very strong increase of 5.6% in last year's second quarter. Comp store sales were challenged throughout the quarter, with April and May impacted primarily from unfavorable weather patterns and tough comparisons from prior year. 
Beginning with Memorial Day weekend and warmer weather, seasonal sales trends normalized and comp store sales were in line with our expectations in the month of June.
Sales were the weakest in the Northern regions of the country, where unseasonably cool temperatures reduced demand for many spring items. The Southern regions, which were less impacted by the cooler weather, performed more consistently with our expectations and had positive comps except for the Texas region.
In addition to the impact of the oil patch economy, certain areas of Texas were negatively impacted by heavy rains and flooding, which limited some of the spring season activities. Comp transaction count increased for the 33rd consecutive quarter, gaining 1.5% on top of a 4.2% increase last year. As C.U.E. items such as pet and animal food continued to post high single-digit comps.
Average comp ticket decreased by 190 basis points compared to last year's 130-basis-point increase. Big ticket drove last year's increase and was the principal driver of this year's average ticket decrease. Comparable sales of big ticket items declined approximately 8.5% as big ticket items such as riding lawnmowers and utility vehicles were challenged due to strong comparisons to last year and this year's unfavorable selling conditions. Deflation also had a slight impact on average ticket and contributed approximately 25 basis points to the decrease.
Now turning to gross margin, which decreased 23 basis points to 35% compared to a 50-basis-point improvement in last year's second quarter. Product mix had a negative impact on margin. Although margin benefited from soft sales of some of the key big ticket items such as riding lawnmowers, this benefit was more than offset by the soft sales in other high-margin departments and the strong sales of lower-margin C.U.E. items. 
With respect to margin rate, while promotion cadence was relatively consistent with last year with the exception of a friends and neighbors event, we were slightly sharper on price to drive sales.
Freight was unfavorable as an increase in inbound transportation cost more than offset the benefits from lower diesel prices and a reduction in the outbound stem miles. We estimate deflation had a slight favorable impact on gross margin.
For the quarter, SG&A, including depreciation and amortization as a percentage of sales delevered by 15 basis points to 21.6% of sales compared to 21.4% of sales in the prior year's quarter. SG&A growth was impacted by several factors. The deleverage was primarily due to the lower comparable sales results as SG&A expense grew only 5.2% from the prior year. Excluding incentive compensation expense, SG&A expense increased 6.7%, which is below the SG&A growth rate over the past several quarters.
We experienced strong cost control in personnel, including store level, distribution center and store support payroll as well as medical expense.
Occupancy expense was well managed as we began to benefit from our LED lighting retrofit. The strong expense management was achieved against the headwind from our Arizona distribution center that was not open at this time last year. We estimate the deleverage from the center's operation to be approximately 15 basis points.
Our effective income tax rate decreased to 36.8% in Q2 compared to 37.2% last year due to additional federal and state tax credits.
Turning to the balance sheet. At the end of Q2 this year, we had cash balance of $151.1 million and $196.2 million in outstanding debt, principally comprised of the term loan compared to a cash balance of $56 million and no outstanding debt last year.
During the second quarter, we had limited purchases under our stock repurchase program. Average inventory levels per store decreased 1.2% compared to a 4.1% increase in last year's second quarter, and inventory turns decreased compared to last year. 
We had strong inventory management in the quarter considering the soft sales environment. The transition between second and third quarters generally does not have significant markdown exposure. We are comfortable with our seasonal inventory as we move into the third quarter, and we expect a normal markdown cadence exiting the season.
Capital expenditures for the quarter were $64.3 million compared to $48.2 million last year. We opened 22 stores and closed 1 Del's store in the second quarter compared to 17 new stores and 1 closed store in the second quarter of 2015.
The CapEx increase relates to our new store expansion, which includes an emphasis on retrofit locations that generally require renovation capital and our LED lighting retrofit project.
Now looking ahead, based on the trends and results for the first half of the year, we revised our outlook for the full year fiscal 2016 in our June 29th business update. We are reiterating that outlook today. 
We expect full year sales to range from $6.8 billion to $6.9 billion, comparable store sales to increase between 2.5% and 3.5% and net income to range from $451 million to $456 million with earnings per diluted share to be $3.35 to $3.40.
Assumed in this guidance is an EBIT margin improvement of about 10 to 15 basis points, a tax rate of 36.8% and capital expenditures of $230 million to $250 million. We will continue to make purchases under our share repurchase program and currently project full year diluted shares outstanding to be approximately $134.5 million to $134.8 million. 
In our June 29th business update, we stated that although June sales were more normalized, we did not expect a shift of spring sales into the third quarter. While it is still early in the third quarter, the trends through the first few weeks of July would appear to support this expectation. From a comparison standpoint in the third quarter, we face our toughest year-over-year comparison in July and our easiest comparison is in September.
As a reminder, we had a record mild winter last year, and therefore, we believe that any upside in our forecast will be in the fourth quarter. We also have our 53rd week and an additional comp sales day in the fourth quarter. The additional sales week will provide incremental expense leverage in the fourth quarter, and we estimate that the additional week will provide $0.03 to $0.04 increase to EPS, which is contained in our guidance.
In our original full year guidance, we forecasted a $0.01 negative EPS impact from the closing of several Del's stores in the fourth quarter as part of our transition to Tractor Supply stores in Washington state. 
We have now made the decision to close those stores closer to their lease expiration, with most of them expiring in 2017. We are pleased with the performance to date of the Tractor Supply stores that we have opened in the former Del's markets.
We continue to expect limited deflation in the back half of the year in the 15- to 20-basis-point range. As we look at the back half of the year, we expect improvement of EBIT margin driven principally by improved gross margin in both the third and fourth quarters and expense leverage from the 53rd week. While transportation expenses will continue to be a headwind as we cycle the decline in diesel prices, we expect our gross margin initiatives to continue to drive improvement.
With respect to SG&A, we were very pleased with our expense management in Q2. We will continue to drive cost saving programs in the back half and we'll react accordingly to sales trends, but we would expect year-over-year increase in SG&A to track closer to the overall growth in sales. 
We expect to maintain the appropriate payroll allocation to drive sales in the back half and incur a more normalized incentive compensation expense. We will continue to have the headwind of the Arizona distribution center until we cycle its opening in late December.
That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we will now turn the call over for questions."

The advantage of the open buying days is we're going to get an opportunity to see 300, 400 folks come through and talk to our teams, all of which are doing business with Tractor Supply today and really getting a better understanding of what's going on in the marketplace because most of these folks, either seller or competitors or they're somewhere else out there that we can get a better read on what's happening in the marketplace. Everyone who signs up, we will give some time to. And so we don't really narrow it down in any one given category. In terms of what we're looking at in the box itself to move our business forward, we've talked a lot about the C.U.E. business. And you'll see a number of resets that are going to take place in the back half of this year that will support that, whether it'd be what we're doing in feed with the launch of our DuMOR equine program or what we're going to see in terms of Blue Seal, which will expand out to another couple of hundred stores in the Northeast and down the corridor. So there's a lot of things that are happening within the box right now, not just in terms of resets but also events such as deer feeding that we've got out there right now that's doing particularly well or the Stock Your Shop tool event. And in that event itself, we're going to have about 60% new products that we didn't have a year ago to really give our customers a treasure hunt experience. So I could go on and on about all the things that we're working on, but I would say across the board, we've got a lot of things cooking."

A couple of things to note. The second quarter was difficult. And there was just incredibly, I'll say, challenging weather in some other regions of the country, where we have typically been able to weather those storms in the past, but -- I'll give you an example. In Texas, very, very difficult, massive flooding, a lot of destruction. That will take time for that market to come back. It's not -- it doesn't snap back tomorrow. So our feeling was, let's be a little more conservative as we go in the second half. We know it's going to take some time for a large market like that where we have 170-plus stores to recover. And we -- and as we talked amongst ourselves, our feeling was, we're always kind of a conservative group here. We would rather be more conservative and give ourselves an opportunity to exceed that than to say, well, we think -- we can't forecast the future. We could only kind of deal with the past and try to look at that and understand what could be in front of us.

So we thought, well, that's just going to be a trade-off between a couple of months. But as we said in the 29th update, we really haven't seen anything significant with the customers' use of credit or shift to spending and so on and so forth at this point. It's fundamentally they're still buying the things they need, they're still shopping for us, our traffic counts are up. So it was a bit of a tough pill to swallow when we saw the business just not developed and then, again, a little warmness in June and we saw a nice push again in the business.

I've been with the company now -- I'll be 9 years in November. And I would say that the last 4 had been the most interesting from a standpoint of the mix of our products, when things were selling, when things peaked, introductions of newness and so on. But I can't underestimate and we used to -- I think that we could control more things around some of the weather patterning across the country. But as we've gotten now into 49 states, and that store dispersion is a good thing generally, I would tell you that it makes it more challenging for us to understand sometimes how these ebb and flows will affect the overall business on an annual basis. We typically can work our way through some of these slight, if you call it, troubled spots where we have, I will say, less-than-ideal weather and less-than-ideal conditions for selling certain products. But we're in a new learning curve here, I believe, as we look at some of these things moving forward. And the team has done some great work as we forecast forward through the second half and into next year. And I'm convinced that we can kind of push this thing back on this growth trajectory that is kind of expected from Tractor. I mean, we're a test and learn company. We learn all the time. There's no lack of newness, as Steve mentioned earlier. We continue to introduce new products, and those are things that really drive all the footsteps. And then we're getting far better at this localization component, and that's going to be a key as we go forward because that helps us defend ourselves when conditions are less than ideal for selling some products. I can't reiterate enough, our customers buy to demand or to need. They don't buy early, and they haven't been for a long time."

In addition to that, the clearance module that we use has still been very effective for us and helping us work our way through a lot of that product while it's still in home before it gets moved and try to move it through while we're still in season. Our units in terms of SKU products, we're still seeing strong comp store units movement, and we really track units as much as we do sales in many cases.

I would say to you that from a competitive standpoint, I think the overall farm community or farm business is probably fairly healthy from a retail standpoint. And we're opening stores in markets where the competition is at. Vice versa, they're opening a few in our markets. And we have plans, and I'll call it tactics, to challenge that and offset that. So we're not seeing any real competitive intrusion to any great degree, anything different than we've seen in the past. One of the things we don't and will not do is go out and try to buy sales for the short term. Steve mentioned earlier that we're going to look at all the ways that we can be in front of our customer with our mix and the brand itself. But the more stores that we put out there in the landscape, the more often and more chances we have to win customers over. So I think our plans as we go forward are solid. I think our store expansion strategy is solid. And there's not a competitive intrusion that's causing any issues for us at this point."

Thank you for joining us. On the call with me today are Tony Crudele, our EVP and Chief Financial Officer; Steve Barbarick, our President and Chief Merchandising and Marketing Officer; and Kurt Barton, our Senior VP and Controller. 
As we previously discussed in our business update earlier in September, there were several headwinds affecting our business during the third quarter. We have dedicated a considerable amount of time and effort gathering and analyzing data during the quarter to understand more fully the impact these headwinds have had on our performance, and we do not believe the current sales trends are the result of significant shifts in the competitive landscape, our market share growth or our long-term operating fundamentals. In fact, our core everyday business in categories such as Livestock and Pet [ph] remain strong throughout the third quarter, and our business outside of the energy and agricultural markets in regions like the Southwest and West performed very well for the quarter. We did, however, experienced softer demand in the energy and agricultural markets, and we saw a slow start to the early preseason sales of cold weather and heating-related products that impacted the Northern region.
We have managed successfully through challenging sales environments before, the recession of 2008, 2009. And during those most difficult sales periods, our teams remained focused on managing the factors they could control such as inventory, gross margin and other expenses. We made the necessary adjustments then by taking a long-term balanced approach as we cycle through those periods, and we will do the same for now until these short-term headwinds subside.
At Tractor Supply, we are committed to introduce new products and updating our merchandise categories to keep our stores fresh. And with the current sales environment, we are specifically targeting those categories that have demonstrated strong sales performance year-to-date. Already this fall season, we have had several series of calls with field leadership across several of our more challenged markets to understand the depth of the issues we face. As a result of those calls, we executed a number of timely inventory investments to ensure that we have the appropriate emphasis on categories of high demand in those regions that are performing well: categories such as pet food, agricultural fencing [ph] and grass seeds, to name a few.
Additionally, recognizing [ph] the cold weather and winter preparedness sales were slower to ramp, we adjusted our inventories downward on cold weather products and upward on warm weather regional categories where customer demand stayed high such as fly control, riding lawnmowers, short-sleeve shirts and packaged seeds. [ph] Having this agility to react to current sales trends, we believe it's our [ph] level of sophistication and capability that differentiates us from most of our competition. 
Now with respect to our management of seasonal inventory, we are monitoring sales trends closely and continue to adjust for ongoing customer demand. For example, in the heating category, which I mentioned earlier, we have experienced sluggish early demand and we have kept inventories at a minimum for now. When sales trends accelerate due to cooler weather, our supply chain and our vendor base are ready to react and will push inventory into our DCs then into our stores quickly so that we can meet the increased sales demands.
Also in many of our everyday basic items, C.U.E., [ph] we have elevated in-stock levels to meet the continuing strong demand for animal, pet and land care needs. While we may be a chain of 1,500-plus stores, what is important to understand about our customer is that they perceive Tractor Supply as their unique farm store conveniently located in their small community that offers them locally correct assortments that meet the unique outdoor [ph] lifestyle needs they have.
Now on the marketing front. We adjusted Q3 and forward [ph] programs based on current sales trends by region in an effort to accelerate our comp store sales. We added radio advertising to promote key events during the quarter such as our annual pet appreciation week and lowest prices of the season event. [ph] We enhanced our digital impressions to our web customers and increased our circular distribution to a larger base of our best customers, and we added several targeted sales driving initiatives in key sales weeks to improve our overall sales and marketing effectiveness.
To demonstrate how we are focusing on the growth of our business for the long term, we are continuing to invest in technology to improve our capture of customer insights. This includes the rollout of our Neighbor's Club loyalty program which we believe will give Tractor Supply a unique way to communicate with our customer base by offering a more relevant and personalized message. As well, we completed bringing our customer database in-house so that we could better analyze and segment the customer information that we are collecting from our Neighbor's Club members.
We added an additional 45 stores to the Neighbor's Club program on October 1 in the Western region. And with the initial customer enrollment and customer response being so positive, we now plan to roll the program out to all stores by the middle of 2017.
We continue to invest in the platforms where our customers choose to shop, giving them more options in the way they can interact with the Tractor Supply Company as a brand. This includes the introduction of buy online, pick up in store, [ph] which we started piloting in September and expect to have wide in over half of the chain by the end of this year. We are also continuing to invest in our Tractor Supply website to improved search capabilities and to enhance the know-how section for product content and projects that are important to our customers using videos and online articles. And we continue to invest in store-level resources, including mobile POS and a more intuitive special order process that will assist our team members and our customers to locate hard-to-find products.
As a company, we remain confident in our long-term store target of 2,500 domestic Tractor Supply locations and mid-single-digit annual square footage growth. To help achieve this target, we recently conducted a comprehensive study of our logistics infrastructure to understand what would be required to add capacity and drive more supply chain efficiency as we move toward our long-term store target. One thing to note from the study data, we confirmed that we have a short-term need to add additional distribution capacity in the Northeast region if we plan to continue the store growth there. We have begun the planning process to enable the opening of a new distribution center in that region targeted for mid- to late 2018.
Our recently announced purchase of Petsense, [ph] a leading specialty retailer of pet supplies and services with over 130 stores in 25 states, is another example of our commitment to long-term growth. For some time now, we have discussed the Pet category as a growth opportunity for the company. And based on our research and experience with our own hometown pet concept, we concluded there is a substantial opportunity to grow the pet specialty business in small town America. Their expertise and success in growing a smaller pet specialty store format will allow Petsense to continue at a growth rate of 15% to 20% annually without distraction to the TSC business. Tractor Supply's proven expertise in site selection and store growth should make for a strong partnership with Petsense and allow us to accelerate their growth over time.
Over the longer term, we stay focused on our people and their development, on enhancing our merchandise assortments and adding IT capability to better meet the evolving needs of our customers while always being mindful to return value to our shareholders through sustainable longer-term growth.
Before I wrap up, I want to thank the nearly 23,000 members of the Tractor Supply family for their continued hard work, dedication and the level of service they provide our customers. A big hoorah [ph] to all. 
I would also like to welcome the Petsense team as members of the Tractor Supply family. We are proud to be partnered with you and are excited about the opportunity to develop and grow the Petsense business.
I will now turn the call over to Tony for more detailed commentary on our third quarter financial results and the outlook for the remainder of 2016."

And good afternoon, everyone. For the quarter ended September 24, 2016, on a year-over-year basis, net sales increased 4.5% to $1.54 billion; net income grew 2.4% to $89.4 million; and EPS increased 4.7% to $0.67 per diluted share.C",1572,"Great. Thanks, Greg. And good afternoon, everyone. For the quarter ended September 24, 2016, on a year-over-year basis, net sales increased 4.5% to $1.54 billion; net income grew 2.4% to $89.4 million; and EPS increased 4.7% to $0.67 per diluted share.
Comp store sales decreased 0.6% in the third quarter compared to an increase of 2.9% in last year's third quarter. There are a number of economic headwinds impacting consumer spending throughout many of our markets. However, as noted in our business update on September 7, the energy-producing and agricultural markets were the most impacted. To give you a sense of the magnitude of the macro impact of the energy and farm economies, we estimate that approximately 25% of our stores have a direct correlation to these economies. This does not include any of the stores that may be tangently [ph] affected by the economies.
The strongest regional performance was in the Southeast and West regions where there is less exposure to the energy and agricultural markets. The West region base had a solid mid-single-digit comp, and the Southeast was well above chain average. We continue to experience strong demand for many of our basic everyday items such as Livestock and Pet category which generated mid-single-digit comparable chain wide sales. While the quarter did not shape up the way we expected, we continued to be well positioned for the long term. The solid comp sales in the nonimpacted regions support our position that the business will continue to drive profitable growth. As Greg said, we have been through periods like this before, and we have the leaders and the strategy to continue delivering value to customers, stakeholders and shareholders.
Comp transaction count increased for the 34th consecutive quarter, gaining 0.5%, on top of a 3.8% increase last year as some C.U.E. items, such as pet food and animal feed, continue to drive strong traffic. Average comp ticket decreased by 111 basis points compared to last year's 90 basis points decrease. Big ticket was one of the largest drivers of this year's average ticket decrease. Comparable sales of big ticket items declined approximately 4.7%. The decline was across several categories related principally to the energy and farm markets as well as early season winter sales in the North. More discretionary items, such as UTVs, were down in the oil and farm areas. Oil patch-related products such as compressors and fuel handling were down. Cold weather-related hardlines, such as log splitters and stoves, were down double digits as a result of the lack of urgency cycling a warm winter season last year and low heating oil prices.
On a positive note, we did take advantage of opportunities for some key summer big ticket products, such as riding lawnmowers, by working collaboratively with vendors to develop a late-season sales driving program. Additionally, the average ticket was negatively impacted by the decline in the units per transaction, with preseason sales of wood burning fuel as the principal driver. We estimated of that deflation also decreased the average ticket by approximately 40 basis points. September was the strongest sales month and did register a positive comp. September did have the easiest year-over-year comparison. 
Now turning to gross margin which was flat at 34.7% compared to 60-basis-point decrease in last year's third quarter. Overall, we're very pleased how the team managed margin during a tough selling environment. We continue to improve our initial margin through our key margin initiatives.
Product mix had a negative impact on margin. This resulted from a larger mix of feed and pet food and the strong sales in the riding lawnmower category. 
With respect to margin rate, we were sharper on price and, as Greg mentioned, added few sales-driving initiatives. Freight was essentially flat, lower diesel fuel, lower container cost and a reduction in outbound stem miles were favorable factors. This was offset by higher inbound and outbound costs related to mix and higher lane [ph] costs. We estimate that deflation had a slightly favorable impact on gross margin.
For the quarter, SG&A, including depreciation and amortization as a percent of sales, deleveraged by 20 basis points to 25.5% of sales. The deleverage was primarily due to the decline in comparable sales. SG&A expense grew only 5.4% from the prior year which benefited from a reduction in incentive compensation expense. Excluding incentive compensation, SG&A expense increased only 7.9%, a continuation of the tight cost control management initiated in the second quarter.
Similar to the second quarter, we experienced strong cost control in store level and store support center payroll and medical expense. Occupancy expense was well managed as we continued to benefit from our LED lighting retrofit. The strong expense management was achieved against the headwind from our Arizona DC and mixing centers. We estimate the deleverage from these centers' operations were approximately 15 basis points. Our effective income tax rate decreased to 36.5% in Q3 compared to 36.9% last year due to additional federal and state tax credits.
Turning to the balance sheet. At the end of Q3 this year, we had a cash balance of $55.5 million and $295 million in outstanding debt compared to a cash balance of $51.4 million and $190 million outstanding debt last year. During the third quarter, under our stock repurchase program, we acquired approximately 1.4 million shares for $108.8 million. Average inventory levels per store decreased 1.8% compared to 1.6% increase in last year's third quarter, and inventory turns decreased slightly. We managed our inventory well in the quarter and are comfortable with our seasonal inventory as we move into the fourth quarter.
Capital expenditures for the quarter were $66.2 million compared to $66.5 million last year. We opened up 34 stores, closed 1 Del's store in the third quarter compared to 30 new stores opened and 2 Del's stores and 1 Tractor Supply store closed in the third quarter of 2015. The CapEx this year relates to new store expansion, which includes an emphasis on retrofit locations that generally require renovation capital, and our LED lighting retrofit project. Whereas last year, capital included $12.6 million for the Arizona DC. 
Now looking ahead. Based on the trends and results of the third quarter, we revised our outlook for the full year fiscal year 2016 in our September 7 business update. We are reiterating that outlook today.
We expect full year sales to range from $6.7 billion to $6.75 billion, comparable store sales to increase between 1% and 1.7%, and net income to range from $432 million to $438 million and earnings per diluted share to range between $3.22 to $3.26. Assumed in this full year guidance is an EBIT margin decline of 10 to 15 basis points, a tax rate of 36.7% and capital expenditures of $235 million to $245 million. We will continue to make purchases under our share repurchase program and currently project full year diluted shares outstanding to be approximately 133.8 million to 134.2 million.
As a reminder, we have our 53rd week and an additional comp sales day in the fourth quarter. We now estimate that the additional week will provide $0.04 to $0.05 benefit to EPS which is contained in our guidance. We expect deflation in the fourth quarter of approximately 40 basis points. With respect to gross margin, we expect to continue to be sharper on price which will limit the upside on margin. We also expect to have slight headwinds from product mix and transportation expenses as we cycle the decline in diesel prices. Therefore, we are targeting gross margin to be flat to slightly down for the full year and the fourth quarter.
With respect to SG&A, we will continue to drive cost-saving programs in the fourth quarter and we will react accordingly to the sales trends. We expect to maintain appropriate payroll allocation to drive sales in the fourth quarter, and incur a more normalized incentive compensation expense. We will continue to have the headwind of the Arizona DC until we cycle its opening in late December. Although we benefit from slight leverage from the additional sales week, it has very little impact on the quarter. We estimate that the additional week adds approximately 6% to the year-over-year SG&A growth, including depreciation. We do not expect to leverage SG&A for the quarter. 
With respect to the Petsense acquisition, as we mentioned in our webcast call on September 29, we expect onetime transaction costs, with the majority being recognized in the fourth quarter to be approximately $0.01 to $0.015. There will be some integration costs but we expect these to be immaterial to our overall financial results. Although not originally included in our full year outlook due to the immateriality [ph] of the amount, we did not revise our guidance. Our guidance does that include Petsense sales or operations as we expect the net bottom line impact not to be material.
A few reminders as we look ahead to 2017. We'll be cycling the 53rd week year and, therefore, you need to adjust your models accordingly. With the resulting 1 week shift in 2017, Q2 will have 1 less comp day related to the shift in Easter. Additionally, in 2016, we had a significant decrease in incentive compensation.

But we talked about the impact that the energy markets have had on ticket, and I would go back and say that categories such as welders, some compressors, those type of businesses have been a bit of a challenge for us. And you can see that in those individual markets where we are impacted most by energy, things like certain apparel, whether it's some steel footwear -- cold footwear or fire-retardant apparel, that you can actually look into those specific regions and you can pretty much kind of estimate what categories are going to be the most impacted there. In terms of the seasonal businesses, we talked about having a fairly soft spring but didn't drag [ph] into the fall and that benefited us. But we certainly didn't capture any of the preheating sales that we had traditionally gotten. Still, again, if you look at seasonal, it's kind of a tale of 2 stories how we preferred to have spring in spring and winter in winter, but that just hasn't necessarily been the case yet. So we're having to move some of our inventories around to better position ourselves to optimize where we think we can. And then the last thing I would tell you is in the truck tool [ph] and hardware business, it's a little similar to what I talked about earlier with some of the big ticket.

They're still shopping the store as evidenced by the transaction increases that we're seeing. They're still supporting the pet, the animal and some land maintenance and in other categories across the stores. So we're not seeing them just cherrypick. They're actually shopping across the store. But they pull back considerably on big ticket spends for now. We think there's a number of factors involved there, not just the energy markets and some of the things happening in the ag economy. But we're going get to -- listen again this evening on a debate about who's going to be the next President of the United States, and those things have some effect on our customer, no question.

But when we look at it and look at it over a 12, rolling 12, it's relatively consistent for the last 4 quarters. It has gone down slightly. Some of the West stores have come out slower, that's probably one of the bigger drivers. And some of the West stores also had a little bit more square footage, as we've had some additional square footage so that we can add more allocation for the product since they tend to be strong feed stores.

Thank you for joining us. On the call with me today are Tony Crudele, our EVP and Chief Financial Officer; Steve Barbarick, our President and Chief Merchandising and Marketing Officer; and Kurt Barton, our Senior VP and Controlle",1389,"Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us. On the call with me today are Tony Crudele, our EVP and Chief Financial Officer; Steve Barbarick, our President and Chief Merchandising and Marketing Officer; and Kurt Barton, our Senior VP and Controller. 
As we previously discussed in our business update earlier in September, there were several headwinds affecting our business during the third quarter. We have dedicated a considerable amount of time and effort gathering and analyzing data during the quarter to understand more fully the impact these headwinds have had on our performance, and we do not believe the current sales trends are the result of significant shifts in the competitive landscape, our market share growth or our long-term operating fundamentals. In fact, our core everyday business in categories such as Livestock and Pet remain strong throughout the third quarter, and our business outside of the energy and agricultural markets in regions like the Southwest and West performed very well for the quarter. We did, however, experience softer demand in the energy and agricultural markets, and we saw a slow start to the early preseason sales of cold weather and heating-related products that impacted the Northern region.
We have managed successfully through challenging sales environments before, the recession of 2008, 2009. And during those most difficult sales periods, our teams remained focused on managing the factors they could control such as inventory, gross margin and other expenses. We made the necessary adjustments then by taking a long-term balanced approach as we cycle through those periods, and we will do the same for now until these short-term headwinds subside.
At Tractor Supply, we are committed to introduce new products and updating our merchandise categories to keep our stores fresh. And with the current sales environment, we are specifically targeting those categories that have demonstrated strong sales performance year-to-date. Already this fall season, we have had several series of calls with field leadership across several of our more challenged markets to understand the depth of the issues we face. As a result of those calls, we executed a number of timely inventory investments to ensure that we have the appropriate emphasis on categories of high demand in those regions that are performing well: categories such as pet food, agricultural fencing and grass seed, to name a few.
Additionally, recognizing the cold weather and winter preparedness sales were slower to ramp, we adjusted our inventories downward on cold weather products and upward on warm weather regional categories where customer demand stayed high such as fly control, riding lawnmowers, short-sleeved shirts and packaged seeds. Having this agility to react to current sales trends, we believe, is the level of sophistication and capability that differentiates us from most of our competition. 
Now with respect to our management of seasonal inventory, we are monitoring sales trends closely and continue to adjust for ongoing customer demand. For example, in the heating category, which I mentioned earlier, we have experienced sluggish early demand and we have kept inventories at a minimum for now. When sales trends accelerate due to cooler weather, our supply chain and our vendor base are ready to react and will push inventory into our DCs then into our stores quickly so that we can meet the increased sales demands.
Also in many of our everyday basic items, C.U.E., we have elevated in-stock levels to meet the continuing strong demand for animal, pet and land care needs. While we may be a chain of 1,500-plus stores, what is important to understand about our customer is that they perceive Tractor Supply as their unique farm store conveniently located in their small community that offers them locally correct assortments that meet the unique outdoor lifestyle needs they have.
Now on the marketing front. We adjusted Q3 and forward programs based on current sales trends by region in an effort to accelerate our comp store sales. We added radio advertising to promote key events during the quarter such as our annual Pet Appreciation Week and Lowest Prices of the Season event. We enhanced our digital impressions to our web customers and increased our circular distribution to a larger base of our best customers, and we added several targeted sales driving initiatives in key sales weeks to improve our overall sales and marketing effectiveness.
To demonstrate how we are focusing on the growth of our business for the long term, we are continuing to invest in technology to improve our capture of customer insights. This includes the rollout of our Neighbor's Club loyalty program which we believe will give Tractor Supply a unique way to communicate with our customer base by offering a more relevant and personalized message. As well, we completed bringing our customer database in-house so that we could better analyze and segment the customer information that we are collecting from our Neighbor's Club members.
We added an additional 45 stores to the Neighbor's Club program on October 1 in the Western region. And with the initial customer enrollment and customer response being so positive, we now plan to roll the program out to all stores by the middle of 2017.
We continue to invest in the platforms where our customers choose to shop, giving them more options in the way they can interact with the Tractor Supply Company as a brand. This includes the introduction of Buy Online Pickup in Store, which we started piloting in September and expect to have wide in over half of the chain by the end of this year. We are also continuing to invest in our Tractor Supply website to improved search capabilities and to enhance the know-how section for product content and projects that are important to our customers using videos and online articles. And we continue to invest in store-level resources, including mobile POS and a more intuitive special order process that will assist our team members and our customers to locate hard-to-find products.
As a company, we remain confident in our long-term store target of 2,500 domestic Tractor Supply locations and mid-single-digit annual square footage growth. To help achieve this target, we recently conducted a comprehensive study of our logistics infrastructure to understand what would be required to add capacity and drive more supply chain efficiency as we move toward our long-term store target. One thing to note from the study data, we confirmed that we have a short-term need to add additional distribution capacity in the Northeast region if we plan to continue the store growth there. We have begun the planning process to enable the opening of a new distribution center in that region targeted for mid- to late 2018.
Our recently announced purchase of Petsense, a leading specialty retailer of pet supplies and services with over 130 stores in 25 states, is another example of our commitment to long-term growth. For some time now, we have discussed the Pet category as a growth opportunity for the company. And based on our research and experience with our own hometown pet concept, we concluded there is a substantial opportunity to grow the pet specialty business in small town America. Their expertise and success in growing a smaller pet specialty store format will allow Petsense to continue at a growth rate of 15% to 20% annually without distraction to the TSC business. Tractor Supply's proven expertise in site selection and store growth should make for a strong partnership with Petsense and allow us to accelerate their growth over time.
Over the longer term, we stay focused on our people and their development, on enhancing our merchandise assortments and adding IT capability to better meet the evolving needs of our customers while always being mindful to return value to our shareholders through sustainable longer-term growth.
Before I wrap up, I want to thank the nearly 23,000 members of the Tractor Supply family for their continued hard work, dedication and the level of service they provide our customers. A big hoorah [ph] to all. 
I would also like to welcome the Petsense team as members of the Tractor Supply family. We are proud to be partnered with you and are excited about the opportunity to develop and grow the Petsense business.
I will now turn the call over to Tony for more detailed commentary on our third quarter financial results and the outlook for the remainder of 2016."
329501,404322301,1057181,"Tractor Supply Company, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 19, 2016",2016-10-19,"Earnings Calls","Tractor Supply Company","Executives","Great. Thanks, Greg. And good afternoon, everyone. For the quarter ended September 24, 2016, on a year-over-year basis, net sales increased 4.5% to $1.54 billion; net income grew 2.4% to $89.4 million; and EPS increased 4.7% to $0.67 per diluted share.C",1569,"Great. Thanks, Greg. And good afternoon, everyone. For the quarter ended September 24, 2016, on a year-over-year basis, net sales increased 4.5% to $1.54 billion; net income grew 2.4% to $89.4 million; and EPS increased 4.7% to $0.67 per diluted share.
Comp store sales decreased 0.6% in the third quarter compared to an increase of 2.9% in last year's third quarter. There are a number of economic headwinds impacting consumer spending throughout many of our markets. However, as noted in our business update on September 7, the energy-producing and agricultural markets were the most impacted. To give you a sense of the magnitude of the macro impact of the energy and farm economies, we estimate that approximately 25% of our stores have a direct correlation to these economies. This does not include any of the stores that may be tangentially affected by the economies.
The strongest regional performance was in the Southeast and West regions where there is less exposure to the energy and agricultural markets. The West region base had a solid mid-single-digit comp, and the Southeast was well above chain average. We continue to experience strong demand for many of our basic everyday items such as Livestock and Pet category which generated mid-single-digit comparable chain wide sales. While the quarter did not shape up the way we expected, we continued to be well positioned for the long term. The solid comp sales in the nonimpacted regions support our position that the business will continue to drive profitable growth. As Greg said, we have been through periods like this before, and we have the leaders and the strategy to continue delivering value to customers, stakeholders and shareholders.
Comp transaction count increased for the 34th consecutive quarter, gaining 0.5%, on top of a 3.8% increase last year as some C.U.E. items, such as pet food and animal feed, continue to drive strong traffic. Average comp ticket decreased by 111 basis points compared to last year's 90 basis points decrease. Big ticket was one of the largest drivers of this year's average ticket decrease. Comparable sales of big ticket items declined approximately 4.7%. The decline was across several categories related principally to the energy and farm markets as well as early season winter sales in the North. More discretionary items, such as UTVs, were down in the oil and farm areas. Oil patch-related products such as compressors and fuel handling were down. Cold weather-related hardlines, such as log splitters and stoves, were down double digits as a result of the lack of urgency cycling a warm winter season last year and low heating oil prices.
On a positive note, we did take advantage of opportunities for some key summer big ticket products, such as riding lawnmowers, by working collaboratively with vendors to develop a late-season sales driving program. Additionally, the average ticket was negatively impacted by the decline in the units per transaction, with preseason sales of wood burning fuel as the principal driver. We estimated of that deflation also decreased the average ticket by approximately 40 basis points. September was the strongest sales month and did register a positive comp. September did have the easiest year-over-year comparison. 
Now turning to gross margin which was flat at 34.7% compared to 60-basis-point decrease in last year's third quarter. Overall, we're very pleased how the team managed margin during a tough selling environment. We continue to improve our initial margin through our key margin initiatives.
Product mix had a negative impact on margin. This resulted from a larger mix of feed and pet food and the strong sales in the riding lawnmower category. 
With respect to margin rate, we were sharper on price and, as Greg mentioned, added few sales-driving initiatives. Freight was essentially flat, lower diesel fuel, lower container cost and a reduction in outbound stem miles were favorable factors. This was offset by higher inbound and outbound costs related to mix and higher lane costs. We estimate that deflation had a slightly favorable impact on gross margin.
For the quarter, SG&A, including depreciation and amortization as a percent of sales, deleveraged by 20 basis points to 25.5% of sales. The deleverage was primarily due to the decline in comparable sales. SG&A expense grew only 5.4% from the prior year which benefited from a reduction in incentive compensation expense. Excluding incentive compensation, SG&A expense increased only 7.9%, a continuation of the tight cost control management initiated in the second quarter.
Similar to the second quarter, we experienced strong cost control in store level and store support center payroll and medical expense. Occupancy expense was well managed as we continued to benefit from our LED lighting retrofit. The strong expense management was achieved against the headwind from our Arizona DC and mixing centers. We estimate the deleverage from these centers' operations were approximately 15 basis points. Our effective income tax rate decreased to 36.5% in Q3 compared to 36.9% last year due to additional federal and state tax credits.
Turning to the balance sheet. At the end of Q3 this year, we had a cash balance of $55.5 million and $295 million in outstanding debt compared to a cash balance of $51.4 million and $190 million outstanding debt last year. During the third quarter, under our stock repurchase program, we acquired approximately 1.4 million shares for $108.8 million. Average inventory levels per store decreased 1.8% compared to 1.6% increase in last year's third quarter, and inventory turns decreased slightly. We managed our inventory well in the quarter and are comfortable with our seasonal inventory as we move into the fourth quarter.
Capital expenditures for the quarter were $66.2 million compared to $66.5 million last year. We opened up 34 stores, closed 1 Del's store in the third quarter compared to 30 new stores opened and 2 Del's stores and 1 Tractor Supply store closed in the third quarter of 2015. The CapEx this year relates to new store expansion, which includes an emphasis on retrofit locations that generally require renovation capital, and our LED lighting retrofit project. Whereas last year, capital included $12.6 million for the Arizona DC. 
Now looking ahead. Based on the trends and results of the third quarter, we revised our outlook for the full year fiscal year 2016 in our September 7 business update. We are reiterating that outlook today.
We expect full year sales to range from $6.7 billion to $6.75 billion, comparable store sales to increase between 1% and 1.7%, and net income to range from $432 million to $438 million and earnings per diluted share to range between $3.22 to $3.26. Assumed in this full year guidance is an EBIT margin decline of 10 to 15 basis points, a tax rate of 36.7% and capital expenditures of $235 million to $245 million. We will continue to make purchases under our share repurchase program and currently project full year diluted shares outstanding to be approximately 133.8 million to 134.2 million.
As a reminder, we have our 53rd week and an additional comp sales day in the fourth quarter. We now estimate that the additional week will provide $0.04 to $0.05 benefit to EPS which is contained in our guidance. We expect deflation in the fourth quarter of approximately 40 basis points. With respect to gross margin, we expect to continue to be sharper on price which will limit the upside on margin. We also expect to have slight headwinds from product mix and transportation expenses as we cycle the decline in diesel prices. Therefore, we are targeting gross margin to be flat to slightly down for the full year and the fourth quarter.
With respect to SG&A, we will continue to drive cost-saving programs in the fourth quarter and we will react accordingly to the sales trends. We expect to maintain appropriate payroll allocation to drive sales in the fourth quarter, and incur a more normalized incentive compensation expense. We will continue to have the headwind of the Arizona DC until we cycle its opening in late December. Although we benefit from slight leverage from the additional sales week, it has very little impact on the quarter. We estimate that the additional week adds approximately 6% to the year-over-year SG&A growth, including depreciation. We do not expect to leverage SG&A for the quarter. 
With respect to the Petsense acquisition, as we mentioned in our webcast call on September 29, we expect onetime transaction costs, with the majority being recognized in the fourth quarter to be approximately $0.01 to $0.015. There will be some integration costs but we expect these to be immaterial to our overall financial results. Although not originally included in our full year outlook due to the immateriality of the amount, we did not revise our guidance. Our guidance does that include Petsense sales or operations as we expect the net bottom line impact not to be material.
A few reminders as we look ahead to 2017. We'll be cycling the 53rd week year and, therefore, you need to adjust your models accordingly. With the resulting 1 week shift in 2017, Q2 will have 1 less comp day related to the shift in Easter. Additionally, in 2016, we had a significant decrease in incentive compensation. We would expect a normalized planned incentive compensation for 2017, and that would represent an incremental $0.07 to $0.08 to the SG&A cost structure.
That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we will now turn the call over for questions."

But we talked about the impact that the energy markets have had on ticket, and I would go back and say that categories such as welders, some compressors, those type of businesses have been a bit of a challenge for us. And you can see that in those individual markets where we are impacted most by energy, things like certain apparel, whether it's some steel footwear -- cold footwear or fire-retardant apparel, that you can actually look into those specific regions and you can pretty much kind of estimate what categories are going to be the most impacted there. In terms of the seasonal businesses, we talked about having a fairly soft spring but didn't drag into the fall and that benefited us. But we certainly didn't capture any of the preheating sales that we had traditionally gotten. Still, again, if you look at seasonal, it's kind of a tale of 2 stories how we preferred to have spring in spring and winter in winter, but that just hasn't necessarily been the case yet. So we're having to move some of our inventories around to better position ourselves to optimize where we think we can.

When in good times, and the chain is moving at your 3 to 5 comp, we're going to be at a delta above that. We're seeing that the stores out West are running above that normalized delta.

But what I would tell you is that, yes, some of the stores that came out slow are ramping at a much nicer pace. We're very pleased with those stores. And that's why when we look at the new store productivity, and we spend a great deal of time looking at it, we look at it more on a rolling 12. We know that some of the stores last year that we talked about came out a little bit soft. So we know that we probably have this lower new store productivity over the course of the year. But when we look at it and look at it over a 12 -- rolling 12, it's relatively consistent for the last 4 quarters. It has gone down slightly. Some of the West stores have come out slower, that's probably one of the bigger drivers. And some of the West stores also had a little bit more square footage as we've had some additional square footage so that we could have more allocation for the products since they tend to be strong feed stores. So that distorts the calculation a little as well. But IRR hurdle has not changed.

Thank you for joining us. On the call with me today are Tony Crudele, our EVP and Chief Financial Officer; Steve Barbarick, our President and Chief Merchandising and Marketing Officer; and Kurt Barton, our Senior VP and Controller. 
As we previously discussed in our business update earlier in September, there were several headwinds affecting our business during the third quarter. We have dedicated a considerable amount of time and effort gathering and analyzing data during the quarter to understand more fully the impact these headwinds have had on our performance, and we do not believe the current sales trends are the result of significant shifts in the competitive landscape, our market share growth or our long-term operating fundamentals. In fact, our core everyday business in categories such as Livestock and Pet remained strong throughout the third quarter, and our business outside of the energy and agricultural markets in regions like the Southwest and West performed very well for the quarter. We did, however, experience softer demand in the energy and agricultural markets, and we saw a slow start to the early preseason sales of cold weather- and heating-related products that impacted the Northern region.
We have managed successfully through challenging sales environments before, the recession of 2008, 2009. And during those most difficult sales periods, our teams remained focused on managing the factors they could control such as inventory, gross margin and other expenses. We made the necessary adjustments then by taking a long-term balanced approach as we cycled through those periods, and we will do the same for now until these short-term headwinds subside.
At Tractor Supply, we are committed to introduce new products and updating in merchandise categories to keep our stores fresh. And with the current sales environment, we are specifically targeting those categories that have demonstrated strong sales performance year-to-date. Already this fall season, we have had several series of calls with field leadership across several of our more challenged markets to understand the depth of the issues we face. As a result of those calls, we executed a number of timely inventory investments to ensure that we have the appropriate emphasis on categories of high demand in those regions that are performing well: categories such as pet food, agricultural fencing and grass seed, to name a few.
Additionally, recognizing that cold weather and winter preparedness sales were slower to ramp, we adjusted our inventories downward on cold-weather products and upward on warm weather regional categories where customer demand stayed high such as fly control, riding lawnmowers, short-sleeved shirts and packaged seeds. Having this agility to react to current sales trends, we believe, is the level of sophistication and capability that differentiates us from most of our competition. 
Now with respect to our management of seasonal inventory, we are monitoring sales trends closely and continue to adjust for ongoing customer demand. For example, in the heating category, which I mentioned earlier, we have experienced sluggish early demand and we have kept inventories at a minimum for now. When sales trends accelerate due to cooler weather, our supply chain and our vendor base are ready to react and will push inventory into our DCs then into our stores quickly so that we can meet the increased sales demands.
Also in many of our everyday basic items, C.U.E., we have elevated in-stock levels to meet the continuing strong demand for animal, pet and land care needs. While we may be a chain of 1,500-plus stores, what is important to understand about our customer is that they perceive Tractor Supply as their unique farm store, conveniently located in their small community that offers them locally correct assortments that meet the unique outdoor lifestyle needs they have.
Now on the marketing front. We adjusted Q3 and forward programs based on current sales trends by region in an effort to accelerate our comp store sales. We added radio advertising to promote key events during the quarter such as our annual Pet Appreciation Week and Lowest Prices of the Season event. We enhanced our digital impressions to our web customers and increased our circular distribution to a larger base of our best customers, and we added several targeted sales driving initiatives in key sales weeks to improve our overall sales and marketing effectiveness.
To demonstrate how we are focusing on the growth of our business for the long term, we are continuing to invest in technology to improve our capture of customer insights. This includes the rollout of our Neighbor's Club loyalty program which we believe will give Tractor Supply a unique way to communicate with our customer base by offering a more relevant and personalized message. As well, we completed bringing our customer database in-house so that we could better analyze and segment the customer information that we are collecting from our Neighbor's Club members.
We added an additional 45 stores to the Neighbor's Club program on October 1 in the Western region. And with the initial customer enrollment and customer response being so positive, we now plan to roll the program out to all stores by the middle of 2017.
We continue to invest in the platforms where our customers choose to shop, giving them more options in the way they can interact with the Tractor Supply Company as a brand. This includes the introduction of Buy Online Pickup in Store, which we started piloting in September and expect to have wide in over half of the chain by the end of this year. We are also continuing to invest in our Tractor Supply website to improve search capabilities and to enhance the know-how section for product content and projects that are important to our customers using videos and online articles. And we continue to invest in store-level resources, including mobile POS and a more intuitive special order process that will assist our team members and our customers to locate hard-to-find products.
As a company, we remain confident in our long-term store target of 2,500 domestic Tractor Supply locations and mid-single-digit annual square footage growth. To help achieve this target, we recently conducted a comprehensive study of our logistics infrastructure to understand what would be required to add capacity and drive more supply chain efficiency as we move toward our long-term store target. One thing to note from the study data, we confirmed that we have a short-term need to add additional distribution capacity in the Northeast region if we plan to continue the store growth there. We have begun the planning process to enable the opening of a new distribution center in that region targeted for mid- to late 2018.
Our recently announced purchase of Petsense, a leading specialty retailer of pet supplies and services with over 130 stores in 25 states, is another example of our commitment to long-term growth. For some time now, we have discussed the Pet category as a growth opportunity for the company. And based on our research and experience with our own hometown pet concept, we concluded there is a substantial opportunity to grow the pet specialty business in small town America. Their expertise and success in growing a smaller pet specialty store format will allow Petsense to continue at a growth rate of 15% to 20% annually without distraction to the TSC business. Tractor Supply's proven expertise in site selection and store growth should make for a strong partnership with Petsense and allow us to accelerate their growth over time.
Over the longer term, we stay focused on our people and their development, on enhancing our merchandise assortments and adding IT capability to better meet the evolving needs of our customers while always being mindful to return value to our shareholders through sustainable longer-term growth.
Before I wrap up, I want to thank the nearly 23,000 members of the Tractor Supply family for their continued hard work, dedication and the level of service they provide our customers; a big hoorah [ph] to all. 
I would also like to welcome the Petsense team as members of the Tractor Supply family. We are proud to be partnered with you and are excited about the opportunity to develop and grow the Petsense business.
I will now turn the call over to Tony for more detailed commentary on our third quarter financial results and the outlook for the remainder of 2016."

And good afternoon, everyone. For the quarter ended September 24, 2016, on a year-over-year basis, net sales increased 4.5% to $1.54 billion; net income grew 2.4% to $89.4 million; and EPS increased 4.7% to $0.67 per diluted share.C",1566,"Great. Thanks, Greg. And good afternoon, everyone. For the quarter ended September 24, 2016, on a year-over-year basis, net sales increased 4.5% to $1.54 billion; net income grew 2.4% to $89.4 million; and EPS increased 4.7% to $0.67 per diluted share.
Comp store sales decreased 0.6% in the third quarter compared to an increase of 2.9% in last year's third quarter. There are a number of economic headwinds impacting consumer spending throughout many of our markets. However, as noted in our business update on September 7, the energy-producing and agricultural markets were the most impacted. To give you a sense of the magnitude of the macro impact of the energy and farm economies, we estimate that approximately 25% of our stores have a direct correlation to these economies. This does not include any of the stores that may be tangentially affected by the economies.
The strongest regional performance was in the Southeast and West regions where there is less exposure to the energy and agricultural markets. The West region base had a solid mid-single-digit comp, and the Southeast was well above chain average. We continue to experience strong demand for many of our basic everyday items such as Livestock and Pet category which generated mid-single-digit comparable chain-wide sales. 
While the quarter did not shape up the way we expected, we continue to be well positioned for the long term. The solid comp sales in the nonimpacted regions support our position that the business will continue to drive profitable growth. As Greg said, we have been through periods like this before, and we have the leaders and the strategy to continue delivering value to customers, stakeholders and shareholders.
Comp transaction count increased for the 34th consecutive quarter, gaining 0.5% on top of a 3.8% increase last year as some C.U.E. items, such as pet food and animal feed, continue to drive strong traffic. Average comp ticket decreased by 111 basis points compared to last year's 90 basis points decrease. Big ticket was one of the largest drivers of this year's average ticket decrease. Comparable sales of big ticket items declined approximately 4.7%. The decline was across several categories related principally to the energy and farm markets as well as early season winter sales in the North. More discretionary items, such as UTVs, were down in the oil and farm areas. Oil patch-related products such as compressors and fuel handling were down. Cold weather-related hardlines, such as log splitters and stoves, were down double digits as a result of the lack of urgency cycling a warm winter season last year and low heating oil prices.
On a positive note, we did take advantage of opportunities for some key summer big ticket products, such as riding lawnmowers, by working collaboratively with vendors to develop a late-season sales driving program. Additionally, the average ticket was negatively impacted by the decline in the units per transaction, with preseason sales of wood-burning fuel as the principal driver. We estimated that deflation also decreased the average ticket by approximately 40 basis points. September was the strongest sales month and did register a positive comp. September did have the easiest year-over-year comparison. 
Now turning to gross margin which was flat at 34.7% compared to 60-basis-point decrease in last year's third quarter. Overall, we're very pleased how the team managed margin during a tough selling environment. We continue to improve our initial margin through our key margin initiatives. Product mix had a negative impact on margin. This resulted from a larger mix of feed and pet food and the strong sales in the riding lawnmower category. 
With respect to margin rate, we were sharper on price and, as Greg mentioned, added few sales-driving initiatives. Freight was essentially flat. Lower diesel fuel, lower container cost and a reduction in outbound stem miles were favorable factors. This was offset by higher inbound and outbound costs related to mix and higher lane costs. We estimate that deflation had a slightly favorable impact on gross margin.
For the quarter, SG&A, including depreciation and amortization as a percent of sales, deleveraged by 20 basis points to 25.5% of sales. The deleverage was primarily due to the decline in comparable sales. SG&A expense grew only 5.4% from the prior year which benefited from a reduction in incentive compensation expense. Excluding incentive compensation, SG&A expense increased only 7.9%, a continuation of the tight cost control management initiated in the second quarter.
Similar to the second quarter, we experienced strong cost control in store level and store support center payroll and medical expense. Occupancy expense was well managed as we continued to benefit from our LED lighting retrofit. The strong expense management was achieved against the headwind from our Arizona DC and mixing centers. We estimate the deleverage from these centers' operations were approximately 15 basis points. Our effective income tax rate decreased to 36.5% in Q3 compared to 36.9% last year due to additional federal and state tax credits.
Turning to the balance sheet. At the end of Q3 this year, we had a cash balance of $55.5 million and $295 million in outstanding debt compared to a cash balance of $51.4 million and $190 million outstanding debt last year. During the third quarter, under our stock repurchase program, we acquired approximately 1.4 million shares for $108.8 million. Average inventory levels per store decreased 1.8% compared to 1.6% increase in last year's third quarter, and inventory turns decreased slightly. We managed our inventory well in the quarter and are comfortable with our seasonal inventory as we move into the fourth quarter.
Capital expenditures for the quarter were $66.2 million compared to $66.5 million last year. We opened up 34 stores, closed 1 Del's store in the third quarter compared to 30 new stores opened and 2 Del's stores and 1 Tractor Supply store closed in the third quarter of 2015. The CapEx this year relates to new store expansion, which includes an emphasis on retrofit locations that generally require renovation capital, and our LED lighting retrofit project; whereas last year, capital included $12.6 million for the Arizona DC. 
Now looking ahead. Based on the trends and results of the third quarter, we revised our outlook for the full year fiscal year 2016 in our September 7 business update. We are reiterating that outlook today.
We expect full year sales to range from $6.7 billion to $6.75 billion; comparable store sales to increase between 1% and 1.7%; and net income to range from $432 million to $438 million; and earnings per diluted share to range between $3.22 to $3.26. Assumed in this full year guidance is an EBIT margin decline of 10 to 15 basis points, a tax rate of 36.7% and capital expenditures of $235 million to $245 million. We will continue to make purchases under our share repurchase program and currently project full year diluted shares outstanding to be approximately 133.8 million to 134.2 million.
As a reminder, we have our 53rd week and an additional comp sales day in the fourth quarter. We now estimate that the additional week will provide $0.04 to $0.05 benefit to EPS which is contained in our guidance. We expect deflation in the fourth quarter of approximately 40 basis points. With respect to gross margin, we expect to continue to be sharp on price which will limit the upside on margin. We also expect to have slight headwinds from product mix and transportation expenses as we cycle the decline in diesel prices. Therefore, we are targeting gross margin to be flat to slightly down for the full year and the fourth quarter.
With respect to SG&A, we will continue to drive cost-saving programs in the fourth quarter and we will react accordingly to the sales trends. We expect to maintain appropriate payroll allocation to drive sales in the fourth quarter, and incur a more normalized incentive compensation expense. We will continue to have the headwind of the Arizona DC until we cycle its opening in late December. Although we benefit from slight leverage from the additional sales week, it has very little impact on the quarter. We estimate that the additional week adds approximately 6% to the year-over-year SG&A growth, including depreciation. We do not expect to leverage SG&A for the quarter. 
With respect to the Petsense acquisition, as we mentioned in our webcast call on September 29, we expect onetime transaction costs, with the majority being recognized in the fourth quarter to be approximately $0.01 to $0.015. There will be some integration costs but we expect these to be immaterial to our overall financial results. Although not originally included in our full year outlook due to the immateriality of the amount, we did not revise our guidance. Our guidance does not include Petsense sales or operations as we expect the net bottom line impact not to be material.
And a few reminders as we look ahead to 2017. We'll be cycling the 53rd week year and, therefore, you need to adjust your models accordingly. With the resulting 1-week shift in 2017, Q2 will have 1 less comp day related to the shift in Easter. Additionally, in 2016, we had a significant decrease in incentive compensation. We would expect a normalized planned incentive compensation for 2017, and that would represent an incremental $0.07 to $0.08 to the SG&A cost structure.
That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we will now turn the call over for questions."

We started the program back -- it was about a year ago in October, and we've been very methodical and watching it. The one thing that's really exciting is the enrollment continues to exceed our expectations. To look at the fact that -- I'll give you some numbers here. 80% of the e-mails that we're getting through the program are new to our database, and about 50% of the folks that are signing up are also new to our database. So we're getting a real good insight into these individuals. In tracking over the course of the last year, what we're finding is that people that are signing up, and this is of no surprise, tend to be the closest ones to the brand, and they do want to hear from us. They tend to shop us more often, and they're twice as likely to take advantage of our marketing promotions. So as we move forward with this program, we think that this is a real opportunity to talk more to them. They're typically our best customers, and they really want to hear from us. So we think this has a lot of upside in the future."

But we certainly didn't capture any of the preheating sales that we had traditionally gotten. So again, if you look at seasonal, it's kind of a tale of 2 stories. We prefer to have spring in spring and winter in winter, but that just hasn't necessarily been the case yet. So we're having to move some of our inventories around to better position ourselves to optimize where we think we can. And then the last thing I would tell you is in the truck, tool and hardware business, it's a little similar to what I talked about earlier with some of the big ticket. Truck boxes, fuel handling, those kind of categories have been really soft for us. And again, we believe a lot of that is more energy-related. So does that help clarify some?"

There's evidence not only in the consumer surveys that we've completed, but in our current sales trends, that the customers have become more conservative in their purchasing behaviors. That doesn't mean they're not still buying but they're buying more conservative, which means they're buying absolutely what they need at the time that they need it. They're still shopping the store as evidenced by the transaction increases that we're seeing. They're still supporting the pet, the animal and some land maintenance and in other categories across the stores. So we're not seeing them just cherry-pick. They're actually shopping across the store. But they pull back considerably on big ticket spends for now. We think there's a number of factors involved there, not just the energy markets and some of the things happening in the ag economy. But we're going get to listen again this evening on a debate about who's going to be the next President of the United States, and those things have some effect on our customer, no question. We have heard from them in these surveys that they feel their budgets are a bit tighter right now. And as we've been monitoring sales trends and looking at this by region, the customer demand for those things that are needed to support the lifestyle continue to exist, continue -- they continue to come in and purchase in our stores. So we have got to keep bringing new products. We got to keep updating the merchandise assortments, keeping those stores fresh. And I can tell you, the consumer count is still there, but they're being very conservative and very thoughtful in their spends."

I mean, we hear these things from our customers, and I would tell you that I think it's more severe now than it was in the past. I'll also tell you that in the model of our business, this is the first time that we've seen energy come into the same kind of a play on top of these other aspects.

When we look at the comps and sort of the store maturation cycle, we've always said that the newer stores are going to ramp at a higher pace than the chain. When in good times, and the chain is moving out at your 3% to 5% comp, we're going to be at a delta above that, we're seeing that the stores out West are running above that normalized delta. But given that, obviously, the rest of the chain is very flat, obviously, that helps to increase the delta between the mature stores and the new stores out there. But what I would tell you is that, yes, some of the stores that came out slow are ramping at a much nicer pace. We're very pleased with those stores. And that's why when we look at the new store productivity, and we spend a great deal of time looking at it, we look at it more on a rolling 12. We know that some of the stores last year that we talked about came out a little bit soft. So we know that we probably have this lower new store productivity over the course of the year. But when we look at it and look at it over a 12 -- rolling 12, it's relatively consistent for the last 4 quarters. It has gone down slightly. Some of the West stores have come out slower, that's probably one of the bigger drivers. And some of the West stores also had a little bit more square footage as we've had some additional square footage so that we could have more allocation for the products since they tend to be strong feed stores. So that distorts the calculation a little as well. But IRR hurdle has not changed. We're meeting pro forma, and so we feel very good about the new stores, especially as we see the stores out West ramp."

Thank you for joining us. On the call with me today are Tony Crudele, our EVP and Chief Financial Officer; Steve Barbarick, our President and Chief Merchandising and Marketing Officer; and Kurt Barton, our Senior VP and Controller. 
As we previously discussed in our business update earlier in September, there were several headwinds affecting our business during the third quarter. We have dedicated a considerable amount of time and effort gathering and analyzing data during the quarter to understand more fully the impact these headwinds have had on our performance, and we do not believe the current sales trends are the result of significant shifts in the competitive landscape, our market share growth or our long-term operating fundamentals. In fact, our core everyday business in categories such as Livestock and Pet remained strong throughout the third quarter, and our business outside of the energy and agricultural markets in regions like the Southwest and West performed very well for the quarter. We did, however, experience softer demand in the energy and agricultural markets, and we saw a slow start to the early preseason sales of cold weather- and heating-related products that impacted the Northern region.
We have managed successfully through challenging sales environments before, the recession of 2008, 2009. And during those most difficult sales periods, our teams remained focused on managing the factors they could control such as inventory, gross margin and other expenses. We made the necessary adjustments then by taking a long-term balanced approach as we cycled through those periods, and we will do the same for now until these short-term headwinds subside.
At Tractor Supply, we are committed to introduce new products and updating in merchandise categories to keep our stores fresh. And with the current sales environment, we are specifically targeting those categories that have demonstrated strong sales performance year-to-date. Already this fall season, we have had several series of calls with field leadership across several of our more challenged markets to understand the depth of the issues we face. As a result of those calls, we executed a number of timely inventory investments to ensure that we have the appropriate emphasis on categories of high demand in those regions that are performing well: categories such as pet food, agricultural fencing and grass seed, to name a few.
Additionally, recognizing that cold weather and winter preparedness sales were slower to ramp, we adjusted our inventories downward on cold-weather products and upward on warm weather regional categories where customer demand stayed high such as fly control, riding lawnmowers, short-sleeved shirts and packaged seeds. Having this agility to react to current sales trends, we believe, is the level of sophistication and capability that differentiates us from most of our competition. 
Now with respect to our management of seasonal inventory, we are monitoring sales trends closely and continue to adjust for ongoing customer demand. For example, in the heating category, which I mentioned earlier, we have experienced sluggish early demand and we have kept inventories at a minimum for now. When sales trends accelerate due to cooler weather, our supply chain and our vendor base are ready to react and will push inventory into our DCs then into our stores quickly so that we can meet the increased sales demands.
Also in many of our everyday basic items, C.U.E., we have elevated in-stock levels to meet the continuing strong demand for animal, pet and land care needs. While we may be a chain of 1,500-plus stores, what is important to understand about our customer is that they perceive Tractor Supply as their unique farm store, conveniently located in their small community that offers them locally correct assortments that meet the unique outdoor lifestyle needs they have.
Now on the marketing front. We adjusted Q3 and forward programs based on current sales trends by region in an effort to accelerate our comp store sales. We added radio advertising to promote key events during the quarter such as our annual Pet Appreciation Week and Lowest Prices of the Season event. We enhanced our digital impressions to our web customers and increased our circular distribution to a larger base of our best customers, and we added several targeted sales driving initiatives in key sales weeks to improve our overall sales and marketing effectiveness.
To demonstrate how we are focusing on the growth of our business for the long term, we are continuing to invest in technology to improve our capture of customer insights. This includes the rollout of our Neighbor's Club loyalty program which we believe will give Tractor Supply a unique way to communicate with our customer base by offering a more relevant and personalized message. As well, we completed bringing our customer database in-house so that we could better analyze and segment the customer information that we are collecting from our Neighbor's Club members.
We added an additional 45 stores to the Neighbor's Club program on October 1 in the Western region. And with the initial customer enrollment and customer response being so positive, we now plan to roll the program out to all stores by the middle of 2017.
We continue to invest in the platforms where our customers choose to shop, giving them more options in the way they can interact with the Tractor Supply Company as a brand. This includes the introduction of Buy Online Pickup in Store, which we started piloting in September and expect to have wide in over half of the chain by the end of this year. We are also continuing to invest in our Tractor Supply website to improve search capabilities and to enhance the know-how section for product content and projects that are important to our customers using videos and online articles. And we continue to invest in store-level resources, including mobile POS and a more intuitive special order process that will assist our team members and our customers to locate hard-to-find products.
As a company, we remain confident in our long-term store target of 2,500 domestic Tractor Supply locations and mid-single-digit annual square footage growth. To help achieve this target, we recently conducted a comprehensive study of our logistics infrastructure to understand what would be required to add capacity and drive more supply chain efficiency as we move toward our long-term store target. One thing to note from the study data, we confirmed that we have a short-term need to add additional distribution capacity in the Northeast region if we plan to continue the store growth there. We have begun the planning process to enable the opening of a new distribution center in that region targeted for mid- to late 2018.
Our recently announced purchase of Petsense, a leading specialty retailer of pet supplies and services with over 130 stores in 25 states, is another example of our commitment to long-term growth. For some time now, we have discussed the Pet category as a growth opportunity for the company. And based on our research and experience with our own hometown pet concept, we concluded there is a substantial opportunity to grow the pet specialty business in small town America. Their expertise and success in growing a smaller pet specialty store format will allow Petsense to continue at a growth rate of 15% to 20% annually without distraction to the TSC business. Tractor Supply's proven expertise in site selection and store growth should make for a strong partnership with Petsense and allow us to accelerate their growth over time.
Over the longer term, we stay focused on our people and their development, on enhancing our merchandise assortments and adding IT capability to better meet the evolving needs of our customers while always being mindful to return value to our shareholders through sustainable longer-term growth.
Before I wrap up, I want to thank the nearly 23,000 members of the Tractor Supply family for their continued hard work, dedication and the level of service they provide our customers. A big hoorah [ph] to all. 
I would also like to welcome the Petsense team as members of the Tractor Supply family. We are proud to be partnered with you and are excited about the opportunity to develop and grow the Petsense business.
I will now turn the call over to Tony for more detailed commentary on our third quarter financial results and the outlook for the remainder of 2016."

Comp store sales decreased 0.6% in the third quarter compared to an increase of 2.9% in last year's third quarter. There are a number of economic headwinds impacting consumer spending throughout many of our markets. However, as noted in our business update on September 7, the energy-producing and agricultural markets were the most impacted. To give you a sense of the magnitude of the macro impact of the energy and farm economies, we estimate that approximately 25% of our stores have a direct correlation to these economies. This does not include any of the stores that may be tangentially affected by the economies.
The strongest regional performance was in the Southeast and West regions where there is less exposure to the energy and agricultural markets. The West region base had a solid mid-single-digit comp, and the Southeast was well above chain average. We continue to experience strong demand for many of our basic everyday items such as Livestock and Pet category which generated mid-single-digit comparable chainwide sales. 
While the quarter did not shape up the way we expected, we continue to be well positioned for the long term. The solid comp sales in the nonimpacted regions support our position that the business will continue to drive profitable growth. As Greg said, we have been through periods like this before, and we have the leaders and the strategy to continue delivering value to customers, stakeholders and shareholders.
Comp transaction count increased for the 34th consecutive quarter, gaining 0.5% on top of a 3.8% increase last year as some C.U.E. items, such as pet food and animal feed, continue to drive strong traffic. Average comp ticket decreased by 111 basis points compared to last year's 90 basis points decrease. Big ticket was one of the largest drivers of this year's average ticket decrease. Comparable sales of big ticket items declined approximately 4.7%. The decline was across several categories related principally to the energy and farm markets as well as early season winter sales in the North. More discretionary items, such as UTVs, were down in the oil and farm areas. Oil patch-related products such as compressors and fuel handling were down. Cold weather-related hardlines, such as log splitters and stoves, were down double digits as a result of the lack of urgency cycling a warm winter season last year and low heating oil prices.
On a positive note, we did take advantage of opportunities for some key summer big ticket products, such as riding lawnmowers, by working collaboratively with vendors to develop a late-season sales driving program. Additionally, the average ticket was negatively impacted by the decline in the units per transaction, with preseason sales of wood-burning fuel as the principal driver. We estimated that deflation also decreased the average ticket by approximately 40 basis points. September was the strongest sales month and did register a positive comp. September did have the easiest year-over-year comparison. 
Now turning to gross margin which was flat at 34.7% compared to 60-basis-point decrease in last year's third quarter. Overall, we're very pleased how the team managed margin during a tough selling environment. We continue to improve our initial margin through our key margin initiatives. Product mix had a negative impact on margin. This resulted from a larger mix of feed and pet food and the strong sales in the riding lawnmower category. 
With respect to margin rate, we were sharper on price and, as Greg mentioned, added few sales-driving initiatives. Freight was essentially flat. Lower diesel fuel, lower container cost and a reduction in outbound stem miles were favorable factors. This was offset by higher inbound and outbound costs related to mix and higher lane costs. We estimate that deflation had a slightly favorable impact on gross margin.
For the quarter, SG&A, including depreciation and amortization as a percent of sales, deleveraged by 20 basis points to 25.5% of sales. The deleverage was primarily due to the decline in comparable sales. SG&A expense grew only 5.4% from the prior year which benefited from a reduction in incentive compensation expense. Excluding incentive compensation, SG&A expense increased only 7.9%, a continuation of the tight cost control management initiated in the second quarter.
Similar to the second quarter, we experienced strong cost control in store level and store support center payroll and medical expense. Occupancy expense was well managed as we continued to benefit from our LED lighting retrofit. The strong expense management was achieved against the headwind from our Arizona DC and mixing centers. We estimate the deleverage from these centers' operations were approximately 15 basis points. Our effective income tax rate decreased to 36.5% in Q3 compared to 36.9% last year due to additional federal and state tax credits.
Turning to the balance sheet. At the end of Q3 this year, we had a cash balance of $55.5 million and $295 million in outstanding debt compared to a cash balance of $51.4 million and $190 million outstanding debt last year. During the third quarter, under our stock repurchase program, we acquired approximately 1.4 million shares for $108.8 million. Average inventory levels per store decreased 1.8% compared to 1.6% increase in last year's third quarter, and inventory turns decreased slightly. We managed our inventory well in the quarter and are comfortable with our seasonal inventory as we move into the fourth quarter.
Capital expenditures for the quarter were $66.2 million compared to $66.5 million last year. We opened up 34 stores, closed 1 Del's store in the third quarter compared to 30 new stores opened and 2 Del's stores and 1 Tractor Supply store closed in the third quarter of 2015. The CapEx this year relates to new store expansion, which includes an emphasis on retrofit locations that generally require renovation capital, and our LED lighting retrofit project, whereas last year, capital included $12.6 million for the Arizona DC. 
Now looking ahead. Based on the trends and results of the third quarter, we revised our outlook for the full year fiscal year 2016 in our September 7 business update. We are reiterating that outlook today.
We expect full year sales to range from $6.7 billion to $6.75 billion, comparable store sales to increase between 1% and 1.7%, and net income to range from $432 million to $438 million and earnings per diluted share to range between $3.22 to $3.26. Assumed in this full year guidance is an EBIT margin decline of 10 to 15 basis points, a tax rate of 36.7% and capital expenditures of $235 million to $245 million. We will continue to make purchases under our share repurchase program and currently project full year diluted shares outstanding to be approximately 133.8 million to 134.2 million.
As a reminder, we have our 53rd week and an additional comp sales day in the fourth quarter. We now estimate that the additional week will provide $0.04 to $0.05 benefit to EPS which is contained in our guidance. We expect deflation in the fourth quarter of approximately 40 basis points. With respect to gross margin, we expect to continue to be sharp on price which will limit the upside on margin. We also expect to have slight headwinds from product mix and transportation expenses as we cycle the decline in diesel prices. Therefore, we are targeting gross margin to be flat to slightly down for the full year and the fourth quarter.
With respect to SG&A, we will continue to drive cost-saving programs in the fourth quarter and we will react accordingly to the sales trends. We expect to maintain appropriate payroll allocation to drive sales in the fourth quarter, and incur a more normalized incentive compensation expense. We will continue to have the headwind of the Arizona DC until we cycle its opening in late December. Although we benefit from slight leverage from the additional sales week, it has very little impact on the quarter. We estimate that the additional week adds approximately 6% to the year-over-year SG&A growth, including depreciation. We do not expect to leverage SG&A for the quarter. 
With respect to the Petsense acquisition, as we mentioned in our webcast call on September 29, we expect onetime transaction costs, with the majority being recognized in the fourth quarter to be approximately $0.01 to $0.015. There will be some integration costs but we expect these to be immaterial to our overall financial results. Although not originally included in our full year outlook due to the immateriality of the amount, we did not revise our guidance. Our guidance does not include Petsense sales or operations as we expect the net bottom line impact not to be material.
And a few reminders as we look ahead to 2017. We'll be cycling the 53rd week year and, therefore, you need to adjust your models accordingly. With the resulting 1-week shift in 2017, Q2 will have 1 less comp day related to the shift in Easter. Additionally, in 2016, we had a significant decrease in incentive compensation. We would expect a normalized planned incentive compensation for 2017, and that would represent an incremental $0.07 to $0.08 to the SG&A cost structure.
That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we will now turn the call over for questions."

Next, if -- on the hierarchy would be really the impact of the cold-weather products, and that would be probably the second biggest drag on the comps. And then really, thirdly, it's the farm economies. And it's really all 3 combined which is having the impact. So as any one of those start to turn, obviously, it would have a favorable impact on the business. So I wouldn't necessarily say we need all 3 of them to turn around to start to see the comps really improve dramatically.

So -- but what we're seeing is -- and since this is such a broad area of the country, all the stores are getting thrown in there, so it appears to be a much larger piece of business. But when we run our models, we see that the correlation, specifically to all 3 of those, being any of the oil, energy, coal or farm, the correlation -- the direct correlation is only for about 25% of the store base. So those are the ones that are being directly impacted. So as much as we have a lot of stores in Texas, there's only x amount that are energy-impacted.

But we talked about the impact that the energy markets have had on ticket, and I would go back and say that categories such as welders, some compressors, those type of businesses have been a bit of a challenge for us. And you can see that in those individual markets where we are impacted most by energy, things like certain apparel, whether it's some steel footwear -- toe footwear or fire-retardant apparel, that you can actually look into those specific regions and you can pretty much kind of estimate what categories are going to be the most impacted there. In terms of the seasonal businesses, we talked about having a fairly soft spring but then it drag into the fall and that benefited us. But we certainly didn't capture any of the preheating sales that we had traditionally gotten. So again, if you look at seasonal, it's kind of a tale of 2 stories. We prefer to have spring in spring and winter in winter, but that just hasn't necessarily been the case yet. So we're having to move some of our inventories around to better position ourselves to optimize where we think we can. And then the last thing I would tell you is in the truck, tool and hardware business, it's a little similar to what I talked about earlier with some of the big ticket.

They're still shopping the store as evidenced by the transaction increases that we're seeing. They're still supporting the pet, the animal and some land maintenance and in other categories across the stores. So we're not seeing them just cherry-pick. They're actually shopping across the store. But they pull back considerably on big ticket spends for now. We think there's a number of factors involved there, not just the energy markets and some of the things happening in the ag economy. But we're going get to listen again this evening on a debate about who's going to be the next President of the United States, and those things have some effect on our customer, no question.

When we look at the comps and sort of the store maturation cycle, we've always said that the newer stores are going to ramp at a higher pace than the chain. When in good times, and the chain is moving out at your 3% to 5% comp, we're going to be at a delta above that, we're seeing that the stores out West are running above that normalized delta.

But what I would tell you is that, yes, some of the stores that came out slow are ramping at a much nicer pace. We're very pleased with those stores. And that's why when we look at the new store productivity, and we spend a great deal of time looking at it, we look at it more on a rolling 12. We know that some of the stores last year that we talked about came out a little bit soft. So we know that we probably have this lower new store productivity over the course of the year. But when we look at it and look at it over a 12 -- rolling 12, it's relatively consistent for the last 4 quarters. It has gone down slightly. Some of the West stores have come out slower, that's probably one of the bigger drivers. And some of the West stores also had a little bit more square footage as we've had some additional square footage so that we could have more allocation for the products since they tend to be strong feed stores. So that distorts the calculation a little as well. But IRR hurdle has not changed.
