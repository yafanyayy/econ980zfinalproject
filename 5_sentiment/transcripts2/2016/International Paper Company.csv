During this call, we will make forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties, which are outlined on Slide 2 of our presentation. We will also present certain non-U.S. GAAP financial information. A reconciliation of those figures to U.S. GAAP financial measures are available on our website.

I want to quickly go over the format we're going to use this morning. I will review the full year 2015 results first, and then I'll turn it over to Carol to discuss our fourth quarter results and the performances of our individual businesses, and then come back and cover the outlook before we open it up for Q&A. 
So I'm going to begin on Slide 5. International Paper finished a very solid year in 2015. We achieved a return on invested capital of 11%, a little above our cost of capital. And this makes it the sixth consecutive year that our actual returns are above our cost of capital. Our free cash flow came in strong as well at $1.8 billion, and our earnings per share of $3.65 was the highest EPS in 20 years. That was largely driven by strong results in our North American Industrial Packaging business and record level of results from our Ilim joint venture in Russia. 
Additionally, we completed the sale of our 55% stake in the Sun JV in China at the beginning of the fourth quarter. We received $25 million in cash, in addition to eliminating approximately $400 million of consolidated debt from our balance sheet. 
We also made another meaningful increase to our dividend by 10% in the fourth quarter. And we enhanced our dividend policy, moving the target payout range to 40% to 50% of free cash flow, up from 30% to 40%. We feel confident in this change because it's based on the pressure test we did and updated, which provides a level of confidence to us that our businesses in different economic times have the ability to produce a very sustainable cash, and hence, the sustainable dividend. 
And finally, we continued our strong track record on share buyback as an additional means of returning cash to shareholders, buying more than 500 million shares in 2015. As of this call, total purchases since the inception of the buyback program in September of 2013 amount to about $2.1 billion. 
Moving to slide 6, and turning to the full year financial results. I'd like to highlight a couple of items on this slide. Year-over-year EPS when adjusted for the noncash FX charge on Ilim's U.S. dollar-denominated debt was up 5.5%. Revenue is down roughly 5% with the most significant factor being FX translation. And overall EBITDA margins continue to be strong at 17.6%. 
On Slide 7, you can see that 2015 continued to trend a strong sustainable free cash flow, which has averaged $1.3 billion over the last several years. As we look into 2016 and beyond, we remain confident that IP has a portfolio that can continue to generate strong free cash flow results. We believe free cash flow generation and ROIC above the cost of capital are 2 key drivers of shareholder value. So we think we're on the right track. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Carol to discuss the specifics of the fourth quarter."

I'm on Slide 8. As Mark said earlier, EPS of $3.65 per share is the highest level of 20 years and compares favorably to $3 per share in 2014. Looking at the details, price and mix declines across the North America",1585,"Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. I'm on Slide 8. As Mark said earlier, EPS of $3.65 per share is the highest level of 20 years and compares favorably to $3 per share in 2014. Looking at the details, price and mix declines across the North American businesses were essentially offset by favorable input cost. Volume was generally flat across most businesses, with the exception of reduced export volume from the North American Containerboard business. Operations largely performed in line with expectations with cost-reduction initiatives offsetting the majority of inflation for the year. Slightly higher taxes were more than offset by lower interest expense and lower share count. And the Ilim JV posted significantly higher results due to improved operation, increased margins and a less negative FX impact on the JV's U.S. dollar-denominated debt. 
Turning to the fourth quarter, free cash flow was strong at $501 million. Industrial Packaging delivered another solid quarter based on steady daily box demand. Additional downtime was taken to balance our supply with our demand as overall demand was impacted by 3 fewer shipping days as compared to the third quarter. Domestic prices were generally stable across our North American businesses. And volumes were seasonally higher, along with increased prices in Brazil, Russia and Europe, primarily in our paper business. And finally, the Ilim JV turned in another strong quarter of results, but was unfavorably impacted by a $0.05 noncash FX charge on the JV U.S. dollar-denominated debt. 
Moving to the quarter-over-quarter bridge. As I mentioned, prices were generally stable across the businesses. Volume was unfavorably impacted by 3 less shipping days in the fourth quarter for the North American box business, and we did have reduced export volume. This was partially offset by stronger volume in Europe and Brazil. Operations were negatively impacted by weather and flooding on the East Coast and were further impacted by higher operating cost in the quarter, including costs associated with the increased levels of maintenance and downtime taken to balance our supply with our demand. Quarterly earnings benefited from a favorable input costs and a lower noncash FX charge at the Ilim JV. 
Turning to the businesses and beginning with Industrial Packaging on Slide 11. Volume, as I said, was impacted by 3 fewer shipping days in our U.S. box business, and we did have lower export shipments. The daily shipment rates for boxes was up almost 4% over the third quarter and was flat year-over-year against the strong comp for IP. Operational costs were higher significantly impacted by 322,000 tons of downtime. 230,000 tons of which were taken to balance our supply with our demand. And operating cost were also slightly higher in our Brazil and European packaging businesses. 
Turning to Slide 12, I want to provide some color on the North American box business and what we're experiencing in our shipment in the key segments we serve. As you can see, we experienced a 2% increase in year-over-year shipments on a per day basis from the fourth quarter of '13 to the fourth quarter of '14. And then in the fourth quarter of this year, or last year, we essentially held that increased level of demand. I would say, the market has even been a bit stronger than what we have experienced. 
From a key segment standpoint, we continue to be encouraged by some of the trends we're seeing. We continue to see substantial growth in the e-commerce and distribution segment, in which we are a strong player. Another important trend is in the agricultural segment, which is benefiting from shifting consumer trends to more healthy food. And new product offerings in the beverage segment are also driving some pockets of new growth. Overall, we see a healthy box market that will continue to benefit from evolving consumer trends. 
Moving to Consumer Packaging. The business experienced the less favorable mix and lower volume due to 3 less shipping days. The fourth quarter was a higher operating cost quarter. And the North American business experienced some transition costs associated with the shutdown of the coated paperboard machine at Riegelwood related to preparations for the conversion project. Average expenses were higher as expected, and input cost were favorable. Finally, earnings improved due to the sale of our share of the Sun JV. 
Turning to Slide 14 and the Paper business. IP experienced price increases in Brazil, Europe and Russia as well as a seasonally favorable mix improvement in Brazil that was partially offset by pulp price pressure in the quarter. Volume was higher primarily due to seasonal strength in Brazil and Europe. Operations were negatively impacted in North America due to extreme weather and flooding on the East Coast. Some effects which will linger into the first quarter. Operating cost were seasonally higher as well. The negative FX swing here is simply the nonrepeat of the favorable Brazilian FX impact that we experienced in the third quarter. 
Turning to Slide 15. I want to provide an update on the Riegelwood Mill conversion project. As we announced last year, we are converting the mill to 100% pulp with the capability to run an additional 400,000 tons of soft wood and/or fluff pulp. This will bring our total North American system to a capacity of 1.7 million tons, of which 1.5 million can produce fluff pulp. The project is well underway, having shut down the first coated paperboard machine, PM18, which is the one that's actually being converted, and we did that in December. And we shutdown the second machine, PM15, in January. We will bring the converted machine back online in May, which means half the mill will be down for roughly half the year. Once online, we expect to fully ramp up on softwood pulp and qualified PM 18 on fluff pulp by the end of the year. This will ensure we have adequate capacity for our key fluff customers as their demanded grows. For the balance of the year, we expect to run and sell mostly market softwood pulp. We will incur costs associated with the conversion and the ramp up. In total, we expect the conversion impact in 2016 to impact earnings by roughly $75 million to $80 million, with about $50 million impacting our first quarter earnings. And that's when the bulk of the conversion work will be done and much of the mill will be down actually also for the annual outage. And then, there will be some ramp up cost beyond that, that will spread into the second and third quarters. 
Now turning to Ilim. The JV concluded a strong year of operational and financial results as the focus shifted to optimizing and leveraging the completed investments and their very advantage export position. The JV achieved record operational EBITDA results of $724 million in 2015 and IP's corresponding equity earnings were $131 million. During the quarter, the JV refinanced the portion of their U.S. dollar debt to rubles. 
Relative to the first quarter outlook, the JV expect to continue its strong operational and cost performance against higher inflation, lower pulp prices and the expected weaker seasonality. 
Before I turn to the outlook for the first quarter, I want to just give a quick update on IP's balance sheet. As of December 31, 2015, our balance sheet debt declined slightly to $9.3 billion. The pension GAAP declined by $300 million. In 2015, we made a $750 million voluntary contribution to the pension in the second quarter. Additionally, we had a bond issue and tender offer which further reduced our debt powers in 2018 and 2021 at lower interest rates. And I'd also remind you that we increased our dividend, as Mark said, 10% to $1.76 and brought back a little more than 500 million of stock in 2015. And currently, we're maintaining a cash balance of about $1 billion. 
So moving to the first quarter outlook on Slide 18. Earnings associated with volume will be lower for the following reasons: Number one, channel mix in our North American Industrial Packaging business will be -- impact earnings by $25 million as box volume will be seasonally weaker and export volume will be stronger. Secondly, our North American Consumer Packaging business will be impacted by roughly $5 million due to the exit of the Bristol's -- of the Carolina volume. And third, seasonally lower volume in Brazil will impact earnings by roughly $25 million. 
Pricing is expected to be lower for the North American pulp and paper businesses. These are expected to impact earnings by roughly $20 million. Price for our North American Industrial Packaging will be impacted by continued lower export pricing, along with the recent PBW index change. All in, this is expected to impact earnings by $20 million. Prices are expected to improve in both European, Russia and Brazil papers as recent price increase are implemented. These will be somewhat offset by inflationary cost pressures in those regions. 
Operations are expected to be generally at the same level as the fourth quarter. Operational cost are expected to improve modestly in North American Industrial Packaging. Maintenance outage expense will increase collectively by $56 million as shown on the slide, inclusive of the higher outage cost associated with the Riegelwood conversion, as I mentioned earlier. 
And as always, we provide an outlook for Ilim assuming stable FX coming our of the quarter, so the first quarter outlook assumes a nonrepeat of the $0.05 charge we incurred in the fourth quarter. 
So with that, let me turn it over to Mark."

Before I return to 2016, I just like to reiterate that I feel really good about our results in 2015. I'm on Slide 19 right now. The year didn't play out the way we envisioned coming into it, but given hwo things unfolded across the globe, I think we played our hand pretty well and had a number of significant accomplishments in 2015. I'm really proud of the way our teams stepped up and dealt with the environment that we were really dealing with, not the one we thought we were going to be dealing with. 
Turning now to 2016. Sitting here today, it's really difficult to predict where things might go from a global macro standpoint. We feel good about how we're positioned to deal with whatever the market brings and the agility that we have in IP to adjust as needed. As you can see from the chart, CapEx for 2016 is $1.3 billion. This will ensure we get the most important things done, and it reinforces our commitment to remain highly focused on maximizing free cash flow. As we highlighted earlier on this call, IP has delivered consistently strong results and return on invested capital and free cash flow for the last several years, and I have every confidence we'll do so again in 2016. 
Turning to Slide 20. Beyond keeping our employees safe and being good stewards of the environment and being good citizens in the communities in which we operate, we have a robustness of focus items for 2016. At the top of that list is a very good reason is continuing to improve our North American Industrial Packaging system. We have a great foundation to build upon, but we certainly have many opportunities to optimize further across all aspects of the business. The Riegelwood conversion has begun with the objective of having the mill up and running in May and fully ramped up by the fourth quarter. Our teams are keenly focused on making this happen safely and on time and getting the new machine qualified in quick order to supply fluff pulp. Additionally, we are executing our plan to grow our cup business at our recently expanded in Ohio cup facility. This will enable us to take care of our key customers' growing needs in this important segment as consumers drive to shift -- continue to drive the shift from foam to fiber-based packaging. 
Another focus item for us in 2016 is to optimize our North American paper portfolio by aligning with the most attractive customers and the opportunities to deliver a strong value proposition to those customers. We're also working towards the sale of our Asia box business as we announced last October. And the Ilim JV had a strong year in 2015, and we expect another strong performance in 2016. 
And finally, we remain focused on maximizing free cash flow generation and deploying that capital in a way that creates additional value for our shareholders. All of these positions International Paper to have another successful year in 2016. 
And as I wrap up in closing, before we go to Q&A, I go back to the investment thesis for International Paper. We've built a portfolio with strong competitive positions in key markets where IP has a right to win. I like our portfolio, and we'll continue to look for opportunities to improve the company as we go forward. Our strategy has enabled us to achieve and increase the spread of our return on invested capital above our cost of capital, and we've been doing this for the last 6 years. In addition to that, we've proven that we can generate strong sustainable free cash flow, year in and year out, and we've been doing that for several years now. We remain highly focused on the capital allocation strategy as based on very simple principles of creating value, rewarding our shareholders and making International Paper better. 
And with that, I'd like to turn it back over to the operator and open the floor for questions."

As you know, if you order something online, you get a box when you receive it, and then if you have to return it, you use another box to send it back and swap it out. So it carried over a little bit into January. Our January was, I'd say more, or less the way we expected it. We did have a little bit of impact from weather with the snowstorms that moved through. And if you remember, January last year was a bit of an anomalous month with January 2 the way it fell right before a weekend, and was it a work day, wasn't it a work day. So it's a pretty strong comp with some confused workdays for January. But as we look through all of that, January was expected. And first quarter looks to be more or less as we expect.

There are some pockets of where demand is a little bit weaker, namely Turkey, which where we're very large supplier to that market. And some of the Mid East conflict has spilled over. But on balance, demand has held up fairly well. And we continue to see that in the first quarter. January was right as we expected, and February looks to be pretty solid from an advanced standpoint. In the box business, as I said a minute to go, we're expecting roughly a flat absolute tonnage first quarter versus last year. And our model, our demand model that we use says that the market could grow upwards of a percent in the first quarter. We've got some segment mixed uses that we've been working through.

But the other thing that's going on, we've got a much better in stock position of roll stock in our box plants than we've traditionally had over the past 2 or 3 years. So that help us well. And then probably the last one, we did see an improved efficiency in our supply chain network. There were more rail cars available, there were more trucks available. It could be that the just point in time, and it doesn't continue as a trend, but we were reacting to just the velocity, which inventory was flowing through the system as well. So it's just -- you look at a macro number for what we do around downtime, but that's not how we manage it.

But there's other areas where we're still working and we'll continue to do that to improve the company. But our focus area is really creating value and growing the value of the company. And if M&A can play a role as we've said before, then it will be on the table. But it'll be targeted in our areas of creating value, advantage positions and serving, growing solid end markets. Now just about growth rates of unit volume or anything, but really going after where we can find the profit pulls that we can be a competitive right-wing kind of company."

I want to quickly go over the format we're going to use this morning. I will review the full year 2015 results first, and then I'll turn it over to Carol to discuss our fourth quarter results and the performances of our individual businesses. I'll then come back and cover the outlook before we open it for Q&A. 
So I'm going to begin on Slide 5. International Paper finished a very solid year in 2015. We achieved a return on invested capital of 11%, well above our cost of capital, and this makes it the sixth consecutive year that our actual returns are above our cost of capital. Our free cash flow came in strong as well at $1.8 billion, and our earnings per share of $3.65 was the highest EPS in 20 years. That was largely driven by strong results in our North American Industrial Packaging business and record level of results from our Ilim joint venture in Russia. 
Additionally, we completed the sale of our 55% stake in the Sun JV in China at the beginning of the fourth quarter. We received $25 million in cash, in addition to eliminating approximately $400 million of consolidated debt from our balance sheet. 
We also made another meaningful increase to our dividend by 10% in the fourth quarter. And we enhanced our dividend policy, moving the target payout range to 40% to 50% of free cash flow, up from 30% to 40%. We feel confident in this change because it's based on the pressure test we did and updated, which provides a level of confidence to us that our businesses in different economic times have the ability to produce a very sustainable cash and, hence, a sustainable dividend. 
And finally, we continued our strong track record on share buyback as an additional means of returning cash to shareholders, buying more than 500 million shares in 2015. As of this call, total purchases since the inception of the buyback program in September of 2013 amount to about $2.1 billion. 
Moving to slide 6 and turning to the full year financial results. I'd like to highlight a couple of items on this slide. Year-over-year EPS when adjusted for the noncash FX charge on Ilim's U.S. dollar-denominated debt was up 5.5%. Revenue is down roughly 5% with the most significant factor being FX translation, and overall EBITDA margins continue to be strong at 17.6%. 
On Slide 7, you can see that 2015 continued to trend a strong sustainable free cash flow, which has averaged $1.8 billion over the last several years. As we look into 2016 and beyond, we remain confident that IP has a portfolio that can continue to generate strong free cash flow results. We believe free cash flow generation and ROIC above the cost of capital are 2 key drivers of shareholder value, so we think we're on the right track. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Carol to discuss the specifics of the fourth quarter."

I'm on Slide 8. As Mark said earlier, EPS of $3.65 per share is the highest level of 20 years and compares favorably to $3 per share in 2014. Looking at the details, price and mix declines across the North American businesses were essentially offset by favorable input cost. Volume was generally flat across most businesses with the exception of reduced export volume from the North American Containerboard business. Operations largely performed in line with expectations with cost-reduction initiatives offsetting the majority of inflation for the year. Slightly higher taxes were more than offset by lower interest expense and lower share count. And the Ilim JV posted significantly higher results due to improved operation, increased margins and a less negative FX impact on the JV's U.S. dollar-denominated debt. 
Turning to the fourth quarter, free cash flow was strong at $501 million. Industrial Packaging delivered another solid quarter based on steady daily box demand. Additional downtime was taken to balance our supply with our demand as overall demand was impacted by 3 fewer shipping days as compared to the third quarter. Domestic prices were generally stable across our North American businesses. And volumes were seasonally higher, along with increased prices in Brazil, Russia and Europe, primarily in our paper businesses. And finally, the Ilim JV turned in another strong quarter of results but was unfavorably impacted by a $0.05 noncash FX charge on the JV's U.S. dollar-denominated debt. 
Moving to the quarter-over-quarter bridge. As I mentioned, prices were generally stable across the businesses. Volume was unfavorably impacted by 3 less shipping days in the fourth quarter for the North American box business, and we did have reduced export volume. This was partially offset by stronger volume in Europe and Brazil. Operations were negatively impacted by weather and flooding on the East Coast and were further impacted by higher operating cost in the quarter including costs associated with the increased levels of maintenance and downtime taken to balance our supply with our demand. Quarterly earnings benefited from a favorable input costs and a lower noncash FX charge at the Ilim JV. 
Turning to the businesses and beginning with Industrial Packaging on Slide 11. Volume, as I said, was impacted by 3 fewer shipping days in our U.S. box business, and we did have lower export shipments. The daily shipment rate for boxes was up almost 4% over the third quarter and was flat year-over-year against the strong comp for IP. Operational costs were higher, significantly impacted by 322,000 tons of downtime, 230,000 tons of which was taken to balance our supply with our demand. And operating costs were also slightly higher in our Brazil and European packaging businesses. 
Turning to Slide 12, I want to provide some color on the North American box business and what we're experiencing in our shipment in the key segments we serve. As you can see, we experienced a 2% increase in year-over-year shipments on a per day basis from the fourth quarter of '13 to the fourth quarter of '14. And then in the fourth quarter of this year or last year, we essentially held that increased level of demand. I would say the market has even been a bit stronger than what we have experienced. 
From a key segment standpoint, we continue to be encouraged by some of the trends we're seeing. We continue to see substantial growth in the e-commerce and distribution segment in which we are a strong player. Another important trend is in the agricultural segment, which is benefiting from shifting consumer trends to more healthy food. And new product offerings in the beverage segment are also driving some pockets of new growth. Overall, we see a healthy box market that will continue to benefit from evolving consumer trends. 
Moving to Consumer Packaging. The business experienced a less favorable mix and lower volume due to 3 less shipping days. The fourth quarter was a higher operating cost quarter, and the North American business experienced some transition costs associated with the shutdown of the coated paperboard machine at Riegelwood related to preparations for the conversion project. Outage expenses were higher as expected, and input costs were favorable. Finally, earnings improved due to the sale of our share of the Sun JV. 
Turning to Slide 14 and the Paper business. IP experienced price increases in Brazil, Europe and Russia as well as a seasonally favorable mix improvement in Brazil that was partially offset by pulp price pressure in the quarter. Volume was higher primarily due to seasonal strength in Brazil and Europe. Operations were negatively impacting North America due to extreme weather and flooding on the East Coast, some effects which will linger into the first quarter. Operating costs were seasonally higher as well. The negative FX swing here is simply the nonrepeat of the favorable Brazilian FX impact that we experienced in the third quarter. 
Turning to Slide 15. I want to provide an update on the Riegelwood Mill conversion project. As we announced last year, we are converting the mill to 100% pulp with the capability to run an additional 400,000 tons of soft wood and/or fluff pulp. This will bring our total North American system to a capacity of 1.7 million tons, of which 1.5 million can produce fluff pulp. The project is well underway having shut down the first coated paperboard machine, PM18, which is the one that's actually being converted, and we did that in December. And we shut down the second machine, PM15, in January. We will bring the converted machine back online in May, which means half the mill will be down for roughly half the year. Once online, we expect to fully ramp up on softwood pulp and qualified PM18 on fluff pulp by the end of the year. This will ensure we have adequate capacity for our key fluff customers as their demand grows. For the balance of the year, we expect to run and sell mostly market softwood pulp. We will incur costs associated with the conversion and the ramp up. In total, we expect the conversion impact in 2016 to impact earnings by roughly $75 million to $80 million with about $50 million impacting our first quarter earnings, and that's when the bulk of the conversion work will be done and much of the mill will be down actually also for the annual outage. And then there will be some ramp up cost beyond that, that will spread into the second and third quarters. 
Now turning to Ilim. The JV concluded a strong year of operational and financial results as the focus shifted to optimizing and leveraging the completed investments and their very advantage export positions. The JV achieved record operational EBITDA results of $724 million in 2015, and IP's corresponding equity earnings were $131 million. During the quarter, the JV refinanced a portion of their U.S. dollar debt to rubles. 
Relative to the first quarter outlook, the JV expects to continue its strong operational and cost performance against higher inflation, lower pulp prices and the expected weaker seasonality. 
Before I turn to the outlook for the first quarter, I want to just give a quick update on IP's balance sheet. As of December 31, 2015, our balance sheet debt declined slightly to $9.3 billion. The pension GAAP declined by $300 million. In 2015, we made a $750 million voluntary contribution to the pension in the second quarter. Additionally, we had a bond issue and tender offer, which further reduced our debt powers in 2018 and 2021 at lower interest rates. And I'd also remind you that we increased our dividend, as Mark said, 10% to $1.76 and bought back a little more than 500 million of stock in 2015. And currently, we're maintaining a cash balance of about $1 billion. 
So moving to the first quarter outlook on Slide 18. Earnings associated with volume will be lower for the following reasons: number one, channel mix in our North American Industrial Packaging business will impact earnings by $25 million as box volume will be seasonally weaker and export volume will be stronger; secondly, our North American Consumer Packaging business will be impacted by roughly $5 million due to the exit of the Bristol's -- of the Carolina volume; and third, seasonally lower volume in Brazil will impact earnings by roughly $25 million. 
Pricing is expected to be lower for the North American pulp and paper businesses. These are expected to impact earnings by roughly $20 million. Price for our North American Industrial Packaging will be impacted by continued lower export pricing along with the recent PPW index change. All in, this is expected to impact earnings by $20 million. Prices are expected to improve in both European, Russia and Brazil papers as recent price increase announcements are implemented. These will be somewhat offset by inflationary cost pressures in those regions. 
Operations are expected to be generally at the same level as the fourth quarter. Operational costs are expected to improve modestly in North American Industrial Packaging. Maintenance outage expense will increase collectively by $56 million as shown on the slide, inclusive of the higher outage cost associated with the Riegelwood conversion, as I mentioned earlier. 
And as always, we provide an outlook for Ilim assuming stable FX coming our of the quarter, so the first quarter outlook assumes a nonrepeat of the $0.05 charge we incurred in the fourth quarter. 
So with that, let me turn it back over to Mark."

Before I turn to 2016, I just like to reiterate that I feel really good about our results in 2015. I'm on Slide 19 right now. The year didn't play out the way we envisioned coming into it, but given how things unfolded across the globe, I think we played our hand pretty well and had a number of significant accomplishments in 2015. I'm really proud of the way our teams stepped up and dealt with the environment that we were really dealing with, not the one we thought we were going to be dealing with. 
Turning now to 2016. Sitting here today, it's real difficult to predict where things might go from a global macro standpoint. We feel good about how we're positioned to deal with whatever the market brings and the agility that we have in IP to adjust as needed. As you can see from the chart, CapEx for 2016 is $1.3 billion. This will ensure we get the most important things done, and it reinforces our commitment to remain highly focused on maximizing free cash flow. As we highlighted earlier on this call, IP has delivered consistently strong results and return on invested capital and free cash flow for the last several years, and I have every confidence we'll do so again in 2016. 
Turning to Slide 20. Beyond keeping our employees safe and being good stewards of the environment and being good citizens in the communities in which we operate, we have a robustness of focus items for 2016. At the top of that list and for very good reason is continuing to improve our North American Industrial Packaging system. We have a great foundation to build upon, but we certainly have many opportunities to optimize further across all aspects of the business. The Riegelwood conversion has begun with the objective of having the mill up and running in May and fully ramped up by the fourth quarter. Our teams are keenly focused on making this happen safely and on time and getting the new machine qualified in quick order to supply fluff pulp. Additionally, we are executing our plan to grow our cup business at our recently expanded Kenton, Ohio cup facility. This will enable us to take care of our key customers' growing needs in this important segment as consumers drive to shift -- continue to drive the shift from foam to fiber-based packaging. 
Another focus item for us in 2016 is to optimize our North American paper portfolio by aligning with the most attractive customers and the opportunities to deliver a strong value proposition to those customers. We're also working towards the sale of our Asia box business as we announced last October. And the Ilim JV had a strong year in 2015, and we expect another strong performance in 2016. 
And finally, we remain focused on maximizing free cash flow generation and deploying that capital in a way that creates additional value for our shareholders. All of this positions International Paper to have another successful year in 2016. 
And as I wrap up in closing before we go to Q&A, I go back to the investment thesis for International Paper. We've built a portfolio with strong competitive positions in key markets where IP has a right to win. I like our portfolio, and we'll continue to look for opportunities to improve the company as we move forward. 
Our strategy is enabling us to achieve and increase the spread of our return on invested capital above our cost of capital, and we've been doing this for the last 6 years. In addition to that, we've proven that we can generate strong sustainable free cash flow, year in and year out, and we've been doing that for several years now. We remain highly focused on the capital allocation strategy as based on some very simple principles of creating value, rewarding our shareholders and making International Paper better. 
And with that, I'd like to turn it back over to the operator and open the floor for questions."

As you know, if you've ordered something online, you get a box when you receive it. And then if you have to return it, you use another box to send it back and swap it out. So it carried over a little bit into January. Our January was, I'd say, more or less the way we expected it. We did have a little bit of impact from weather with snowstorms that moved through. And if you remember, January last year was a bit of an anomalous month with January 2, the way it fell right before a weekend. And was it a work day? Wasn't it a work day? So it's a pretty strong comp with some confused workdays for January. But as we look through all of that, January was expected. And first quarter looks to be more or less as we expect.

And then above that, it's to hopefully improve the company via cost reduction, strategic investments, for example, like our cup project at Kenton. And that's got some flexibility in it over time against the backdrop of our capital allocation principles."

But on balance, demand has held up fairly well, and we continue to see that in the first quarter. January was right as we expected, and February looks to be pretty solid from an advanced standpoint. In the box business, as I said a minute ago, we're expecting roughly a flat absolute tonnage first quarter versus last year.

First of all, we did have more of a shortfall in our export channel in the fourth quarter than we anticipated. Now as I said a moment ago, it has bounced back in the first quarter. So that was one element: fewer days. But the other thing that's going on, we've got a much better in-stock position, a roll stock in our box plants than we've traditionally had over the past 2 or 3 years, so that helped as well. And then probably the last one, we did see an improved efficiency in our supply chain network. There were more rail cars available. There were more trucks available. It could be that, that's just a point in time, and it doesn't continue as a trend. But we were reacting to just the velocity, which inventory was flowing through the system as well. So it's just -- you look at a macro number for what we do around downtime, but that's not how we manage it.

I want to quickly go over the format we're going to use this morning. I will review the full year 2015 results first, and then I'll turn it over to Carol to discuss our fourth quarter results and the performances of our individual businesses. I'll then come back and cover the outlook before we open it for Q&A. 
So I'm going to begin on Slide 5. International Paper finished a very solid year in 2015. We achieved a return on invested capital of 11%, well above our cost of capital, and this makes it the sixth consecutive year that our actual returns are above our cost of capital. Our free cash flow came in strong as well at $1.8 billion, and our earnings per share of $3.65 was the highest EPS in 20 years. That was largely driven by strong results in our North American Industrial Packaging business and record level of results from our Ilim joint venture in Russia. 
Additionally, we completed the sale of our 55% stake in the Sun JV in China at the beginning of the fourth quarter. We received $25 million in cash, in addition to eliminating approximately $400 million of consolidated debt from our balance sheet. 
We also made another meaningful increase to our dividend by 10% in the fourth quarter. And we enhanced our dividend policy, moving the target payout range to 40% to 50% of free cash flow, up from 30% to 40%. We feel confident in this change because it's based on a pressure test we did and updated, which provides a level of confidence to us that our businesses in different economic times have the ability to produce a very sustainable cash and, hence, a sustainable dividend. 
And finally, we continued our strong track record on share buyback as an additional means of returning cash to shareholders, buying more than 500 million shares in 2015. As of this call, total purchases since the inception of the buyback program in September of 2013 amount to about $2.1 billion. 
Moving to slide 6 and turning to the full year financial results. I'd like to highlight a couple of items on this slide. Year-over-year EPS when adjusted for the noncash FX charge on Ilim's U.S. dollar-denominated debt was up 5.5%. Revenue is down roughly 5% with the most significant factor being FX translation, and overall EBITDA margins continue to be strong at 17.6%. 
On Slide 7 you can see that 2015 continued the trend of strong sustainable free cash flow, which has averaged $1.8 billion over the last several years. As we look into 2016 and beyond, we remain confident that IP has a portfolio that can continue to generate strong free cash flow results. We believe free cash flow generation and ROIC above the cost of capital are 2 key drivers of shareholder value, so we think we're on the right track. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Carol to discuss the specifics of the fourth quarter."

I'm on Slide 8. As Mark said earlier, EPS of $3.65 per share is the highest level in 20 years and compares favorably to $3 per share in 2014. Looking at the details, price and mix declines across the North American businesses were essentially offset by favorable input cost. Volume was generally flat across most businesses with the exception of reduced export volume from the North American Containerboard business. Operations largely performed in line with expectations with cost-reduction initiatives offsetting the majority of inflation for the year. Slightly higher taxes were more than offset by lower interest expense and a lower share count. And the Ilim JV posted significantly higher results due to improved operations, increased margins and a less negative FX impact on the JV's U.S. dollar-denominated debt. 
Turning to the fourth quarter, free cash flow was strong at $501 million. Industrial Packaging delivered another solid quarter based on steady daily box demand. Additional downtime was taken to balance our supply with our demand as overall demand was impacted by 3 fewer shipping days as compared to the third quarter. Domestic prices were generally stable across our North American businesses. And volumes were seasonally higher, along with increased prices in Brazil, Russia and Europe, primarily in our paper businesses. And finally, the Ilim JV turned in another strong quarter of results but was unfavorably impacted by a $0.05 noncash FX charge on the JV's U.S. dollar-denominated debt. 
Moving to the quarter-over-quarter bridge. As I mentioned, prices were generally stable across the businesses. Volume was unfavorably impacted by 3 less shipping days in the fourth quarter for the North American box business, and we did have reduced export volume. This was partially offset by stronger volume in Europe and Brazil. Operations were negatively impacted by weather and flooding on the East Coast and were further impacted by higher operating cost in the quarter, including costs associated with the increased levels of maintenance and downtime taken to balance our supply with our demand. Quarterly earnings benefited from favorable input costs and a lower noncash FX charge at the Ilim JV. 
Turning to the businesses and beginning with Industrial Packaging on Slide 11. Volume, as I said, was impacted by 3 fewer shipping days in our U.S. box business, and we did have lower export shipments. The daily shipment rate for boxes was up almost 4% over the third quarter and was flat year-over-year against a strong comp for IP. Operational costs were higher, significantly impacted by 322,000 tons of downtime, 230,000 tons of which was taken to balance our supply with our demand. And operating costs were also slightly higher in our Brazil and European packaging businesses. 
Turning to Slide 12, I want to provide some color on the North American box business and what we're experiencing in our shipments in the key segments we serve. As you can see, we experienced a 2% increase in year-over-year shipments on a per day basis from the fourth quarter of '13 to the fourth quarter of '14. And then in the fourth quarter of this year -- or last year, we essentially held that increased level of demand. I would say the market has even been a bit stronger than what we have experienced. 
From a key segment standpoint, we continue to be encouraged by some of the trends we're seeing. We continue to see substantial growth in the e-commerce and distribution segment in which we are a strong player. Another important trend is in the agricultural segment, which is benefiting from shifting consumer trends to more healthy foods. And new product offerings in the beverage segment are also driving some pockets of new growth. Overall we see a healthy box market that will continue to benefit from evolving consumer trends. 
Moving to Consumer Packaging. The business experienced a less favorable mix and lower volume due to 3 less shipping days. The fourth quarter was a higher operating cost quarter, and the North American business experienced some transition costs associated with the shutdown of the coated paperboard machine at Riegelwood related to preparations for the conversion project. Outage expenses were higher as expected, and input costs were favorable. Finally, earnings improved due to the sale of our share of the Sun JV. 
Turning to Slide 14 and the Paper business. IP experienced price increases in Brazil, Europe and Russia as well as a seasonally favorable mix improvement in Brazil that was partially offset by pulp price pressure in the quarter. Volume was higher primarily due to seasonal strength in Brazil and Europe. Operations were negatively impacted in North America due to extreme weather and flooding on the East Coast, some effects which will linger into the first quarter. Operating costs were seasonally higher as well. The negative FX swing here is simply the nonrepeat of the favorable Brazilian FX impact that we experienced in the third quarter. 
Turning to Slide 15. I want to provide an update on the Riegelwood Mill conversion project. As we announced last year, we are converting the mill to 100% pulp with the capability to run an additional 400,000 tons of softwood and/or fluff pulp. This will bring our total North American system to a capacity of 1.7 million tons, of which 1.5 million can produce fluff pulp. The project is well underway, having shut down the first coated paperboard machine, PM18, which is the one that's actually being converted, and we did that in December. And we shut down the second machine, PM15, in January. We will bring the converted machine back online in May, which means half the mill will be down for roughly half the year. 
Once online, we expect to fully ramp up on softwood pulp and qualify PM18 on fluff pulp by the end of the year. This will ensure we have adequate capacity for our key fluff customers as their demand grows. For the balance of the year, we expect to run and sell mostly market softwood pulp. We will incur costs associated with the conversion and the ramp-up. In total, we expect the conversion impact in 2016 to impact earnings by roughly $75 million to $80 million with about $50 million impacting our first quarter earnings, and that's when the bulk of the conversion work will be done and much of the mill will be down, actually also for the annual outage. And then there will be some ramp-up cost beyond that, that will spread into the second and third quarters. 
Now turning to Ilim. The JV concluded a strong year of operational and financial results as the focus shifted to optimizing and leveraging the completed investments and their very advantaged export positions. The JV achieved record operational EBITDA results of $724 million in 2015, and IP's corresponding equity earnings were $131 million. During the quarter the JV refinanced a portion of their U.S. dollar debt to rubles. 
Relative to the first quarter outlook, the JV expects to continue its strong operational and cost performance against higher inflation, lower pulp prices and the expected weaker seasonality. 
Before I turn to the outlook for the first quarter, I want to just give a quick update on IP's balance sheet. As of December 31, 2015, our balance sheet debt declined slightly to $9.3 billion. The pension gap declined by $300 million. In 2015 we made a $750 million voluntary contribution to the pension in the second quarter. Additionally, we had a bond issue and tender offer which further reduced our debt towers in 2018 and 2021 at lower interest rates. And I'd also remind you that we increased our dividend, as Mark said, 10% to $1.76 and bought back a little more than 500 million of stock in 2015. And currently we're maintaining a cash balance of about $1 billion. 
So moving to the first quarter outlook on Slide 18. Earnings associated with volume will be lower for the following reasons: number one, channel mix in our North American Industrial Packaging business will impact earnings by $25 million as box volume will be seasonally weaker and export volume will be stronger; secondly, our North American Consumer Packaging business will be impacted by roughly $5 million due to the exit of the Bristols -- of the Carolina volume; and third, seasonally lower volume in Brazil will impact earnings by roughly $25 million. 
Pricing is expected to be lower for the North American pulp and paper businesses. These are expected to impact earnings by roughly $20 million. Price for our North American Industrial Packaging will be impacted by continued lower export pricing along with the recent PPW index change. All in, this is expected to impact earnings by $20 million. Prices are expected to improve in both European, Russia and Brazil papers as recent price increase announcements are implemented. These will be somewhat offset by inflationary cost pressures in those regions. 
Operations are expected to be generally at the same level as the fourth quarter. Operational costs are expected to improve modestly in North American Industrial Packaging. Maintenance outage expense will increase collectively by $56 million as shown on the slide, inclusive of the higher outage cost associated with the Riegelwood conversion, as I mentioned earlier. 
And as always, we provide an outlook for Ilim assuming stable FX coming out of the quarter, so the first quarter outlook assumes a nonrepeat of the $0.05 charge we incurred in the fourth quarter. 
So with that, let me turn it back over to Mark."

Before I turn to 2016, I'd just like to reiterate that I feel really good about our results in 2015. I'm on Slide 19 right now. The year didn't play out the way we envisioned coming into it, but given how things unfolded across the globe, I think we played our hand pretty well and had a number of significant accomplishments in 2015. I'm really proud of the way our team stepped up and dealt with the environment that we were really dealing with, not the one we thought we were going to be dealing with. 
Turning now to 2016. Sitting here today, it's real difficult to predict where things might go from a global macro standpoint. We feel good about how we're positioned to deal with whatever the market brings and the agility that we have in IP to adjust as needed. As you can see from the chart, CapEx for 2016 is $1.3 billion. This will ensure we get the most important things done, and it reinforces our commitment to remain highly focused on maximizing free cash flow. As we highlighted earlier on this call, IP has delivered consistently strong results and return on invested capital and free cash flow for the last several years, and I have every confidence we'll do so again in 2016. 
Turning to Slide 20. Beyond keeping our employees safe and being good stewards of the environment and being good citizens in the communities in which we operate, we have a robust list of focus items for 2016. At the top of that list and for very good reason is continuing to improve our North American Industrial Packaging system. We have a great foundation to build upon, but we certainly have many opportunities to optimize further across all aspects of the business. 
The Riegelwood conversion has begun with the objective of having the mill up and running in May and fully ramped up by the fourth quarter. Our teams are keenly focused on making this happen safely and on time and getting the new machine qualified in quick order to supply fluff pulp. Additionally, we are executing our plan to grow our cup business at our recently expanded Kenton, Ohio cup facility. This will enable us to take care of our key customers' growing needs in this important segment as consumers drive the shift -- continue to drive the shift from foam to fiber-based packaging. 
Another focus item for us in 2016 is to optimize our North American paper portfolio by aligning with the most attractive customers and the opportunities to deliver a strong value proposition to those customers. We're also working towards the sale of our Asia box business as we announced last October. And the Ilim JV had a strong year in 2015, and we expect another strong performance in 2016. 
And finally, we remain focused on maximizing free cash flow generation and deploying that capital in a way that creates additional value for our shareholders. All of this positions International Paper to have another successful year in 2016. 
And as I wrap up in closing before we go to Q&A, I go back to the investment thesis for International Paper. We've built a portfolio with strong competitive positions in key markets where IP has a right to win. I like our portfolio, and we'll continue to look for opportunities to improve the company as we move forward. 
Our strategy is enabling us to achieve and increase the spread of our return on invested capital above our cost of capital, and we've been doing this for the last 6 years. In addition to that, we've proven that we can generate strong sustainable free cash flow year in and year out, and we've been doing that for several years now. We remain highly focused on a capital allocation strategy that's based on some very simple principles of creating value, rewarding our shareholders and making International Paper better. 
And with that, I'd like to turn it back over to the operator and open the floor for questions."

So we had a strong fourth quarter, especially in December, around e-commerce. That continued into the first part of January. 
As you know, if you've ordered something online, you get a box when you receive it. And then if you have to return it you use another box to send it back and swap it out. So it carried over a little bit into January. Our January was, I'd say, more or less the way we expected it. We did have a little bit of impact from weather with the snowstorm that moved through. And if you remember, January last year was a bit of an anomalous month with January 2, the way it fell right before a weekend and was it a work day, wasn't it a work day? So it's a pretty strong comp with some confused workdays for January. 
But as we look through all of that, January was expected. And first quarter looks to be more or less as we expect.

And I think we've said before, with the asset base that we have and the culture we have in our company to operate safe, environmentally-sound and reliable operations, we tend to have a base load in that $1 billion range. And then above that it's to hopefully improve the company via cost reduction, strategic investments, for example, like our cup project at Kenton.

There are some pockets where demand is a little bit weaker, namely Turkey, which we're a very large supplier to that market. And some of the Mid East conflict has spilled over. But on balance, demand has held up fairly well, and we continue to see that in the first quarter. January was right as we expected, and February looks to be pretty solid from an advance standpoint. 
In the box business, as I said a minute ago, we're expecting roughly a flat absolute tonnage first quarter versus last year. And our model, our demand model that we use says that the market could grow upwards of 1% in the first quarter. We've got some segment mix issues that we've been working through.

First of all, we did have more of a shortfall in our export channel in the fourth quarter than we anticipated. Now, as I said a moment ago, it has bounced back in the first quarter. So that was one element: fewer days. 
But the other thing that's going on, we've got a much better in-stock position of roll stock in our box plants than we've traditionally had over the past 2 or 3 years, so that helped as well. 
And then probably the last one, we did see an improved efficiency in our supply chain network. There were more railcars available. There were more trucks available. It could be that, that's just point in time and it doesn't continue as a trend. But we were reacting to just the velocity at which inventory was flowing through the system as well. 
So it's just -- you look at a macro number for what we do around downtime, but that's not how we manage it. We're managing thousands of SKUs, 200 locations and trying to get the right product in the right place at the right time. And so that all factors in to the amount of downtime we take or don't take."

It doesn't have an export position, which is the model that's more typical, which is exporting kraftliner. We use everything we make. And so you've got demand down pretty much tracking with negative GDP. And what's been a challenge and we're making progress is the ability to get pricing to at a minimum offset inflation. So we raised containerboard prices in the fourth quarter. Those are implemented. And we're in the process of raising box prices. 
But being 100% dependent on the Brazilian economy, which I think for the long term is not a bad thing, for the last couple years and for this year and maybe even next year it's a bit of a challenge.

How do you feel about full year '16? Could we see another point, 1.5 points, 2 points of corrugated consumption box growth in full year '16, part 1? 
And then part 2, IP has lagged a little bit the industry. And could you maybe give us a little color on what you were talking about with some of the mix and issues and things there, and could that begin to kind of revert back to averages?"

On your question on growth for the year, yes, I do think that it could be in that point to 1.5 point range. That's what our model says. Having said that, box consumption is not totally disconnected from the economy, so it'll depend on economic performance as we go through the year. But right now, what we see in terms of how the economy is performing, there's no reason to believe that it would be less than that 1% to 1.5% that we saw last year."

In addition to Tim's comment, one of the things that we've seen in OCC is there's just a practical issue with the cost curve, is that when you get in the area where prices are now, you get to a point where collecting the final marginal tons becomes uneconomic.

But we think people are collecting more, which long term is a good thing, but we do think that there's still a practical issue of what it costs to collect that highest cost marginal ton, which is probably curbside and the kind of things that municipalities are doing.

In terms of the pressure that we're seeing out there, overall last year, as we look at strategically where we're focused and where we're growing, we had a good year in our fluff growth, delivering at about 4%, 4.5% on our growth. So we felt really good about that, which is hence the need for the incremental capacity and the growth that we've got planned for this year and going forward.

I want to quickly go over the format we're going to use this morning. I will review the full year 2015 results first, and then I'll turn it over to Carol to discuss our fourth quarter results and the performances of our individual businesses. I'll then come back and cover the outlook before we open it for Q&A. 
So I'm going to begin on Slide 5. International Paper finished a very solid year in 2015. We achieved a return on invested capital of 11%, well above our cost of capital, and this makes it the sixth consecutive year that our actual returns are above our cost of capital. Our free cash flow came in strong as well at $1.8 billion, and our earnings per share of $3.65 was the highest EPS in 20 years. That was largely driven by strong results in our North American Industrial Packaging business and record level of results from our Ilim joint venture in Russia. 
Additionally, we completed the sale of our 55% stake in the Sun JV in China at the beginning of the fourth quarter. We received $25 million in cash, in addition to eliminating approximately $400 million of consolidated debt from our balance sheet. 
We also made another meaningful increase to our dividend by 10% in the fourth quarter. And we enhanced our dividend policy, moving the target payout range to 40% to 50% of free cash flow, up from 30% to 40%. We feel confident in this change because it's based on a pressure test we did and updated, which provides a level of confidence to us that our businesses in different economic times have the ability to produce a very sustainable cash and, hence, a sustainable dividend. 
And finally, we continued our strong track record on share buyback as an additional means of returning cash to shareholders, buying more than 500 million shares in 2015. As of this call, total purchases since the inception of the buyback program in September of 2013 amount to about $2.1 billion. 
Moving to slide 6 and turning to the full year financial results. I'd like to highlight a couple of items on this slide. Year-over-year EPS when adjusted for the noncash FX charge on Ilim's U.S. dollar-denominated debt was up 5.5%. Revenue is down roughly 5% with the most significant factor being FX translation, and overall EBITDA margins continue to be strong at 17.6%. 
On Slide 7 you can see that 2015 continued the trend of strong sustainable free cash flow, which has averaged $1.8 billion over the last several years. As we look into 2016 and beyond, we remain confident that IP has a portfolio that can continue to generate strong free cash flow results. We believe free cash flow generation and ROIC above the cost of capital are 2 key drivers of shareholder value, so we think we're on the right track. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Carol to discuss the specifics of the fourth quarter."

I'm on Slide 8. As Mark said earlier, EPS of $3.65 per share is the highest level in 20 years and compares favorably to $3 per share in 2014. Looking at the details, price and mix declines across the North American businesses were essentially offset by favorable input cost. Volume was generally flat across most businesses with the exception of reduced export volume from the North American Containerboard business. Operations largely performed in line with expectations with cost-reduction initiatives offsetting the majority of inflation for the year. Slightly higher taxes were more than offset by lower interest expense and a lower share count. And the Ilim JV posted significantly higher results due to improved operations, increased margins and a less negative FX impact on the JV's U.S. dollar-denominated debt. 
Turning to the fourth quarter, free cash flow was strong at $501 million. Industrial Packaging delivered another solid quarter based on steady daily box demand. Additional downtime was taken to balance our supply with our demand as overall demand was impacted by 3 fewer shipping days as compared to the third quarter. Domestic prices were generally stable across our North American businesses. And volumes were seasonally higher, along with increased prices in Brazil, Russia and Europe, primarily in our paper businesses. And finally, the Ilim JV turned in another strong quarter of results but was unfavorably impacted by a $0.05 noncash FX charge on the JV's U.S. dollar-denominated debt. 
Moving to the quarter-over-quarter bridge. As I mentioned, prices were generally stable across the businesses. Volume was unfavorably impacted by 3 less shipping days in the fourth quarter for the North American box business, and we did have reduced export volume. This was partially offset by stronger volume in Europe and Brazil. Operations were negatively impacted by weather and flooding on the East Coast and were further impacted by higher operating cost in the quarter, including costs associated with the increased levels of maintenance and downtime taken to balance our supply with our demand. Quarterly earnings benefited from favorable input costs and a lower noncash FX charge at the Ilim JV. 
Turning to the businesses and beginning with Industrial Packaging on Slide 11. Volume, as I said, was impacted by 3 fewer shipping days in our U.S. box business, and we did have lower export shipments. The daily shipment rate for boxes was up almost 4% over the third quarter and was flat year-over-year against a strong comp for IP. Operational costs were higher, significantly impacted by 322,000 tons of downtime, 230,000 tons of which was taken to balance our supply with our demand. And operating costs were also slightly higher in our Brazil and European packaging businesses. 
Turning to Slide 12, I want to provide some color on the North American box business and what we're experiencing in our shipments in the key segments we serve. As you can see, we experienced a 2% increase in year-over-year shipments on a per day basis from the fourth quarter of '13 to the fourth quarter of '14. And then in the fourth quarter of this year -- or last year, we essentially held that increased level of demand. I would say the market has even been a bit stronger than what we have experienced. 
From a key segment standpoint, we continue to be encouraged by some of the trends we're seeing. We continue to see substantial growth in the e-commerce and distribution segment in which we are a strong player. Another important trend is in the agricultural segment, which is benefiting from shifting consumer trends to more healthy foods. And new product offerings in the beverage segment are also driving some pockets of new growth. Overall we see a healthy box market that will continue to benefit from evolving consumer trends. 
Moving to Consumer Packaging. The business experienced a less favorable mix and lower volume due to 3 less shipping days. The fourth quarter was a higher operating cost quarter, and the North American business experienced some transition costs associated with the shutdown of the coated paperboard machine at Riegelwood related to preparations for the conversion project. Outage expenses were higher as expected, and input costs were favorable. Finally, earnings improved due to the sale of our share of the Sun JV. 
Turning to Slide 14 and the Paper business. IP experienced price increases in Brazil, Europe and Russia as well as a seasonally favorable mix improvement in Brazil that was partially offset by pulp price pressure in the quarter. Volume was higher primarily due to seasonal strength in Brazil and Europe. Operations were negatively impacted in North America due to extreme weather and flooding on the East Coast, some effects which will linger into the first quarter. Operating costs were seasonally higher as well. The negative FX swing here is simply the nonrepeat of the favorable Brazilian FX impact that we experienced in the third quarter. 
Turning to Slide 15. I want to provide an update on the Riegelwood Mill conversion project. As we announced last year, we are converting the mill to 100% pulp with the capability to run an additional 400,000 tons of softwood and/or fluff pulp. This will bring our total North American system to a capacity of 1.7 million tons, of which 1.5 million can produce fluff pulp. The project is well underway, having shut down the first coated paperboard machine, PM18, which is the one that's actually being converted, and we did that in December. And we shut down the second machine, PM15, in January. We will bring the converted machine back online in May, which means half the mill will be down for roughly half the year. 
Once online, we expect to fully ramp up on softwood pulp and qualify PM18 on fluff pulp by the end of the year. This will ensure we have adequate capacity for our key fluff customers as their demand grows. For the balance of the year, we expect to run and sell mostly market softwood pulp. We will incur costs associated with the conversion and the ramp-up. In total, we expect the conversion impact in 2016 to impact earnings by roughly $75 million to $80 million with about $50 million impacting our first quarter earnings, and that's when the bulk of the conversion work will be done and much of the mill will be down, actually also for the annual outage. And then there will be some ramp-up cost beyond that, that will spread into the second and third quarters. 
Now turning to Ilim. The JV concluded a strong year of operational and financial results as the focus shifted to optimizing and leveraging the completed investments and their very advantaged export positions. The JV achieved record operational EBITDA results of $724 million in 2015, and IP's corresponding equity earnings were $131 million. During the quarter the JV refinanced a portion of their U.S. dollar debt to rubles. 
Relative to the first quarter outlook, the JV expects to continue its strong operational and cost performance against higher inflation, lower pulp prices and the expected weaker seasonality. 
Before I turn to the outlook for the first quarter, I want to just give a quick update on IP's balance sheet. As of December 31, 2015, our balance sheet debt declined slightly to $9.3 billion. The pension gap declined by $300 million. In 2015 we made a $750 million voluntary contribution to the pension in the second quarter. Additionally, we had a bond issue and tender offer which further reduced our debt towers in 2018 and 2021 at lower interest rates. And I'd also remind you that we increased our dividend, as Mark said, 10% to $1.76 and bought back a little more than 500 million of stock in 2015. And currently we're maintaining a cash balance of about $1 billion. 
So moving to the first quarter outlook on Slide 18. Earnings associated with volume will be lower for the following reasons: number one, channel mix in our North American Industrial Packaging business will impact earnings by $25 million as box volume will be seasonally weaker and export volume will be stronger; secondly, our North American Consumer Packaging business will be impacted by roughly $5 million due to the exit of the Bristols -- of the Carolina volume; and third, seasonally lower volume in Brazil will impact earnings by roughly $25 million. 
Pricing is expected to be lower for the North American pulp and paper businesses. These are expected to impact earnings by roughly $20 million. Price for our North American Industrial Packaging will be impacted by continued lower export pricing along with the recent PPW index change. All in, this is expected to impact earnings by $20 million. Prices are expected to improve in both European, Russia and Brazil papers as recent price increase announcements are implemented. These will be somewhat offset by inflationary cost pressures in those regions. 
Operations are expected to be generally at the same level as the fourth quarter. Operational costs are expected to improve modestly in North American Industrial Packaging. Maintenance outage expense will increase collectively by $56 million as shown on the slide, inclusive of the higher outage cost associated with the Riegelwood conversion, as I mentioned earlier. 
And as always, we provide an outlook for Ilim assuming stable FX coming out of the quarter, so the first quarter outlook assumes a nonrepeat of the $0.05 charge we incurred in the fourth quarter. 
So with that, let me turn it back over to Mark."

Before I turn to 2016, I'd just like to reiterate that I feel really good about our results in 2015. I'm on Slide 19 right now. The year didn't play out the way we envisioned coming into it, but given how things unfolded across the globe, I think we played our hand pretty well and had a number of significant accomplishments in 2015. I'm really proud of the way our team stepped up and dealt with the environment that we were really dealing with, not the one we thought we were going to be dealing with. 
Turning now to 2016. Sitting here today, it's real difficult to predict where things might go from a global macro standpoint. We feel good about how we're positioned to deal with whatever the market brings and the agility that we have in IP to adjust as needed. As you can see from the chart, CapEx for 2016 is $1.3 billion. This will ensure we get the most important things done, and it reinforces our commitment to remain highly focused on maximizing free cash flow. As we highlighted earlier on this call, IP has delivered consistently strong results and return on invested capital and free cash flow for the last several years, and I have every confidence we'll do so again in 2016. 
Turning to Slide 20. Beyond keeping our employees safe and being good stewards of the environment and being good citizens in the communities in which we operate, we have a robust list of focus items for 2016. At the top of that list and for very good reason is continuing to improve our North American Industrial Packaging system. We have a great foundation to build upon, but we certainly have many opportunities to optimize further across all aspects of the business. 
The Riegelwood conversion has begun with the objective of having the mill up and running in May and fully ramped up by the fourth quarter. Our teams are keenly focused on making this happen safely and on time and getting the new machine qualified in quick order to supply fluff pulp. Additionally, we are executing our plan to grow our cup business at our recently expanded Kenton, Ohio cup facility. This will enable us to take care of our key customers' growing needs in this important segment as consumers drive the shift -- continue to drive the shift from foam to fiber-based packaging. 
Another focus item for us in 2016 is to optimize our North American paper portfolio by aligning with the most attractive customers and the opportunities to deliver a strong value proposition to those customers. We're also working towards the sale of our Asia box business as we announced last October. And the Ilim JV had a strong year in 2015, and we expect another strong performance in 2016. 
And finally, we remain focused on maximizing free cash flow generation and deploying that capital in a way that creates additional value for our shareholders. All of this positions International Paper to have another successful year in 2016. 
And as I wrap up in closing before we go to Q&A, I go back to the investment thesis for International Paper. We've built a portfolio with strong competitive positions in key markets where IP has a right to win. I like our portfolio, and we'll continue to look for opportunities to improve the company as we move forward. 
Our strategy is enabling us to achieve and increase the spread of our return on invested capital above our cost of capital, and we've been doing this for the last 6 years. In addition to that, we've proven that we can generate strong sustainable free cash flow year in and year out, and we've been doing that for several years now. We remain highly focused on a capital allocation strategy that's based on some very simple principles of creating value, rewarding our shareholders and making International Paper better. 
And with that, I'd like to turn it back over to the operator and open the floor for questions."

So we had a strong fourth quarter, especially in December, around e-commerce. That continued into the first part of January. 
As you know, if you've ordered something online, you get a box when you receive it. And then if you have to return it you use another box to send it back and swap it out. So it carried over a little bit into January. Our January was, I'd say, more or less the way we expected it. We did have a little bit of impact from weather with the snowstorm that moved through. And if you remember, January last year was a bit of an anomalous month with January 2, the way it fell right before a weekend and was it a work day, wasn't it a work day? So it's a pretty strong comp with some confused workdays for January. 
But as we look through all of that, January was expected. And first quarter looks to be more or less as we expect.

As it relates to required contributions, we have no required contribution for '16 or '17.

There are some pockets where demand is a little bit weaker, namely Turkey, which we're a very large supplier to that market. And some of the Mid East conflict has spilled over. But on balance, demand has held up fairly well, and we continue to see that in the first quarter. January was right as we expected, and February looks to be pretty solid from an advance standpoint. 
In the box business, as I said a minute ago, we're expecting roughly a flat absolute tonnage first quarter versus last year. And our model, our demand model that we use says that the market could grow upwards of 1% in the first quarter. We've got some segment mix issues that we've been working through.

First of all, we did have more of a shortfall in our export channel in the fourth quarter than we anticipated. Now, as I said a moment ago, it has bounced back in the first quarter. So that was one element: fewer days. 
But the other thing that's going on, we've got a much better in-stock position of roll stock in our box plants than we've traditionally had over the past 2 or 3 years, so that helped as well. 
And then probably the last one, we did see an improved efficiency in our supply chain network. There were more railcars available. There were more trucks available. It could be that, that's just point in time and it doesn't continue as a trend. But we were reacting to just the velocity at which inventory was flowing through the system as well. 
So it's just -- you look at a macro number for what we do around downtime, but that's not how we manage it. We're managing thousands of SKUs, 200 locations and trying to get the right product in the right place at the right time. And so that all factors in to the amount of downtime we take or don't take."

And so you've got demand down pretty much tracking with negative GDP. And what's been a challenge and we're making progress is the ability to get pricing to at a minimum offset inflation. So we raised containerboard prices in the fourth quarter. Those are implemented. And we're in the process of raising box prices. 
But being 100% dependent on the Brazilian economy, which I think for the long term is not a bad thing, for the last couple years and for this year and maybe even next year it's a bit of a challenge.

And that inflation number is probably in the range of $200 million to $225 million, and that's on people and services and whatnot. And our goal on that, as it is every year for International Paper, is to offset that with just running better and improvement, which we've been doing."

Thank you for joining our call. I'm going to start on Slide 5.

Thank you for joining our call. 
I'm going to start on Slide 5. International Paper delivered solid first quarter driven by continued strong performance in our North American Industrial Packaging business, along with improved results in our global papers business. Demand across our businesses was at or slightly better than expectations. Our operations performed well, and input costs were favorable. The Riegelwood conversion to fluff pulp was completed several days ago, and we have commenced start-up and qualifications. The Ilim JV had another strong quarter of results. And we announced a couple of important strategic moves, both of which will benefit IP's returns and are really all about making our best business, our Industrial Packaging business, even better. We reached a definitive agreement to sell our Asia Industrial Packaging business, which is expected to close in the second quarter. We also reached an agreement to acquire state-of-the-art newsprint mill in Spain from Holmen Paper, which we plan to convert to high-performance recycled linerboard to strengthen our value proposition to our customers and enhance the results for our European Industrial Packaging business. We plan to use all of that containerboard inside of our converting system. 
Turning to Slide 6. I'd just like to give you a little more color on our financial performance. IP's revenue declined a year-over-year. This was primarily due to the sale of the Sun joint venture in China, which took place in the fourth quarter of 2015. We also incurred cost of about $45 million, exclusive of outage expenses, associated with the Riegelwood conversion, and this was a significant drag to earnings in the quarter. Margins would have been about 100 basis points better, absent this impact. Our free cash flow $311 million was on par with last year's first quarter. 
At this point, what I'd like to do is turn it over to Carol, and she'll walk us through the performance of our individual businesses and the second quarter outlook. And then I'll return to wrap it up, and we'll open it up for your questions. Carol?"
61036,329083157,964109,"International Paper Company, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2016",2016-04-27,"Earnings Calls","International Paper Company","Executives","Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. As Mark mentioned, IP delivered a solid first quarter at $0.80 cents EPS with favorable operations and input cost, offset by lower prices, seasonally lower volumes and heavy maintenance outages, including the Rieg",1520,"Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. As Mark mentioned, IP delivered a solid first quarter at $0.80 cents EPS with favorable operations and input cost, offset by lower prices, seasonally lower volumes and heavy maintenance outages, including the Riegelwood conversion. The positive swing at Ilim is FX related, primarily due to the strengthening of the ruble as it relates to the JV's U.S. dollar-denominated net debt. 
Turning to the businesses on Slide 8. Industrial Packaging, as Mark said, had a strong quarter. We had favorable operations and lower input cost, but they were mostly offset by lower export and box pricing, seasonally lower box volume as expected and higher plant maintenance outage expense. Export volumes did rebound from a weak fourth quarter. The North American business took 212 tons of economic downtime to balance our supply with our demand and adjust our need to match a more efficient supply chain. Input cost were positively impacted by lower cost of OCC and diesel fuel. 
Turning to Slide 9. IP's North American box demand came in generally as expected with year-over-year volume of 1.3% for the first quarter, which was in line with the industry. The quarter finished strong in March, and that momentum has continued through April. As you can see in the table, which highlights several of IP's key customer segment, we see several encouraging trends. We continue to see strong growth in online retail, which had become more meaningful for overall demand. The large process food segment is beginning to show some positive signs as the major companies are making moves to adjust to changing consumer preferences. The agricultural segment, to which IP is a major supplier, is enjoying the most favorable weather conditions the regions have seen in a few years, and this point to solid growth for 2016. And the outlook for the important protein segment is improving. So net-net, a fairly favorable outlook for the business. 
Turning to Europe. As Mark mentioned, we recently announced the strategic move to acquire a unique asset that can be converted to very effectively complement our corrugated packaging network in the region. This transaction will create significant value from both the customer offering and the financial standpoint as it will enable IP to produce high-performance, lightweight recycled containerboard in region. We will acquire the mill along with associated recycling operations and Holmen's ownership position in an on-site cogeneration facility. Upon closing of the deal, we will initiate plans for the conversion of the state-of-the-art newsprint machine to a first quartile testliner machine, which we expect to complete in late 2017. Once reconfigured, the machine will produce 420,000 short ton on recycled containerboard, which will enable IP to integrate the majority of our test liner needs. The total investment for the acquisition and conversion is expected to be approximately $160 million with an expected IRR of more than 15%. 
If you turn to Slide 11, in addition to the attractive age and technology of the machine as well as the mill's configuration, the location of the mill in relation to the majority of our box network is very attractive. The grades of high-performance test liner that we intend to produce on these machines have the greatest application for our broad base of industrial customers. And most of these our served out of our box plant in Spain, France and northern Italy, as shown on the highlighted area of the map. So once again, we're excited about the prospect of this movie and what it can do for our customers at International Paper. 
Turning now to Slide 12, let me talk about Consumer Packaging, where we saw a seasonally slower quarter combined with some pricing pressures, less favorable mix and heavier outage expense resulted in lower earnings for the business in the first quarter. Most of the pricing pressure was felt in the commodity price segment. The timing of volume and higher value mix in the foodservice consumers business was slower to materialize than we had expected as well. Additionally, the sale and exit of the coated bristols business negatively impacted results in the quarter. 
Now moving to Slide 13, and talking about our Printing Papers segment. The slide shows the sequential bridge for the entire segment, which does include our pulp business. As was mentioned earlier, the pulp impact of the Riegelwood conversion, along with the sub-optimized operation at Riegelwood as the conversion of PM18 was underway, significantly impacted segment results for the first quarter by approximately $45 million in total. We will continue to see cost impact from the conversion in the second quarter, along with start-up and qualification cost that will continue to impact results in the second quarter and the second half of 2016. This is consistent with the outlook we provided last quarter and is fully captured in the outlook that I'll share with you shortly. 
Slide 14 shows the results of the global paper segment, excluding pulp and the impact of the conversion. Volume was seasonally weaker as we expected, largely in Brazil, while demand in North America was solid. Good operations and lower input cost contributed favorably to the result as in lower plant maintenance outage expense. Prices were lower in North America, but higher in Europe, Russia and Brazil as we plan to see the benefit of the implementation of previously announced price increases. And price increases are announced in North America and are being implemented in the second quarter. 
Let me give a little more color on Riegelwood. As Mark said, we are pleased that the conversion has been completed on-time and on budget in the month of April, and the start up and qualification of the machine have commenced. Production of softwood market pulp is underway, and then we'll move to the qualification of fluff pulp. We expect to begin fluff trials in the third quarter. The current pricing environment for softwood market pulp, which is used for paper towel and tissue products, is under pressure in the near term. As we ramp up and produce SPFK on the new machine through the rest of 2016, these current conditions will adversely affect earnings. This will improve as we qualify fluff pulp on the new machine and optimize production across our system. 
Turning now to the Ilim JV. The JV had another very strong quarter with operational EBITDA of $176 million, a strong manufacturing performance partially offset lower pulp prices and seasonally lower volume. Over the course of the first quarter, the ruble strengthened slightly against the dollar, which resulted in a favorable noncash FX gain on the JV's $600 million of U.S. denominated net debt, and that impacted our first quarter earnings favorably by $0.03 per share. Lower pulp prices and seasonally higher wood cost, along with planned maintenance outages at the Bratsk and Koryazhma mills are expected to negatively impact second quarter results. 
So before I turn it back over to Mark, let me give you the second quarter outlook. Earnings will increase due to seasonally higher volume in North American box and Brazil papers. The additional box volume is expected to favorably impact North American Industrial Packaging earnings by roughly $40 million. The impact of seasonally stronger demand in Brazil is expected to positively impact earnings by $10 million. 
Moving on to pricing in North America. The expected impact of lower pulp prices and a less favorable mix, associated with the ramp up of Riegelwood on softwood pulp in the second quarter, is about a negative $20 million. This is net of the benefits of the previously announced price increases in uncoated free sheet in North America. Pricing for North American Industrial Packaging will be impacted by lower export pricing, along with the flow through of the January PPW index change that will move through the box. To mind, this is expected to negatively impact earnings in the range of $25 million to $30 million. Prices are expected to improve in Brazil papers as the previous announced price increases are implemented. This will favorably impact earnings by about $10 million. Operational cost in North American Industrial Packaging are expected to improve as a result of seasonally stronger demand and utilization, along with other cost reduction and improvement initiatives. This will be a benefit of roughly $30 million. Operational cost across the other businesses are expected to remain favorable, and input costs are expected to remain generally favorable as well, although we do expect some slight pressure in Europe. Maintenance outage expenses will continue to be heavy in the second quarter but are expected to decrease by a total of $22 million as shown on the slide, mainly due to the lower outage cost at Riegelwood. And relative to the Ilim JV, the items you see on the chart are expected to negatively impact IP equity earnings by approximately $10 million to $15 million. And additionally, we are assuming stable FX coming out of the quarter. As you know, we don't attempt to forecast currency. So the outlook assumes a nonrepeat of the $0.03 gain from the first quarter. 
So with that overview, let me turn it back over to Mark."

Demand actually is holding up reasonably well in the fourth quarter, I think we called out -- our volume was down, we called out some reasons around that, that were situational, and we thought temporary in the first quarter we saw a rebound in export volumes. We were still a little bit lower in total than we were in the first quarter last year. Part of that, in fact, a big part of it is really Turkey and the dumping tariffs that has been imposed and just simply how we're thinking about our participation in the market. It's still a very key market for us, but not every account there is equal. And so we made some decisions in terms of how we were going to position ourselves in the first quarter and going forward. I'd say demand is good. Price gets written about a lot. It doesn't feel like our experience is quite as negative as all the things that has written about it. But there's no doubt, there's some competitive situations out there, and there is a little bit of price pressure. That will probably continue as we go to the second quarter."

We know that when you're stretching the system in terms of utilization rate, things don't always work out the way you want them to, and we've built a tremendous amount of flexibility and a very strong system. So I can't say what it will be going forward. What I can say is we look over a multi-period -- multiple periods, out months at a time, not just within a quarter, and we target where we think we need to be in terms of how we run the system. And then we adjust that almost day-to-day and week-to-week based on a variety of factors. One thing that happened in the fourth quarter, really late third, and continues to be a factor is just how efficiently the supply chain network is running right now. And so what it's meant for us at a moment in time is we just need lots of inventory, and so we've adjusted our production accordingly to match that. We'll have to monitor that over time. Things don’t stay the same. They have a tendency to move around, so we'll have to see how supply chain performs through the rest of the year."

One of the things we've learned as our system has been optimized and it's gotten as large as it gotten, we clearly create more value in our containerboard and box system when there is a bit of flexibility in the system and we create less value when we try to run everything to its limits. And I mean, commercial volume and our ability to respond to customers, running efficient box network, and also actual cost value in properly maintaining the equipment before the expensive failures occurs. And so that few percent on maintenance and that few percent on economic flexibility, economic downtime, really ends up creating the best opportunity for us to generate the highest margins. So it's something that we don't look to sell to 0, because I think if it was 0, we will have a very difficult commercial proposition for our customers."

Just to tie it back to an earlier question around how we run our system.

So the issue of capacity coming online is only when and if we needed for the demand environment. It's really the driver is really making more of this and less of that for the boxes that we need to make going forward.

Thank you for joining our call. 
I'm going to start on Slide 5. International Paper delivered solid first quarter, driven by continued strong performance in our North American Industrial Packaging business, along with improved results in our global papers business. Demand across our businesses was at or slightly better than expectations. Our operations performed well, and input costs were favorable. The Riegelwood conversion to fluff pulp was completed several days ago, and we have commenced start-up and qualifications. The Ilim JV had another strong quarter of results. And we announced a couple of important strategic moves, both of which will benefit IP's returns and are really all about making our best business, our Industrial Packaging business, even better. We reached a definitive agreement to sell our Asia Industrial Packaging business, which is expected to close in the second quarter. We also reached an agreement to acquire a state-of-the-art newsprint mill in Spain from Holmen Paper, which we plan to convert to high-performance recycled linerboard to strengthen our value proposition to our customers and enhance the results for our European Industrial Packaging business. We plan to use all of that containerboard inside of our converting system. 
Turning to Slide 6. I'd just like to give you a little more color on our financial performance. IP's revenue declined year-over-year. This was primarily due to the sale of the Sun joint venture in China, which took place in the fourth quarter of 2015. We also incurred cost of about $45 million, exclusive of outage expenses, associated with the Riegelwood conversion, and this was a significant drag to earnings in the quarter. Margins would have been about 100 basis points better, absent this impact. Our free cash flow $311 million was on par with last year's first quarter. 
At this point, what I'd like to do is turn it over to Carol, and she'll walk us through the performance of our individual businesses and the second quarter outlook. And then I'll return to wrap it up, and we'll open it up for your questions. Carol?"
61036,329083157,964409,"International Paper Company, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2016",2016-04-27,"Earnings Calls","International Paper Company","Executives","Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. As Mark mentioned, IP delivered a solid first quarter at $0.80 EPS with favorable operations and input cost, offset by lower prices, seasonally lower volumes and heavy maintenance outages, including the Riegelwood",1515,"Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. As Mark mentioned, IP delivered a solid first quarter at $0.80 EPS with favorable operations and input cost, offset by lower prices, seasonally lower volumes and heavy maintenance outages, including the Riegelwood conversion. The positive swing at Ilim is FX related, primarily due to the strengthening of the ruble as it relates to the JV's U.S. dollar-denominated net debt. 
Turning to the businesses on Slide 8. Industrial Packaging, as Mark said, had a strong quarter. We had favorable operations and lower input cost, but they were mostly offset by lower export and box pricing, seasonally lower box volume, as expected, and higher plant maintenance outage expense. Export volume did rebound from a weak fourth quarter. The North American business took 212 tons of economic downtime to balance our supply with our demand and adjust our need to match a more efficient supply chain. Input costs were positively impacted by lower cost of OCC diesel fuel. 
Turning to Slide 9. IP's North American box demand came in generally as expected, with year-over-year volume of 1.3% for the first quarter, which was in line with the industry. The quarter finished strong in March, and that momentum has continued through April. As you can see in the table, which highlights several of IP's key customer segments, we see several encouraging trends. We continue to see strong growth in online retail, which has become more meaningful for overall demand. The large processed foods segment is beginning to show some positive signs as the major companies are making moves to adjust to changing consumer preferences. The agricultural segment, to which IP is a major supplier, is enjoying the most favorable weather conditions the regions have seen in a few years, and this point to solid growth for 2016. And the outlook for the important protein segment is improving. So net-net, a fairly favorable outlook for the business. 
Turning to Europe. As Mark mentioned, we recently announced a strategic move to acquire a unique asset that can be converted to very effectively complement our corrugated packaging network in the region. This transaction will create significant value from both a customer offering and a financial standpoint as it will enable IP to produce high-performance, lightweight recycled containerboard in region. We will acquire the mill, along with associated recycling operations and Holmen's ownership position, in an on-site cogeneration facility. Upon closing of the deal, we will initiate plans for the conversion of the state-of-the-art newsprint machine to a first quartile test liner machine, which we expect to complete in late 2017. Once reconfigured, the machine will produce 420,000 short ton of recycled containerboard, which will enable IP to integrate the majority of our test liner needs. The total investment for the acquisition and conversion is expected to be approximately $160 million with an expected IRR of more than 15%. 
If you turn to Slide 11, in addition to the attractive age and technology of the machine as well as the mill's configuration, the location of the mill in relation to the majority of our box network is very attractive. The grades of high-performance test liner that we intend to produce on this machine have the greatest application for our broad base of industrial customers. And most of these are served out of our box plants in Spain, France and Northern Italy, as shown on the highlighted area of the map. So once again, we're excited about the prospects of this move and what it can do for our customers at International Paper. 
Turning now to Slide 12. Let me talk about Consumer Packaging, where we saw a seasonally slower quarter, combined with some pricing pressures, a less favorable mix and heavier outage expense resulted in lower earnings for the business in the first quarter. Most of the pricing pressure was felt in the commodity plate segment. The timing of volume and higher value mix in the foodservice business was slower to materialize than we had expected as well. Additionally, the sale and exit of the coated bristols business negatively impacted results in the quarter. 
Now moving to Slide 13, and talking about our Printing Papers segment. The slide shows the sequential bridge for the entire segment, which does include our pulp business. As was mentioned earlier, the cost impact of the Riegelwood conversion, along with the suboptimized operation at Riegelwood as the conversion of PM18 was underway, significantly impacted segment results for the first quarter by approximately $45 million in total. We will continue to see cost impact from the conversion in the second quarter, along with start-up and qualification cost that will continue to impact results in the second quarter and the second half of 2016. This is consistent with the outlook we provided last quarter and is fully captured in the outlook that I'll share with you shortly. 
Slide 14 shows the results of the global paper segment, excluding pulp and the impact of the conversion. Volume was seasonally weaker as we expected, largely in Brazil, while demand in North America was solid. Good operations and lower input cost contributed favorably to the result, as in lower plant maintenance outage expense. Prices were lower in North America, but higher in Europe, Russia and Brazil as we began to see the benefit of the implementation of previously announced price increases. And price increases are announced in North America, and are being implemented in the second quarter. 
Let me give a little more color on Riegelwood. As Mark said, we are pleased that the conversion has been completed on-time and on-budget in the month of April, and the startup and qualification of the machine have commenced. Production of softwood market pulp is underway, and then we'll move to the qualification of fluff pulp. We expect to begin fluff trials in the third quarter. The current pricing environment for softwood market pulp, which is used for paper towel and tissue products, is under pressure in the near term. As we ramp up and produce SPFK on the new machine through the rest of 2016, these current conditions will adversely affect earnings. This will improve as we qualify fluff pulp on the new machine and optimize production across our system. 
Turning now to the Ilim JV. The JV had another very strong quarter with operational EBITDA of $176 million. A strong manufacturing performance partially offset lower pulp prices and seasonally lower volume. Over the course of the first quarter, the ruble strengthened slightly against the dollar, which resulted in a favorable noncash FX gain on the JV's $600 million of U.S.-denominated net debt, and that impacted our first quarter earnings favorably by $0.03 per share. Lower pulp prices and seasonally higher wood cost, along with planned maintenance outages at the Bratsk and Koryazhma mills are expected to negatively impact second quarter results. 
So before I turn it back over to Mark, let me give you the second quarter outlook. Earnings will increase due to seasonally higher volume in North American box and Brazil papers. The additional box volume is expected to favorably impact North American Industrial Packaging earnings by roughly $40 million. The impact of seasonally stronger demand in Brazil is expected to positively impact earnings by $10 million. 
Moving on to pricing in North America. The expected impact of lower pulp prices and a less favorable mix, associated with the ramp up of Riegelwood on softwood pulp in the second quarter, is about a negative $20 million. This is net of the benefits of the previously announced price increases in uncoated free sheet in North America. Pricing for North American Industrial Packaging will be impacted by lower export pricing, along with the flow-through of the January PPW index change that will move through the boxes. To mind, this is expected to negatively impact earnings in the range of $25 million to $30 million. 
Prices are expected to improve in Brazil papers, as the previously announced price increases are implemented. This will favorably impact earnings by about $10 million. Operational costs in North American Industrial Packaging are expected to improve as a result of seasonally stronger demand and utilization, along with other cost reduction and improvement initiatives. This will be a benefit of roughly $30 million. Operational costs across the other businesses are expected to remain favorable, and input costs are expected to remain generally favorable as well, although we do expect some slight pressure in Europe. Maintenance outage expenses will continue to be heavy in the second quarter, but are expected to decrease by a total of $22 million as shown on the slide, mainly due to the lower outage cost at Riegelwood. And relative to the Ilim JV, the items you see on the chart are expected to negatively impact IP equity earnings by approximately $10 million to $15 million. And additionally, we are assuming stable FX coming out of the quarter. As you know, we don't attempt to forecast currency. So the outlook assumes a nonrepeat of the $0.03 gain from the first quarter. 
So with that overview, let me turn it back over to Mark."

The conversion at Riegelwood went well, was on-time and on-budget, and our team is now ramping up and qualifying the new capabilities. All of this will enable International Paper to continue to generate strong free cash flow, which we will allocate to create additional value. We've also made some key decisions that will improve IP's portfolio and make it stronger, and further improve returns on invested capital, namely our decisions in Asia and Madrid.

It's still a very key market for us, but not every account there is equal. And so we made some decisions in terms of how we were going to position ourselves in the first quarter and going forward. I'd say demand is good. Price gets written about a lot. It doesn't feel like our experience is quite as negative as all the things that has written about it.

And some of the investments that we're making, it's all around building capability and flexibility in the system. We know that when you're stretching the system in terms of utilization rate, things don't always work out the way you want them to, and we've built a tremendous amount of flexibility and a very strong system. So I can't say what it will be going forward. What I can say is we look over a multi-period -- multiple periods, out months at a time, not just within a quarter, and we target where we think we need to be in terms of how we run the system. And then we adjust that almost day-to-day and week-to-week based on a variety of factors. One thing that happened in the fourth quarter, really late third, and continues to be a factor is just how efficiently the supply chain network is running right now. And so what it's meant for us at a moment in time is we just need lots of inventory, and so we've adjusted our production accordingly to match that. We'll have to monitor that over time. Things don’t stay the same. They have a tendency to move around, so we'll have to see how supply chain performs through the rest of the year."

One of the things we've learned as our system has been optimized, and it's gotten as large as it's gotten, we clearly create more value in our containerboard and box system when there is a bit of flexibility in the system. And we create less value when we try to run everything to its limits. And I mean, commercial value and our ability to respond to customers, run an efficient box network, and also, actual cost value in properly maintaining the equipment before the expensive failures occur. And so that few percent on maintenance and that few percent on economic flexibility, economic downtime, really ends up creating the best opportunity for us to generate the highest margins. So it's something that we don't look to sell to 0, because I think if it was 0, we would have a very difficult commercial proposition for our customers."

So how do we -- are you thinking about addressing that business in itself, because just adding upstream integration doesn't necessarily fix what seems to be a low-margin business?"

We move very high-quality, high-performance kraftliners through that system. If you look at the geography, where Southern focused around fresh foods. And so our view of that business is part of our integrated channel to market. And the integration of high-performance recycled liner, coupled with our U.S.-produced high-performance kraftliner makes that whole value proposition better. It allows us to improve our customer mix. And as you know from the European theater, the recycled board that's available is geographically available. So you have to have what you need, where you need it, in a reliable way to build out your offering for your customers. And that's what this does to improve that business. So what we focus on in our European corrugated business is very good for the company. And when you take it back and look at the way we think about Industrial Packaging globally, it's a really good business for IP."

Just the question -- the first question you asked, just to tie it back to an earlier question around how we run our system.

So the issue of capacity coming online is only when and if we needed for the demand environment. It's really -- the driver is really making more of this and less of that for the boxes that we need to make going forward. And as an outcome of improving those facilities, we have more capacity if we need more capacity. So that's kind of the way to think about it as opposed to this is coming on this at this date, and this is coming on at that date. It's coming as a new product, a new basis weight, a new design.

Thank you for joining our call. 
I'm going to start on Slide 5. International Paper delivered a solid first quarter, driven by continued strong performance in our North American Industrial Packaging business, along with improved results in our global papers business. Demand across our businesses was at or slightly better than expectations. Our operations performed well, and input costs were favorable. The Riegelwood conversion to fluff pulp was completed several days ago, and we have commenced startup and qualifications. The Ilim JV had another strong quarter of results. And we announced a couple of important strategic moves, both of which will benefit IP's returns and are really all about making our best business, our Industrial Packaging business, even better. We reached a definitive agreement to sell our Asia Industrial Packaging business, which is expected to close in the second quarter. We also reached an agreement to acquire a state-of-the-art newsprint mill in Spain from Holmen Paper, which we plan to convert to high-performance recycled linerboard to strengthen our value proposition to our customers and enhance the results for our European Industrial Packaging business. We plan to use all of that containerboard inside of our converting system. 
Turning to Slide 6. I'd just like to give you a little more color on our financial performance. IP's revenue declined year-over-year. This was primarily due to the sale of the Sun joint venture in China, which took place in the fourth quarter of 2015. We also incurred costs of about $45 million, exclusive of outage expenses, associated with the Riegelwood conversion, and this was a significant drag to earnings in the quarter. Margins would have been about 100 basis points better absent this impact. Our free cash flow of $311 million was on par with last year's first quarter. 
At this point what I'd like to do is turn it over to Carol, and she'll walk us through the performance of our individual businesses and the second quarter outlook. And then I'll return to wrap it up, and we'll open it up for your questions. Carol?"
61036,329083157,964657,"International Paper Company, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2016",2016-04-27,"Earnings Calls","International Paper Company","Executives","Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. As Mark mentioned, IP delivered a solid first quarter at $0.80 EPS with favorable operations and input costs, offset by lower prices, seasonally lower volume and heavy maintenance outages, including the Riegelwood",1514,"Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. As Mark mentioned, IP delivered a solid first quarter at $0.80 EPS with favorable operations and input costs, offset by lower prices, seasonally lower volume and heavy maintenance outages, including the Riegelwood conversion. The positive swing at Ilim is FX related, primarily due to the strengthening of the ruble as it relates to the JV's U.S. dollar-denominated net debt. 
Turning to the businesses on Slide 8. Industrial Packaging, as Mark said, had a strong quarter. We had favorable operations and lower input costs, but they were mostly offset by lower export and box pricing; seasonally lower box volume, as expected; and higher planned maintenance outage expense. Export volume did rebound from a weak fourth quarter. The North American business took 212 tons of economic downtime to balance our supply with our demand and adjust our needs to match a more efficient supply chain. Input costs were positively impacted by lower cost of OCC diesel fuel. 
Turning to Slide 9. IP's North American box demand came in generally as expected, with year-over-year volume up 1.3% for the first quarter, which was in line with the industry. The quarter finished strong in March and that momentum has continued through April. As you can see in the table, which highlights several of IP's key customer segments, we see several encouraging trends. We continue to see strong growth in online retail, which has become more meaningful for overall demand. The large processed foods segment is beginning to show some positive signs as the major companies are making moves to adjust to changing consumer preferences. The agricultural segment, to which IP is a major supplier, is enjoying the most favorable weather conditions the regions have seen in a few years, and this points to solid growth for 2016. And the outlook for the important protein segment is improving. So net-net, a fairly favorable outlook for the business. 
Turning to Europe. As Mark mentioned, we recently announced a strategic move to acquire a unique asset that can be converted to very effectively complement our corrugated packaging network in the region. This transaction will create significant value from both a customer offering and a financial standpoint as it will enable IP to produce high-performance lightweight recycled containerboard in region. We will acquire the mill, along with associated recycling operations and Holmen's ownership position in an on-site cogeneration facility. Upon closing of the deal, we will initiate plans for the conversion of the state-of-the-art newsprint machine to a first quartile test liner machine, which we expect to complete in late 2017. Once reconfigured, the machine will produce 420,000 short tons of recycled containerboard, which will enable IP to integrate the majority of our test liner needs. The total investment for the acquisition and conversion is expected to be approximately $160 million, with an expected IRR of more than 15%. 
If you turn to Slide 11, in addition to the attractive age and technology of the machine as well as the mill's configuration, the location of the mill in relation to the majority of our box network is very attractive. The grades of high-performance test liner that we intend to produce on this machine have the greatest application for our broad base of industrial customers. And most of these are served out of our box plants in Spain, France and Northern Italy, as shown on the highlighted area of the map. So once again, we're excited about the prospects of this move and what it can do for our customers and International Paper. 
Turning now to Slide 12. Let me talk about Consumer Packaging, where we saw a seasonally slower quarter, combined with some pricing pressures, a less favorable mix and heavier outage expense resulted in lower earnings for the business in the first quarter. Most of the pricing pressure was felt in the commodity plate segment. The timing of volume and higher value mix in the foodservice business was slower to materialize than we had expected as well. Additionally, the sale and exit of the coated bristols business negatively impacted results in the quarter. 
Now moving to Slide 13 and talking about our Printing Papers segment, the slide shows the sequential bridge for the entire segment, which does include our pulp business. As was mentioned earlier, the cost impact of the Riegelwood conversion, along with the suboptimized operation at Riegelwood as the conversion of PM18 was underway, significantly impacted segment results for the first quarter by approximately $45 million in total. We will continue to see cost impact from the conversion in the second quarter, along with start-up and qualification costs that will continue to impact results in the second quarter and the second half of 2016. This is consistent with the outlook we provided last quarter and is fully captured in the outlook that I'll share with you shortly. 
Slide 14 shows the results of the global paper segment excluding pulp and the impact of the conversion. Volume was seasonally weaker, as we expected, largely in Brazil, while demand in North America was solid. Good operations and lower input costs contributed favorably to the result, as did lower planned maintenance outage expense. Prices were lower in North America but higher in Europe, Russia and Brazil as we began to see the benefit of the implementation of previously announced price increases. And price increases are announced in North America and are being implemented in the second quarter. 
Let me give a little more color on Riegelwood. As Mark said, we are pleased that the conversion has been completed on time and on budget in the month of April and startup and qualification of the machine has commenced. Production of softwood market pulp is underway, and then we'll move to the qualification of fluff pulp. We expect to begin fluff trials in the third quarter. The current pricing environment for softwood market pulp, which is used for paper towel and tissue products, is under pressure in the near term. As we ramp up and produce SPFK on the new machine through the rest of 2016, these current conditions will adversely affect earnings. This will improve as we qualify fluff pulp on the new machine and optimize production across our system. 
Turning now to the Ilim JV. The JV had another very strong quarter with operational EBITDA of $176 million, as strong manufacturing performance partially offset lower pulp prices and seasonally lower volume. Over the course of the first quarter the ruble strengthened slightly against the dollar, which resulted in a favorable noncash FX gain on the JV's $600 million of U.S.-denominated net debt, and that impacted our first quarter earnings favorably by $0.03 per share. Lower pulp prices and seasonally higher wood cost, along with planned maintenance outages at the Bratsk and Koryazhma mills, are expected to negatively impact second quarter results. 
So before I turn it back over to Mark, let me give you the second quarter outlook. Earnings will increase due to seasonally higher volume in North American box and Brazil papers. The additional box volume is expected to favorably impact North American Industrial Packaging earnings by roughly $40 million. The impact of seasonally stronger demand in Brazil is expected to positively impact earnings by $10 million. 
Moving on to pricing in North America. The expected impact of lower pulp prices and a less favorable mix associated with the ramp-up of Riegelwood on softwood pulp in the second quarter is about a negative $20 million. This is net of the benefits of the previously announced price increases in uncoated free sheet in North America. Pricing for North American Industrial Packaging will be impacted by lower export pricing, along with the flow-through of the January PPW index change that will move through to boxes. Combined, this is expected to negatively impact earnings in the range of $25 million to $30 million. 
Prices are expected to improve in Brazil papers as the previously announced price increases are implemented. This will favorably impact earnings by about $10 million. Operational costs in North American Industrial Packaging are expected to improve as a result of seasonally stronger demand and utilization, along with other cost reduction and improvement initiatives. This will be a benefit of roughly $30 million. Operational costs across the other businesses are expected to remain favorable, and input costs are expected to remain generally favorable as well, although we do expect some slight pressure in Europe. Maintenance outage expenses will continue to be heavy in the second quarter but are expected to decrease by a total of $22 million, as shown on the slide, mainly due to the lower outage costs at Riegelwood. And relative to the Ilim JV, the items you see on the chart are expected to negatively impact IP equity earnings by approximately $10 million to $15 million. And additionally, we are assuming stable FX coming out of the quarter. As you know, we don't attempt to forecast currency. So the outlook assumes a nonrepeat of the $0.03 gain from the first quarter. 
So with that overview, let me turn it back over to Mark."

The conversion at Riegelwood went well, was on time and on budget, and our team is now ramping up and qualifying the new capabilities. All of this will enable International Paper to continue to generate strong free cash flow, which we will allocate to create additional value. 
We've also made some key decisions that will improve IP's portfolio and make it stronger and further improve returns on invested capital, namely our decisions in Asia and Madrid. And you'll see more of this as we move forward where it makes sense for International Paper and our stakeholders.

So I think we're very much still in the range of being able to accomplish that. We've got a lot of the year left, and we've got some real positive trends on our commercial front, and we're operating very, very well. So we are all about focused on hitting that EBITDA that we talked about."

In the fourth quarter I think we called out -- our volume was down. We called out some reasons around that, that were situational and we thought temporary. In the first quarter we saw a rebound in export volumes. We were still a little bit lower in total than we were in the first quarter last year. Part of that, in fact the big part of it is really Turkey and the dumping tariff that has been imposed and just simply how we're thinking about our participation in the market. It's still a very key market for us, but not every account there is equal. And so we made some decisions in terms of how we were going to position ourselves in the first quarter and going forward. 
I'd say demand is good. Price gets written about a lot. It doesn't feel like our experience is quite as negative as all the things that is written about it. But there's no doubt there's some competitive situations out there and there is a little bit of price pressure. That will probably continue as we go through the second quarter."

We know that when you're stretching the system in terms of utilization rate, things don't always work out the way you want them to, and we've built a tremendous amount of flexibility and a very strong system. So I can't say what it will be going forward. What I can say is we look over a multi-period -- multiple periods, out months at a time, not just within a quarter, and we target where we think we need to be in terms of how we run the system. And then we adjust that almost day-to-day and week-to-week based on a variety of factors. 
One thing that happened in the fourth quarter, really late third, and continues to be a factor is just how efficiently the supply chain network is running right now. And so what it's meant for us at a moment in time is we just need less inventory, and so we've adjusted our production accordingly to match that. We'll have to monitor that over time. Things don’t stay the same. They have a tendency to move around. So we'll have to see how supply chain performs through the rest of the year."

One of the things we've learned as our system has been optimized and it's gotten as large as it's gotten is we clearly create more value in our containerboard and box system when there is a bit of flexibility in the system. And we create less value when we try to run everything to its limits. And I mean commercial value in our ability to respond to customers, run an efficient box network, and also actual cost value in properly maintaining the equipment before the expensive failures occur. And so that few percent on maintenance and that few percent on economic flexibility, economic downtime, really ends up creating the best opportunity for us to generate the highest margins. So it's something that we don't look to sell to 0, because I think if it was 0 we would have a very difficult commercial proposition for our customers."

And so we'll continue to do that, and if one makes sense, then we'll be talking to everyone about what it is and why we think it makes sense. 
In terms of Holmen, don't expect a big impact from one region to another, at all. But the related question around are there are things like that, I think that's what you see us doing with some of these investments that we're making. We've talked about increasing capacity and adding flexibility. It's not that all capacity is the same. What we're doing is we're adding capability around certain products that we think are growing through our segments and that we think we need, and we're building that capability. So it's similar to Holmen; it's just different. We've got 16 mills where we can look at the product mix that we need and make investments accordingly."

And so our view of that business is part of our integrated channel to market. And the integration of high-performance recycled liner, coupled with our U.S.-produced high-performance kraftliner, makes that whole value proposition better. It allows us to improve our customer mix. And as you know from the European theater, the recycled board that's available is geographically available. So you have to have what you need where you need it in a reliable way to build out your offering for your customers. And that's what this does to improve that business.

Just the question -- the first question you asked, just to tie it back to an earlier question around how we run our system, that incremental capacity capability that's coming from these investments, as Tim mentioned, is really about making some products differently than we've made before, making our system more flexible, meaning we can make similar products at a similar mill -- at the same mill or a different mill so we can improve our supply chain. So the issue of capacity coming online is only when and if we need it for the demand environment. It's really -- the driver is really making more of this and less of that for the boxes that we need to make going forward. And as an outcome of improving those facilities, we have more capacity if we need more capacity.

A big portion of that is inclusive of their normal maintenance and regulatory CapEx. That's about $325 million annually. So the incremental that was in that announcement over that 5-year period was about $700 million. And it's planned only as the projects are developed and as they have the right returns to improve the current business that they have and to improve the quality of the product and, if necessary, to make more product at a second facility. And the plan for that would be to organize the funding the same way the prior development of Ilim was done, which is on the Ilim balance sheet we don't see any effect on the dividend changing or going down or anything like that. So we think there's some good opportunities for improving Ilim. And it goes to that comment I made on my closing statement around making products that are needed in the market, mainly into consumer-oriented end uses, and making them in the right place in the world where you're advantaged: fiber, cost structure and workforce.

Thank you for joining our call. I'm going to start on Slide 5. International Paper delivered a solid first quarter, driven by continued strong performance in our North American Industrial Packaging business, a",350,"Thank you, Jay, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call. 
I'm going to start on Slide 5. International Paper delivered a solid first quarter, driven by continued strong performance in our North American Industrial Packaging business, along with improved results in our global papers business. Demand across our businesses was at or slightly better than expectations. Our operations performed well, and input costs were favorable. The Riegelwood conversion to fluff pulp was completed several days ago, and we have commenced startup and qualifications. The Ilim JV had another strong quarter of results. And we announced a couple of important strategic moves, both of which will benefit IP's returns and are really all about making our best business, our Industrial Packaging business, even better. We reached a definitive agreement to sell our Asia Industrial Packaging business, which is expected to close in the second quarter. We also reached an agreement to acquire a state-of-the-art newsprint mill in Spain from Holmen Paper, which we plan to convert to high-performance recycled linerboard to strengthen our value proposition to our customers and enhance the results for our European Industrial Packaging business. We plan to use all of that containerboard inside of our converting system. 
Turning to Slide 6. I'd just like to give you a little more color on our financial performance. IP's revenue declined year-over-year. This was primarily due to the sale of the Sun joint venture in China, which took place in the fourth quarter of 2015. We also incurred costs of about $45 million, exclusive of outage expenses, associated with the Riegelwood conversion, and this was a significant drag to earnings in the quarter. Margins would have been about 100 basis points better absent this impact. Our free cash flow of $311 million was on par with last year's first quarter. 
At this point what I'd like to do is turn it over to Carol, and she'll walk us through the performance of our individual businesses and the second quarter outlook. And then I'll return to wrap it up, and we'll open it up for your questions. Carol?"
61036,329083157,965300,"International Paper Company, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2016",2016-04-27,"Earnings Calls","International Paper Company","Executives","Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. As Mark mentioned, IP delivered a solid first quarter at $0.80 EPS with favorable operations and input costs, offset by lower prices, seasonally lower volume and heavy maintenance outages, including the Riegelwood",1514,"Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. As Mark mentioned, IP delivered a solid first quarter at $0.80 EPS with favorable operations and input costs, offset by lower prices, seasonally lower volume and heavy maintenance outages, including the Riegelwood conversion. The positive swing at Ilim is FX related, primarily due to the strengthening of the ruble as it relates to the JV's U.S. dollar-denominated net debt. 
Turning to the businesses on Slide 8. Industrial Packaging, as Mark said, had a strong quarter. We had favorable operations and lower input costs, but they were mostly offset by lower export and box pricing; seasonally lower box volume, as expected; and higher planned maintenance outage expense. Export volume did rebound from a weak fourth quarter. The North American business took 212 tons of economic downtime to balance our supply with our demand and adjust our needs to match a more efficient supply chain. Input costs were positively impacted by lower cost of OCC diesel fuel. 
Turning to Slide 9. IP's North American box demand came in generally as expected, with year-over-year volume up 1.3% for the first quarter, which was in line with the industry. The quarter finished strong in March and that momentum has continued through April. As you can see in the table, which highlights several of IP's key customer segments, we see several encouraging trends. We continue to see strong growth in online retail, which has become more meaningful for overall demand. The large processed foods segment is beginning to show some positive signs as the major companies are making moves to adjust to changing consumer preferences. The agricultural segment, to which IP is a major supplier, is enjoying the most favorable weather conditions the regions have seen in a few years, and this points to solid growth for 2016. And the outlook for the important protein segment is improving. So net-net, a fairly favorable outlook for the business. 
Turning to Europe. As Mark mentioned, we recently announced a strategic move to acquire a unique asset that can be converted to very effectively complement our corrugated packaging network in the region. This transaction will create significant value from both a customer offering and a financial standpoint as it will enable IP to produce high-performance lightweight recycled containerboard in region. We will acquire the mill, along with associated recycling operations and Holmen's ownership position in an on-site cogeneration facility. Upon closing of the deal, we will initiate plans for the conversion of the state-of-the-art newsprint machine to a first quartile test liner machine, which we expect to complete in late 2017. Once reconfigured, the machine will produce 420,000 short tons of recycled containerboard, which will enable IP to integrate the majority of our test liner needs. The total investment for the acquisition and conversion is expected to be approximately $160 million, with an expected IRR of more than 15%. 
If you turn to Slide 11, in addition to the attractive age and technology of the machine as well as the mill's configuration, the location of the mill in relation to the majority of our box network is very attractive. The grades of high-performance test liner that we intend to produce on this machine have the greatest application for our broad base of industrial customers. And most of these are served out of our box plants in Spain, France and Northern Italy, as shown on the highlighted area of the map. So once again, we're excited about the prospects of this move and what it can do for our customers and International Paper. 
Turning now to Slide 12. Let me talk about Consumer Packaging, where we saw a seasonally slower quarter, combined with some pricing pressures, a less favorable mix and heavier outage expense resulted in lower earnings for the business in the first quarter. Most of the pricing pressure was felt in the commodity plate segment. The timing of volume and higher value mix in the foodservice business was slower to materialize than we had expected as well. Additionally, the sale and exit of the coated bristols business negatively impacted results in the quarter. 
Now moving to Slide 13 and talking about our Printing Papers segment, the slide shows the sequential bridge for the entire segment, which does include our pulp business. As was mentioned earlier, the cost impact of the Riegelwood conversion, along with the suboptimized operation at Riegelwood as the conversion of PM18 was underway, significantly impacted segment results for the first quarter by approximately $45 million in total. We will continue to see cost impact from the conversion in the second quarter, along with start-up and qualification costs that will continue to impact results in the second quarter and the second half of 2016. This is consistent with the outlook we provided last quarter and is fully captured in the outlook that I'll share with you shortly. 
Slide 14 shows the results of the global paper segment excluding pulp and the impact of the conversion. Volume was seasonally weaker, as we expected, largely in Brazil, while demand in North America was solid. Good operations and lower input costs contributed favorably to the result, as did lower planned maintenance outage expense. Prices were lower in North America but higher in Europe, Russia and Brazil as we began to see the benefit of the implementation of previously announced price increases. And price increases are announced in North America and are being implemented in the second quarter. 
Let me give a little more color on Riegelwood. As Mark said, we are pleased that the conversion has been completed on time and on budget in the month of April and startup and qualification of the machine has commenced. Production of softwood market pulp is underway, and then we'll move to the qualification of fluff pulp. We expect to begin fluff trials in the third quarter. The current pricing environment for softwood market pulp, which is used for paper towel and tissue products, is under pressure in the near term. As we ramp up and produce SPFK on the new machine through the rest of 2016, these current conditions will adversely affect earnings. This will improve as we qualify fluff pulp on the new machine and optimize production across our system. 
Turning now to the Ilim JV. The JV had another very strong quarter with operational EBITDA of $176 million, as strong manufacturing performance partially offset lower pulp prices and seasonally lower volume. Over the course of the first quarter the ruble strengthened slightly against the dollar, which resulted in a favorable noncash FX gain on the JV's $600 million of U.S.-denominated net debt, and that impacted our first quarter earnings favorably by $0.03 per share. Lower pulp prices and seasonally higher wood cost, along with planned maintenance outages at the Bratsk and Koryazhma mills, are expected to negatively impact second quarter results. 
So before I turn it back over to Mark, let me give you the second quarter outlook. Earnings will increase due to seasonally higher volume in North American box and Brazil papers. The additional box volume is expected to favorably impact North American Industrial Packaging earnings by roughly $40 million. The impact of seasonally stronger demand in Brazil is expected to positively impact earnings by $10 million. 
Moving on to pricing in North America. The expected impact of lower pulp prices and a less favorable mix associated with the ramp-up of Riegelwood on softwood pulp in the second quarter is about a negative $20 million. This is net of the benefits of the previously announced price increases in uncoated free sheet in North America. Pricing for North American Industrial Packaging will be impacted by lower export pricing, along with the flow-through of the January PPW index change that will move through to boxes. Combined, this is expected to negatively impact earnings in the range of $25 million to $30 million. 
Prices are expected to improve in Brazil papers as the previously announced price increases are implemented. This will favorably impact earnings by about $10 million. Operational costs in North American Industrial Packaging are expected to improve as a result of seasonally stronger demand and utilization, along with other cost reduction and improvement initiatives. This will be a benefit of roughly $30 million. Operational costs across the other businesses are expected to remain favorable, and input costs are expected to remain generally favorable as well, although we do expect some slight pressure in Europe. Maintenance outage expenses will continue to be heavy in the second quarter but are expected to decrease by a total of $22 million, as shown on the slide, mainly due to the lower outage costs at Riegelwood. And relative to the Ilim JV, the items you see on the chart are expected to negatively impact IP equity earnings by approximately $10 million to $15 million. And additionally, we are assuming stable FX coming out of the quarter. As you know, we don't attempt to forecast currency. So the outlook assumes a nonrepeat of the $0.03 gain from the first quarter. 
So with that overview, let me turn it back over to Mark."

I feel really good about our execution and results from the first quarter, and I'm encouraged that demand feels more favorable across the primary markets that we serve. Our focus remains on execution and we saw benefit from our efforts in the first quarter in terms of good operational performance and lower costs. The conversion at Riegelwood went well, was on time and on budget, and our team is now ramping up and qualifying the new capabilities. All of this will enable International Paper to continue to generate strong free cash flow, which we will allocate to create additional value. 
We've also made some key decisions that will improve IP's portfolio and make it stronger and further improve returns on invested capital, namely our decisions in Asia and Madrid. And you'll see more of this as we move forward where it makes sense for International Paper and our stakeholders. 
We have winning strategies in the right markets, and our focus is clear, as you're seeing in the moves we are making. We're focused on producing products where we have a distinct advantage with good access to fiber and low-cost manufacturing.

In the fourth quarter I think we called out -- our volume was down. We called out some reasons around that, that were situational and we thought temporary. In the first quarter we saw a rebound in export volumes. We were still a little bit lower in total than we were in the first quarter last year. Part of that, in fact the big part of it is really Turkey and the dumping tariff that has been imposed and just simply how we're thinking about our participation in the market. It's still a very key market for us, but not every account there is equal. And so we made some decisions in terms of how we were going to position ourselves in the first quarter and going forward. 
I'd say demand is good. Price gets written about a lot. It doesn't feel like our experience is quite as negative as all the things that is written about it. But there's no doubt there's some competitive situations out there and there is a little bit of price pressure. That will probably continue as we go through the second quarter."

We know that when you're stretching the system in terms of utilization rate, things don't always work out the way you want them to, and we've built a tremendous amount of flexibility and a very strong system. So I can't say what it will be going forward. What I can say is we look over a multi-period -- multiple periods, out months at a time, not just within a quarter, and we target where we think we need to be in terms of how we run the system. And then we adjust that almost day-to-day and week-to-week based on a variety of factors. 
One thing that happened in the fourth quarter, really late third, and continues to be a factor is just how efficiently the supply chain network is running right now. And so what it's meant for us at a moment in time is we just need less inventory, and so we've adjusted our production accordingly to match that. We'll have to monitor that over time. Things don’t stay the same. They have a tendency to move around. So we'll have to see how supply chain performs through the rest of the year."

One of the things we've learned as our system has been optimized and it's gotten as large as it's gotten is we clearly create more value in our containerboard and box system when there is a bit of flexibility in the system. And we create less value when we try to run everything to its limits. And I mean commercial value in our ability to respond to customers, run an efficient box network, and also actual cost value in properly maintaining the equipment before the expensive failures occur. And so that few percent on maintenance and that few percent on economic flexibility, economic downtime, really ends up creating the best opportunity for us to generate the highest margins. So it's something that we don't look to sell to 0, because I think if it was 0 we would have a very difficult commercial proposition for our customers."

In terms of Holmen, don't expect a big impact from one region to another, at all. But the related question around are there are things like that, I think that's what you see us doing with some of these investments that we're making. We've talked about increasing capacity and adding flexibility. It's not that all capacity is the same. What we're doing is we're adding capability around certain products that we think are growing through our segments and that we think we need, and we're building that capability.

It allows us to improve our customer mix. And as you know from the European theater, the recycled board that's available is geographically available.

Just the question -- the first question you asked, just to tie it back to an earlier question around how we run our system, that incremental capacity capability that's coming from these investments, as Tim mentioned, is really about making some products differently than we've made before, making our system more flexible, meaning we can make similar products at a similar mill -- at the same mill or a different mill so we can improve our supply chain. So the issue of capacity coming online is only when and if we need it for the demand environment. It's really -- the driver is really making more of this and less of that for the boxes that we need to make going forward. And as an outcome of improving those facilities, we have more capacity if we need more capacity. So that's kind of the way to think about that as opposed to this is coming on this at this date and this is coming on at that date. It's coming as a new product, a new basis weight, a new design, and net capacity comes on if we have the orders for it and doesn't come on if we don't have the orders for it."

I'm just going to say that we're constantly looking out 4, 5 months in advance, targeting where we think we need based on our demand signal, and then we make adjustments as we run the system. So the downtime that we took in the fourth quarter and first quarter, a very large component of that goes back to supply chain efficiencies and just not needing as much inventory through our chain. That could change over time, and maybe we're taking a little bit of risk on the downside in terms of how it might change and what we might do to -- be able to do to respond to it. But we just like to run a very tight supply chain, and we'll continue to do so."

I'm going to start on Slide 5. International Paper delivered a strong second quarter with solid contribution from our key businesses across our enterprise, resulting in an EBITDA margin of 17.6%, which is 50 basis points higher than the second quarter of 2015. Free cash flow for the quarter was strong at $527 million, operations performed well and a heavy quarter of maintenance outages was executed very effectively. The recently converted machine at the Riegelwood mill is running well and on schedule with our expectations. 
On the portfolio front, we completed the sale of the Asia box business and closed on the purchase of the Madrid mill. We have an agreement with Holmen to produce newsprint, which enables sell until we start the recycled containerboard conversion in mid-2017. We expect the converted mill to be up and running in the fourth quarter of 2017. 
And in early May, we announced that we reached an agreement with Weyerhaeuser to buy their pulp business, and we expect to close on that transaction in the fourth quarter. I'm pleased to report that we successfully completed the lump-sum buyout program for our term vested employees in the IP pension plan, which we initiated to further derisk the plan consistent with our balance sheet strategy. 
Finally, the Ilim joint venture delivered another solid quarter performance, and International Paper received a $58 million dividend in the quarter. 
Turning to Slide 6 and speaking a little more specifically to the financial results for the quarter. Revenue was down year-over-year primarily due to the sale of the Sun joint venture in China and the sale of our Carolina brand of coated bristols last year. EPS of $0.92 represented strong performance coming off a solid first quarter. And as you can see in the chart on the right, return on invested capital for the first half of 2016 was solidly above our cost of capital at 10.6%. This is an important metric that we watch very closely because it's a good indicator of whether IP is creating value for our shareholders over time. When we run our businesses well and when we deploy capital I a value-creating way, we see this metric improve. We've had 6 consecutive years above our cost of capital, and we've been on an upward improvement trend for several years. 
All in all, I'm pleased with our performance in the quarter and the first half of 2016. And with that introduction, I'm going to turn it over to Carol Roberts to cover the business highlights and the outlook for the third quarter."
61036,370166205,1015275,"International Paper Company, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2016",2016-07-28,"Earnings Calls","International Paper Company","Executives","Thanks, Mark, and good morning. As Mark mentioned, IP delivered a strong quarter at $0.92 EPS, driven by seasonally stronger volume and good operational performance. Prices were lower as expected, and I'll put some color on this as we get to the various b",1176,"Thanks, Mark, and good morning. As Mark mentioned, IP delivered a strong quarter at $0.92 EPS, driven by seasonally stronger volume and good operational performance. Prices were lower as expected, and I'll put some color on this as we get to the various business segments. We successfully executed a heavy outage quarter that was slightly lower than the first quarter due to less down time from the mill conversion project at Riegelwood. And results for the Ilim JV were slightly lower than the first quarter, mainly due to planned maintenance outages in the quarter and some modest cost inflation. 
Turning to the businesses, and beginning with Industrial Packaging. The business had another strong quarter driven by seasonally stronger volume, good operational performance and some benefits from input cost. These were partially offset by lower containerboard export prices and lower box prices due to the impact of the January containerboard index change, contract renewals and a slightly favorable less favorable mix. Maintenance outage expenses were higher as well. The North American system took 85,000 tons of economic downtime in the quarter to match our supply with our demand. 
Turning to Slide 9, I want to highlight some of the key levers we have within IP's North American Industrial Packaging business that enable us to build upon what is already a great business and make it even better. 
Our sales teams and designers are working with our customers every day to redesign packaging, leverage innovation and find ways to take cost out. IP has a low cost, world-class mill system, along with a vast box and specialty plant footprint with a diverse range of capabilities. And that footprint serves thousands of customers across every consumer segment. 
We're always working to improve our portfolio business and grow with the highest value customers. And we have a portfolio of customers and products second to none in the industry. 
On the manufacturing and supply chain front, our teams are using the most advanced tools and techniques to drive efficiency improvement and cost reduction. And this, of course, positively impacts our margin. 
As Mark mentioned, we're committed to a disciplined and targeted capital investment program in the right places to maintain and improve this world-class systems. 
For example, over the last few years, we have implemented a couple hundred million dollars of cost-reduction projects in the areas of consumption reduction that have IRRs greater than 25%. We continue to have a robust pipeline of these types of opportunities across our broad networks. 
As I said, lots of levers that have contributed to our success, and we'll continue to do so as we move forward. 
Slide 10, moving now to Consumer Packaging. The business experienced a much improved quarter driven by good operations, effective cost management and the lack of maintenance outages. Prices were slightly lower on folding carton and plate stock, but this was fully offset by a more favorable mix. 
Within this segment, our foodservice business benefited from increased volume as we move through the summer cold cup season. 
In printing papers, earnings improved due to lower outage cost associated with the Riegelwood mill conversion, partly offset by a less favorable product mix and lower pulp prices. The negative $11 million in the price mix bucket is fully attributable to the less favorable mix associated with the ramp up and qualification of the duly converted machine in Riegelwood. Paper volume was higher in Europe and Brazil, and it's also worth noting that the significantly lower outage expense in pulp was partially offset by higher planned maintenance outage expense across the remaining Paper business. 
Turning now to Ilim. The JV turned in another solid quarter of performance with volumes up almost 5% year-over-year. The JV had planned maintenance outages at 2 of the mills, which negatively impacted earnings. FX was generally stable throughout the quarter. And as Mark mentioned, IP received a dividend of $58 million during the quarter. The outlook for IP equity earnings for the third quarter is generally in line with the quarter just completed, but I would note that there was a positive gain of $0.01 on FX related to the JVs U.S.-denominated debt in the second quarter that we assume will not repeat in the third quarter. 
Turning to Slide 13. Before I move on to the outlook, I'd like to give an update on actions we've taken or are planning to take around continued prudent management of IP's pension plan. As we previously disclosed in the first quarter 10-Q, we offered a voluntary pension buyout for term-vested former employees. We completed the program and made the associated payments in the second quarter. We paid a total of $1.2 billion to approximately 25,000 former employees out of plan assets, settling the corresponding liability in keeping with our strategy to take risk off the table. A requirement of settling a liability of this magnitude resulted in IP taking a noncash settlement charge of $439 million or $270 million after tax for unamortized actuarial losses, which impacted our non-operating pension expense for the quarter. 
Additionally, we elected to make a voluntary contribution of $250 million to the plan in the second quarter, and we plan to make additional contributions of $500 million by the end of the year. 
Based on our analysis, we believe these contributions make good sense in light of the tax benefits as well as the fee savings and is consistent with our strategy of derisking the plan over time and managing our balance sheet. 
So on Slide 14, moving to the third quarter outlook. Volume is expected to be mostly stable across the businesses, with the exception of EMEA Packaging, which will be lower due to normal seasonality in Morocco. Price for the quarter is expected to be lower in North American Industrial Packaging due to the flow-through effect of the January PPW FX change. This will negatively affect earnings by about $10 million. To a slightly lesser extent, earnings are expected to also be impacted by a less favorable mix in the pulp business as the majority of the tons coming off the new capacity at Riegelwood during ramp-up will be market softwood rolls. All other pricing should be largely stable. 
Operations are expected to continue to perform well, and input cost, particularly energy and OCC in North America, are expected to be higher in the third quarter by roughly $35 million. Maintenance outage expenses are forecasted to be lower by about $60 million. IP equity earnings from the Ilim JV are expected to be relatively flat assuming a stable FX. With this assumption, there will be a nonrepeat of the favorable $0.01 gain from FX on the JV's U.S.-denominated debt in the prior quarter. And as you can see, there are a few other minor items noted on the chart. I would also note that several of the trends we are seeing as we move into the third quarter, such as input cost, are likely to impact the fourth quarter as well. 
So with that, let me turn it back over to Mark."

When we complete the transac",455,"Thanks, Carol. So before I wrap things up, I want to take a moment to touch on the strategic opportunity we announced during the quarter that IP has reached an agreement to acquire the assets of Weyerhaeuser's pulp business. 
When we complete the transaction, International Paper will be a premier global producer of fluff pulp with a strong position in North America and the ability to serve growing global markets. This strategic combination will also provide us with a talented team and superior research and development capabilities, including a valuable patent portfolio that will enable IP to better serve customers and make our combined businesses more competitive and more profitable. 
The valuation around the acquisition is very compelling and offers an attractive all-in multiple, along with solid double-digit financial returns through real and significant synergies and low integration risk. 
Again, we're very pleased with this acquisition and the integration opportunity ahead of us, and look forward to strengthening this business and the rest of International Paper. 
Moving to Slide 16, I want to briefly come back to the bigger picture for International Paper as we've evolved over the last 18 months or so. Our strategy is to produce fiber-based packaging, pulp and paper where we have advantage production positions and we serve advantaged markets. When we choose the right products, make them in the right places and serve the right markets and the right customers, and when we execute very effectively, we generate the greatest value for customers and our shareholders. 
Looking at that recent decisions we've made, I believe our actions in Asia, the improvement in our North American Industrial Packaging business, the investment in European packaging and the opportunity with our Riegelwood mill conversion and the purchase of Weyerhaeuser's fluff pulp business are consistent with this strategy. 
So in closing, I'm encouraged by how International Paper continues to consistently perform in a challenging and changing global environment. Our focus is squarely on execution from working closely with our customers to deliver superior value, to running and improving our operations, to driving cost out of our system and supply chain, all to maintain and improve margins as you've seen IP do over the last several years. Our financial discipline is evident from our constant vigilance to maintain a strong balance sheet to the Riegelwood capital allocation. We're committed to strengthening our portfolio businesses and to increase the value of the company and ensure an attractive future for IP and our shareholders. And finally, we remain intensely focused on strong free cash flow generation and delivering returns well above our cost of capital to drive shareholder value. 
With that, I'd like to turn it back over to the operator and open the lines for questions."

One is we'll have a half a year of asset performance, we'll have the contributions that go in and we'll also remeasure the plan depending upon how interest rates will from June 30 for International Paper to the end of the year. So yes, you're thinking about it correct."

As I said, the last couple of calls, what we're trying to do with that business is improve it from a cost profile standpoint. Redesigning the way we're organized from people standpoint and redesigning the way that we make and supply the containerboard to our box plants. And then be as strong as we can and perform where we think we can perform in a positive economy versus a minus 4%. That business has the potential to perform much better at a plus 4%, and being able to cover inflation with some degree of pricing versus a minus 4% market and being behind the inflation. So what we're trying to do is change the cost structure, make sure we continue to focus on the customers we have, even though everybody in almost every segment is hurting right now and be well positioned when Brazil's economy begins to pick up. That's what we can control, and we're being very careful with any investments and really trying to do what I would say is fundamental basic blocking and tackling on the commercial side and on the operational side. On the Paper business, we continue to perform very well in that business. Part of it is because it fits squarely into being if you're going to make uncoated free sheet and be a global provider, that is the place to make it. And it starts with the fiber cost structure and our fiber available. So given our export position and given the fact that paper market in Brazil hasn't been hit as much as some of the consumer products market that hit the box business, we're continuing to perform well. And this is part of the same story is getting our cost even lower and making sure that we go out the extra mile to take care of our customers, both in Brazil and outside of Brazil. And we still have some of the strongest EBITDA margins in all of IP in our Brazil Paper business."

Thank you for joining our call, and thank you for your interest in International Paper. 
I'm going to start on Slide 5. International Paper delivered a strong second quarter with solid contributions from our key businesses across our enterprise, resulting in an EBITDA margin of 17.6%, which is 50 basis points higher than the second quarter of 2015. Free cash flow for the quarter was strong at $527 million. Operations performed well, and a heavy quarter of maintenance outages was executed very effectively. The recently converted machine at the Riegelwood mill is running well and on schedule with our expectations. 
On the portfolio front, we completed the sale of the Asia box business and closed on the purchase of the Madrid mill. We have an agreement with Holmen to produce newsprint, which enables sell until we start the recycled containerboard conversion in mid-2017. We expect the converted mill to be up and running in the fourth quarter of 2017. 
And in early May, we announced that we reached an agreement with Weyerhaeuser to buy their pulp business, and we expect to close on that transaction in the fourth quarter. 
I'm pleased to report that we successfully completed the lump sum buyout program for our term-vested employees in the IP pension plan, which we initiated to further derisk the plan consistent with our balance sheet strategy. 
Finally, the Ilim joint venture delivered another solid quarter performance, and International Paper received a $58 million dividend in the quarter. 
Turning to Slide 6 and speaking a little more specifically to the financial results for the quarter. Revenue was down year-over-year, primarily due to the sale of the Sun joint venture in China and the sale of our Carolina brand of coated bristols last year. EPS of $0.92 represented strong performance coming off a solid first quarter. 
And as you can see in the chart on the right, return on invested capital for the first half of 2016 was solidly above our cost of capital at 10.6%. This is an important metric that we watch very closely because it's a good indicator of whether IP is creating value for our shareholders over time. When we run our businesses well and when we deploy capital in a value-creating way, we see this metric improve. We've had 6 consecutive years above our cost of capital, and we've been on an upward improvement trend for several years. 
All in all, I'm pleased with our performance in the quarter and the first half of 2016. 
And with that introduction, I'm going to turn it over to Carol Roberts to cover the business highlights and the outlook for the third quarter."
61036,370166205,1015644,"International Paper Company, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2016",2016-07-28,"Earnings Calls","International Paper Company","Executives","Thanks, Mark, and good morning. As Mark mentioned, IP delivered a strong quarter at $0.92 EPS, driven by seasonally stronger volume and good operational performance. Prices were lower as expected, and I'll put some color on this as we get into the vario",1173,"Thanks, Mark, and good morning. 
As Mark mentioned, IP delivered a strong quarter at $0.92 EPS, driven by seasonally stronger volume and good operational performance. Prices were lower as expected, and I'll put some color on this as we get into the various business segments. We successfully executed a heavy outage quarter that was slightly lower than the first quarter due to less downtime from the mill conversion project at Riegelwood. And results for the Ilim JV were slightly lower than the first quarter, mainly due to planned maintenance outages in the quarter and some modest cost inflation. 
Turning to the businesses, and beginning with Industrial Packaging. The business had another strong quarter driven by seasonally stronger volume, good operational performance and some benefits from input costs. These were partially offset by lower containerboard export prices and lower box prices due to the impact of the January containerboard index change, contract renewal and a slightly favorable less favorable mix. Maintenance outage expenses were higher as well. The North American system took 85,000 tons of economic downtime in the quarter to match our supply with our demand. 
Turning to Slide 9. I want to highlight some of the key levers we have within IP's North American Industrial Packaging business that enable us to build upon what is already a great business and make it even better. 
Our sales teams and designers are working with our customers every day to redesign packaging, leverage innovation and find ways to take cost out. IP has a low-cost, world-class mill system, along with a vast box and specialty plant footprint with a diverse range of capabilities. And that footprint serves thousands of customers across every consumer segment. We are always working to improve our portfolio business and grow with the highest value customers, and we have a portfolio of customers and products second to none in the industry. 
On the manufacturing and supply chain front, our teams are using the most advanced tools and techniques to drive efficiency, improvement and cost reduction. And this, of course, positively impacts our margin. 
As Mark mentioned, we're committed to a disciplined and targeted capital investment program in the right places to maintain and improve this world-class system. For example, over the last few years, we have implemented a couple hundred million dollars of cost-reduction projects in the areas of consumption reduction that have IRRs greater than 25%. We continue to have a robust pipeline of these types of opportunities across our broad network. As I said, lots of levers that have contributed to our success, and we'll continue to do so as we move forward. 
Slide 10, moving now to Consumer Packaging. The business experienced a much improved quarter driven by good operations, effective cost management and the lack of maintenance outages. Prices were slightly lower on folding carton and plate stock, but this was fully offset by a more favorable mix. Within this segment, our food service business benefited from increased volume as we move through the summer cold cup season. 
In printing papers, earnings improved due to lower outage cost associated with the Riegelwood mill conversion, partly offset by a less favorable product mix and lower pulp prices. The negative $11 million in the price mix bucket is fully attributable to the less favorable mix associated with the ramp-up and qualification of the duly converted machine in Riegelwood. Paper volume was higher in Europe and Brazil, and it's also worth noting that the significantly lower outage expense in pulp was partially offset by higher planned maintenance outage expense across the remaining Paper business. 
Turning now to Ilim. The JV turned in another solid quarter of performance with volumes up almost 5% year-over-year. The JV had planned maintenance outages at 2 of the mills, which negatively impacted earnings. FX was generally stable throughout the quarter. And as Mark mentioned, IP received a dividend of $58 million during the quarter. The outlook for IP equity earnings for the third quarter is generally in line with the quarter just completed, but I would note that there was a positive gain of $0.01 on FX related to the JVs U.S.-denominated debt in the second quarter that we assume will not repeat in the third quarter. 
Turning to Slide 13. Before I move on to the outlook, I'd like to give an update on actions we've taken or are planning to take around continued prudent management of IP's pension plan. As we previously disclosed in the first quarter 10-Q, we offered a voluntary pension buyout for term-vested former employees. We completed the program and made the associated payments in the second quarter. We paid a total of $1.2 billion to approximately 25,000 former employees out-of-plan assets, settling the corresponding liability in keeping with our strategy to take risk off the table. A requirement of settling a liability of this magnitude resulted in IP taking a noncash settlement charge of $439 million or $270 million after tax for unamortized actuarial losses, which impacted our non-operating pension expense for the quarter. Additionally, we elected to make a voluntary contribution of $250 million to the plan in the second quarter, and we plan to make additional contributions of $500 million by the end of the year. 
Based on our analysis, we believe these contributions make good sense in light of the tax benefits as well as the fee savings and is consistent with our strategy of derisking the plan over time and managing our balance sheet. 
So on Slide 14, moving to the third quarter outlook. Volume is expected to be mostly stable across the businesses, with the exception of EMEA Packaging, which will be lower due to normal seasonality in Morocco. 
Price for the quarter is expected to be lower in North American Industrial Packaging due to the flow-through effect of the January PPW index change. This will negatively affect earnings by about $10 million. To a slightly lesser extent, earnings are expected to also be impacted by a less favorable mix in the Pulp business as the majority of the tons coming off the new capacity at Riegelwood during ramp-up will be market softwood rolls. All other pricing should be largely stable. 
Operations are expected to continue to perform well. And input costs, particularly energy and OCC in North America, are expected to be higher in the third quarter by roughly $35 million. Maintenance outage expenses are forecasted to be lower by about $60 million. IP equity earnings from the Ilim JV are expected to be relatively flat, assuming a stable FX. With this assumption, there would be a nonrepeat of the favorable $0.01 gain from FX on the JV's U.S.-denominated debt in the prior quarter. And as you can see, there are a few other minor items noted on the chart. 
I would also note that several of the trends we are seeing as we move into the third quarter, such as input costs, are likely to impact the fourth quarter as well.

So before I wrap things up, I want to take a moment to touch on the strategic opportunity we announced during the quarter, that IP has reached an agreement to acquire the assets of Weyerhaeuser's Pulp business. When we complete the tran",456,"Thanks, Carol. 
So before I wrap things up, I want to take a moment to touch on the strategic opportunity we announced during the quarter, that IP has reached an agreement to acquire the assets of Weyerhaeuser's Pulp business. 
When we complete the transaction, International Paper will be a premier global producer of fluff pulp with a strong position in North America and the ability to serve growing global markets. This strategic combination will also provide us with a talented team and superior research and development capabilities, including a valuable patent portfolio that will enable IP to better serve customers and make our combined businesses more competitive and more profitable. The valuation around the acquisition is very compelling and offers an attractive all-in multiple, along with solid double-digit financial returns through real and significant synergies and low integration risk. 
Again, we're very pleased with this acquisition and the integration opportunity ahead of us, and look forward to strengthening this business and the rest of International Paper. 
Moving to Slide 16. I want to briefly come back to the bigger picture for International Paper as we've evolved over the last 18 months or so. Our strategy is to produce fiber-based packaging, pulp and paper where we have advantage production positions and we serve advantaged markets. When we choose the right products, make them in the right places and serve the right markets and the right customers, and when we execute very effectively, we generate the greatest value for customers and our shareholders. Looking at the recent decisions we've made, I believe our actions in Asia, the improvement in our North American Industrial Packaging business, the investment in European packaging and the opportunity with our Riegelwood mill conversion and the purchase of Weyerhaeuser's Fluff Pulp business are all consistent with this strategy. 
So in closing, I'm encouraged by how International Paper continues to consistently perform in a challenging and changing global environment. Our focus is squarely on execution from working closely with our customers to deliver superior value, to running and improving our operations, to driving cost out of our system and supply chain, all to maintain and improve margins as you've seen IP do over the last several years. 
Our financial discipline is evident from our constant vigilance to maintain a strong balance sheet to the [indiscernible] capital allocation. 
We're committed to strengthening our portfolio businesses and to increase the value of the company and ensure an attractive future for IP and our shareholders. 
And finally, we remain intensely focused on strong free cash flow generation and delivering returns well above our cost to capital to drive shareholder value. 
With that, I'd like to turn it back over to the operator and open the lines for questions."

So the liability that shows on the balance sheet has been impacted by the very low interest rates that hit at the end of the June, which was a combination of all kinds of things going on the globe. So a couple of things will happen.

As I said, the last couple of calls, what we're trying to do with that business is improve it from a cost profile standpoint, redesigning the way we're organized from people standpoint and redesigning the way that we make and supply the containerboard to our box plants, and then be as strong as we can and perform where we think we can perform in a positive economy versus a minus 4%. That business has the potential to perform much better at a plus 4%, and being able to cover inflation with some degree of pricing versus a minus 4% market and being behind the inflation wheel. So what we're trying to do is change the cost structure, make sure we continue to focus on the customers we have even though everybody in almost every segment is hurting right now, and be well positioned when Brazil's economy begins to pick up. That's what we can control, and we're being very careful with any investments and really trying to do what I would say is fundamental basic blocking and tackling on the commercial side and on the operational side. On the Paper business, we continue to perform very well in that business. Part of it is because it fits squarely into being. If you're going to make uncoated free sheet and be a global provider, that is the place to make it. And it starts with the fiber cost structure and our fiber availability. So given our export position and given the fact that the paper market in Brazil hasn't been hit as much as some of the consumer product markets that hit the box business, we're continuing to perform well. And this is part of the same story, is getting our cost even lower and making sure that we go at the extra mile to take care of our customers both in Brazil and outside of Brazil. And we still have some of the strongest EBITDA margins in all of IP in our Brazil Paper business."

Thank you for joining our call, and thank you for your interest in International Paper. 
I'm going to start on Slide 5. International Paper delivered a strong second quarter with solid contributions from our key businesses across our enterprise, resulting in an EBITDA margin of 17.6%, which is 50 basis points higher than the second quarter of 2015. Free cash flow for the quarter was strong at $527 million. Operations performed well, and a heavy quarter of maintenance outages was executed very effectively. The recently converted machine at the Riegelwood mill is running well and on schedule with our expectations. 
On the portfolio front, we completed the sale of the Asia box business and closed on the purchase of the Madrid mill. We have an agreement with Holmen to produce newsprint, which enables sell until we start the recycled containerboard conversion in mid-2017. We expect the converted mill to be up and running in the fourth quarter of 2017. 
And in early May, we announced that we reached an agreement with Weyerhaeuser to buy their pulp business, and we expect to close on that transaction in the fourth quarter. 
I'm pleased to report that we successfully completed the lump sum buyout program for our term-vested employees in the IP pension plan, which we initiated to further derisk the plan consistent with our balance sheet strategy. 
Finally, the Ilim joint venture delivered another solid quarter of performance, and International Paper received a $58 million dividend in the quarter. 
Turning to Slide 6 and speaking a little more specifically to the financial results for the quarter. Revenue was down year-over-year, primarily due to the sale of the Sun joint venture in China and the sale of our Carolina brand of coated bristols last year. EPS of $0.92 represented strong performance coming off a solid first quarter. 
And as you can see in the chart on the right, return on invested capital for the first half of 2016 was solidly above our cost of capital at 10.6%. This is an important metric that we watch very closely because it's a good indicator of whether IP is creating value for our shareholders over time. When we run our businesses well and when we deploy capital in a value-creating way, we see this metric improve. We've had 6 consecutive years above our cost of capital, and we've been on an upward improvement trend for several years. 
All in all, I'm pleased with our performance in the quarter and the first half of 2016. 
And with that introduction, I'm going to turn it over to Carol Roberts to cover the business highlights and the outlook for the third quarter."
61036,370166205,1015898,"International Paper Company, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2016",2016-07-28,"Earnings Calls","International Paper Company","Executives","Thanks, Mark, and good morning. As Mark mentioned, IP delivered a strong quarter at $0.92 EPS, driven by seasonally stronger volume and good operational performance. Prices were lower as expected, and I'll put some color on this as we get into the vario",1175,"Thanks, Mark, and good morning. 
As Mark mentioned, IP delivered a strong quarter at $0.92 EPS, driven by seasonally stronger volume and good operational performance. Prices were lower as expected, and I'll put some color on this as we get into the various business segments. We successfully executed a heavy outage quarter that was slightly lower than the first quarter due to less downtime from the mill conversion project at Riegelwood. And results for the Ilim JV were slightly lower than the first quarter, mainly due to planned maintenance outages in the quarter and some modest cost inflation. 
Turning to the businesses, and beginning with Industrial Packaging. The business had another strong quarter driven by seasonally stronger volume, good operational performance and some benefits from input costs. These were partially offset by lower containerboard export prices and lower box prices due to the impact of the January containerboard index change, contract renewal and a slightly favorable -- less favorable mix. Maintenance outage expenses were higher as well. The North American system took 85,000 tons of economic downtime in the quarter to match our supply with our demand. 
Turning to Slide 9. I want to highlight some of the key levers we have within IP's North American Industrial Packaging business that enable us to build upon what is already a great business and make it even better. 
Our sales teams and designers are working with our customers every day to redesign packaging, leverage innovation and find ways to take cost out. IP has a low-cost, world-class mill system, along with a vast box and specialty plant footprint with a diverse range of capabilities. And that footprint serves thousands of customers across every consumer segment. We are always working to improve our portfolio of business and grow with the highest value customers, and we have a portfolio of customers and products second to none in the industry. 
On the manufacturing and supply chain front, our teams are using the most advanced tools and techniques to drive efficiency, improvement and cost reduction. And this, of course, positively impacts our margin. 
As Mark mentioned, we're committed to a disciplined and targeted capital investment program in the right places to maintain and improve this world-class system. For example, over the last few years, we have implemented a couple hundred million dollars of cost-reduction projects in the areas of consumption reduction that have IRRs greater than 25%. We continue to have a robust pipeline of these types of opportunities across our broad network. As I said, lots of levers that have contributed to our success, and we'll continue to do so as we move forward. 
Slide 10, moving now to Consumer Packaging. The business experienced a much improved quarter driven by good operations, effective cost management and the lack of maintenance outages. Prices were slightly lower on folding carton and plate stock, but this was fully offset by a more favorable mix. Within this segment, our food service business benefited from increased volume as we moved through the summer cold cup season. 
In Printing Papers, earnings improved due to lower outage cost associated with the Riegelwood mill conversion, partly offset by a less favorable product mix and lower pulp prices. The negative $11 million in the price mix bucket is fully attributable to the less favorable mix associated with the ramp-up and qualification of the duly converted machine in Riegelwood. Paper volume was higher in Europe and Brazil, and it's also worth noting that the significantly lower outage expense in pulp was partially offset by higher planned maintenance outage expense across the remaining Paper business. 
Turning now to Ilim. The JV turned in another solid quarter of performance with volumes up almost 5% year-over-year. The JV had planned maintenance outages at 2 of the mills, which negatively impacted earnings. FX was generally stable throughout the quarter. And as Mark mentioned, IP received a dividend of $58 million during the quarter. The outlook for IP equity earnings for the third quarter is generally in line with the quarter just completed, but I would note that there was a positive gain of $0.01 on FX related to the JVs U.S.-denominated debt in the second quarter that we assume will not repeat in the third quarter. 
Turning to Slide 13. Before I move on to the outlook, I'd like to give an update on actions we've taken or are planning to take around continued prudent management of IP's pension plan. As we previously disclosed in the first quarter 10-Q, we offered a voluntary pension buyout for term-vested former employees. We completed the program and made the associated payments in the second quarter. We paid a total of $1.2 billion to approximately 25,000 former employees out-of-plan assets, settling the corresponding liability in keeping with our strategy to take risk off the table. A requirement of settling a liability of this magnitude resulted in IP taking a noncash settlement charge of $439 million or $270 million after tax for unamortized actuarial losses, which impacted our non-operating pension expense for the quarter. Additionally, we elected to make a voluntary contribution of $250 million to the plan in the second quarter, and we plan to make additional contributions of $500 million by the end of the year. 
Based on our analysis, we believe these contributions make good sense in light of the tax benefits as well as the fee savings and is consistent with our strategy of derisking the plan over time and managing our balance sheet. 
So on Slide 14, moving to the third quarter outlook. Volume is expected to be mostly stable across the businesses, with the exception of EMEA Packaging, which will be lower due to normal seasonality in Morocco. 
Price for the quarter is expected to be lower in North American Industrial Packaging due to the flow-through effect of the January PPW index change. This will negatively affect earnings by about $10 million. To a slightly lesser extent, earnings are expected to also be impacted by a less favorable mix in the Pulp business as the majority of the tons coming off the new capacity at Riegelwood during ramp-up will be market softwood rolls. All other pricing should be largely stable. 
Operations are expected to continue to perform well. And input costs, particularly energy and OCC in North America, are expected to be higher in the third quarter by roughly $35 million. Maintenance outage expenses are forecasted to be lower by about $60 million. IP equity earnings from the Ilim JV are expected to be relatively flat, assuming a stable FX. With this assumption, there would be a nonrepeat of the favorable $0.01 gain from FX on the JV's U.S.-denominated debt in the prior quarter. And as you can see, there are a few other minor items noted on the chart. 
I would also note that several of the trends we are seeing as we move into the third quarter, such as input costs, are likely to impact the fourth quarter as well. 
So with that, let me turn it back over to Mark."

So before I wrap things up, I wanted to take a moment to touch on the strategic opportunity we announced during the quarter, that IP has reached an agreement to acquire the assets of Weyerhaeuser's Pulp business. 
When we complete the transaction, International Paper will be a premier global producer of fluff pulp with a strong position in North America and the ability to serve growing global markets. This strategic combination will also provide us with a talented team and superior research and development capabilities, including a valuable patent portfolio that will enable IP to better serve customers and make our combined businesses more competitive and more profitable. The valuation around the acquisition is very compelling and offers an attractive all-in multiple, along with solid double-digit financial returns through real and significant synergies and low integration risk. 
Again, we're very pleased with this acquisition and the integration opportunity ahead of us, and look forward to strengthening this business and the rest of International Paper. 
Moving to Slide 16. I want to briefly come back to the bigger picture for International Paper as we've evolved over the last 18 months or so. Our strategy is to produce fiber-based packaging, pulp and paper where we have advantaged production positions and we serve advantaged markets. When we choose the right products, make them in the right places and serve the right markets and the right customers, and when we execute very effectively, we generate the greatest value for customers and our shareholders. Looking at the recent decisions we've made, I believe our actions in Asia, the improvement in our North American Industrial Packaging business, the investment in European packaging and the opportunity with our Riegelwood mill conversion and the purchase of Weyerhaeuser's Fluff Pulp business are all consistent with this strategy. 
So in closing, I'm encouraged by how International Paper continues to consistently perform in a challenging and changing global environment. Our focus is squarely on execution, from working closely with our customers to deliver superior value, to running and improving our operations, to driving cost out of our system and supply chain, all to maintain and improve margins as you've seen IP do over the last several years. 
Our financial discipline is evident from our constant vigilance to maintain a strong balance sheet to the [indiscernible] capital allocation. 
We're committed to strengthening our portfolio businesses and to increase the value of the company and ensure an attractive future for IP and our shareholders. 
And finally, we remain intensely focused on strong free cash flow generation and delivering returns well above our cost of capital to drive shareholder value. 
With that, I'd like to turn it back over to the operator and open the lines for questions."

We would remeasure the plan at the end of the year. So the liability that shows on the balance sheet has been impacted by the very low interest rates that hit at the end of the June, which was a combination of all kinds of things going on, on the globe. So a couple of things will happen. One is we'll have 0.5 year of asset performance, we'll have the contributions that go in, and we'll also remeasure the plan depending upon how interest rates move from June 30 for International Paper to the end of the year. So yes, you're thinking about it correctly."

As I said, the last couple of calls, what we're trying to do with that business is improve it from a cost profile standpoint, redesigning the way we're organized from a people standpoint and redesigning the way that we make and supply the containerboard to our box plants, and then be as strong as we can and perform where we think we can perform in a positive economy versus a minus 4%. That business has the potential to perform much better at a plus 4%, and being able to cover inflation with some degree of pricing versus a minus 4% market and being behind the inflation wheel. So what we're trying to do is change the cost structure, make sure we continue to focus on the customers we have even though everybody in almost every segment is hurting right now, and be well positioned when Brazil's economy begins to pick up. That's what we can control, and we're being very careful with any investments and really trying to do what I would say is fundamental basic blocking and tackling on the commercial side and on the operational side. On the Paper business, we continue to perform very well in that business. Part of it is because it fits squarely into being. If you're going to make uncoated free sheet and be a global provider, that is the place to make it. And it starts with the fiber cost structure and our fiber availability. So given our export position and given the fact that the paper market in Brazil hasn't been hit as much as some of the consumer product markets that hit the box business, we're continuing to perform well. And this is part of the same story, is getting our cost even lower and making sure that we go out the extra mile to take care of our customers both in Brazil and outside of Brazil. And we still have some of the strongest EBITDA margins in all of IP in our Brazil Paper business."

Thank you for joining our call, and thank you for your interest in International Paper. 
I'm going to start on Slide 5. International Paper delivered a strong second quarter with solid contributions from our key businesses across our enterprise, resulting in an EBITDA margin of 17.6%, which is 50 basis points higher than the second quarter of 2015. Free cash flow for the quarter was strong at $527 million. Operations performed well, and a heavy quarter of maintenance outages was executed very effectively. The recently converted machine at the Riegelwood mill is running well and on schedule with our expectations. 
On the portfolio front, we completed the sale of the Asia box business and closed on the purchase of the Madrid mill. We have an agreement with Holmen to produce newsprint, which enables sell until we start the recycled containerboard conversion in mid-2017. We expect the converted mill to be up and running in the fourth quarter of 2017. 
And in early May, we announced that we reached an agreement with Weyerhaeuser to buy their pulp business, and we expect to close on that transaction in the fourth quarter. 
I'm pleased to report that we successfully completed the lump sum buyout program for our term-vested employees in the IP pension plan, which we initiated to further derisk the plan consistent with our balance sheet strategy. 
Finally, the Ilim joint venture delivered another solid quarter of performance, and International Paper received a $58 million dividend in the quarter. 
Turning to Slide 6 and speaking a little more specifically to the financial results for the quarter. Revenue was down year-over-year, primarily due to the sale of the Sun joint venture in China and the sale of our Carolina brand of coated bristols last year. EPS of $0.92 represented strong performance coming off a solid first quarter. 
And as you can see in the chart on the right, return on invested capital for the first half of 2016 was solidly above our cost of capital at 10.6%. This is an important metric that we watch very closely because it's a good indicator of whether IP is creating value for our shareholders over time. When we run our businesses well and when we deploy capital in a value-creating way, we see this metric improve. We've had 6 consecutive years above our cost of capital, and we've been on an upward improvement trend for several years. 
All in all, I'm pleased with our performance in the quarter and the first half of 2016. 
And with that introduction, I'm going to turn it over to Carol Roberts to cover the business highlights and the outlook for the third quarter."
61036,370166205,1016468,"International Paper Company, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2016",2016-07-28,"Earnings Calls","International Paper Company","Executives","Thanks, Mark, and good morning. As Mark mentioned, IP delivered a strong quarter at $0.92 EPS, driven by seasonally stronger volume and good operational performance. Prices were lower as expected, and I'll put some color on this as we get into the vario",1175,"Thanks, Mark, and good morning. 
As Mark mentioned, IP delivered a strong quarter at $0.92 EPS, driven by seasonally stronger volume and good operational performance. Prices were lower as expected, and I'll put some color on this as we get into the various business segments. We successfully executed a heavy outage quarter that was slightly lower than the first quarter due to less downtime from the mill conversion project at Riegelwood. And results for the Ilim JV were slightly lower than the first quarter, mainly due to planned maintenance outages in the quarter and some modest cost inflation. 
Turning to the businesses, and beginning with Industrial Packaging. The business had another strong quarter driven by seasonally stronger volume, good operational performance and some benefits from input costs. These were partially offset by lower containerboard export prices and lower box prices due to the impact of the January containerboard index change, contract renewal and a slightly favorable -- less favorable mix. Maintenance outage expenses were higher as well. The North American system took 85,000 tons of economic downtime in the quarter to match our supply with our demand. 
Turning to Slide 9. I want to highlight some of the key levers we have within IP's North American Industrial Packaging business that enable us to build upon what is already a great business and make it even better. 
Our sales teams and designers are working with our customers every day to redesign packaging, leverage innovation and find ways to take cost out. IP has a low-cost, world-class mill system, along with a vast box and specialty plant footprint with a diverse range of capabilities. And that footprint serves thousands of customers across every consumer segment. We are always working to improve our portfolio of business and grow with the highest value customers, and we have a portfolio of customers and products second to none in the industry. 
On the manufacturing and supply chain front, our teams are using the most advanced tools and techniques to drive efficiency, improvement and cost reduction. And this, of course, positively impacts our margin. 
As Mark mentioned, we're committed to a disciplined and targeted capital investment program in the right places to maintain and improve this world-class system. For example, over the last few years, we have implemented a couple hundred million dollars of cost-reduction projects in the areas of consumption reduction that have IRRs greater than 25%. We continue to have a robust pipeline of these types of opportunities across our broad network. As I said, lots of levers that have contributed to our success, and we'll continue to do so as we move forward. 
Slide 10, moving now to Consumer Packaging. The business experienced a much improved quarter driven by good operations, effective cost management and the lack of maintenance outages. Prices were slightly lower on folding carton and plate stock, but this was fully offset by a more favorable mix. Within this segment, our food service business benefited from increased volume as we moved through the summer cold cup season. 
In Printing Papers, earnings improved due to lower outage cost associated with the Riegelwood mill conversion, partly offset by a less favorable product mix and lower pulp prices. The negative $11 million in the price mix bucket is fully attributable to the less favorable mix associated with the ramp-up and qualification of the duly converted machine in Riegelwood. Paper volume was higher in Europe and Brazil, and it's also worth noting that the significantly lower outage expense in pulp was partially offset by higher planned maintenance outage expense across the remaining Paper business. 
Turning now to Ilim. The JV turned in another solid quarter of performance with volumes up almost 5% year-over-year. The JV had planned maintenance outages at 2 of the mills, which negatively impacted earnings. FX was generally stable throughout the quarter. And as Mark mentioned, IP received a dividend of $58 million during the quarter. The outlook for IP equity earnings for the third quarter is generally in line with the quarter just completed, but I would note that there was a positive gain of $0.01 on FX related to the JVs U.S.-denominated debt in the second quarter that we assume will not repeat in the third quarter. 
Turning to Slide 13. Before I move on to the outlook, I'd like to give an update on actions we've taken or are planning to take around continued prudent management of IP's pension plan. As we previously disclosed in the first quarter 10-Q, we offered a voluntary pension buyout for term-vested former employees. We completed the program and made the associated payments in the second quarter. We paid a total of $1.2 billion to approximately 25,000 former employees out-of-plan assets, settling the corresponding liability in keeping with our strategy to take risk off the table. A requirement of settling a liability of this magnitude resulted in IP taking a noncash settlement charge of $439 million or $270 million after tax for unamortized actuarial losses, which impacted our non-operating pension expense for the quarter. Additionally, we elected to make a voluntary contribution of $250 million to the plan in the second quarter, and we plan to make additional contributions of $500 million by the end of the year. 
Based on our analysis, we believe these contributions make good sense in light of the tax benefits as well as the fee savings and is consistent with our strategy of derisking the plan over time and managing our balance sheet. 
So on Slide 14, moving to the third quarter outlook. Volume is expected to be mostly stable across the businesses, with the exception of EMEA Packaging, which will be lower due to normal seasonality in Morocco. 
Price for the quarter is expected to be lower in North American Industrial Packaging due to the flow-through effect of the January PPW index change. This will negatively affect earnings by about $10 million. To a slightly lesser extent, earnings are expected to also be impacted by a less favorable mix in the Pulp business as the majority of the tons coming off the new capacity at Riegelwood during ramp-up will be market softwood rolls. All other pricing should be largely stable. 
Operations are expected to continue to perform well. And input costs, particularly energy and OCC in North America, are expected to be higher in the third quarter by roughly $35 million. Maintenance outage expenses are forecasted to be lower by about $60 million. IP equity earnings from the Ilim JV are expected to be relatively flat, assuming a stable FX. With this assumption, there would be a nonrepeat of the favorable $0.01 gain from FX on the JV's U.S.-denominated debt in the prior quarter. And as you can see, there are a few other minor items noted on the chart. 
I would also note that several of the trends we are seeing as we move into the third quarter, such as input costs, are likely to impact the fourth quarter as well. 
So with that, let me turn it back over to Mark."

So before I wrap things up, I wanted to take a moment to touch on the strategic opportunity we announced during the quarter, that IP has reached an agreement to acquire the assets of Weyerhaeuser's Pulp business. 
When we complete the transaction, International Paper will be a premier global producer of fluff pulp with a strong position in North America and the ability to serve growing global markets. This strategic combination will also provide us with a talented team and superior research and development capabilities, including a valuable patent portfolio that will enable IP to better serve customers and make our combined businesses more competitive and more profitable. The valuation around the acquisition is very compelling and offers an attractive all-in multiple, along with solid double-digit financial returns through real and significant synergies and low integration risk. 
Again, we're very pleased with this acquisition and the integration opportunity ahead of us, and look forward to strengthening this business and the rest of International Paper. 
Moving to Slide 16. I want to briefly come back to the bigger picture for International Paper as we've evolved over the last 18 months or so. Our strategy is to produce fiber-based packaging, pulp and paper where we have advantaged production positions and we serve advantaged markets. When we choose the right products, make them in the right places and serve the right markets and the right customers, and when we execute very effectively, we generate the greatest value for customers and our shareholders. Looking at the recent decisions we've made, I believe our actions in Asia, the improvement in our North American Industrial Packaging business, the investment in European packaging and the opportunity with our Riegelwood mill conversion and the purchase of Weyerhaeuser's Fluff Pulp business are all consistent with this strategy. 
So in closing, I'm encouraged by how International Paper continues to consistently perform in a challenging and changing global environment. Our focus is squarely on execution, from working closely with our customers to deliver superior value, to running and improving our operations, to driving cost out of our system and supply chain, all to maintain and improve margins as you've seen IP do over the last several years. 
Our financial discipline is evident from our constant vigilance to maintain a strong balance sheet to the [indiscernible] capital allocation. 
We're committed to strengthening our portfolio businesses and to increase the value of the company and ensure an attractive future for IP and our shareholders. 
And finally, we remain intensely focused on strong free cash flow generation and delivering returns well above our cost of capital to drive shareholder value. 
With that, I'd like to turn it back over to the operator and open the lines for questions."

We would remeasure the plan at the end of the year. So the liability that shows on the balance sheet has been impacted by the very low interest rates that hit at the end of the June, which was a combination of all kinds of things going on, on the globe. So a couple of things will happen. One is we'll have 0.5 year of asset performance, we'll have the contributions that go in, and we'll also remeasure the plan depending upon how interest rates move from June 30 for International Paper to the end of the year. So yes, you're thinking about it correctly."

As I said, the last couple of calls, what we're trying to do with that business is improve it from a cost profile standpoint, redesigning the way we're organized from a people standpoint and redesigning the way that we make and supply the containerboard to our box plants, and then be as strong as we can and perform where we think we can perform in a positive economy versus a minus 4%. That business has the potential to perform much better at a plus 4%, and being able to cover inflation with some degree of pricing versus a minus 4% market and being behind the inflation wheel. So what we're trying to do is change the cost structure, make sure we continue to focus on the customers we have even though everybody in almost every segment is hurting right now, and be well positioned when Brazil's economy begins to pick up. That's what we can control, and we're being very careful with any investments and really trying to do what I would say is fundamental basic blocking and tackling on the commercial side and on the operational side. On the Paper business, we continue to perform very well in that business. Part of it is because it fits squarely into being. If you're going to make uncoated free sheet and be a global provider, that is the place to make it. And it starts with the fiber cost structure and our fiber availability. So given our export position and given the fact that the paper market in Brazil hasn't been hit as much as some of the consumer product markets that hit the box business, we're continuing to perform well. And this is part of the same story, is getting our cost even lower and making sure that we go out the extra mile to take care of our customers both in Brazil and outside of Brazil. And we still have some of the strongest EBITDA margins in all of IP in our Brazil Paper business."

Part of it's the tax advantage way of doing it. The other thing we always consider is we're always looking out and thinking about, will we have a regret factor long term? And we never want to have too much where we put money and that we say, ""Geez, why did we do that?"" So it's a balancing act based upon options. So I think what you're seeing us do is, right now, this is what makes sense for us given the point we are relative to our overall debt profile.

Thank you for joining us this morning to review our third quarter results and our fourth quarter outlook. I'm going to start on Slide 5. 
International Paper delivered an overall solid performance in the third quarter, beginning with strong free cash flow of $575 million. Results in our North American Industrial Packaging business were significantly affected by rising input costs, which negatively impacted earnings by $36 million quarter-over-quarter, along with a slightly less favorable mix and modest price erosion which squeezed our margins a bit. We announced, and are in the process of implementing, a domestic containerboard price increase, as well as a corresponding U.S. box price increase. 
We continue to see improved the market demand across both our North American box business and our global pulp business. We experienced strong operational performances across our North American, EMEA and Brazil papers business as well as continuing strong performance in our Ilim joint venture in Russia. Also during the quarter, our Board of Directors approved a 5% increase to our annual dividend in our October meeting moving it to a $1.85 per share. This marks the fifth consecutive year of a dividend increase since we established our dividend policy in 2012 when the dividend was $1.05 per share. This reinforces our confidence in the strength and sustainability of our free cash flow and our commitment to return a meaningful portion of our cash generation to our shareholders. 
Relative to the portfolio, we continue to actively work toward being prepared to close the acquisition of Weyerhaeuser's pulp business in the fourth quarter. We received the European Union's approval last week and we received Brazil's approval just this week, but we still await a few others that we hope to receive shortly. Also we've made the [ph] decision not to pursue a potential expansion into containerboard in India, and as a consequence, we wrote off a modest investment we had made in land and engineering for our potential site. 
Continuing with our financial results on Slide 6. You can see the various key metrics in the table on the slide and I'll remind you of just a couple of points. The year-over-year revenue decline is primarily due to the divestitures of our Sun joint venture and our box business in China as well as the sale of our coated bristols business in North America. As you can see on the slide, IP continues to deliver strong margins in varying economic conditions at 17.6% for the third quarter. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Carol and return at the end to wrap up and move it to question and answers. Thank you. Carol?"

Taking a look at the bridge from the second to third quarter, you can see that our EPS performance was generally flat. As Mark mentioned, we encountered meaningful input cost inflation in the quarter primarily on",1681,"Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Taking a look at the bridge from the second to third quarter, you can see that our EPS performance was generally flat. As Mark mentioned, we encountered meaningful input cost inflation in the quarter primarily on OCC and natural gas. Additionally, we experienced a less favorable box mix along with modest price erosion, predominantly in our North American Industrial Packaging business. These items offset the benefit of lower planned maintenance outage expense of $0.10 as well as a lower tax rate in the quarter, which was driven by our mix of earnings as well as some one-time discrete items. 
Moving to the businesses. Results in the Industrial Packaging segment were negatively impacted by rising input costs and less favorable mix, price erosion and some operational and cost issues, all of which were more than offset -- or more than offset the benefit of lower planned maintenance outage expense. 
Relative to price and mix, IP experienced a less favorable box mix in the third quarter. Additionally, box prices were down $5 per ton due to the flow-through from the January index change, along with modest price erosion. And also worth noting, the average price for our containerboard exports was lower on average in the third quarter as prices stabilized around the exit rate from the second quarter. 
The negative impact of volume in the quarter was attributable to the seasonally lower volume in EMEA associated with our Moroccan box business. 
In operations and cost, we had a couple of isolated issues at 2 mills, which have now been resolved, and we also absorbed extra cost in the quarter due to additional overtime that we incurred in our box system to satisfy increased demand. 
Turning to Slide 9 and continuing on the theme of increased demand, our box business saw a favorable demand trend throughout the quarter with volume up 1.2% year-over-year. The increased demand was driven by favorable trends across IP's key segments highlighted on the slide. 
We continue to see robust year-over-year growth in online retail and distribution, which is a meaningful segment for our business. 
IP's customers within the processed food segment have leveled out and are showing some growth as consumer trends continue to shift to healthier product offering and our customers enhanced their offering by providing new products to satisfy these needs. 
Increased production and consumption of beef and pork are driving growth in the protein segment, and favorable weather and crop conditions have fueled strong demand in the produce segment. 
It is our view at IP that the improving box market we are seeing is not an anomaly. Even though GDP's been below expectations in 2016, the consumer segments within GDP have been some of the strongest, and at the end of the day, it's consumer activity that drives the majority of box demand. 
Turning to Consumer Packaging on Slide 10. This segment delivered another solid performance coming off a robust second quarter. Price and mix were modestly impacted by a less favorable mix of folding cup [ph] business, along with some slight erosion.  Operations performed well overall but were impacted by several minor cost items in the quarter, including FX in EMEA and other miscellaneous onetime items in the U.S. 
Moving to the Printing Papers segment, results across the global businesses were strong, partially offset by another transitional quarter for the pulp business.  Papers had a strong operational quarter, particularly in North America. Overall results for this segment were negatively impacted by a strike and other downtime we experienced in India, which unfavorably impacted results by about $5 million in the quarter. 
Relative to price and mix for North America, mix was slightly negative and pricing was flat to slightly positive. We experienced some lower prices in Europe and on our Latin American exports out of Brazil.  Overall, pulp business results declined by $15 million quarter-over-quarter, almost half of which was attributable to higher outage cost in the third quarter.  And finally, results were favorably impacted by $6 million due to FX benefits mostly in Brazil. 
Turning to Ilim. The JV delivered another strong quarter with operational EBITDA of $168 million, which translated to IP equity earnings of $46 million. Relatively stable FX throughout the quarter resulted in a slight favorable gain for the quarter. Looking ahead, the JV expects seasonally higher volume to be more than offset by seasonally higher wood cost for the fourth quarter. 
Turning to Slide 13 and moving to an update on recent financing and capital allocation actions we've taken. Early in the third quarter, we completed a debt issuance of $2.3 billion to fund our acquisition of Weyerhaeuser's pulp business as well as the voluntary pension contributions that we spoke about on our last call. Additionally, as Mark mentioned in the opening, earlier this month, IP's Board of Directors authorized an increase to the company's annual dividend of 5% to $1.85 per share, which marked the fifth consecutive annual increase to the dividend. This is another meaningful move consistent with our policy of keeping the dividend in the range of 40% to 50% of our free cash flow and speaks to our continued confidence in the sustainability of our cash generation as we look forward. 
Before I move to the outlook, let me recap how we continue to think about capital allocation. It starts with cash from operations, and we think about how we can best leverage every dollar. Beginning with capital spending, you've seen us be flexible in terms of how we think about capital: Balancing the ongoing need to maintain a world-class fleet with the realities of the marketplace and what we choose to or can afford to spend in any given year. We also continue to have a healthy pipeline of high return cost-reduction projects that we fund at an appropriate level on this basis. From there, we think about the need to utilize and maintain a strong and healthy balance sheet, with appropriate leverage and credit rating to give us financial strength and flexibility over time. This includes the need to continue to proactively manage our pension plan, as you've seen, given the various moves we've made over the last several years.  We are absolutely committed to returning a substantial portion of our cash to shareowners, as evidenced by the significant and consistent moves we've made to increase our dividend to a very meaningful level. Additionally, we supplemented this cash to shareholders with opportunistic share repurchases and we'll continue to thoughtfully utilize this option in the future. 
While we're doing all of these, we continue to look for select, value-creating investment opportunities which fit our advantaged position and advantaged markets strategy. These may come in the form of M&A like the Weyerhaeuser pulp acquisition, or could be more modest bolt-on types of opportunities like the Madrid mill, [ph] Riegelwood and our projects within North American Industrial Packaging. Bottom line, we continue to feel that a relentless focus on strong cash generation and a balanced approach to capital allocation is the right strategy for IP to create long-term value for our shareholders. 
So moving to the fourth quarter outlook. I'll cover the details around the typical seasonal impacts that we see as we move from the third to the fourth quarter, but additionally we have a couple of onetime nonrecurring items that are expected to impact results for the quarter as well. 
So starting at the top. We expect daily demand to remain strong. However, volume will be lower due to 4 less shipping days in our North American Corrugated Packaging business. This is expected to negatively impact North American packaging business results by about $50 million. We expect seasonally stronger volume in the Brazil paper's business, along with seasonal demand improvement in EMEA Packaging. 
Relative to price and mix, due to the implementation of the North American containerboard and box price increases, we expect favorable impact in the fourth quarter to be about $20 million. 
Relative to the North American pulp business, we expect unfavorable impact of about $10 million as we continue to supply additional tons of softwood market pulp into less than favorable market conditions as we work towards qualifying and supplying more fluff pulp out of the new capacity at Riegelwood. Additionally, we expect to see benefits of recently announced and implemented price increases in Brazil papers in the quarter. 
Moving to operations and other. We experienced disruptions with Hurricane Matthew in October that unfavorably affected our North American businesses where we have primary mills and significant business on the East Coast. 
In our North American papers and pulp business, this, along with other normal [ph] fourth quarter seasonal cost impacts, are expected to unfavorably impact results by $25 million. 
In our North American Industrial Packaging business, we will also see the impact of Hurricane Matthew on our results. Additionally, we expect to incur a noncash charge associated with inventory revaluation due to our LIFO accounting convention related to the North American containerboard price increase. These items are expected to unfavorably impact results by $35 million. 
So as you think about the fourth quarter, the all-in impact of the onetime items I just covered above, including Hurricane Matthew and the noncash inventory charge in North American Industrial Packaging, is roughly $45 million that will not repeat after the fourth quarter. 
Moving to input costs on top of the impact we saw on the third quarter, we expect to see additional energy cost in North America as well as inflationary pressure on inputs in our EMEA business. We expect the unfavorable impact across our North American businesses to be about $12 million and about $6 million in Europe. 
Maintenance outage expenses are expected to increase slightly by $7 million. We expect Ilim results to be slightly less favorable due to lower operational EBITDA, along with the non-repeat of the favorable $0.01 FX impact from Q3. And finally, we do expect some modest impacts from the other items, as we've noted at the bottom of the slide. 
So with -- now, let me turn it back over to Mark."

In closing, International Paper continues to deliver solid performance in a global environment that presents plenty of challenges. As Carol mentioned, we remain highly focus on cash generation and we're on track for another very strong year",256,"Thanks, Carol. In closing, International Paper continues to deliver solid performance in a global environment that presents plenty of challenges. As Carol mentioned, we remain highly focus on cash generation and we're on track for another very strong year. We also remain focused on return on invested capital and are delivering another year of strong returns solidly above 10%, which is well above our cost of capital. 
As I think about where we are, how we expect to finish the year and what next year looks like, we are seeing some near-term margin squeeze across many of our businesses as some price erosion has occurred while input costs have turned up. The good news is we continue to execute well and our margins remain strong overall. We also have some upside ahead, particularly in the North American Industrial Packaging business with the price increases which are underway. In addition to that, while market fundamentals for our global pulp business may remain challenged for a while, the Weyerhaeuser pulp acquisition provides real and significant synergy opportunities that we can begin to bring to the bottom line as soon as we close the transaction. And while it's a bit further off [ph] due to the conversion, our newly acquired Madrid mill provides nice upside and earnings for our European box business. 
With our continued focus on cash generation and thoughtful approach to capital allocation, I remain confident in our ability to continue to generate meaningful value for our shareholders. 
And with that, we'll open the floor for questions."

I think box demand -- and it can always change. It's only as good as our forecast. But box demand is playing out more or less the way we have seen it for a while now in the course of 2016. So we always saw it strengthening. Our model was predicting based on economic performance and influence that we were going to strengthen through the second half of the year, and so we're seeing that. It's a little bit better, quite frankly, than we might have thought. But our experience has been pretty good. It's evidenced by the numbers that we posted on demand growth. Back to your first question, I think there's a few things to keep in mind. First of all, we don't see the dynamics around this price increase being any -- materially different than any other price increase we've ever had. If you look at being down $5 in the quarter, I just explained a part of that is mix, but some of it was the publication down, which happened earlier in the year, and then also just normal activity. That normal activity has a lag to it, right? So some of what's showing up in the quarter is stuff that has already happened and now is just materializing. So when we communicated the price increase to our customers, we were looking at the fundamentals that we saw a point in time and then our view of how they were going to look going forward. And if anything, I'd say they turned out to be a little bit stronger than what we originally viewed."

We look at the demand across the regions, and we say, we kind of expect somewhere between 2% and 3.5% so it seems like it's right in the expectations may be on the low side of expectations for growth. For us, it's somewhere between 12% and 15%. It varies. But we look at it as, for our business, what we're doing is responding to what customers are demanding based on their needs. And there's been some changes in trade flows over the course of the past year given the FX volatility. But we see the market is pretty stable and continuing to go up what would be an expected rate."

In simple terms, we run our businesses in a FIFO model, first and first-out, but we keep our corporate book model on a LIFO model, last in, first-out. And so we keep that you call it your LIFO reserve, your LIFO balance we just your contra in the inventor account on the corporate book. And basically you do LIFO because cost go up through time and that's the best way, the best effect to get the outcome for the company. When you have a dramatic shift and for us it's around inventory between our mills and our box plants, we charge our box plants market price so we're going to move that board into our box business at the higher price. But you do last-in, first-out relative to your accounting, so you have the balance that LIFO account. The other thing that comes into play to get that LIFO account balanced by year end. So the timing of this increase coming right at the end of the year calls us to have to balance that account in the quarter. What's most important is noncash. And in LIFO, when you make adjustments to those LIFO balance is noncash. But due to the way we run our business and our accounting convention, that charge hits us in this fourth quarter. So that's my best explanation, and we can always follow-up with more if you feel like you want some more information."

There's a lot of negatives on the non-consumer side, which netted out to 1.4% GDP. So for us, it looks like it squares up pretty well."

Thank you for joining us this morning to review our third quarter results and our fourth quarter outlook. I'm going to start on Slide 5.

Thank you for joining us this morning to review our third quarter results and our fourth quarter outlook. I'm going to start on Slide 5. 
International Paper delivered an overall solid performance in the third quarter, beginning with strong free cash flow of $575 million. Results in our North American Industrial Packaging business were significantly affected by rising input costs, which negatively impacted earnings by $36 million quarter-over-quarter, along with a slightly less favorable mix and modest price erosion which squeezed our margins a bit. We announced, and are in the process of implementing, a domestic containerboard price increase, as well as a corresponding U.S. box price increase. 
We continue to see improved the market demand across both our North American box business and our global pulp business. We experienced strong operational performances across our North American, EMEA and Brazil papers business as well as continuing strong performance in our Ilim joint venture in Russia. Also during the quarter, our Board of Directors approved a 5% increase to our annual dividend in our October meeting moving it to a $1.85 per share. This marks the fifth consecutive year of a dividend increase since we established our dividend policy in 2012 when the dividend was $1.05 per share. This reinforces our confidence in the strength and sustainability of our free cash flow and our commitment to return a meaningful portion of our cash generation to our shareholders. 
Relative to the portfolio, we continue to actively work toward being prepared to close the acquisition of Weyerhaeuser's pulp business in the fourth quarter. We received the European Union's approval last week and we received Brazil's approval just this week, but we still await a few others that we hope to receive shortly. Also we've made the decision not to pursue a potential expansion into containerboard in India, and as a consequence, we wrote off a modest investment we had made in land and engineering for our potential site. 
Continuing with our financial results on Slide 6. You can see the various key metrics in the table on the slide and I'll remind you of just a couple of points. The year-over-year revenue decline is primarily due to the divestitures of our Sun joint venture and our box business in China as well as the sale of our coated bristols business in North America. As you can see on the slide, IP continues to deliver strong margins in varying economic conditions at 17.6% for the third quarter. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Carol and return at the end to wrap up and move it to question and answers. Thank you. Carol?"
61036,403179322,1063405,"International Paper Company, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2016",2016-10-27,"Earnings Calls","International Paper Company","Executives","Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Taking a look at the bridge from the second to third quarter, you can see that our EPS performance was generally flat. As Mark mentioned, we encountered meaningful input cost inflation in the quarter primarily on",1679,"Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Taking a look at the bridge from the second to third quarter, you can see that our EPS performance was generally flat. As Mark mentioned, we encountered meaningful input cost inflation in the quarter primarily on OCC and natural gas. Additionally, we experienced a less favorable box mix along with modest price erosion, predominantly in our North American Industrial Packaging business. These items offset the benefit of lower planned maintenance outage expense of $0.10 as well as a lower tax rate in the quarter, which was driven by our mix of earnings as well as some one-time discrete items. 
Moving to the businesses. Results in the Industrial Packaging segment were negatively impacted by rising input costs and less favorable mix, price erosion and some operational and cost issues, all of which were more than offset -- or more than offset the benefit of lower planned maintenance outage expense. 
Relative to price and mix, IP experienced a less favorable box mix in the third quarter. Additionally, box prices were down $5 per ton due to the flow-through from the January index change, along with modest price erosion. And also worth noting, the average price for our containerboard exports was lower on average in the third quarter as prices stabilized around the exit rate from the second quarter. 
The negative impact of volume in the quarter was attributable to the seasonally lower volume in EMEA associated with our Moroccan box business. 
In operations and cost, we had a couple of isolated issues at 2 mills, which have now been resolved, and we also absorbed extra cost in the quarter due to additional overtime that we incurred in our box system to satisfy increased demand. 
Turning to Slide 9 and continuing on the theme of increased demand, our box business saw a favorable demand trend throughout the quarter with volume up 1.2% year-over-year. The increased demand was driven by favorable trends across IP's key segments highlighted on the slide. 
We continue to see robust year-over-year growth in online retail and distribution, which is a meaningful segment for our business. 
IP's customers within the processed food segment have leveled out and are showing some growth as consumer trends continue to shift to healthier product offering and our customers enhanced their offering by providing new products to satisfy these needs. 
Increased production and consumption of beef and pork are driving growth in the protein segment, and favorable weather and crop conditions have fueled strong demand in the produce segment. 
It is our view at IP that the improving box market we are seeing is not an anomaly. Even though GDP's been below expectations in 2016, the consumer segments within GDP have been some of the strongest, and at the end of the day, it's consumer activity that drives the majority of box demand. 
Turning to Consumer Packaging on Slide 10. This segment delivered another solid performance coming off a robust second quarter. Price and mix were modestly impacted by a less favorable mix of folding to cup business, along with some slight erosion.  Operations performed well overall but were impacted by several minor cost items in the quarter, including FX in EMEA and other miscellaneous onetime items in the U.S. 
Moving to the Printing Papers segment, results across the global businesses were strong, partially offset by another transitional quarter for the pulp business.  Papers had a strong operational quarter, particularly in North America. Overall results for this segment were negatively impacted by a strike and other downtime we experienced in India, which unfavorably impacted results by about $5 million in the quarter. 
Relative to price and mix for North America, mix was slightly negative and pricing was flat to slightly positive. We experienced some lower prices in Europe and on our Latin American exports out of Brazil.  Overall, pulp business results declined by $15 million quarter-over-quarter, almost half of which was attributable to higher outage cost in the third quarter.  And finally, results were favorably impacted by $6 million due to FX benefits mostly in Brazil. 
Turning to Ilim. The JV delivered another strong quarter with operational EBITDA of $168 million, which translated to IP equity earnings of $46 million. Relatively stable FX throughout the quarter resulted in a slight favorable gain for the quarter. Looking ahead, the JV expects seasonally higher volume to be more than offset by seasonally higher wood cost for the fourth quarter. 
Turning to Slide 13 and moving to an update on recent financing and capital allocation actions we've taken. Early in the third quarter, we completed a debt issuance of $2.3 billion to fund our acquisition of Weyerhaeuser's pulp business as well as the voluntary pension contributions that we spoke about on our last call. Additionally, as Mark mentioned in the opening, earlier this month, IP's Board of Directors authorized an increase to the company's annual dividend of 5% to $1.85 per share, which marked the fifth consecutive annual increase to the dividend. This is another meaningful move consistent with our policy of keeping the dividend in the range of 40% to 50% of our free cash flow and speaks to our continued confidence in the sustainability of our cash generation as we look forward. 
Before I move to the outlook, let me recap how we continue to think about capital allocation. It starts with cash from operations, and we think about how we can best leverage every dollar. Beginning with capital spending, you've seen us be flexible in terms of how we think about capital: Balancing the ongoing need to maintain a world-class fleet with the realities of the marketplace and what we choose to or can afford to spend in any given year. We also continue to have a healthy pipeline of high return cost-reduction projects that we fund at an appropriate level on this basis. From there, we think about the need to utilize and maintain a strong and healthy balance sheet, with appropriate leverage and credit rating to give us financial strength and flexibility over time. This includes the need to continue to proactively manage our pension plan, as you've seen, given the various moves we've made over the last several years.  We are absolutely committed to returning a substantial portion of our cash to shareowners, as evidenced by the significant and consistent moves we've made to increase our dividend to a very meaningful level. Additionally, we supplemented this cash to shareholders with opportunistic share repurchases and we'll continue to thoughtfully utilize this option in the future. 
While we're doing all of these, we continue to look for select, value-creating investment opportunities which fit our advantaged position and advantaged markets strategy. These may come in the form of M&A like the Weyerhaeuser pulp acquisition, or could be more modest bolt-on types of opportunities like the Madrid mill, Riegelwood and our projects within North American Industrial Packaging. Bottom line, we continue to feel that a relentless focus on strong cash generation and a balanced approach to capital allocation is the right strategy for IP to create long-term value for our shareholders. 
So moving to the fourth quarter outlook. I'll cover the details around the typical seasonal impacts that we see as we move from the third to the fourth quarter, but additionally we have a couple of onetime nonrecurring items that are expected to impact results for the quarter as well. 
So starting at the top. We expect daily demand to remain strong. However, volume will be lower due to 4 less shipping days in our North American Corrugated Packaging business. This is expected to negatively impact North American packaging business results by about $50 million. We expect seasonally stronger volume in the Brazil paper's business, along with seasonal demand improvement in EMEA Packaging. 
Relative to price and mix, due to the implementation of the North American containerboard and box price increases, we expect favorable impact in the fourth quarter to be about $20 million. 
Relative to the North American pulp business, we expect unfavorable impact of about $10 million as we continue to supply additional tons of softwood market pulp into less than favorable market conditions as we work towards qualifying and supplying more fluff pulp out of the new capacity at Riegelwood. Additionally, we expect to see benefits of recently announced and implemented price increases in Brazil papers in the quarter. 
Moving to operations and other. We experienced disruptions with Hurricane Matthew in October that unfavorably affected our North American businesses where we have primary mills and significant business on the East Coast. 
In our North American papers and pulp business, this, along with other normal fourth quarter seasonal cost impacts, are expected to unfavorably impact results by $25 million. 
In our North American Industrial Packaging business, we will also see the impact of Hurricane Matthew on our results. Additionally, we expect to incur a noncash charge associated with inventory revaluation due to our LIFO accounting convention related to the North American containerboard price increase. These items are expected to unfavorably impact results by $35 million. 
So as you think about the fourth quarter, the all-in impact of the onetime items I just covered above, including Hurricane Matthew and the noncash inventory charge in North American Industrial Packaging, is roughly $45 million that will not repeat after the fourth quarter. 
Moving to input costs on top of the impact we saw on the third quarter, we expect to see additional energy cost in North America as well as inflationary pressure on inputs in our EMEA business. We expect the unfavorable impact across our North American businesses to be about $12 million and about $6 million in Europe. 
Maintenance outage expenses are expected to increase slightly by $7 million. We expect Ilim results to be slightly less favorable due to lower operational EBITDA, along with the non-repeat of the favorable $0.01 FX impact from Q3. And finally, we do expect some modest impacts from the other items, as we've noted at the bottom of the slide. 
So with -- now, let me turn it back over to Mark."

In closing, International Paper continues to deliver solid performance in a global environment that presents plenty of challenges. As Carol mentioned, we remain highly focus on cash generation and we're on track for another very strong year",255,"Thanks, Carol. In closing, International Paper continues to deliver solid performance in a global environment that presents plenty of challenges. As Carol mentioned, we remain highly focus on cash generation and we're on track for another very strong year. We also remain focused on return on invested capital and are delivering another year of strong returns solidly above 10%, which is well above our cost of capital. 
As I think about where we are, how we expect to finish the year and what next year looks like, we are seeing some near-term margin squeeze across many of our businesses as some price erosion has occurred while input costs have turned up. The good news is we continue to execute well and our margins remain strong overall. We also have some upside ahead, particularly in the North American Industrial Packaging business with the price increases which are underway. In addition to that, while market fundamentals for our global pulp business may remain challenged for a while, the Weyerhaeuser pulp acquisition provides real and significant synergy opportunities that we can begin to bring to the bottom line as soon as we close the transaction. And while it's a bit further off due to the conversion, our newly acquired Madrid mill provides nice upside and earnings for our European box business. 
With our continued focus on cash generation and thoughtful approach to capital allocation, I remain confident in our ability to continue to generate meaningful value for our shareholders. 
And with that, we'll open the floor for questions."

So in the interim, in order to run the machine and make the fluff trials, we make regular market softwood. And obviously, pricing has been a little bit depressed. Demand is good. It's -- global softwood's up 4%, but we're selling in -- the market pulp into a lower-priced environment. So as we get our specialty pulp, fluff and other grades qualified, the mix on the asset will move up dramatically over time.

Let's take the last question first, George. I think box demand -- and it can always change. It's only as good as our forecast.

I think box demand -- and it can always change. It's only as good as our forecast. But box demand is playing out more or less the way we have seen it for a while now in the course of 2016. So we always saw it strengthening. Our model was predicting based on economic performance and influence that we were going to strengthen through the second half of the year, and so we're seeing that. It's a little bit better, quite frankly, than we might have thought. But our experience has been pretty good. It's evidenced by the numbers that we posted on demand growth. Back to your first question, I think there's a few things to keep in mind. First of all, we don't see the dynamics around this price increase being any -- materially different than any other price increase we've ever had. If you look at being down $5 in the quarter, I just explained a part of that is mix, but some of it was the publication down, which happened earlier in the year, and then also just normal activity. That normal activity has a lag to it, right? So some of what's showing up in the quarter is stuff that has already happened and now is just materializing. So when we communicated the price increase to our customers, we were looking at the fundamentals that we saw a point in time and then our view of how they were going to look going forward. And if anything, I'd say they turned out to be a little bit stronger than what we originally viewed."

In simple terms, we run our businesses in a FIFO model, first in, first out; but we keep our corporate books on a LIFO model, last in, first out. And so we keep that, you call it your LIFO reserve, your LIFO balance, which is your contra-inventory account on the corporate books. And basically, you do LIFO because cost go up through time and that's the best way, the best effect to get the outcome for the company. When you have a dramatic shift, and for us it's around inventory between our mills and our box plants, we charge our box plants market price. So we're going to move that board into our box business at the higher price. But you do last in, first out relative to your accounting, so you have to balance that LIFO account. The other thing that comes into play is you got to get that LIFO account balanced by year end. So the timing of this increase coming right at the end of the year causes us to have to balance that account in the quarter. What's most important is noncash. And in LIFO, when you make adjustments to those LIFO balance is it's noncash. But due to the way we run our business and our accounting conventions, that charge hits us in this fourth quarter. So that's my best explanation, and we can always follow-up with more if you feel like you want some more information."

We think that nondurable production is, in part, a good proxy for box demand, but it's not always, in the moment, lined up exactly the same way. There's been period where box demand has outperformed nondurables and vice versa. And there's other components of economic activity that actually influence box demand. Some of our demand trends have been the things I mentioned earlier, where protein's starting to come back off some depressed levels for the past couple of years. Distribution and online retail continues to grow for us quite well. And processed food has actually been pretty good for us. You have to remember, a year or 2 ago, the shrinking at 3% doesn't feel like it's doing that anymore. So it's not stellar growth, but it's not performing as bad as it has in prior periods. So I think that based on the way we look at how box demand gets driven, it's performing the way we would expect it to in the moment."

Even if they're trading out of a consumer good into a fresh good or other segments, with a consumer component of GDP at 2.8%, it's pretty squared with our mind around why box demand is at a 1.5%. There was a lot of negatives on the non-consumer side, which netted out a 1.4% GDP. So for us, it looks like it squares up pretty well."

Thank you for joining us this morning to review our third quarter results and our fourth quarter outlook. I'm going to start on Slide 5. International Paper delivered an overall solid performance in the third qua",444,"Thanks, Jay, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us this morning to review our third quarter results and our fourth quarter outlook. 
I'm going to start on Slide 5. International Paper delivered an overall solid performance in the third quarter, beginning with strong free cash flow of $575 million. Results in our North American Industrial Packaging business were significantly affected by rising input cost, which negatively impacted earnings by $36 million quarter-over-quarter, along with a slightly less favorable mix and modest price erosion which squeezed our margins a bit. We announced, and are in the process of implementing, a domestic containerboard price increase, as well as a corresponding U.S. box price increase. 
We continue to see improved market demand across both our North American box business and our global pulp business. We experienced strong operational performances across our North American, EMEA and Brazil papers business as well as continuing strong performance in our Ilim joint venture in Russia. 
Also during the quarter, our Board of Directors approved a 5% increase to our annual dividend in our October meeting moving it to a $1.85 per share. This marks the fifth consecutive year of a dividend increase since we established our dividend policy in 2012 when the dividend was $1.05 per share. This reinforces our confidence in the strength and sustainability of our free cash flow and our commitment to return a meaningful portion of our cash generation to our shareholders. 
Relative to the portfolio, we continue to actively work toward being prepared to close the acquisition of Weyerhaeuser's pulp business in the fourth quarter. We received the European Union's approval last week and we received Brazil's approval just this week, but we still await a few others that we hope to receive shortly. Also, we've made the decision not to pursue a potential expansion into containerboard in India, and as a consequence, we wrote off a modest investment we had made in land and engineering for our potential site. 
Continuing with our financial results on Slide 6. You can see the various key metrics in the table on the slide and I'll remind you of just a couple of points. The year-over-year revenue decline is primarily due to the divestitures of our Sun joint venture and our box business in China as well as the sale of our coated bristols business in North America. As you can see on the slide, IP continues to deliver strong margins in varying economic conditions at 17.6% for the third quarter. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Carol and return at the end to wrap up and move it to question and answers. Thank you. Carol?"
61036,403179322,1063723,"International Paper Company, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2016",2016-10-27,"Earnings Calls","International Paper Company","Executives","Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Taking a look at the bridge from the second to third quarter, you can see that our EPS performance was generally flat. As Mark mentioned, we encountered meaningful input cost inflation in the quarter primarily on",1678,"Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Taking a look at the bridge from the second to third quarter, you can see that our EPS performance was generally flat. As Mark mentioned, we encountered meaningful input cost inflation in the quarter primarily on OCC and natural gas. Additionally, we experienced a less favorable box mix along with modest price erosion, predominantly in our North American Industrial Packaging business. These items offset the benefit of lower planned maintenance outage expense of $0.10 as well as a lower tax rate in the quarter, which was driven by our mix of earnings as well as some onetime discrete items. 
Moving to the businesses. Results in the Industrial Packaging segment were negatively impacted by rising input costs and less favorable mix, price erosion and some operational and cost issues, all of which were more than offset -- or more than offset the benefit of lower planned maintenance outage expense. 
Relative to price and mix, IP experienced a less favorable box mix in the third quarter. Additionally, box prices were down $5 per ton due to the flow-through from the January index change, along with modest price erosion. And also worth noting, the average price for our containerboard exports was lower on average in the third quarter as prices stabilized around the exit rate from the second quarter. 
The negative impact of volume in the quarter was attributable to the seasonally lower volume in EMEA associated with our Moroccan box business. 
In operations and costs, we had a couple of isolated issues at 2 mills, which have now been resolved, and we also absorbed extra cost in the quarter due to additional overtime that we incurred in our box system to satisfy increased demand. 
Turning to Slide 9 and continuing on the theme of increased demand, our box business saw a favorable demand trend throughout the quarter, with volume up 1.2% year-over-year. The increased demand was driven by favorable trends across IP's key segments highlighted on the slide. 
We continue to see robust year-over-year growth in online retail and distribution, which is a meaningful segment for our business. 
IP's customers within the processed food segment have leveled out and are showing some growth as consumer trends continue to shift to healthier product offering and our customers enhanced their offering by providing new products to satisfy these needs. 
Increased production and consumption of beef and pork are driving growth in the protein segment, and favorable weather and crop conditions have fueled strong demand in the produce segment. 
It is our view at IP that the improving box market we are seeing is not an anomaly. Even though GDP's been below expectations in 2016, the consumer segments within GDP have been some of the strongest, and at the end of the day, it's consumer activity that drives the majority of box demand. 
Turning to Consumer Packaging on Slide 10. This segment delivered another solid performance coming off a robust second quarter. Price and mix were modestly impacted by a less favorable mix of folding to cup business, along with some slight erosion. Operations performed well overall but were impacted by several minor cost items in the quarter, including FX in EMEA and other miscellaneous onetime items in the U.S. 
Moving to the Printing Papers segment. Results across the global businesses were strong, partially offset by another transitional quarter for the pulp business. Papers had a strong operational quarter, particularly in North America. Overall results for this segment were negatively impacted by a strike and other downtime we experienced in India, which unfavorably impacted results by about $5 million in the quarter. 
Relative to price and mix for North America, mix was slightly negative and pricing was flat to slightly positive. We experienced some lower prices in Europe and on our Latin American exports out of Brazil.  Overall, pulp business results declined by $15 million quarter-over-quarter, almost half of which was attributable to higher outage cost in the third quarter. And finally, results were favorably impacted by $6 million due to FX benefits mostly in Brazil. 
Turning to Ilim. The JV delivered another strong quarter, with operational EBITDA of $168 million, which translated to IP equity earnings of $46 million. Relatively stable FX throughout the quarter resulted in a slight favorable gain for the quarter. Looking ahead, the JV expects seasonally higher volume to be more than offset by seasonally higher wood cost for the fourth quarter. 
Turning to Slide 13, moving to an update on recent financing and capital allocation actions we've taken. Early in the third quarter, we completed a debt issuance of $2.3 billion to fund our acquisition of Weyerhaeuser's pulp business as well as the voluntary pension contributions that we spoke about on our last call. 
Additionally, as Mark mentioned in the opening, earlier this month, IP's Board of Directors authorized an increase to the company's annual dividend of 5% to $1.85 per share, which marked the fifth consecutive annual increase to the dividend. This is another meaningful move consistent with our policy of keeping the dividend in the range of 40% to 50% of our free cash flow and speaks to our continued confidence in the sustainability of our cash generation as we look forward. 
Before I move to the outlook, let me recap how we continue to think about capital allocation. It starts with cash from operations, and we think about how we can best leverage every dollar. Beginning with capital spending, you've seen us be flexible in terms of how we think about capital: Balancing the ongoing need to maintain a world-class fleet with the realities of the marketplace and what we choose to or can afford to spend in any given year. We also continue to have a healthy pipeline of high return cost-reduction projects that we fund at an appropriate level on this basis. 
From there, we think about the need to utilize and maintain a strong and healthy balance sheet, with appropriate leverage and credit rating to give us financial strength and flexibility over time. This includes the need to continue to proactively manage our pension plan, as you've seen, given the various moves we've made over the last several years. 
We are absolutely committed to returning a substantial portion of our cash to shareowners, as evidenced by the significant and consistent moves we've made to increase our dividend to a very meaningful level. Additionally, we supplemented this cash to shareholders with opportunistic share repurchases and we'll continue to thoughtfully utilize this option in the future. 
While we're doing all of this, we continue to look for select, value-creating investment opportunities which fit our advantaged position and advantaged markets strategy. These may come in the form of M&A like the Weyerhaeuser pulp acquisition, or could be more modest bolt-on types of opportunities like the Madrid mill, Riegelwood and our projects within North American Industrial Packaging. Bottom line, we continue to feel that a relentless focus on strong cash generation and a balanced approach to capital allocation is the right strategy for IP to create long-term value for our shareholders. 
So moving to the fourth quarter outlook. I'll cover the details around the typical seasonal impacts that we see as we move from the third to the fourth quarter, but additionally, we have a couple of onetime nonrecurring items that are expected to impact results for the quarter as well. 
So starting at the top. We expect daily demand to remain strong. However, volume will be lower due to 4 less shipping days in our North American Corrugated Packaging business. This is expected to negatively impact North American packaging business results by about $50 million. We expect seasonally stronger volume in the Brazil papers business, along with seasonal demand improvement in EMEA Packaging. 
Relative to price and mix, due to the implementation of the North American containerboard and box price increases, we expect favorable impact in the fourth quarter to be about $20 million. 
Relative to the North American pulp business, we expect unfavorable impact of about $10 million as we continue to supply additional tons of softwood market pulp into less than favorable market conditions as we work towards qualifying and supplying more fluff pulp out of the new capacity at Riegelwood. Additionally, we expect to see benefits of recently announced and implemented price increases in Brazil papers in the quarter. 
Moving to operations and other. We experienced disruptions with Hurricane Matthew in October that unfavorably affected our North American businesses where we have primary mills and significant business on the East Coast. 
In our North American papers and pulp business, this, along with other normal fourth quarter seasonal cost impacts, are expected to unfavorably impact results by $25 million. 
In our North American Industrial Packaging business, we will also see the impact of Hurricane Matthew on our results. Additionally, we expect to incur a noncash charge associated with inventory revaluation due to our LIFO accounting convention related to the North American containerboard price increase. These items are expected to unfavorably impact results by $35 million. 
So as you think about the fourth quarter, the all-in impact of the onetime items I just covered above, including Hurricane Matthew and the noncash inventory charge in North American Industrial Packaging, is roughly $45 million that will not repeat after the fourth quarter. 
Moving to input costs. On top of the impact we saw on the third quarter, we expect to see additional energy cost in North America as well as inflationary pressure on inputs in our EMEA business. We expect the unfavorable impact across our North American businesses to be about $12 million and about $6 million in Europe. 
Maintenance outage expenses are expected to increase slightly by $7 million. We expect Ilim results to be slightly less favorable due to lower operational EBITDA, along with the non-repeat of the favorable $0.01 FX impact from Q3. And finally, we do expect some modest impacts from the other items, as we've noted at the bottom of the slide. 
So with -- now, let me turn it back over to Mark."

In closing, International Paper continues to deliver solid performance in a global environment that presents plenty of challenges. As Carol mentioned, we remain highly focus on cash generation and we're on track for another very strong year",255,"Thanks, Carol. In closing, International Paper continues to deliver solid performance in a global environment that presents plenty of challenges. As Carol mentioned, we remain highly focus on cash generation and we're on track for another very strong year. We also remain focused on return on invested capital and are delivering another year of strong returns solidly above 10%, which is well above our cost of capital. 
As I think about where we are, how we expect to finish the year and what next year looks like, we are seeing some near-term margin squeeze across many of our businesses as some price erosion has occurred while input costs have turned up. The good news is we continue to execute well and our margins remain strong overall. 
We also have some upside ahead, particularly in the North American Industrial Packaging business with the price increases which are underway. 
In addition to that, while market fundamentals for our global pulp business may remain challenged for a while, the Weyerhaeuser pulp acquisition provides real and significant synergy opportunities that we can begin to bring to the bottom line as soon as we close the transaction. 
And while it's a bit further off due to the conversion, our newly acquired Madrid mill provides nice upside and earnings for our European box business. 
With our continued focus on cash generation and thoughtful approach to capital allocation, I remain confident in our ability to continue to generate meaningful value for our shareholders. 
And with that, we'll open the floor for questions."

So in the interim, in order to run the machine and make the fluff trials, we make regular market softwood. And obviously, pricing has been a little bit depressed. Demand is good. It's -- global softwood's up 4%, but we're selling in -- the market pulp into a lower-priced environment. So as we get our specialty pulp, fluff and other grades qualified, the mix on the asset will move up dramatically over time.

Let's take the last question first, George. I think box demand -- and it can always change. It's only as good as our forecast.

I think box demand -- and it can always change. It's only as good as our forecast. But box demand is playing out more or less the way we have seen it for a while now in the course of 2016. So we always saw it strengthening. Our model was predicting based on economic performance and influence that we were going to strengthen through the second half of the year, and so we're seeing that. It's a little bit better, quite frankly, than we might have thought. But our experience has been pretty good. It's evidenced by the numbers that we posted on demand growth. Back to your first question, I think there's a few things to keep in mind. First of all, we don't see the dynamics around this price increase being any -- materially different than any other price increase we've ever had. If you look at being down $5 in the quarter, I just explained a part of that is mix, but some of it was the publication down, which happened earlier in the year, and then also just normal activity. That normal activity has a lag to it, right. So some of what's showing up in the quarter is stuff that has already happened and now it's just materializing. So when we communicated the price increase to our customers, we were looking at the fundamentals that we saw a point in time and then our view of how they were going to look going forward. And if anything, I'd say they turned out to be a little bit stronger than what we originally viewed."

In simple terms, we run our businesses in a FIFO model, first in, first out; but we keep our corporate books on a LIFO model, last in, first out. And so we keep that, you call it your LIFO reserve, your LIFO balance, which is your contra-inventory account on the corporate books. And basically, you do LIFO because costs go up through time and that's the best way, the best effect to get the outcome for the company. When you have a dramatic shift, and for us, it's around the inventory between our mills and our box plants, we charge our box plants market price. So we're going to move that board into our box business at the higher price. But you do last in, first out relative to your accounting, so you have to balance that LIFO account. The other thing that comes into play is you got to get that LIFO account balanced by year-end. So the timing of this increase coming right at the end of the year causes us to have to balance that account in the quarter. What's most important is noncash. And in LIFO, when you make adjustments to those LIFO balances it's noncash. But due to the way we run our business and our accounting conventions, that charge hits us in this fourth quarter. So that's my best explanation, and we can always follow-up with more if you feel like you want some more information."

You have to remember, a year or 2 ago, the shrinking at 3% doesn't feel like it's doing that anymore. So it's not stellar growth, but it's not performing as bad as it has in prior periods. So I think that based on the way we look at how box demand gets driven, it's performing the way we would expect it to in the moment."

Yes, just kind of one of the views we have in addition to the segment discussion Tim had, if you think back to the GDP number for the quarter and you look at the total, it was very modest. But if you look at the components, the consumer section of GDP was up almost 3%. Those are the kinds of activities by the consumer that drive box demand. Even if they're trading out of a consumer good into a fresh good or other segments, with a consumer component of GDP at 2.8%, it's pretty squared with our mind around why box demand is at a 1.5%. There was a lot of negatives on the non-consumer side, which netted out a 1.4% GDP. So for us, it looks like it squares up pretty well."

Thank you for joining us this morning to review our third quarter results and our fourth quarter outlook. I'm going to start on Slide 5.

Thank you for joining us this morning to review our third quarter results and our fourth quarter outlook. 
I'm going to start on Slide 5. International Paper delivered an overall solid performance in the third quarter, beginning with strong free cash flow of $575 million. Results in our North American Industrial Packaging business were significantly affected by rising input cost, which negatively impacted earnings by $36 million quarter-over-quarter, along with a slightly less favorable mix and modest price erosion which squeezed our margins a bit. We announced, and are in the process of implementing, a domestic containerboard price increase, as well as a corresponding U.S. box price increase. 
We continue to see improved market demand across both our North American box business and our global pulp business. We experienced strong operational performances across our North American, EMEA and Brazil papers business as well as continuing strong performance in our Ilim joint venture in Russia. 
Also during the quarter, our Board of Directors approved a 5% increase to our annual dividend in our October meeting moving it to a $1.85 per share. This marks the fifth consecutive year of a dividend increase since we established our dividend policy in 2012 when the dividend was $1.05 per share. This reinforces our confidence in the strength and sustainability of our free cash flow and our commitment to return a meaningful portion of our cash generation to our shareholders. 
Relative to the portfolio, we continue to actively work toward being prepared to close the acquisition of Weyerhaeuser's pulp business in the fourth quarter. We received the European Union's approval last week and we received Brazil's approval just this week, but we still await a few others that we hope to receive shortly. Also, we've made the decision not to pursue a potential expansion into containerboard in India, and as a consequence, we wrote off a modest investment we had made in land and engineering for our potential site. 
Continuing with our financial results on Slide 6. You can see the various key metrics in the table on the slide and I'll remind you of just a couple of points. The year-over-year revenue decline is primarily due to the divestitures of our Sun joint venture and our box business in China as well as the sale of our coated bristols business in North America. As you can see on the slide, IP continues to deliver strong margins in varying economic conditions at 17.6% for the third quarter. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Carol and return at the end to wrap up and move it to question and answers. Thank you. Carol?"
61036,403179322,1064631,"International Paper Company, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2016",2016-10-27,"Earnings Calls","International Paper Company","Executives","Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Taking a look at the bridge from the second to third quarter, you can see that our EPS performance was generally flat. As Mark mentioned, we encountered meaningful input cost inflation in the quarter primarily on",1678,"Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Taking a look at the bridge from the second to third quarter, you can see that our EPS performance was generally flat. As Mark mentioned, we encountered meaningful input cost inflation in the quarter primarily on OCC and natural gas. Additionally, we experienced a less favorable box mix along with modest price erosion, predominantly in our North American Industrial Packaging business. These items offset the benefit of lower planned maintenance outage expense of $0.10 as well as a lower tax rate in the quarter, which was driven by our mix of earnings as well as some onetime discrete items. 
Moving to the businesses. Results in the Industrial Packaging segment were negatively impacted by rising input costs and less favorable mix, price erosion and some operational and cost issues, all of which were more than offset -- or more than offset the benefit of lower planned maintenance outage expense. 
Relative to price and mix, IP experienced a less favorable box mix in the third quarter. Additionally, box prices were down $5 per ton due to the flow-through from the January index change, along with modest price erosion. And also worth noting, the average price for our containerboard exports was lower on average in the third quarter as prices stabilized around the exit rate from the second quarter. 
The negative impact of volume in the quarter was attributable to the seasonally lower volume in EMEA associated with our Moroccan box business. 
In operations and costs, we had a couple of isolated issues at 2 mills, which have now been resolved, and we also absorbed extra cost in the quarter due to additional overtime that we incurred in our box system to satisfy increased demand. 
Turning to Slide 9 and continuing on the theme of increased demand, our box business saw a favorable demand trend throughout the quarter, with volume up 1.2% year-over-year. The increased demand was driven by favorable trends across IP's key segments highlighted on the slide. 
We continue to see robust year-over-year growth in online retail and distribution, which is a meaningful segment for our business. 
IP's customers within the processed food segment have leveled out and are showing some growth as consumer trends continue to shift to healthier product offering and our customers enhanced their offering by providing new products to satisfy these needs. 
Increased production and consumption of beef and pork are driving growth in the protein segment, and favorable weather and crop conditions have fueled strong demand in the produce segment. 
It is our view at IP that the improving box market we are seeing is not an anomaly. Even though GDP's been below expectations in 2016, the consumer segments within GDP have been some of the strongest, and at the end of the day, it's consumer activity that drives the majority of box demand. 
Turning to Consumer Packaging on Slide 10. This segment delivered another solid performance coming off a robust second quarter. Price and mix were modestly impacted by a less favorable mix of folding to cup business, along with some slight erosion. Operations performed well overall but were impacted by several minor cost items in the quarter, including FX in EMEA and other miscellaneous onetime items in the U.S. 
Moving to the Printing Papers segment. Results across the global businesses were strong, partially offset by another transitional quarter for the pulp business. Papers had a strong operational quarter, particularly in North America. Overall results for this segment were negatively impacted by a strike and other downtime we experienced in India, which unfavorably impacted results by about $5 million in the quarter. 
Relative to price and mix for North America, mix was slightly negative and pricing was flat to slightly positive. We experienced some lower prices in Europe and on our Latin American exports out of Brazil.  Overall, pulp business results declined by $15 million quarter-over-quarter, almost half of which was attributable to higher outage cost in the third quarter. And finally, results were favorably impacted by $6 million due to FX benefits mostly in Brazil. 
Turning to Ilim. The JV delivered another strong quarter, with operational EBITDA of $168 million, which translated to IP equity earnings of $46 million. Relatively stable FX throughout the quarter resulted in a slight favorable gain for the quarter. Looking ahead, the JV expects seasonally higher volume to be more than offset by seasonally higher wood cost for the fourth quarter. 
Turning to Slide 13, moving to an update on recent financing and capital allocation actions we've taken. Early in the third quarter, we completed a debt issuance of $2.3 billion to fund our acquisition of Weyerhaeuser's pulp business as well as the voluntary pension contributions that we spoke about on our last call. 
Additionally, as Mark mentioned in the opening, earlier this month, IP's Board of Directors authorized an increase to the company's annual dividend of 5% to $1.85 per share, which marked the fifth consecutive annual increase to the dividend. This is another meaningful move consistent with our policy of keeping the dividend in the range of 40% to 50% of our free cash flow and speaks to our continued confidence in the sustainability of our cash generation as we look forward. 
Before I move to the outlook, let me recap how we continue to think about capital allocation. It starts with cash from operations, and we think about how we can best leverage every dollar. Beginning with capital spending, you've seen us be flexible in terms of how we think about capital: Balancing the ongoing need to maintain a world-class fleet with the realities of the marketplace and what we choose to or can afford to spend in any given year. We also continue to have a healthy pipeline of high return cost-reduction projects that we fund at an appropriate level on this basis. 
From there, we think about the need to utilize and maintain a strong and healthy balance sheet, with appropriate leverage and credit rating to give us financial strength and flexibility over time. This includes the need to continue to proactively manage our pension plan, as you've seen, given the various moves we've made over the last several years. 
We are absolutely committed to returning a substantial portion of our cash to shareowners, as evidenced by the significant and consistent moves we've made to increase our dividend to a very meaningful level. Additionally, we supplemented this cash to shareholders with opportunistic share repurchases and we'll continue to thoughtfully utilize this option in the future. 
While we're doing all of this, we continue to look for select, value-creating investment opportunities which fit our advantaged position and advantaged markets strategy. These may come in the form of M&A like the Weyerhaeuser pulp acquisition, or could be more modest bolt-on types of opportunities like the Madrid mill, Riegelwood and our projects within North American Industrial Packaging. Bottom line, we continue to feel that a relentless focus on strong cash generation and a balanced approach to capital allocation is the right strategy for IP to create long-term value for our shareholders. 
So moving to the fourth quarter outlook. I'll cover the details around the typical seasonal impacts that we see as we move from the third to the fourth quarter, but additionally, we have a couple of onetime nonrecurring items that are expected to impact results for the quarter as well. 
So starting at the top. We expect daily demand to remain strong. However, volume will be lower due to 4 less shipping days in our North American Corrugated Packaging business. This is expected to negatively impact North American packaging business results by about $50 million. We expect seasonally stronger volume in the Brazil papers business, along with seasonal demand improvement in EMEA Packaging. 
Relative to price and mix, due to the implementation of the North American containerboard and box price increases, we expect favorable impact in the fourth quarter to be about $20 million. 
Relative to the North American pulp business, we expect unfavorable impact of about $10 million as we continue to supply additional tons of softwood market pulp into less than favorable market conditions as we work towards qualifying and supplying more fluff pulp out of the new capacity at Riegelwood. Additionally, we expect to see benefits of recently announced and implemented price increases in Brazil papers in the quarter. 
Moving to operations and other. We experienced disruptions with Hurricane Matthew in October that unfavorably affected our North American businesses where we have primary mills and significant business on the East Coast. 
In our North American papers and pulp business, this, along with other normal fourth quarter seasonal cost impacts, are expected to unfavorably impact results by $25 million. 
In our North American Industrial Packaging business, we will also see the impact of Hurricane Matthew on our results. Additionally, we expect to incur a noncash charge associated with inventory revaluation due to our LIFO accounting convention related to the North American containerboard price increase. These items are expected to unfavorably impact results by $35 million. 
So as you think about the fourth quarter, the all-in impact of the onetime items I just covered above, including Hurricane Matthew and the noncash inventory charge in North American Industrial Packaging, is roughly $45 million that will not repeat after the fourth quarter. 
Moving to input costs. On top of the impact we saw on the third quarter, we expect to see additional energy cost in North America as well as inflationary pressure on inputs in our EMEA business. We expect the unfavorable impact across our North American businesses to be about $12 million and about $6 million in Europe. 
Maintenance outage expenses are expected to increase slightly by $7 million. We expect Ilim results to be slightly less favorable due to lower operational EBITDA, along with the non-repeat of the favorable $0.01 FX impact from Q3. And finally, we do expect some modest impacts from the other items, as we've noted at the bottom of the slide. 
So with -- now, let me turn it back over to Mark."

In closing, International Paper continues to deliver solid performance in a global environment that presents plenty of challenges. As Carol mentioned, we remain highly focus on cash generation and we're on track for another very strong year",255,"Thanks, Carol. In closing, International Paper continues to deliver solid performance in a global environment that presents plenty of challenges. As Carol mentioned, we remain highly focus on cash generation and we're on track for another very strong year. We also remain focused on return on invested capital and are delivering another year of strong returns solidly above 10%, which is well above our cost of capital. 
As I think about where we are, how we expect to finish the year and what next year looks like, we are seeing some near-term margin squeeze across many of our businesses as some price erosion has occurred while input costs have turned up. The good news is we continue to execute well and our margins remain strong overall. 
We also have some upside ahead, particularly in the North American Industrial Packaging business with the price increases which are underway. 
In addition to that, while market fundamentals for our global pulp business may remain challenged for a while, the Weyerhaeuser pulp acquisition provides real and significant synergy opportunities that we can begin to bring to the bottom line as soon as we close the transaction. 
And while it's a bit further off due to the conversion, our newly acquired Madrid mill provides nice upside and earnings for our European box business. 
With our continued focus on cash generation and thoughtful approach to capital allocation, I remain confident in our ability to continue to generate meaningful value for our shareholders. 
And with that, we'll open the floor for questions."

I think box demand -- and it can always change. It's only as good as our forecast. But box demand is playing out more or less the way we have seen it for a while now in the course of 2016. So we always saw it strengthening. Our model was predicting based on economic performance and influence that we were going to strengthen through the second half of the year, and so we're seeing that. It's a little bit better, quite frankly, than we might have thought. But our experience has been pretty good. It's evidenced by the numbers that we posted on demand growth. Back to your first question, I think there's a few things to keep in mind. First of all, we don't see the dynamics around this price increase being any -- materially different than any other price increase we've ever had. If you look at being down $5 in the quarter, I just explained a part of that is mix, but some of it was the publication down, which happened earlier in the year, and then also just normal activity. That normal activity has a lag to it, right. So some of what's showing up in the quarter is stuff that has already happened and now it's just materializing. So when we communicated the price increase to our customers, we were looking at the fundamentals that we saw a point in time and then our view of how they were going to look going forward. And if anything, I'd say they turned out to be a little bit stronger than what we originally viewed."

In simple terms, we run our businesses in a FIFO model, first in, first out; but we keep our corporate books on a LIFO model, last in, first out. And so we keep that, you call it your LIFO reserve, your LIFO balance, which is your contra-inventory account on the corporate books. And basically, you do LIFO because costs go up through time and that's the best way, the best effect to get the outcome for the company. When you have a dramatic shift, and for us, it's around the inventory between our mills and our box plants, we charge our box plants market price. So we're going to move that board into our box business at the higher price. But you do last in, first out relative to your accounting, so you have to balance that LIFO account. The other thing that comes into play is you got to get that LIFO account balanced by year-end. So the timing of this increase coming right at the end of the year causes us to have to balance that account in the quarter. What's most important is noncash. And in LIFO, when you make adjustments to those LIFO balances it's noncash. But due to the way we run our business and our accounting conventions, that charge hits us in this fourth quarter. So that's my best explanation, and we can always follow-up with more if you feel like you want some more information."

But if you look at the components, the consumer section of GDP was up almost 3%. Those are the kinds of activities by the consumer that drive box demand. Even if they're trading out of a consumer good into a fresh good or other segments, with a consumer component of GDP at 2.8%, it's pretty squared with our mind around why box demand is at a 1.5%. There was a lot of negatives on the non-consumer side, which netted out a 1.4% GDP. So for us, it looks like it squares up pretty well."

Just I think, Tim, you talked about your supply chain being quite tight. I think in response to George's question about box price erosion you were talking about, some of it is a lag from the January cup, but some of it is related to competitive activity. So if your supply chain is really tight, why would there be sufficient competitive activity on the box side such that you're seeing erosion in your box prices to a fairly meaningful degree?"

And as a follow-up on the question you asked about export, because the Brazil demand is steady, we have announced a price increase for the export business that's effective in the fourth quarter.
