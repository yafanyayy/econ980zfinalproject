I'd like to kick off the call with a recap of 2015 and then update you on the trends we are currently seeing in the business segments. It's pretty clear that there were some tough macro headwinds in 2015. Doub",1338,"Thanks, Kelcey, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to kick off the call with a recap of 2015 and then update you on the trends we are currently seeing in the business segments. 
It's pretty clear that there were some tough macro headwinds in 2015. Double-digit foreign currency devaluations, some of the worst recessionary conditions on record in South America and a plummet in commodity prices created challenging conditions for industrial growth. Despite these events, our organization did what it does best, adapt to current conditions and take appropriate actions on things we can't control. And while there were  many accomplishments of our employees around the world to mitigate these challenges, I'd like to highlight 4 key areas. 
First, we continued with our strong management of costs and price. This is a hallmark of the Praxair culture. We adjusted our cost structure in line with economic trends, saving over $75 million per year. We improved pricing levels in nearly every region of the world, and we delivered strong productivity results. All of these efforts were quite visible in the financial statements and led to record operating and EBITDA margins of 23.1% and 33.8%, respectively. 
Second, we prudently managed capital. We maintained our industry-leading return on capital and delivered one of the highest free cash flow results in company history by achieving 25% operating cash flow as a percentage of sales and trimming capital expenditures 9% from prior year. During 2015, we also raised the dividend 10% as part of the $1.5 billion return to shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases. And we accomplished this without using leverage, as we held net debt flat. 
Third, we never lost sight of the priority for quality growth. We signed 6 large growth projects for about $700 million of investment, including the largest in company history, to extend our hydrogen and nitrogen pipeline complex in the U.S. Gulf Coast and supply the Yara-BASF joint venture. Acquisitions also played an important role, with around 15 accretive deals being closed or announced, including the European industrial gas business of Yara to help the to another percent of global for the company. We recently announced the joint venture with GE Aviation to enhance our presence in the aerospace market and provide additional resilient growth prospects. And we continue to deploy our application technologies to find more usage for our products that enable our customers to increase productivity, lower costs and improve their environmental footprint. 
And finally, we recognized the cyclical shift in some of our end markets and quickly adapted with a series of actions and initiatives. The renewed focus on more resilient industries and synergistic acquisitions at a reasonable price will provide continued growth opportunities in a world that is cyclically weaker across many sectors. 
So collectively, these actions mitigated the current headwinds and better positioned the company for future earnings accretion when markets turn. But unfortunately, we're seeing many negative trends continue into 2016. 
When I look around at the current industrial state of the world, I don't see many things getting better, and a few are getting a little worse. The combination of excess supply and reduced demand continues to put strain on several industrial end markets. However, we have exclusive customer supply contracts with our cylinders, tanks and pipelines that are located at customer sites. The challenge is that we are replenishing the gases to these assets at a lower frequency due to our customers' lower production rates. But consistent with other prior industrial cycles, this will eventually turn and improve. 
In North America, the impact of lower hydrocarbon pricing continues to pressure many industries, including mining, oil and gas, railcar production, heavy equipment and general manufacturing. Furthermore, the stronger dollar has put additional strain on the U.S. manufacturing competitiveness. These negative trends can be seen in recent industrial production and PMI reports. However, we continue to see good demand in consumer-oriented sectors like food, beverage, automotive, health care, refining and chemicals. They U.S. Gulf Coast petrochemical buildout still provides good opportunities for new on-site contracts, and we are pursuing several bids, of which we expect to convert to new supply contracts soon. 
South America has not improved but rather worsened, which is consistent with our expectations. The combination of political turmoil in Brazil and the seasonal outages significantly curtailed volumes, which will likely continue into Q1 for the Carnaval holiday and possibly beyond. I believe the election results in countries like Venezuela and Argentina will bode well for future business opportunities, but it will take some time to see any impact on the ground. We continue to take appropriate actions to preserve the quality of the business, but frankly, South America is becoming less and less of a component of our consolidated results due to the severe currency devaluation. So the potential downside impact is less than prior years. 
Europe is stable and slightly growing in several regions. Commodity-consuming nations like Germany, Spain, Benelux and Italy have benefited from the lower cost of oil and weaker euro. This is evidenced by the strong growth we are seeing in our Port of Antwerp pipeline expansion such as the recently announced Total contracts. In addition to the positive growth across both cyclical and noncyclical industries, commodity-producing nations like Russia and those in Scandinavia are negatively feeling the effects, but we have partnered with some of the most competitive and lowest-cost producers in the world. So they're still running their assets in this environment, and we anticipate that to continue. 
Asia segment trends are quite different depending upon the country. Thailand and India continue to perform well, and we're seeing strong pockets of growth in both countries. Korean growth is primarily focused on the electronics industry, which has been in a strong cycle for a few years now, although certain areas are projected to slow. And China is the country getting the most press these days. Clearly, you have a situation of excess capacity across most infrastructure-supporting industries like steel, glass and cement. We've been seeing softness in those areas for a few quarters now, and that will likely continue for 2016. Consumer-related industries are still performing well in China, as we continue to see good demand for things like transportation fuels, food, health care, environmental solutions and plastics. Examples include our new project startup at [indiscernible] and a recent project signing with [indiscernible]. So we'll have to see how China performs this year, but the underlying growth rates will be lower than what we saw in prior years. 
So when you sum it up, we're just not seeing much improvement from the current weak industrial run rates. Given that, our strategic focus that we laid out over the past several months is still valid in this environment, and you can find that on Page 3. 
This slide shows the key elements of our focus to grow earnings and cash flow regardless of the underlying economic conditions, and we are still on track. 
Starting with the bar at the top. We're currently benefiting from the cost restructuring actions taken mid last year. And we continue to find new price and cost opportunities throughout our business. These are, and will, continue to contribute positive EPS growth. 
On the second bar, we are proceeding well regarding synergistic acquisitions. We still expect to execute $500 million to $600 million of acquisitions this year, with over half already announced. Most of these are in developed markets or more resilient industries, which will help enhance and insulate our business portfolio from some of the current cyclical trends. And we expect strong project backlog contribution for 2017 as some of our large, fixed-fee projects are slated to start in that year. 
So we've mapped the path to growth for our earnings, but for 2016, it's not enough to offset the combination of foreign currency headwind and the current trend of negative underlying volumes. I'll cover this further, including guidance, at the end of the prepared remarks. But first, Kelcey can provide more details on our financial performance for 2015."

Please turn to Slide 4 for an overview of the full year. Overall sales were $10.8 billion, steady with the prior year, excluding currency and cost pass-through. Price attainment contributed 1% growth and was achieved in all reporting segme",1057,"Thanks, Matt. Please turn to Slide 4 for an overview of the full year. 
Overall sales were $10.8 billion, steady with the prior year, excluding currency and cost pass-through. Price attainment contributed 1% growth and was achieved in all reporting segments. Volume growth from projects was about half weighted towards Asia, with the remainder of the contribution in Europe and North America. The full year volume decline, net of project contribution, was driven by weaker base volumes in the Americas, primarily in the upstream energy, manufacturing and metals end markets. Globally, food and beverage, health care and aerospace end markets were positive with low to mid-single-digit organic growth. 
We completed a number of small industrial gas acquisitions during the year that contributed about 1% to the overall growth of Praxair. These synergistic acquisitions will continue to enhance our production network density in all operating segments. 
Operating profit of $2.5 billion grew 1% year-over-year, excluding foreign currency, from higher pricing, cost actions and acquisitions. As a result, we grew full year EBITDAR and operating margins to record levels. Earnings per share of $5.80 grew 3%, excluding foreign currency. 
Please turn to Slide 5 for an overview of cash flow. Through consistent capital and operational discipline, we generated strong operating cash flow of $2.7 billion for the year at 25% of sales. During 2015, $1.5 billion was prudently invested in CapEx for growth and density improvement. These investments are in our core regions and meet our disciplined investment criteria. More than half of the CapEx spent during 2015 occurred in North America, with the rest equally distributed to Asia, Europe and South America. During 2016, CapEx is expected to be even more weighted towards North America, given its larger share of the backlog. 
When our end markets and geographies are in lower growth cycles like today, we typically generate more free cash flow than periods of stronger capital investment since the majority of our capital spend is for growth projects that are only initiated with executed customer contracts. As a result, this morning, we announced a 5% increase to our quarterly dividend, which represents our 23rd consecutive annual increase. This is consistent with our policy to grow dividends each year. The remaining cash that we have after growth investments and dividends is directed towards share repurchases. During 2015, we reduced our outstanding share count by 2%. This was our sixth consecutive year of reducing the share count by at least 1%. 
Now please turn to Slide 6 for an overview of the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter sales were $2.6 billion and 1% lower than the prior year, excluding currency impacts and cost pass-through. Organic sales increased from higher pricing in most operating segments. Lower base volumes continued to be driven by the Americas, primarily in the manufacturing, upstream energy and metals end markets. This was partially offset by new volumes from project startups in Asia and Europe as well as global growth in refining, food and beverage, health care and aerospace end markets. Small acquisitions within all segments contributed 1% growth. 
By operating segment, North America's organic sales declined 3% year-over-year and 1% sequentially. The business achieved price improvement in the U.S., Mexico and Canada. Weaker volumes for manufacturing customers drove about half of the volume decline. This was primarily due to hardgoods, as consumers are reducing investment in capital equipment, given the uncertainty in demand and headwinds from imports with the strength of the U.S. dollar. The remaining volume softness was driven by upstream energy and metals, with metals down 16% organically year-over-year and 8% sequentially. This was partially mitigated by end market growth from refinery, health care and food and beverage customers. 
In Europe, organic sales grew 4% year-over-year and were down 1% sequentially. Year-over-year growth was primarily driven by price attainment in most countries, project contribution in Russia and higher base volumes in Spain. Sequential volume declines were primarily due to upstream energy customers. 
South America's underlying sales were down 1% year-over-year, as volume declines in most end markets were partially offset by price contribution, acquisition and growth in the health care and food and beverage end markets. Sequentially, volumes were down 6% due to further deteriorating industrial production and extended holiday shutdowns by customers in Brazil. This occurred in most end markets with the largest impact to manufacturing, which represents about 20% of Brazil sales. 
Underlying growth in Asia was 6% higher than last year and 2% higher sequentially, primarily driven by new project startups in China and India, growing carbon dioxide sales in Thailand and acquisitions. 
Surface Technologies organic growth was down 2% year-over-year, driven by energy and industrial end markets, and up 4% sequentially, driven by stronger aerospace coatings. 
Global consolidated operating profit was $624 million in the fourth quarter and grew 5% over the prior year, excluding foreign currency. We are seeing the benefits of our restructuring actions, price attainment and acquisitions. The fourth quarter operating profit and margin also benefited from a gain on sale in North America. Earnings per share of $1.47 grew 5% year-over-year, excluding currency. Operating cash flow was $791 million, represented 30% of sales and funded $387 million of capital expenditures. The company paid $204 million of dividends and repaid $203 million of debt to hold net debt steady for the year. 
Our project backlog, which we define as projects with CapEx greater than $5 million and associated with the fully executed customer supply contract, is currently $1.5 billion and comprised of 18 projects. During the fourth quarter, we signed 2 long-term contracts for new projects located in North America and Europe and started 2 projects in Asia. Existing backlog projects will start up and contribute to growth during 2016 through 2018, as shown on Slide 16. North America now reflects about 45% of the backlog. 
We continue to look selectively for tuck-in acquisitions in our core business, which are high-quality, low-risk properties where we can bring synergies to the business we are buying and we can achieve an attractive return on investment. During the fourth quarter, we bought 3 industrial gas businesses in the U.S. with multiple locations and combined sales of more than $20 million annually. And we increased ownership of an existing joint venture in Asia. 
And now I'll turn the call back to Matt to discuss our outlook and earnings guidance for 2016."

Our full year guidance for 2016 is in the range of $5.30 to $5.70. While the entire range is below our 2015 EPS, it does include $0.42 or 7% anticipated headwind from foreign currency translation. The lower right of this slide, yo",590,"Please turn to Page 6. Our full year guidance for 2016 is in the range of $5.30 to $5.70. While the entire range is below our 2015 EPS, it does include $0.42 or 7% anticipated headwind from foreign currency translation. 
The lower right of this slide, you can see the average 2015 FX rate for some of our major currencies, which were all much stronger than what the current spot rates are today. Excluding the FX impact, we expect underlying EPS to grow to be a low of minus 2% to a high of plus 5%. There are a few key drivers that comprise this range. We expect to deliver positive EPS growth from our price, productivity and the 2015 cost actions. Many of these items are already completed, and we have a high level of confidence in our ability to continue to improve our earnings going forward through these company-specific actions. 
We also are expecting EPS accretion through our acquisitions and share buyback program. These are good examples of contribution from our capital allocation process. We have closed several synergistic acquisitions and anticipate completing a few more early this year, which will be immediately accretive to our results. These are primarily tuck-in acquisitions that serve more resilient markets and enhance our existing portfolio. 
In addition, our excess free cash flow has enabled us to consistently repurchase shares without increasing debt levels. So we also feel good about contribution from these areas as most of them are already completed. 
Product volume is really the key unknown factor and, in addition to foreign currency, will vary the most in the near term. You can see the range showing more downside risk than upside. The to pend of this range represents our project volume startup, which we have good visibility into and assumes slightly positive underlying volume growth. The bottom end represents in the same project growth but with current underlying volume trends up [ph] negative low to mid-single-digit percent. As I mentioned earlier, this volume is tied to our existing network of pipelines, tanks and cylinders. So the contracts and assets are in place, but we simply aren't supplying them at the same rate due to the slower demand environment. We'll continue to take actions to improve on this range, but this is our best estimate at this time. 
Turning to the first quarter. We are calling an EPS range of $1.20 to $1.28. This range is down 10% to 16% from last year, of which 9% relates to FX impact. So we're anticipating underlying EPS to be down 1% to 7%. While we have the full benefit of cost reductions in our results, we don't expect that to fully offset the lower volumes seen primarily in North and South America. 
We expect Q1 to be the weakest for 2016, given the normal seasonal impact, coupled with the abnormally low volume trends coming out of 2015. We saw extended seasonal outages during the fourth quarter, and we anticipate similar trends for the first quarter. 
The first half of 2016, especially the first quarter, will be more challenging than the back half. However, we have developed a strategy around to this environment and have taken actions in anticipation of these trends. Our business usually leads these cycles, given the nature of our industry and end markets. We expect to lead the recovery. And while near-term trends will the pressure, we'll continue to take prudent and appropriate actions for long-term shareholder value creation. 
I'd now like to open up the line for Q&A."

We have a fairly similar profile of startup. 2017 is where we really expect that to step up, and that will be closer to the 3%, 4% kind of midterm range that we had given out a few years ago. So we do have a gap in 2015 and '16 on project startups. Part of it are things like the Chevron project, as you recall, that we ultimately ended up selling that asset and as opposed to starting up as a sale of gas. But I would expect '16 to be similar to '15."

And given the situation in Brazil, from an industrial perspective, rates are so low on everything from refineries to ammonia plants, to chemical plants, that the CO2 sources now are actually going down for extended outage periods. So what's happening there is while we're still meeting the requirements that there are for food and beverage, it's causing us extra costs. We have to haul the product much further, dislocation costs. So yes, it's creating some inefficiencies in our system right now, given our supply source outages. And it's just something we have to manage and live with. I do hope that some of these will come back stream here, back in the first quarter. We're seeing a few begin to start up again. But that's something that impacted Q4, will impact Q1, and we'll have to see beyond that."

But the supply/demand imbalance, there's still an issue, especially in certain parts of the country. And we'll just see in terms of capacity.

Canada is mostly an energy issue story, and that also has had some negative impact here over the last few quarters. There could be a little more risk going forward.

And it's something that -- with its height as a segment, it was almost 20% of the operating profit of the entire company. Today, it's slightly above 10%. So we've seen these cycles go up and down on the segment. When you look today, South America as a whole, as a percentage of the company, is approaching kind of 2003, 2004 levels. So I would say, if it continues on its path of shrinking, the shrinking is less severe than obviously coming off the peak in 2010, 2011. But if it does recover to kind of the levels we've seen in the past, that's pretty significant upside, both from a growth perspective in the top line but also the earnings because we tend to get pretty accretive growth when it recovers. So we'll have to see. As I mentioned earlier, I think you are seeing some positive developments in the government side, in countries like Argentina and Venezuela. It will take time to work through, but you're getting more business-friendly approaches in some of the governments there. I think Brazil has -- needs more time to work through their issues. 2016 will be another tough year. 2017, we'll have to see, but they do have an election in 2018. So -- but I think right now, it's at its lowest level it's been in over a decade as far as impact to our organization, and we'll just have to see going forward."

I think, right now, that entire sector is just too much capacity. So there needs to be some rationalization, and I would see future investments in those areas being extremely limited. The other sector of the Chinese economy on the consumer side, which still are good investment opportunities, they tend to be smaller plants. They tend to be less capital-intensive. It could be things in environmental, in food. And that we continue to see good opportunities. But when I look at the steel capacity in China right now, our steel customers are, what I call, Tier 1. So these are the steel pipe customers there. They are very competitive globally. They're very well-integrated and they can withstand these cycles. There are Tier 2 and Tier 3 steel mills that have been popped up all over the country, and those are the ones, I think, from a liquidity standpoint and a competitive standpoint, are struggling. Now just the Premier recently here announced their goal to take out about 100 million to 150 million tons a year capacity. And just to put that in perspective, that's like these higher capacity in the United States, but they are looking to rationalize and take that out, which I think would be great. I don't know when it will happen, but if that could be accelerated, that should be very beneficial in a couple of fronts. It should reduce some of the steel production in some of the imports to other countries like the U.S., but also should help on the liquid merchant front. So in my mind, if those are rationalized, we would not have an interest in those assets. I don't think they're viable, and you can't run the air separation plant without some baseload cost effectively. So I would rather sit back and wait and let some of this rationalization happen that they've announced, and I think that'll be beneficial and constructive for the market."

And when you see large equipment purchases like automatic welders or cutters, that's when things are usually going quite well, and the customer base is confident enough. And furthermore, their backlog is big enough that they want to invest in automation so we saw a lot of that a year plus ago, primarily in the oil patch, but also in the whole center part of the country that serve the some of the manufacturing sector that built constant rate and other things for the oil patch. So we were seeing a lot of automated equipment being purchased. And also just a function of charges skilled laborers, skilled welders and so forth. So that part, we've had to lap. The consumables is the one that can sometimes move right with gas. You're going to use so much wire and contacts usually is some gas to use.

So those are pretty big numbers, and you just don't see that of any project of any size. As far as delays, most of our contracts have some type of date certain clause, which will ensure that if the project's delayed, we either get paid day 1 regardless or we get recovery through the fixed facility fee through a higher fee due to the time loss value. So we do have mechanisms to account for that. Of the projects that we have right now in the backlog, there's no material delays that we can see, but we do have some mechanisms. Now obviously, if the delay's due to us, that's a different issue. But these are more if this is the customer's reason why today, we do not economic recovery mechanisms."

Clearly, having a blend of both, we believe, is a nice benefit because it is a lower capital-intensive approach. But you do need both because you have to give certain reliability and quality standards to the customers you supply into. So this is part of what's always been our long-term strategy in the hydrogen and syngas business, which is to have a combination of both on-purpose and sourcing. And it does help on the capital footprint. Now clearly, you need to make pipelines, you have to have compression, you have to have assets that can clean up the actual hydrogen source you're taking. It's usually not to the right period that you need. But it's all part of our overall strategy, and it does help us deliver the reliability and quantity that we need for our customer base.

I'd like to kick off the call with a recap of 2015 and then update you on the trends we are currently seeing in the business segments. It's pretty clear that there were some tough macro headwinds in 2015. Doub",1338,"Thanks, Kelcey, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to kick off the call with a recap of 2015 and then update you on the trends we are currently seeing in the business segments. 
It's pretty clear that there were some tough macro headwinds in 2015. Double-digit foreign currency devaluations, some of the worst recessionary conditions on record in South America and a plummet in commodity prices created challenging conditions for industrial growth. Despite these events, our organization did what it does best, adapt to current conditions and take appropriate actions on things we can control. And while there were many accomplishments of our employees around the world to mitigate these challenges, I'd like to highlight 4 key areas. 
First, we continued our strong management of costs and price. This is a hallmark of the Praxair culture. We adjusted our cost structure in line with economic trends, saving over $75 million per year. We improved pricing levels in nearly every region of the world, and we delivered strong productivity results. All of these efforts were quite visible in the financial statements and led to record operating and EBITDA margins of 23.1% and 33.8%, respectively. 
Second, we prudently managed capital. We maintained our industry-leading return on capital and delivered one of the highest free cash flow results in company history by achieving 25% operating cash flow as a percentage of sales and trimming capital expenditures 9% from prior year. During 2015, we also raised the dividend 10% as part of the $1.5 billion returned to shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases. And we accomplished this without using leverage, as we held net debt flat. 
Third, we never lost sight of the priority for quality growth. We signed 6 large growth projects for about $700 million of investment, including the largest in company history, to extend our hydrogen and nitrogen pipeline complex in the U.S. Gulf Coast to supply the Yara-BASF joint venture. Acquisitions also played an important role, with around 15 accretive deals being closed or announced, including the European industrial gas business of Yara to help contribute another percent of global growth for the company. We recently announced the joint venture with GE Aviation to enhance our presence in the aerospace market and provide additional resilient growth prospects. And we continue to deploy our application technologies to find more usage for our products that enable our customers to increase productivity, lower costs and improve their environmental footprint. 
And finally, we recognized the cyclical shift in some of our end markets and quickly adapted with a series of actions and initiatives. The renewed focus on more resilient industries and synergistic acquisitions at a reasonable price will provide continued growth opportunities in a world that is cyclically weaker across many sectors. 
So collectively, these actions mitigated the current headwinds and better position the company for future earnings accretion when markets turn. But unfortunately, we're seeing many negative trends continue into 2016. 
When I look around at the current industrial state of the world, I don't see many things getting better, and a few are getting a little worse. The combination of excess supply and reduced demand continues to put strain on several industrial end markets. However, we have exclusive customer supply contracts with our cylinders, tanks and pipelines that are located at customer sites. The challenge is that we are replenishing the gases to these assets at a lower frequency due to our customers' lower production rates. But consistent with other prior industrial cycles, this will eventually turn and improve. 
In North America, the impact of lower hydrocarbon pricing continues to pressure many industries, including mining, oil and gas, railcar production, heavy equipment and general manufacturing. Furthermore, the stronger dollar has put additional strain on the U.S. manufacturing competitiveness. These negative trends can be seen in recent industrial production and PMI reports. However, we continue to see good demand in consumer-oriented sectors like food, beverage, automotive, health care, refining and chemicals. The U.S. Gulf Coast petrochemical buildout still provides good opportunities for new on-site contracts, and we are pursuing several bids, of which we expect to convert to new supply contracts soon. 
South America has not improved but rather worsened, which is consistent with our expectations. The combination of political turmoil in Brazil and the seasonal outages significantly curtailed volumes, which will likely continue into Q1 for the Carnival holiday and possibly beyond. I believe the election results in countries like Venezuela and Argentina will bode well for future business opportunities, but it will take some time to see any impact on the ground. We continue to take appropriate actions to preserve the quality of the business, but frankly, South America is becoming less and less of a component of our consolidated results due to the severe currency devaluation. So the potential downside impact is less than prior years. 
Europe is stable and slightly growing in several regions. Commodity-consuming nations like Germany, Spain, Benelux and Italy have benefited from the lower cost of oil and weaker euro. This is evidenced by the strong growth we are seeing in our Port of Antwerp pipeline expansion such as the recently announced Total contract. In addition to the positive growth across both cyclical and noncyclical industries, commodity-producing nations like Russia and those in Scandinavia are negatively feeling the effects, but we have partnered with some of the most competitive and lowest-cost producers in the world. So they're still running their assets in this environment, and we anticipate that to continue. 
Asia segment trends are quite different depending upon the country. Thailand and India continue to perform well, and we're seeing strong pockets of growth in both countries. Korean growth is primarily focused on the electronics industry, which has been in a strong cycle for a few years now, although certain areas are projected to slow. And China is the country getting the most press these days. Clearly, you have a situation of excess capacity across most infrastructure-supporting industries like steel, glass and cement. We've been seeing softness in those areas for a few quarters now, and that will likely continue for 2016. Consumer-related industries are still performing well in China, as we continue to see good demand for things like transportation fuels, food, health care, environmental solutions and plastics. Examples include our new project startup with Yangquan and a recent project signing with CNOOC. So we'll have to see how China performs this year, but the underlying growth rates will be lower than what we saw in prior years. 
So when you sum it up, we're just not seeing much improvement from the current weak industrial run rates. Given that, our strategic focus that we laid out over the past several months is still valid in this environment, and you can find that on Page 3. 
This slide shows the key elements of our focus to grow earnings and cash flow regardless of the underlying economic conditions, and we are still on track. 
Starting with the bar at the top. We're currently benefiting from the cost restructuring actions taken mid last year. And we continue to find new price and cost opportunities throughout our business. These are, and will, continue to contribute positive EPS growth. 
On the second bar, we are proceeding well regarding synergistic acquisitions. We still expect to execute $500 million to $600 million of acquisitions this year, with over half already announced. Most of these are in developed markets or more resilient industries, which will help enhance and insulate our business portfolio from some of the current cyclical trends. And we expect strong project backlog contribution for 2017 as several of our large, fixed-fee projects are slated to start in that year. 
So we've mapped the path to growth for our earnings, but for 2016, it's not enough to offset the combination of foreign currency headwind and the current trend of negative underlying volumes. I'll cover this further, including guidance, at the end of the prepared remarks. But first, Kelcey can provide some more details on our financial performance for 2015."
318049,321859001,923772,"Praxair Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 29, 2016",2016-01-29,"Earnings Calls","Linde plc","Executives","Thanks, Matt. Please turn to Slide 4 for an overview of the full year. Overall sales were $10.8 billion, steady with the prior year, excluding currency and cost pass-through.

Overall sales were $10.8 billion, steady with the prior year, excluding currency and cost pass-through. Price attainment contributed 1% growth and was achieved in all reporting segments. Volume growth from projects was about half weighted towards Asia, with the remainder of the contribution in Europe and North America. The full year volume decline, net of project contribution, was driven by weaker base volumes in the Americas, primarily in the upstream energy, manufacturing and metals end markets. Globally, food and beverage, health care and aerospace end markets were positive with low to mid-single-digit organic growth. 
We completed a number of small industrial gas acquisitions during the year that contributed about 1% to the overall growth of Praxair. These synergistic acquisitions will continue to enhance our production network density in all operating segments. 
Operating profit of $2.5 billion grew 1% year-over-year, excluding foreign currency, from higher pricing, cost actions and acquisitions. As a result, we grew full year EBITDA and operating margins to record levels. Earnings per share of $5.80 grew 3%, excluding foreign currency. 
Please turn to Slide 5 for an overview of cash flow. Through consistent capital and operational discipline, we generated strong operating cash flow of $2.7 billion for the year at 25% of sales. During 2015, $1.5 billion was prudently invested in CapEx for growth and density improvement. These investments are in our core regions and meet our disciplined investment criteria. More than half of the CapEx spent during 2015 occurred in North America, with the rest equally distributed to Asia, Europe and South America. During 2016, CapEx is expected to be even more weighted towards North America, given its larger share of the backlog. 
When our end markets and geographies are in lower growth cycles like today, we typically generate more free cash flow than periods of stronger capital investment since the majority of our capital spend is for growth projects that are only initiated with executed customer contracts. As a result, this morning, we announced a 5% increase to our quarterly dividend, which represents our 23rd consecutive annual increase. This is consistent with our policy to grow dividends each year. The remaining cash that we have after growth investments and dividends is directed towards share repurchases. During 2015, we reduced our outstanding share count by 2%. This was our sixth consecutive year of reducing the share count by at least 1%. 
Now please turn to Slide 6 for an overview of the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter sales were $2.6 billion and 1% lower than the prior year, excluding currency impacts and cost pass-through. Organic sales increased from higher pricing in most operating segments. Lower base volumes continued to be driven by the Americas, primarily in the manufacturing, upstream energy and metals end markets. This was partially offset by new volumes from project startups in Asia and Europe as well as global growth in refining, food and beverage, health care and aerospace end markets. Small acquisitions within all segments contributed 1% growth. 
By operating segment, North America's organic sales declined 3% year-over-year and 1% sequentially. The business achieved price improvement in the U.S., Mexico and Canada. Weaker volumes for manufacturing customers drove about half of the volume decline. This was primarily due to hardgoods, as consumers are reducing investment in capital equipment given the uncertainty in demand and headwinds from imports with the strength of the U.S. dollar. The remaining volume softness was driven by upstream energy and metals, with metals down 16% organically year-over-year and 8% sequentially. This was partially mitigated by end market growth from refinery, health care and food and beverage customers. 
In Europe, organic sales grew 4% year-over-year and were down 1% sequentially. Year-over-year growth was primarily driven by price attainment in most countries, project contribution in Russia and higher base volumes in Spain. Sequential volume declines were primarily due to upstream energy customers. 
South America's underlying sales were down 1% year-over-year, as volume declines in most end markets were partially offset by price contribution, acquisition and growth in the health care and food and beverage end markets. Sequentially, volumes were down 6% due to further deteriorating industrial production and extended holiday shutdowns by customers in Brazil. This occurred in most end markets with the largest impact to manufacturing, which represents about 20% of Brazil sales. 
Underlying growth in Asia was 6% higher than last year and 2% higher sequentially, primarily driven by new project startups in China and India, growing carbon dioxide sales in Thailand and acquisitions. 
Surface Technologies organic growth was down 2% year-over-year, driven by energy and industrial end markets, and up 4% sequentially, driven by stronger aerospace coatings. 
Global consolidated operating profit was $624 million in the fourth quarter and grew 5% over the prior year, excluding foreign currency. We are seeing the benefits of our restructuring actions, price attainment and acquisitions. The fourth quarter operating profit and margin also benefited from a gain on sale in North America. Earnings per share of $1.47 grew 5% year-over-year, excluding currency. Operating cash flow was $791 million, represented 30% of sales and funded $387 million of capital expenditures. The company paid $204 million of dividend and repaid $203 million of debt to hold net debt steady for the year. 
Our project backlog, which we define as projects with CapEx greater than $5 million and associated with the fully executed customer supply contract, is currently $1.5 billion and comprised of 18 projects. During the fourth quarter, we signed 2 long-term contracts for new projects located in North America and Europe and started 2 projects in Asia. Existing backlog projects will start up and contribute to growth during 2016 through 2018, as shown on Slide 16. North America now reflects about 45% of the backlog. 
We continue to look selectively for tuck-in acquisitions in our core business, which are high-quality, low-risk properties where we can bring synergies to the business we are buying and we can achieve an attractive return on investment. During the fourth quarter, we bought 3 industrial gas businesses in the U.S. with multiple locations and combined sales of more than $20 million annually. And we increased ownership of an existing joint venture in Asia. 
And now I'll turn the call back to Matt who will discuss our outlook and earnings guidance for 2016."
318049,321859001,923772,"Praxair Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 29, 2016",2016-01-29,"Earnings Calls","Linde plc","Executives","Please turn to Page 6. Our full year guidance for 2016 is in the range of $5.30 to $5.70. While the entire range is below our 2015 EPS, it does include $0.42 or 7% anticipated headwind from foreign currency translation. On the lower right of this slide,",589,"Please turn to Page 6. Our full year guidance for 2016 is in the range of $5.30 to $5.70. While the entire range is below our 2015 EPS, it does include $0.42 or 7% anticipated headwind from foreign currency translation. 
On the lower right of this slide, you can see the average 2015 FX rates for some of our major currencies, which were all much stronger than what the current spot rates are today. Excluding the FX impact, we expect underlying EPS to grow to be a low of minus 2% to a high of plus 5%. There are a few key drivers that comprise this range. We expect to deliver positive EPS growth from our price, productivity and the 2015 cost actions. Many of these items are already completed, and we have a high level of confidence in our ability to continue to improve our earnings going forward through these company-specific actions. 
We also are expecting EPS accretion through our acquisitions and share buyback program. These are good examples of contribution from our capital allocation process. We have closed several synergistic acquisitions and anticipate completing a few more early this year, which will be immediately accretive to our results. These are primarily tuck-in acquisitions that serve more resilient markets and enhance our existing portfolio. 
In addition, our excess free cash flow has enabled us to consistently repurchase shares without increasing debt levels. So we also feel good about contribution from these areas as most of them are already completed. 
Product volume is really the key unknown factor and, in addition to foreign currency, will vary the most in the near term. You can see the range showing more downside risk than upside. The top end of this range represents our project volume startup, which we have good visibility into and assumes slightly positive underlying volume growth. The bottom end represents the same project growth but with current underlying volume trends of negative low to mid-single-digit percent. As I mentioned earlier, this volume is tied to our existing network of pipelines, tanks and cylinders. So the contracts and assets are in place, but we simply aren't supplying them at the same rate due to the slower demand environment. We'll continue to take actions to improve on this range, but this is our best estimate at this time. 
Turning to the first quarter. We are calling an EPS range of $1.20 to $1.28. This range is down 10% to 16% from last year, of which 9% relates to FX impact. So we're anticipating underlying EPS to be down 1% to 7%. While we have the full benefit of cost reductions in our results, we don't expect that to fully offset the lower volumes seen primarily in North and South America. 
We expect Q1 to be the weakest for 2016, given the normal seasonal impact, coupled with the abnormally low volume trends coming out of 2015. We saw extended seasonal outages during the fourth quarter, and we anticipate similar trends for the first quarter. 
The first half of 2016, especially the first quarter, will be more challenging than the back half. However, we have developed a strategy around this environment and have taken actions in anticipation of these trends. Our business usually leads these cycles, given the nature of our industry and end markets. And we expect to lead the recovery. And while near-term trends will be pressured, we'll continue to take prudent and appropriate actions for long-term shareholder value creation. 
I'd now like to open up the line for Q&A."

So we do have a gap in 2015 and '16 on project startups. Part of it are things like the Chevron project, as you recall, that we ultimately ended up selling that asset and as opposed to starting up as a sale of gas. But we expect '16 to be similar to '15."

And as you probably know, we generally feedstock -- we get the feedstock from various processes and industries. And given the situation in Brazil, from an industrial perspective, rates are so low on everything from refineries to ammonia plants, to chemical plants, that the CO2 sources now are actually going down for extended outage periods. So what's happening there is while we're still meeting the requirements that there are for food and beverage, it's causing us extra costs. We have to haul the product much further, dislocation costs. So yes, it's creating some inefficiencies in our system right now given our supply source outages. And it's just something we have to manage and live with. I do hope that some of these will come back stream here back in the first quarter. We're seeing a few begin to start up again. But that's something that impacted Q4, will impact Q1, and we'll have to see beyond that."

And also we're just electing not to sell some of these hardgoods, given the margins are just not attractive to us at this time. As far as the metals, that's primarily U.S. We are seeing some slower volumes from some of the import issues coming into the country as well as just some of the slowing demand on certain infrastructure projects. But Mexico, is mostly an energy issue that's played out in our results. It's been in our run rate now for a couple of quarters, almost a year. And excluding that, Mexico is still doing quite well. Canada is mostly an energy issue story, and that also has had some negative impact here over the last few quarters. There could be a little more risk going forward. Excluding that, Canada, on the eastern side of the country, it's doing fairly well due to the weak currency there. It's making their products more competitive. But I would say most of the challenges you've seen in the U.S. are either related to the strong dollar, which is hurting the manufacturing, or the impact of the energy metal side that's working its way through the supply system."

And it's something that at its height as a segment, it was almost 20% of the operating profit of the entire company. Today, it's up slightly above 10%. So we've seen these cycles go up and down on the segment. I mean, you look today, South America as a whole, as a percentage of the company, is approaching kind of 2003, 2004 levels. So I would say, if it continues on its path of shrinking, the shrinking is less severe than obviously coming off the peak in 2010, 2011. But if it does recover to kind of the levels we've seen in the past, that's pretty significant upside, both from a growth perspective in the top line but also the earnings because we tend to get pretty accretive growth when it recovers. So we'll have to see. As I mentioned earlier, I think you are seeing some positive developments in the government side, in countries like Argentina and Venezuela. It will take time to work through, but you're getting more business-friendly approaches in some of the governments there. I think Brazil has -- needs more time to work through their issues. 2016 will be another tough year. 2017, we'll have to see, but they do have an election in 2018.

I think, right now, that entire sector is just too much capacity. So there needs to be some rationalization, and I would see future investments in those areas being extremely limited. The other sector of the Chinese economy on the consumer side, there still are good investment opportunities. They tend to be smaller plants. They tend to be less capital-intensive. It could be things in environmental, in food. And that we continue to see good opportunities. But when I look at the steel capacity in China right now, our steel customers are, what I call, Tier 1. So these are the Baosteel type customers there. And they are very competitive globally. They're very well integrated and they can withstand these cycles. There are Tier 2 and Tier 3 steel mills that have been popped up all over the country, and those are the ones, I think, from a liquidity standpoint and a competitive standpoint are struggling. Now they just -- the Premier recently here announced their goal to take out about 100 million to 150 million tons a year capacity. And just to put that in perspective, that's like the entire capacity of the United States, but they are looking to rationalize and take that out, which I think would be great. I don't know when it will happen, but if that could be accelerated, that should be very beneficial on a couple fronts. It should reduce some of the steel production and some of the imports to other countries like the U.S., but it also should help on the liquid merchant front. So in my mind, if those are rationalized, we would not have an interest in those assets. I don't think they're viable, and you can't run the air separation plant without some baseload cost effectively. So I would rather sit back and wait, and let some of this rationalization happen that they've announced, and I think that will be beneficial and constructive for the market."

But you also need to look at the acquisition front as well. So we're stepping up what we're spending in the acquisition. So I do think some of the backlog that is declining a bit is being replaced by acquisitions. I kind of look at both of them equally in terms of avenues to invest capital to grow. So it is going down a bit, but acquisitions are stepping up a bit. And we've seen this in some of the cycles before.

The large equipment, as you can imagine, it's very large numbers that come in lumpy. And when you see large equipment purchases like automatic welders or cutters, that's when things are usually going quite well, and the customer base is confident enough. And furthermore, their backlog is big enough that they want to invest in automation. So we saw a lot of that a year plus ago, primarily in the oil patch, but also in the whole center part of the country that served some of the manufacturing sectors that built pumps and rigs and other things for the oil patch. So we were seeing a lot of automated equipment being purchased and also just a function of -- a shortage of skilled laborers, skilled welders and so forth. So that part, we had to lap. The consumables is the one that can sometimes move right with gas. You're going to use so much wire and contact tips usually as some gas as you use. So I would say the equipment has been a little bit of a front-end indicator. We see that now, it's just a function of some of the consumables and just some other hardgoods that we personally are just not going to serve that market if the margins aren't worth our effort at this point."

So this is part of what's always been our long-term strategy in the hydrogen and syngas business, which is to have a combination of both on-purpose and sourcing.

I'd like to kick off the call with a recap of 2015 and then update you on the trends we are currently seeing in the business segments. It's pretty clear that there were some tough macro headwinds in 2015. Doub",1338,"Thanks, Kelcey, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to kick off the call with a recap of 2015 and then update you on the trends we are currently seeing in the business segments. 
It's pretty clear that there were some tough macro headwinds in 2015. Double-digit foreign currency devaluations, some of the worst recessionary conditions on record in South America and a plummet in commodity prices created challenging conditions for industrial growth. Despite these events, our organization did what it does best, adapt to current conditions and take appropriate actions on things we can control. And while there were many accomplishments of our employees around the world to mitigate these challenges, I'd like to highlight 4 key areas. 
First, we continued our strong management of cost and price. This is a hallmark of the Praxair culture. We adjusted our cost structure in line with economic trends, saving over $75 million per year. We improved pricing levels in nearly every region of the world, and we delivered strong productivity results. All of these efforts were quite visible in the financial statements and led to record operating and EBITDA margins of 23.1% and 33.8%, respectively. 
Second, we prudently managed capital. We maintained our industry-leading return on capital and delivered one of the highest free cash flow results in company history by achieving 25% operating cash flow as a percentage of sales and trimming capital expenditures 9% from prior year. During 2015, we also raised the dividend 10% as part of the $1.5 billion returned to shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases. And we accomplished this without using leverage, as we held net debt flat. 
Third, we never lost sight of the priority for quality growth. We signed 6 large growth projects for about $700 million of investment, including the largest in company history, to extend our hydrogen and nitrogen pipeline complex in the U.S. Gulf Coast to supply the Yara-BASF joint venture. Acquisitions also played an important role, with around 15 accretive deals being closed or announced, including the European industrial gas business of Yara to help contribute another percent of global growth for the company. We recently announced the joint venture with GE Aviation to enhance our presence in the aerospace market and provide additional resilient growth prospects. And we continue to deploy our application technologies to find more usage for our products that enable our customers to increase productivity, lower costs and improve their environmental footprint. 
And finally, we recognized the cyclical shift in some of our end markets and quickly adapted with a series of actions and initiatives. The renewed focus on more resilient industries and synergistic acquisitions at a reasonable price will provide continued growth opportunities in a world that is cyclically weaker across many sectors. 
So collectively, these actions mitigated the current headwinds and better positioned the company for future earnings accretion when markets turn. But unfortunately, we're seeing many negative trends continue into 2016. 
When I look around at the current industrial state of the world, I don't see many things getting better, and a few are getting a little worse. The combination of excess supply and reduced demand continues to put strain on several industrial end markets. However, we have exclusive customer supply contracts with our cylinders, tanks and pipelines that are located at customer sites. The challenge is that we are replenishing the gases to these assets at a lower frequency due to our customers' lower production rates. But consistent with other prior industrial cycles, this will eventually turn and improve. 
In North America, the impact of lower hydrocarbon pricing continues to pressure many industries, including mining, oil and gas, railcar production, heavy equipment and general manufacturing. Furthermore, the stronger dollar has put additional strain on the U.S. manufacturing competitiveness. These negative trends can be seen in recent industrial production and PMI reports. However, we continue to see good demand in consumer-oriented sectors like food, beverage, automotive, health care, refining and chemicals. The U.S. Gulf Coast petrochemical buildout still provides good opportunities for new on-site contracts, and we are pursuing several bids, of which we expect to convert to new supply contracts soon. 
South America has not improved but rather worsened, which is consistent with our expectations. The combination of political turmoil in Brazil and the seasonal outages significantly curtailed volumes, which will likely continue into Q1 for the Carnival holiday and possibly beyond. I believe the election results in countries like Venezuela and Argentina will bode well for future business opportunities, but it will take some time to see any impact on the ground. We continue to take appropriate actions to preserve the quality of the business, but frankly, South America is becoming less and less of a component of our consolidated results due to the severe currency devaluation. So the potential downside impact is less than prior years. 
Europe is stable and slightly growing in several regions. Commodity-consuming nations like Germany, Spain, Benelux and Italy have benefited from the lower cost of oil and weaker euro. This is evidenced by the strong growth we are seeing in our Port of Antwerp pipeline expansion such as the recently announced Total contract. In addition to the positive growth across both cyclical and noncyclical industries, commodity-producing nations like Russia and those in Scandinavia are negatively feeling the effects, but we have partnered with some of the most competitive and lowest-cost producers in the world. So they're still running their assets in this environment, and we anticipate that to continue. 
Asia segment trends are quite different depending upon the country. Thailand and India continue to perform well, and we're seeing strong pockets of growth in both countries. Korean growth is primarily focused on the electronics industry, which has been in a strong cycle for a few years now, although certain areas are projected to slow. And China is the country getting the most press these days. Clearly, you have a situation of excess capacity across most infrastructure-supporting industries like steel, glass and cement. We've been seeing softness in those areas for a few quarters now, and that will likely continue for 2016. Consumer-related industries are still performing well in China, as we continue to see good demand for things like transportation fuels, food, health care, environmental solutions and plastics. Examples include our new project startup with Yangquan and a recent project signing with CNOOC. So we'll have to see how China performs this year, but the underlying growth rates will be lower than what we saw in prior years. 
So when you sum it up, we're just not seeing much improvement from the current weak industrial run rates. Given that, our strategic focus that we laid out over the past several months is still valid in this environment, and you can find that on Page 3. 
This slide shows the key elements of our focus to grow earnings and cash flow regardless of the underlying economic conditions, and we are still on track. 
Starting with the bar at the top. We're currently benefiting from the cost restructuring actions taken mid last year. And we continue to find new price and cost opportunities throughout our business. These are, and will, continue to contribute positive EPS growth. 
On the second bar, we are proceeding well regarding synergistic acquisitions. We still expect to execute $500 million to $600 million of acquisitions this year, with over half already announced. Most of these are in developed markets or more resilient industries, which will help enhance and insulate our business portfolio from some of the current cyclical trends. And we expect strong project backlog contribution for 2017 as several of our large, fixed-fee projects are slated to start in that year. 
So we've mapped the path to growth for our earnings, but for 2016, it's not enough to offset the combination of foreign currency headwind and the current trend of negative underlying volumes. I'll cover this further, including guidance, at the end of the prepared remarks. But first, Kelcey can provide some more details on our financial performance for 2015."

Overall sales were $10.8 billion, steady with the prior year, excluding currency and cost pass-through. Price attainment contributed 1% growth and was achieved in all reporting segments. Volume growth from projects was about half weighted towards Asia, with the remainder of the contribution in Europe and North America. The full year volume decline, net of project contribution, was driven by weaker base volumes in the Americas, primarily in the upstream energy, manufacturing and metals end markets. Globally, food and beverage, health care and aerospace end markets were positive with low to mid-single-digit organic growth. 
We completed a number of small industrial gas acquisitions during the year that contributed about 1% to the overall growth of Praxair. These synergistic acquisitions will continue to enhance our production network density in all operating segments. 
Operating profit of $2.5 billion grew 1% year-over-year, excluding foreign currency, from higher pricing, cost actions and acquisitions. As a result, we grew full year EBITDA and operating margins to record levels. Earnings per share of $5.80 grew 3%, excluding foreign currency. 
Please turn to Slide 5 for an overview of cash flow. Through consistent capital and operational discipline, we generated strong operating cash flow of $2.7 billion for the year at 25% of sales. During 2015, $1.5 billion was prudently invested in CapEx for growth and density improvement. These investments are in our core regions and meet our disciplined investment criteria. More than half of the CapEx spent during 2015 occurred in North America, with the rest equally distributed to Asia, Europe and South America. During 2016, CapEx is expected to be even more weighted towards North America, given its larger share of the backlog. 
When our end markets and geographies are in lower growth cycles like today, we typically generate more free cash flow than periods of stronger capital investment since the majority of our capital spend is for growth projects that are only initiated with executed customer contracts. As a result, this morning, we announced a 5% increase to our quarterly dividend, which represents our 23rd consecutive annual increase. This is consistent with our policy to grow dividends each year. The remaining cash that we have after growth investments and dividends is directed towards share repurchases. During 2015, we reduced our outstanding share count by 2%. This was our sixth consecutive year of reducing the share count by at least 1%. 
Now please turn to Slide 6 for an overview of the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter sales were $2.6 billion and 1% lower than the prior year, excluding currency impacts and cost pass-through. Organic sales increased from higher pricing in most operating segments. Lower base volumes continued to be driven by the Americas, primarily in the manufacturing, upstream energy and metals end markets. This was partially offset by new volumes from project startups in Asia and Europe as well as global growth in refining, food and beverage, health care and aerospace end markets. Small acquisitions within all segments contributed 1% growth. 
By operating segment, North America's organic sales declined 3% year-over-year and 1% sequentially. The business achieved price improvement in the U.S., Mexico and Canada. Weaker volumes for manufacturing customers drove about half of the volume decline. This was primarily due to hard goods, as consumers are reducing investment in capital equipment given the uncertainty in demand and headwinds from imports with the strength of the U.S. dollar. The remaining volume softness was driven by upstream energy and metals, with metals down 16% organically year-over-year and 8% sequentially. This was partially mitigated by end market growth from refinery, health care and food and beverage customers. 
In Europe, organic sales grew 4% year-over-year and were down 1% sequentially. Year-over-year growth was primarily driven by price attainment in most countries, project contribution in Russia and higher base volumes in Spain. Sequential volume declines were primarily due to upstream energy customers. 
South America's underlying sales were down 1% year-over-year, as volume declines in most end markets were partially offset by price contribution, acquisition and growth in the health care and food and beverage end markets. Sequentially, volumes were down 6% due to further deteriorating industrial production and extended holiday shutdowns by customers in Brazil. This occurred in most end markets with the largest impact to manufacturing, which represents about 20% of Brazil sales. 
Underlying growth in Asia was 6% higher than last year and 2% higher sequentially, primarily driven by new project startups in China and India, growing carbon dioxide sales in Thailand and acquisitions. 
Surface Technologies organic growth was down 2% year-over-year, driven by energy and industrial end markets, and up 4% sequentially, driven by stronger aerospace coatings. 
Global consolidated operating profit was $624 million in the fourth quarter and grew 5% over the prior year, excluding foreign currency. We are seeing the benefits of our restructuring actions, price attainment and acquisitions. The fourth quarter operating profit and margin also benefited from a gain on sale in North America. Earnings per share of $1.47 grew 5% year-over-year, excluding currency. Operating cash flow was $791 million, represented 30% of sales and funded $387 million of capital expenditures. The company paid $204 million of dividend and repaid $203 million of debt to hold net debt steady for the year. 
Our project backlog, which we define as projects with CapEx greater than $5 million and associated with the fully executed customer supply contract, is currently $1.5 billion and comprised of 18 projects. During the fourth quarter, we signed 2 long-term contracts for new projects located in North America and Europe and started 2 projects in Asia. Existing backlog projects will start up and contribute to growth during 2016 through 2018, as shown on Slide 16. North America now reflects about 45% of the backlog. 
We continue to look selectively for tuck-in acquisitions in our core business, which are high-quality, low-risk properties where we can bring synergies to the business we are buying and we can achieve an attractive return on investment. During the fourth quarter, we bought 3 industrial gas businesses in the U.S. with multiple locations and combined sales of more than $20 million annually. And we increased ownership of an existing joint venture in Asia. 
And now I'll turn the call back to Matt who will discuss our outlook and earnings guidance for 2016."

Our full year guidance for 2016 is in the range of $5.30 to $5.70. While the entire range is below our 2015 EPS, it does include $0.42 or 7% anticipated headwind from foreign currency translation. On the lower right of this slide,",589,"Please turn to Page 6. Our full year guidance for 2016 is in the range of $5.30 to $5.70. While the entire range is below our 2015 EPS, it does include $0.42 or 7% anticipated headwind from foreign currency translation. 
On the lower right of this slide, you can see the average 2015 FX rates for some of our major currencies, which were all much stronger than what the current spot rates are today. Excluding the FX impact, we expect underlying EPS to grow to be a low of minus 2% to a high of plus 5%. There are a few key drivers that comprise this range. We expect to deliver positive EPS growth from our price, productivity and the 2015 cost actions. Many of these items are already completed, and we have a high level of confidence in our ability to continue to improve our earnings going forward through these company-specific actions. 
We also are expecting EPS accretion through our acquisitions and share buyback program. These are good examples of contribution from our capital allocation process. We have closed several synergistic acquisitions and anticipate completing a few more early this year, which will be immediately accretive to our results. These are primarily tuck-in acquisitions that serve more resilient markets and enhance our existing portfolio. 
In addition, our excess free cash flow has enabled us to consistently repurchase shares without increasing debt levels. So we also feel good about contribution from these areas as most of them are already completed. 
Product volume is really the key unknown factor and, in addition to foreign currency, will vary the most in the near term. You can see the range showing more downside risk than upside. The top end of this range represents our project volume startup, which we have good visibility into and assumes slightly positive underlying volume growth. The bottom end represents the same project growth but with current underlying volume trends of negative low to mid-single-digit percent. As I mentioned earlier, this volume is tied to our existing network of pipelines, tanks and cylinders. So the contracts and assets are in place, but we simply aren't supplying them at the same rate due to the slower demand environment. We'll continue to take actions to improve on this range, but this is our best estimate at this time. 
Turning to the first quarter. We are calling an EPS range of $1.20 to $1.28. This range is down 10% to 16% from last year, of which 9% relates to FX impact. So we're anticipating underlying EPS to be down 1% to 7%. While we have the full benefit of cost reductions in our results, we don't expect that to fully offset the lower volumes seen primarily in North and South America. 
We expect Q1 to be the weakest for 2016, given the normal seasonal impact, coupled with the abnormally low volume trends coming out of 2015. We saw extended seasonal outages during the fourth quarter, and we anticipate similar trends for the first quarter. 
The first half of 2016, especially the first quarter, will be more challenging than the back half. However, we have developed a strategy around this environment and have taken actions in anticipation of these trends. Our business usually leads these cycles, given the nature of our industry and end markets. And we expect to lead the recovery. And while near-term trends will be pressured, we'll continue to take prudent and appropriate actions for long-term shareholder value creation. 
I'd now like to open up the line for Q&A."

So we do have a gap in 2015 and '16 on project startups. Part of it are things like the Chevron project, as you recall, that we ultimately ended up selling that asset and as opposed to starting up as a sale of gas. But we expect '16 to be similar to '15."

And as you probably know, we generally feedstock -- we get the feedstock from various processes and industries. And given the situation in Brazil, from an industrial perspective, rates are so low on everything from refineries to ammonia plants, to chemical plants, that the CO2 sources now are actually going down for extended outage periods. So what's happening there is while we're still meeting the requirements that there are for food and beverage, it's causing us extra costs. We have to haul the product much further, dislocation costs. So yes, it's creating some inefficiencies in our system right now given our supply source outages. And it's just something we have to manage and live with. I do hope that some of these will come back stream here back in the first quarter. We're seeing a few begin to start up again. But that's something that impacted Q4, will impact Q1, and we'll have to see beyond that."

As far as the metals, that's primarily U.S. We are seeing some slower volumes from some of the import issues coming into the country as well as just some of the slowing demand on certain infrastructure projects. But Mexico, is mostly an energy issue that's played out in our results. It's been in our run rate now for a couple of quarters, almost a year. And excluding that, Mexico is still doing quite well. Canada is mostly an energy issue story, and that also has had some negative impact here over the last few quarters. There could be a little more risk going forward. Excluding that, Canada, on the eastern side of the country, it's doing fairly well due to the weak currency there. It's making their products more competitive.

And it's something that at its height as a segment, it was almost 20% of the operating profit of the entire company. Today, it's slightly above 10%. So we've seen these cycles go up and down on the segment. I mean, you look today, South America as a whole, as a percentage of the company, is approaching kind of 2003, 2004 levels. So I would say, if it continues on its path of shrinking, the shrinking is less severe than obviously coming off the peak in 2010, 2011. But if it does recover to kind of the levels we've seen in the past, that's pretty significant upside, both from a growth perspective in the top line but also the earnings because we tend to get pretty accretive growth when it recovers. So we'll have to see. As I mentioned earlier, I think you are seeing some positive developments in the government side, in countries like Argentina and Venezuela. It will take time to work through, but you're getting more business-friendly approaches in some of the governments there. I think Brazil has -- needs more time to work through their issues. 2016 will be another tough year. 2017, we'll have to see, but they do have an election in 2018.

I think, right now, that entire sector is just too much capacity. So there needs to be some rationalization, and I would see future investments in those areas being extremely limited. The other sector of the Chinese economy on the consumer side, there still are good investment opportunities. They tend to be smaller plants. They tend to be less capital-intensive. It could be things in environmental, in food. And that we continue to see good opportunities. But when I look at the steel capacity in China right now, our steel customers are, what I call, Tier 1. So these are the Baosteel type customers there. And they are very competitive globally. They're very well integrated and they can withstand these cycles. There are Tier 2 and Tier 3 steel mills that have been popped up all over the country, and those are the ones, I think, from a liquidity standpoint and a competitive standpoint are struggling. Now they just -- the Premier recently here announced their goal to take out about 100 million to 150 million tons a year capacity. And just to put that in perspective, that's like the entire capacity of the United States, but they are looking to rationalize and take that out, which I think would be great. I don't know when it will happen, but if that could be accelerated, that should be very beneficial on a couple fronts. It should reduce some of the steel production and some of the imports to other countries like the U.S., but it also should help on the liquid merchant front. So in my mind, if those are rationalized, we would not have an interest in those assets. I don't think they're viable, and you can't run the air separation plant without some baseload cost effectively. So I would rather sit back and wait, and let some of this rationalization happen that they've announced, and I think that will be beneficial and constructive for the market."

The large equipment, as you can imagine, it's very large numbers that come in lumpy. And when you see large equipment purchases like automatic welders or cutters, that's when things are usually going quite well, and the customer base is confident enough and, furthermore, their backlog is big enough that they want to invest in automation. So we saw a lot of that a year plus ago, primarily in the oil patch, but also in the whole center part of the country that served some of the manufacturing sectors that built pumps and rigs and other things for the oil patch. So we were seeing a lot of automated equipment being purchased and also just a function of -- a shortage of skilled laborers, skilled welders and so forth. So that part, we had to lap. The consumables is the one that can sometimes move right with gas. You're going to use so much wire and contact tips, usually as much gas as you use. So I would say the equipment has been a little bit of a front-end indicator. We see that now, it's just a function of some of the consumables and just some other hard goods that we personally are just not going to serve that market if the margins aren't worth our effort at this point."

As far as the multiples on tuck-in, we really haven't seen much change. As you can imagine, we've been pretty disciplined on how we look at multiples and what we're willing to pay. And clearly, there is a large potential buyer that's going to be in pause for a while here, but we haven't really seen much as far as valuations change on some of these deals."

As far as delays, most of our contracts have some type of date certain clause, which will ensure that if the project's delayed, we either get paid day 1 regardless or we get recovery through the fixed facility fee through a higher fee due to the time loss value. So we do have mechanisms to account for that. Of the projects that we have right now in the backlog, there's no material delays that we can see, but we do have some mechanisms -- now obviously, if the delay is due to us, that's a different issue. But these are more if it's the customer's reasons why the delay, we do have economic recovery mechanisms."

So we will take by-product from chlor alkali crackers, et cetera, and bring them into our system. Clearly, having the blend of both, we believe, is a nice benefit because it is a lower capital-intensive approach. But you do need both because you have to give certain reliability and quality standards to the customers you supply into. So this is part of what's always been our long-term strategy in the hydrogen and syngas business, which is to have a combination of both on-purpose and sourcing. And it does help on the capital footprint. Now clearly, you need to make pipelines, you have to have compression, you have to have assets that can clean up the actual hydrogen source you're taking. It's usually not to the right purity that you need. But it's all part of our overall strategy, and it does help us deliver the reliability and quantity that we need for our customer base.

I'd like to kick off the call with a recap of 2015 and then update you on the trends we are currently seeing in the business segments. It's pretty clear that there were some tough macro headwinds in 2015. Doub",1338,"Thanks, Kelcey, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to kick off the call with a recap of 2015 and then update you on the trends we are currently seeing in the business segments. 
It's pretty clear that there were some tough macro headwinds in 2015. Double-digit foreign currency devaluations, some of the worst recessionary conditions on record in South America and a plummet in commodity prices created challenging conditions for industrial growth. Despite these events, our organization did what it does best: adapt to current conditions and take appropriate actions on things we can control. And while there were many accomplishments of our employees around the world to mitigate these challenges, I'd like to highlight 4 key areas. 
First, we continued our strong management of cost and price. This is a hallmark of the Praxair culture. We adjusted our cost structure in line with economic trends, saving over $75 million per year. We improved pricing levels in nearly every region of the world, and we delivered strong productivity results. All of these efforts were quite visible in the financial statements and led to record operating and EBITDA margins of 23.1% and 33.8%, respectively. 
Second, we prudently managed capital. We maintained our industry-leading return on capital and delivered one of the highest free cash flow results in company history by achieving 25% operating cash flow as a percentage of sales and trimming capital expenditures 9% from prior year. During 2015, we also raised the dividend 10% as part of a $1.5 billion returned to shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases. And we accomplished this without using leverage, as we held net debt flat. 
Third, we never lost sight of the priority for quality growth. We signed 6 large growth projects for about $700 million of investment, including the largest in company history, to extend our hydrogen and nitrogen pipeline complex in the U.S. Gulf Coast to supply the Yara-BASF joint venture. Acquisitions also played an important role, with around 15 accretive deals being closed or announced, including the European industrial gas business of Yara to help contribute another percent of global growth for the company. We recently announced the joint venture with GE Aviation to enhance our presence in the aerospace market and provide additional resilient growth prospects. And we continue to deploy our application technologies to find more uses for our products that enable our customers to increase productivity, lower costs and improve their environmental footprint. 
And finally, we recognized the cyclical shift in some of our end markets and quickly adapted with a series of actions and initiatives. The renewed focus on more resilient industries and synergistic acquisitions at a reasonable price will provide continued growth opportunities in a world that is cyclically weaker across many sectors. 
So collectively, these actions mitigated the current headwinds and better positioned the company for future earnings accretion when markets turn. But unfortunately, we're seeing many negative trends continue into 2016. 
When I look around at the current industrial state of the world, I don't see many things getting better, and a few are getting a little worse. The combination of excess supply and reduced demand continues to put strain on several industrial end markets. However, we have exclusive customer supply contracts with our cylinders, tanks and pipelines that are located at customer sites. The challenge is that we are replenishing the gases to these assets at a lower frequency due to our customers' lower production rates. But consistent with other prior industrial cycles, this will eventually turn and improve. 
In North America, the impact of lower hydrocarbon pricing continues to pressure many industries, including mining, oil and gas, railcar production, heavy equipment and general manufacturing. Furthermore, the stronger dollar has put additional strain on the U.S. manufacturing competitiveness. These negative trends can be seen in recent industrial production and PMI reports. However, we continue to see good demand in consumer-oriented sectors like food, beverage, automotive, health care, refining and chemicals. The U.S. Gulf Coast petrochemical buildout still provides good opportunities for new on-site contracts, and we are pursuing several bids, of which we expect to convert to new supply contracts soon. 
South America has not improved but rather worsened, which is consistent with our expectations. The combination of political turmoil in Brazil and the seasonal outages significantly curtailed volumes, which will likely continue into Q1 for the Carnival holiday and possibly beyond. I believe the election results in countries like Venezuela and Argentina will bode well for future business opportunities, but it will take some time to see any impact on the ground. We continue to take appropriate actions to preserve the quality of the business, but frankly, South America is becoming less and less of a component of our consolidated results due to the severe currency devaluation. So the potential downside impact is less than prior years. 
Europe is stable and slightly growing in several regions. Commodity-consuming nations like Germany, Spain, Benelux and Italy have benefited from the lower cost of oil and weaker euro. This is evidenced by the strong growth we are seeing in our Port of Antwerp pipeline expansion such as the recently announced Total contract. In addition to the positive growth across both cyclical and noncyclical industries, commodity-producing nations like Russia and those in Scandinavia are negatively feeling the effects, but we have partnered with some of the most competitive and lowest-cost producers in the world. So they're still running their assets in this environment, and we anticipate that to continue. 
Asia segment trends are quite different depending upon the country. Thailand and India continue to perform well, and we're seeing strong pockets of growth in both countries. Korean growth is primarily focused on the electronics industry, which has been in a strong cycle for a few years now, although certain areas are projected to slow. And China is the country getting the most press these days. Clearly, you have a situation of excess capacity across most infrastructure-supporting industries like steel, glass and cement. We've been seeing softness in those areas for a few quarters now, and that will likely continue for 2016. Consumer-related industries are still performing well in China, as we continue to see good demand for things like transportation fuels, food, health care, environmental solutions and plastics. Examples include our new project startup with Yankuang and a recent project signing with CNOOC. So we'll have to see how China performs this year, but the underlying growth rates will be lower than what we saw in prior years. 
So when you sum it up, we're just not seeing much improvement from the current weak industrial run rates. Given that, our strategic focus that we laid out over the past several months is still valid in this environment, and you can find that on Page 3. 
This slide shows the key elements of our focus to grow earnings and cash flow regardless of the underlying economic conditions, and we are still on track. 
Starting with the bar at the top. We're currently benefiting from the cost restructuring actions taken mid last year, and we continue to find new price and cost opportunities throughout our business. These are, and will, continue to contribute positive EPS growth. 
On the second bar, we are proceeding well regarding synergistic acquisitions. We still expect to execute $500 million to $600 million of acquisitions this year, with over half already announced. Most of these are in developed markets or more resilient industries, which will help enhance and insulate our business portfolio from some of the current cyclical trends. And we expect strong project backlog contribution for 2017 as some of our large, fixed-fee projects are slated to start in that year. 
So we've mapped the path to growth for our earnings, but for 2016, it's not enough to offset the combination of foreign currency headwind and the current trend of negative underlying volumes. I'll cover this further, including guidance, at the end of the prepared remarks. But first, Kelcey can provide some more details on our financial performance for 2015."

Please turn to Slide 4 for an overview of the full year. Overall sales were $10.8 billion, steady with the prior year, excluding currency and cost pass-through.

Overall sales were $10.8 billion, steady with the prior year, excluding currency and cost pass-through. Price attainment contributed 1% growth and was achieved in all reporting segments. Volume growth from projects was about half weighted towards Asia, with the remainder of the contribution in Europe and North America. The full year volume decline, net of project contribution, was driven by weaker base volumes in the Americas, primarily in the upstream energy, manufacturing and metals end markets. Globally, food and beverage, health care and aerospace end markets were positive with low to mid-single-digit organic growth. 
We completed a number of small industrial gas acquisitions during the year that contributed about 1% to the overall growth of Praxair. These synergistic acquisitions will continue to enhance our production network density in all operating segments. 
Operating profit of $2.5 billion grew 1% year-over-year, excluding foreign currency, from higher pricing, cost actions and acquisitions. As a result, we grew full year EBITDA and operating margins to record levels. Earnings per share of $5.80 grew 3%, excluding foreign currency. 
Please turn to Slide 5 for an overview of cash flow. Through consistent capital and operational discipline, we generated strong operating cash flow of $2.7 billion for the year at 25% of sales. During 2015, $1.5 billion was prudently invested in CapEx for growth and density improvement. These investments are in our core regions and meet our disciplined investment criteria. More than half of the CapEx spent during 2015 occurred in North America, with the rest equally distributed to Asia, Europe and South America. During 2016, CapEx is expected to be even more weighted towards North America, given its larger share of the backlog. 
When our end markets and geographies are in lower growth cycles like today, we typically generate more free cash flow than periods of stronger capital investment since the majority of our capital spend is for growth projects that are only initiated with executed customer contracts. As a result, this morning, we announced a 5% increase to our quarterly dividend, which represents our 23rd consecutive annual increase. This is consistent with our policy to grow dividends each year. The remaining cash that we have after growth investments and dividends is directed towards share repurchases. During 2015, we reduced our outstanding share count by 2%. This was our sixth consecutive year of reducing the share count by at least 1%. 
Now please turn to Slide 6 for an overview of the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter sales were $2.6 billion and 1% lower than the prior year, excluding currency impacts and cost pass-through. Organic sales increased from higher pricing in most operating segments. Lower base volumes continued to be driven by the Americas, primarily in the manufacturing, upstream energy and metals end markets. This was partially offset by new volumes from project startups in Asia and Europe as well as global growth in refining, food and beverage, health care and aerospace end markets. Small acquisitions within all segments contributed 1% growth. 
By operating segment, North America's organic sales declined 3% year-over-year and 1% sequentially. The business achieved price improvement in the U.S., Mexico and Canada. Weaker volumes from manufacturing customers drove about half of the volume decline. This was primarily due to hard goods, as customers are reducing investment in capital equipment given the uncertainty in demand and headwinds from imports with the strength of the U.S. dollar. The remaining volume softness was driven by upstream energy and metals, with metals down 16% organically year-over-year and 8% sequentially. This was partially mitigated by end market growth from refinery, health care and food and beverage customers. 
In Europe, organic sales grew 4% year-over-year and were down 1% sequentially. Year-over-year growth was primarily driven by price attainment in most countries, project contribution in Russia and higher base volumes in Spain. Sequential volume declines were primarily due to upstream energy customers. 
South America's underlying sales were down 1% year-over-year, as volume declines in most end markets were partially offset by price contribution, acquisition and growth in the health care and food and beverage end markets. Sequentially, volumes were down 6% due to further deteriorating industrial production and extended holiday shutdowns by customers in Brazil. This occurred in most end markets with the largest impact in manufacturing, which represents about 20% of Brazil sales. 
Underlying growth in Asia was 6% higher than last year and 2% higher sequentially, primarily driven by new project startups in China and India, growing carbon dioxide sales in Thailand and acquisitions. 
Surface Technologies organic growth was down 2% year-over-year, driven by energy and industrial end markets, and up 4% sequentially, driven by stronger aerospace coatings. 
Global consolidated operating profit was $624 million in the fourth quarter and grew 5% over the prior year, excluding foreign currency. We are seeing the benefits of our restructuring actions, price attainment and acquisitions. The fourth quarter operating profit and margin also benefited from a gain on sale in North America. Earnings per share of $1.47 grew 5% year-over-year, excluding currency. Operating cash flow was $791 million, represented 30% of sales and funded $387 million of capital expenditures. The company paid $204 million of dividend and repaid $203 million of debt to hold net debt steady for the year. 
Our project backlog, which we define as projects with CapEx greater than $5 million and associated with a fully executed customer supply contract, is currently $1.5 billion and comprised of 18 projects. During the fourth quarter, we signed 2 long-term contracts for new projects located in North America and Europe and started 2 projects in Asia. Existing backlog projects will start up and contribute to growth during 2016 through 2018, as shown on Slide 16. North America now reflects about 45% of the backlog. 
We continue to look selectively for tuck-in acquisitions in our core business, which are high-quality, low-risk properties where we can bring synergies to the business we are buying and we can achieve an attractive return on investment. During the fourth quarter, we bought 3 industrial gas businesses in the U.S. with multiple locations and combined sales of more than $20 million annually. And we increased ownership of an existing joint venture in Asia. 
And now I'll turn the call back to Matt who will discuss our outlook and earnings guidance for 2016."
318049,321859001,956013,"Praxair Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 29, 2016",2016-01-29,"Earnings Calls","Linde plc","Executives","Please turn to Page 6. Our full year guidance for 2016 is in the range of $5.30 to $5.70. While the entire range is below our 2015 EPS, it does include $0.42 or 7% anticipated headwind from foreign currency translation. The lower right of this slide, yo",588,"Please turn to Page 6. Our full year guidance for 2016 is in the range of $5.30 to $5.70. While the entire range is below our 2015 EPS, it does include $0.42 or 7% anticipated headwind from foreign currency translation. 
The lower right of this slide, you can see the average 2015 FX rates for some of our major currencies, which were all much stronger than what the current spot rates are today. Excluding the FX impact, we expect underlying EPS to grow to be a low of minus 2% to a high of plus 5%. There are a few key drivers that comprise this range. We expect to deliver positive EPS growth from our price, productivity and the 2015 cost actions. Many of these items are already completed, and we have a high level of confidence in our ability to continue to improve our earnings going forward through these company-specific actions. 
We also are expecting EPS accretion through our acquisitions and share buyback program. These are good examples of contribution from our capital allocation process. We have closed several synergistic acquisitions and anticipate completing a few more early this year, which will be immediately accretive to our results. These are primarily tuck-in acquisitions that serve more resilient markets and enhance our existing portfolio. 
In addition, our excess free cash flow has enabled us to consistently repurchase shares without increasing debt levels. So we also feel good about contribution from these areas as most of them are already completed. 
Product volume is really the key unknown factor and, in addition to foreign currency, will vary the most in the near term. You can see the range showing more downside risk than upside. The top end of this range represents our project volume startup, which we have good visibility into and assumes slightly positive underlying volume growth. The bottom end represents the same project growth but with current underlying volume trends of negative low to mid-single-digit percent. As I mentioned earlier, this volume is tied to our existing network of pipelines, tanks and cylinders. So the contracts and assets are in place, but we simply aren't supplying them at the same rate due to the slower demand environment. We'll continue to take actions to improve on this range, but this is our best estimate at this time. 
Turning to the first quarter. We are calling an EPS range of $1.20 to $1.28. This range is down 10% to 16% from last year, of which 9% relates to FX impact. So we're anticipating underlying EPS to be down 1% to 7%. While we have the full benefit of cost reductions in our results, we don't expect that to fully offset the lower volumes seen primarily in North and South America. 
We expect Q1 to be the weakest for 2016, given the normal seasonal impact, coupled with the abnormally low volume trends coming out of 2015. We saw extended seasonal outages during the fourth quarter, and we anticipate similar trends for the first quarter. 
The first half of 2016, especially the first quarter, will be more challenging than the back half. However, we have developed a strategy around this environment and have taken actions in anticipation of these trends. Our business usually leads these cycles, given the nature of our industry and end markets. And we expect to lead the recovery. And while near-term trends will be pressured, we'll continue to take prudent and appropriate actions for long-term shareholder value creation. 
I'd now like to open up the line for Q&A."

So we do have a gap in 2015 and '16 on project startups. Part of it are things like the Chevron project, as you recall, that we ultimately ended up selling that asset and as opposed to starting up as a sale of gas. But I would expect '16 to be similar to '15."

And as you probably know, we generally feedstock -- we get the feedstock from various processes and industries. And given the situation in Brazil, from an industrial perspective, rates are so low on everything from refineries to ammonia plants, to chemical plants, that the CO2 sources now are actually going down for extended outage periods. So what's happening there is while we're still meeting the requirements that there are for food and beverage, it's causing us extra costs. We have to haul the product much further, dislocation costs. So yes, it's creating some inefficiencies in our system right now given our supply source outages. And it's just something we have to manage and live with. I do hope that some of these will come back stream here back end of first quarter. We're seeing a few begin to start up again. But that's something that impacted Q4, will impact Q1, and we'll have to see beyond that."

And also we're just electing not to sell some of these hard goods, given the margins are just not attractive to us at this time. As far as the metals, that's primarily U.S. We are seeing some slower volumes from some of the import issues coming into the country as well as just some of the slowing demand on certain infrastructure projects. But Mexico is mostly an energy issue that's played out in our results. It's been in our run rate now for a couple of quarters, almost a year. And excluding that, Mexico is still doing quite well. Canada is mostly an energy issue story, and that also has had some negative impact here over the last few quarters. There could be a little more risk going forward. Excluding that, Canada, on the eastern side of the country, it's doing fairly well due to the weak currency there. It's making their products more competitive. But I would say most of the challenges you've seen in the U.S. are either related to the strong dollar, which is hurting the manufacturing, or the impact of the energy metal side that's working its way through the supply system."

And it's something that at its height as a segment, it was almost 20% of the operating profit of the entire company. Today, it's slightly above 10%. So we've seen these cycles go up and down on the segment. When you look today, South America as a whole, as a percentage of the company, is approaching kind of 2003, 2004 levels. So I would say, if it continues on its path of shrinking, the shrinking is less severe than obviously coming off the peak in 2010, 2011. But if it does recover to kind of the levels we've seen in the past, that's pretty significant upside, both from a growth perspective in the top line but also the earnings because we tend to get pretty accretive growth when it recovers. So we'll have to see. As I mentioned earlier, I think you are seeing some positive developments in the government side, in countries like Argentina and Venezuela. It will take time to work through, but you're getting more business-friendly approaches in some of the governments there.

It could be things in environmental, in food. In that, we continue to see good opportunities. But when I look at the steel capacity in China right now, our steel customers are, what I call, Tier 1. So these are the Baosteel type customers there. And they are very competitive globally. They're very well integrated and they can withstand these cycles. There are Tier 2 and Tier 3 steel mills that have been popped up all over the country, and those are the ones, I think, from a liquidity standpoint and a competitive standpoint are struggling. Now they just -- the Premier recently here announced their goal to take out about 100 million to 150 million tons a year capacity. And just to put that in perspective, that's like the entire capacity of the United States, but they are looking to rationalize and take that out, which I think would be great. I don't know when it will happen, but if that could be accelerated, that should be very beneficial on a couple fronts. It should reduce some of the steel production and some of the imports to other countries like the U.S., but it also should help on the liquid merchant front. So in my mind, if those are rationalized, we would not have an interest in those assets. I don't think they're viable, and you can't run the air separation plant without some baseload cost effectively. So I would rather sit back and wait and let some of this rationalization happen that they've announced, and I think that will be beneficial and constructive for the market."

So I do think some of the backlog that is declining a bit is being replaced by acquisitions. I kind of look at both of them equally in terms of avenues to invest capital to grow. So it is going down a bit, but acquisitions are stepping up a bit. And we've seen this in some of the cycles before.

But I characterize hard goods into 2 basic buckets: you have large equipment and then you have consumables. The large equipment, as you can imagine, it's very large numbers that come in lumpy. And when you see large equipment purchases like automatic welders or cutters, that's when things are usually going quite well, and the customer base is confident enough and, furthermore, their backlog is big enough that they want to invest in automation. So we saw a lot of that a year plus ago, primarily in the oil patch, but also in the whole center part of the country that served some of the manufacturing sectors that build pumps and rigs and other things for the oil patch. So we were seeing a lot of automated equipment being purchased and also just a function of a shortage of skilled laborers, skilled welders and so forth. So that part, we had to lap. The consumables is the one that can sometimes move right with gas. You're going to use so much wire and contact tips, usually as much gas as you use. So I would say the equipment has been a little bit of a front-end indicator. We've seen that. Now it's just a function of some of the consumables and just some other hard goods that we personally are just not going to serve that market if the margins aren't worth our effort at this point."

So we will take by-product from chlor alkali crackers, et cetera, and bring them into our system. Clearly, having the blend of both, we believe, is a nice benefit because it is a lower capital-intensive approach.

So this is part of what's always been our long-term strategy in the hydrogen and syngas business, which is to have a combination of both on-purpose and sourcing. And it does help on the capital footprint. Now clearly, you need to make pipelines. You have to have compression. You have to have assets that can clean up the actual hydrogen source you're taking. It's usually not to the right purity that you need. But it's all part of our overall strategy, and it does help us deliver the reliability and quantity that we need for our customer base.

Global volume trends we",1103,"Good morning, everyone, and thanks for attending. First quarter EPS finished at $1.28, which was at the higher end of our expectations. Cost management and foreign exchange rates in March were better than we originally anticipated. Global volume trends were a bit mixed as we saw certain end markets improving, with others remaining at fairly low levels. By the second half of this year, we will start to lap some of the more difficult prior-year comparisons. So I anticipate year-over-year trends should improve. 
Starting in North America, volumes were weaker across our major industrial end markets of energy, metals, chemicals and manufacturing. Chemicals and downstream energy were primarily driven by extensive turnaround activity in the U.S. Gulf Coast, which we expect to improve over the next few quarters. Metals, manufacturing and upstream energy trends have been driven by the commodity price collapse, coupled with the strong dollar impact to our U.S. market. I expect upstream energy to remain fairly sluggish, as most wells are not being completed, therefore deferring the need for any nitrogen. We have seen some recent uptick in our steel customers, as a combination of import duties and lower inventories have resulted in higher production volumes. On the manufacturing front, while we've seen some sequential improvement in our on-site and merchant business units, U.S. packaged gas volumes have still been quite weak, especially hardgoods. In fact, U.S. hardgoods alone are driving our volumes down a full percentage point on the global results. Part of this is from weaker demand due to the slower investment cycle, and part from us not participating in some low-margin hardgood business. We've seen this late cycle reaction in our PDI business in the past, so it seems consistent with our prior experience. Looking forward, we may have a few more quarters to go with difficult U.S. packaged gas conditions, but the on-site and merchant businesses seem to be improving modestly. Canada continues to improve in the eastern part of the country from a weaker Canadian dollar, especially in the food, manufacturing and health care end markets, while the west and north continue to struggle from low commodity pricing. And excluding the energy market, Mexico is growing mid-single digits from a weak peso and a very strong manufacturing base. In South America, the volume decline appears to be stabilizing, but it's quite difficult to predict anything there right now. While there has been a flurry of financial market activity related to the political situation in Brazil, we really haven't seen much change on the ground regarding industrial activity. We did see some sequential volume improvement in merchant and packaged gases off a very weak fourth quarter. Brazilian markets of health care and food and beverage are growing double digits from prior year, while industrial markets continue to struggle. We're achieving mid-single-digit pricing in our merchant and packaged gas businesses but it isn't enough to overcome current inflation. So we are initiating new price actions for this year and continuing our cost containment efforts. Margins have eroded from a combination of lower volumes, higher cost and continued excess dislocation costs from CO2 sourced outages. First quarter is always the weakest due to Carnaval and summer holiday but we did see volumes pick up in March and we anticipate further seasonal growth into the second quarter. Europe has been steadily improving each quarter. Year-over-year volumes have increased a few percentage points, supported by project startups and some volume growth in Southern Europe. Almost all end markets are up over last year, with the exception of upstream energy. We've been able to capitalize this and achieve a steady improvement in operating margins, up to 19.4% for the quarter. We anticipate second quarter volumes will sequentially increase from project startups and the Yara acquisition. This acquisition will significantly grow our supply network and density for CO2, serving key Brazilian markets throughout continental Europe. In our Asia segment, we continue to see mid-single digit volume growth but a challenging price environment in China. The first quarter is seasonally the weakest in Asia due to the Lunar New Year, yet we still were able to achieve 6% volume growth, primarily from project startups. In China, industrial end markets continue to be plagued with overcapacity as the economy attempts to shift to more consumer and service-driven growth. We haven't seen much impact yet on steel capacity reduction, but we feel good about our Tier 1 steel customers as they continue to run their operations throughout this period. Other infrastructure-related industries are also struggling as capacity is being rationalized, so we have seen our glass customers lower their production rates. And while Western expansion of coal to liquid projects has been significantly curtailed, we have limited our exposure there and instead focused on coal to chemical projects with highly competitive customers in the East. As such, chemical and electronic markets are growing well, and we are increasing our focus toward food, health care and environmental applications.  Our Indian business is growing mid-single digits driven by combination of project startups and stronger industrial activity. Korea performed as expected from consumer electronic trends, and our Thai business has been growing in the food and transportation end markets. 
I'll wrap it up with our Surface Technologies business, which, as you all know, is a global business. PST serves 3 key end markets, aerospace, energy and industrial. The energy business has weighed negatively on the results due to collapse in oil price and subsequent reduction in coatings for oilfield equipment, although we have recently seen positive trends for coatings to industrial gas turbines. Industrial segment growth rate have also been lower due to global trends. Aerospace however continues to be a bright spot through our strong customer partnerships and air travel trends. We also have seen very high growth rates in our metal powders business serving the 3D printing market. Finally, we expect to start up our GE Aviation joint venture by middle of this year, which should improve the business growth rates. 
On balance, I'll say our first quarter trends was slightly better than we expected. We still have several challenged end markets and late cycle laggers, but we are seeing some positive volume trends in key geographies. And while our EPS is still down year-over-year from a combination of negative foreign currency translation and softer volumes, this is the second quarter in a row that our operating cash flow has grown over prior year. Furthermore, we continue to tightly manage our CapEx spending, resulting in 100% increase in first quarter free cash flow. 
I'll now hand it over to Kelcey to walk through the financial results."

Overall sales were $2.5 billion, 1% lower than last year, excluding currency and cost pass-through. Price attainment contributed 1% growth and was achieved in most reporting segments. The majority of volume growth from new project startups occurred in Asia, with the remainder of revenue contribution largely in Europe. We continue to see solid growth at the more resilient end markets globally with food and beverage and health care growing 7% and 3% respectively. The volume decline year-over-year net of project contribution was primarily driven by weaker base volumes in North America, largely in the energy, manufacturing and metals end markets. Sequentially, volumes were down 1% versus the fourth quarter as the improvement in South America was offset by seasonal declines in Asia and the timing of customer turnaround in North America. 
By operating segment, North America organic sales declined 4% year-over-year and 2% sequentially. The business achieved price improvement from merchant and packaged gases. Weaker packaged gas volumes drove about half of the 5% volume decline, largely hardgoods. The remaining volume softness included continued lower upstream energy and metal sales year-over-year. In addition, chemical and refinery volumes were negatively impacted by the timing of customer turnarounds. Sequentially, organic growth to metals and manufacturing customers was more than offset by the impact of customer turnarounds, as well as modest further weakness in packaged gases. In Europe, organic sales grew 2% year-over-year and were down 2% sequentially. Year-over-year growth was primarily driven by project contribution in Russia and higher base volumes in Southern Europe. Sequential volume declines include the seasonal impact of the Easter holiday, as well as further weakness in upstream energy. South America's organic sales grew 1% year-over-year as price attainment offset the impact of lower volumes. Year-over-year volumes again outperformed local industrial production as growth in health care and food and beverage mitigated volume declines and manufacturing. Sequentially, organic growth of 8% included 3% from new price actions, as well as volume growth from health care, food and beverage, and even a modest improvement in manufacturing off of a very weak fourth quarter base. 
Organic sales in Asia were 5% higher than last year, primarily driven by new project startups in China to chemical customers and in India to metals customers. Sequentially, volumes included the seasonal impact of Lunar New Year. Surface Technologies organic sales were down 5% year-over-year and 2% sequentially, driven by energy and industrial end markets. Operating profit of $554 million was down 4% from the prior-year period, excluding currency. Higher pricing increased operating profit but was more than offset by lower volumes. Operating margin was 22.1% and the EBITDA margin grew 30 basis points to 33.3%. Earnings per share of $1.28 was down 3% excluding foreign currency. Through relentless operational discipline, we generated strong operating cash flow of $547 million, 22% of sales. This funded acquisitions of $63 million and capital expenditures of $323 million, about 65% of which was in North America given its greater share of projects in the backlog. In addition, the company paid $240 million of dividend. 
Our capital allocation process is consistent and disciplined. The remaining cash that we have after growth investments and dividends is directed towards stock repurchases. We continue to expect to spend approximately $500 million on acquisitions this year, including the Yara European carbon dioxide assets and the purchase of the remaining shares in our Yara Praxair joint venture. Given that we anticipate more capital will be allocated towards accretive acquisitions, we have temporarily reduced our stock repurchases. Our project backlog, which we define as projects with CapEx greater than $5 million and associated with the fully executed customer supply contract, is currently $1.5 billion comprised of 17 projects. During the first quarter, we added a project located in the U.S. Gulf Coast region for expansion of carbon monoxide supply to the chemical end market and starting projects in South America and Europe. Existing backlog projects will start up and contribute to growth during 2016 through 2018 as shown on Slide 13. North America continues to reflect about 55% in the backlog. 
And now I'll turn the call back to Matt to discuss our earnings guidance located on Slide #5."

It's safe to say that FX markets are volatile and likely will remain that way for the foreseeable future. In years past, we were able to rely on spot and forward rates as good indicators for near-term future rates, and thus incorporated them into our guidance. However, these have not proven to be very useful over the last several quarters, as many currencies seem to be trading more in binary events than fundamentals. Speculation on political decisions or interest rate increases can move currency rates several percentage points in 1 day. In light of this, our current second quarter guidance reflects the recently improved foreign currency spot rates, but the back half of the year uses rates closer to first quarter average rates given the uncertainty. 
For the second quarter guidance, we are estimating EPS in the range of $1.32 to $1.39. Sequentially, we are anticipating volumes to improve from a combination of seasonal patterns and current run rates from March. We still have some volume headwinds in specific end markets, but I anticipate prior-year comparisons will ease by the second half.  Looking at the full year, EPS guidance is in the range of $5.35 to $5.70. We raised the range $0.05 to account for updated currency impact for the first half, but we then took the top end back down $0.05 in light of the North American volume trends, primarily related to U.S. packaged gas volumes. I believe we have a few more quarters of this late cycle impact, which reduce some of the upside potential for the next 6 to 9 months.  Capital expenditures are anticipated to be $1.5 billion, which is consistent with our prior guidance. We continue to manage capital spending prudently, so I hoped to improve on this number. 
In summary, our first quarter ended a little better than expected. Some of the macroeconomic headwinds have started to stabilize, but one quarter doesn't make a trend. Overall, we are executing the strategy, to optimizing the base business, prudently allocate capital for profitable growth and manage the things within our control to create long-term, intangible shareholder value. 
I'd now like to open up the call for Q&A."

So if the assumption were that large capital expenditures of our customers would either be delayed or deferred into future years, then yes, our free cash flow would continue to grow. And you've seen that over the last 18 months, frankly. We've had some very high free cash flow numbers, and a lot of that's been attributed to the reduced CapEx spend. But when I do look at the project opportunities, we still do see some U.S. Gulf Coast, pretty large scale projects that we're working on diligently. So I'd say, as the projects are coming in, they will be larger and lumpier than they have in the past. We are seeing projects that tend to be both process and atmospheric gases. So you tend to have larger investment than I'd say some of the normal investments we've seen. But to your scenario yes lower CapEx will mean higher free cash flow, and if we're not spending it on acquisitions, which are clearly another synergistic growth area for us, we'll just continue to raise the dividends and use any excess for some buyback."

So I can't speak to those projects specifically. To your point, we did not participate in those projects. But what I would say we've seen on the ground in general is this. First of all, these are very high CapEx projects. They take a significant amount of capital for the gasifiers to basically gasify that coal and make whatever product you're looking to make. I think it's pretty clear and pretty well known that the liquidity situation for a lot of companies in China is not very strong. There's been a lot of stimulus that especially this most recent month or 2 that's not sustainable. So our view is if a project is permitted, there's a good chance it should be finished and built. For project that's not permitted in this space, I believe it probably will not get built in any foreseeable future. Then the question is, if it's built, will it run? Given the low coal price. And that's just the function, I think of the more profitable ones, with liquidity will run and the ones that may have some financial difficulties may or may not run. So that remains to be seen. But our customers that we supply, they're large global chemical players. They're mostly in integrated parks. So there's multiple integrated pet chem chain, and they continue to run."

North America's one of the few regions in the world where they have publicly announced price increases. You may have seen some, through the press releases, so we are getting some price in merchant.

However, there's also a mix hurt with less merchant going into energy, and what's called supplemental liquid that would go into places like metals that may run stronger or liquid argon that may go into places like stainless steel. So I'd say on balance, probably not a lot of mix effect. This is really more a function of the price increases. They are low-single digit and then when we show our price, it has a function of the entire revenue. So the number tends to show a little lower because you have on-site in the denominator and we don't count on-site as pricing. So we're still getting low single digit pricing in both packaged and merchant overall, and this I think pretty much reflects that."

With Lox, one area that's a headwind there is you tend to have, and I mentioned it earlier, supplemental oxygen on a liquid base as you can supply the steel mills. So when steel mills run very hard, especially areas like tubular steel, they'll actually take liquid in addition to any on-site oxygen they have. Clearly that, on a year-over-year basis is a headwind. Those volumes are definitely down. Similarly, Lin is the primary product that we put downhaul for fracturing in the Oilwell service business and that, from Canada to U.S. to Mexico, is down significantly, given the challenges in the upstream energy business and the low oil price. So those are both down significantly in those end markets. Excluding those, we are starting to see some pickup, areas that are resilient like Lin for food, CO2, which I know you didn't ask about, but CO2 was actually growing quite well. We've been securing a lot of sources for CO2, if that is a game that's all about very integrated supply chain, and we're seeing a lot of strength there in food and beverage, especially things like our new CO2 business usage there for carbonated beverages. But other than that, we're seeing some moderate growth in Lin/Lox if you exclude those 2 sort of cyclical demand areas. On the LAR front, stainless is a little bit down year-over-year, we have some strong stainless last year, so you got some comps here lapping there, and met fab is a little down, given the trends I spoke about in pediotic. So from that perspective, I'd say, LAR is down a bit, but LAR is still tight over all. As you imagine, when you have on-site customers that are oxygen baseloads running lower, you have to make more premium argon. So argon is still a tight product despite the volumes being down in some of the end markets. And then liquid hydrogen is something that continues to be quite strong, we have seen a lot of applications there, whether it's for space exploration or areas in some of the hydrogen powered things like fork trucks. So hydrogen continues to be a pretty good growth product as well."

This quarter is a little more difficult simply because you have Carnaval and you have summer holidays. So we always tend to see a few more customers even on a normal year excluding what's going on in the ground, get below end tops, similar with what you see in Asia with do you know you year, so that's what caused more seasonal dip. Put primarily steel customers, they are paying. And as you've seen from our numbers, we did see some sequential improvements especially from a very low December so I think that aspect has been pretty good. In fact, we have a couple of that below MTOP top last quarter and now they are above MTOP in Q1."

I think, Laurence, we are constantly reviewing our geographic portfolio around the world to evaluate, do we have the density that we believe to achieve the type of returns and the quality and reliability of the business model that we need. So that is always an ongoing effort. And as you stated, we entered into certain countries in the Middle East, and I would say the countries that we are in, we do have a fairly meaningful density model but not where we want it to be and we're not participating in Saudi Arabia, which is the largest country in the Middle East. So we continue to evaluate Middle East and see what options we want to take there, but that's something our portfolio will always evaluate. Russia is another area. We've been building some density given the situation in Russia today. We slowed that process down but we have built some pretty strong density in the Volga region as well as out in Katerinaberg and the assets that we do have on the ground there are running as expected and running fairly well. So those are 2 regions that we do see some opportunity to modify our portfolio one way or the other, but we'll continue to evaluate that. As far as Iran, we will clearly work with the U.S. situation there and what they allow with companies. But to say the least, the Europeans will have a head start on that just give in the U.S. relationship with Iran versus, I'd say, the European relationships will probably soften first. So we'll keep our eye on it, but it will be tough I think for American companies to get in there before any European companies."

So we haven't quite even have the anniversary of that yet, but that was a series of actions we took. And frankly before we took that action, people were asking us that same question. What can we do, we've seemed to have run out of levers. I'm not saying that we would go to another action of that nature. We feel that the actions we've taken are well in line with the market we're seeing, but I'd also say that we continually look for productivity opportunities. As the markets change, whether volumes go down or volumes go up, it makes new opportunities in our logistics management. You're seeing mill rates around the world change quite differently, and it makes projects, some cases more valuable, that we may have not done in prior years whether it's an increase or mill rates or in some cases, a decrease in mill rates. And so as the dynamics change on these type of input cost for us, if the dynamics change in terms of the customers we serve, it can create new productivity opportunities that may not have given us a sufficient return under prior scenarios. So we're always looking at these changes, we're always trying to evaluate how long they'll be like this, and we attempt to take a prudent action. But we've had to have a lot of productivity just to sustain the margin levels we have. Every time we lose volume, it falls in pretty high margins. So we need to take a lot of actions in productivity and pricing to negate that effect, and that's what we've been doing. So we look to continue to do that. I'm not anticipating any headcount action at this point given how we're seeing the markets, but I am anticipating we'll continue to push productivity the way we always have, and we'll continue to try and find some opportunities around that."

But the growth rates really is going to be a function of, I'll call it 4 basic things if you're looking at the top line, it will be price, and price tends to be, in my mind, more tied towards inflation. So if you do see some inflation here, that should help. We've seen in primaries with inflation, we have's in markets with inflation. It tends to be tied with acquisition activity. We are seeing more rollup opportunities in this environment, and we're an example of some of the acquisitions we're doing. And then it's a function of both projects and organic volume. So on the project side, it's clear backlogs are going down. Customers or potential customers are not making the capital investments they have. This is part of the cycle you see in the capital cycle. So that is something that if that returns or when that returns, especially in some industries that have been fairly muted for a while, like mining, heavy equipment and areas like that, that will give growth but if that doesn't return anytime soon, then that will be an area of growth that will still be a little sledges. And then finally, to your point, is this organic we usually use IPS a proxy. And to your point, what we have always found is emerging market IP multiples, almost always tend to be stronger than developed market IP growth multiples. And it makes logical sense because in an emerging market, it tends to be more infrastructure-related growth. You tend to have a lot more application related growth. That gets to that whole intensity of industrial gas per capita and that is a real thing we see. So when the emerging markets slowed and the commodity markets slowed, you saw a portion of the backlog projects be reduced as customers don't want to spend money. You saw the highest IP multiple markets be reduced, in fact, all negative, and the combination of those things really did make the, call algorithm Griffin weaker. But the question is the believe the emerging markets are out forever? I personally don't believe that, I think we're in cycles like in any other cycles. Some of the issues we have today are demand driven, there's 1 or 2 that might be supply driven but when it does rebound, you get back to those multiples you've seen and in prior years. Developed markets, in my mind, tend to be more closer to IP, a little bit above IP but that's kind of how I view it. So those are the factors of growth and right now, he has written a position where a lot of people are not making investment. Emerging markets are struggling and that's graded some dampening effect on our growth. But I do expect that will recover and return, when? I don't know but we've seen these cycles in the past."

It creates a very large supplier chain network of many various industrial companies that supply Petrobras directly and indirectly. So there are many customers that we supply that supply Petrobras. And clearly, they are not doing as well. A perfect example, still company that makes tubular steel, they're not making much anymore given Petrobras. But in my mind, the situation on that has been baked into our results for a year now. That's -- they are sort of negative reaction from carwash and some of the curtailment of several quarters. Has already been reflected in several quarters. I think when you look at Brazil now, a question we get is what's going on with the potential impeachment. Would that make any difference? And right now, we just don't know, we just don't know. Clearly, the financial markets have been reacting positively. If. You look at the riyal, if you look at the Belfast bar, but we haven't seen much industrial change yet. But I would say, on an overall basis, the fact that they are trying to roll out layers of corruption is a good thing, and that should position them well for a long-term improvement in the economy. Can you sing some positive developments in Argentina with Macri coming in, with his ability to resolve some of the bond situation, his ability to Fischer bond, is creating a positive effect, and renewed interest and Argentina. So I hope with Brazil, we can get over this hump but it still going to take time to play out and we'll have to see.

Italy has not been that strong, but I'd say, overall, for Europe, it's kind of continued to improve slowly, where we have the biggest headwind right now, has been in our upstream energy business, primarily around the North Sea and that has been a continual headwind. That's really offsetting some of the organic growth rates in the rest of continental Europe. So I'd say, when you exclude that upstream energy, we are getting organic growth in addition to our project contribution. So that part has been good. And you see some of it in the margins as well as we've been able to get the value of that volume contribution and capture with some improve margin. I'd say, Scandinavia in general is a little weaker, as you would imagine given it is an oil-based economy. We continue to see interest in investment and strong volumes in port of Antwerp area, which would make sense given the euro is a little weaker, given oil is a little lower and see shipping costs are much lower.

So with in the U.S., I would say, and we had this discussion a little bit earlier, there will be some mixed effect that could influence of that when you have some higher-margin sales that are going away and we have seen some of that. So that could negatively influence of that. But I would say pricing is still very, very regional, it is within a couple of hundred mile radius, and it tends to be a function of any contracts that may be renewing and/or new opportunities that could be coming up in that region, and it will just be a function of the product supply available for that. But it's a very, very small transaction by transaction, and that's why every time we continue to look at this, what we tend to see is at the top of the house, inflation tends to be a fairly good proxy for it. There are some regional differences that could be driven either by geographic differences will in the U.S., right, we're product might be tight or on the leisure. And there could be some industry perspectives where for example a certain end markets may get extreme high value out of the product and the pricing might be a little better than, say, another in markets where there are alternate substitutes, a be different than into Shell Gas. So from that perspective, I'd say it is not too different from what you've seen in other industries but given that contractual in nature and given the proximity of the supply, beyond the top of the house, inflation still tends to be a good proxy in my mind."

Clearly we continue to look at every market and we continue to look at it from a return perspective and opportunity set. So our focus on resilient markets doesn't mean we're ignoring industrial markets. What it really means is this. When we look out at least in the near-term and it's no surprise that there's a bit of a commodity and an emerging market retrenchment going on right now, that some of these more cyclical markets could take some time before they'll show any new growth opportunities, right. A rebound of lows were already connected to them. Our pipe is already there, our tank is already there. So coming off of a low and rebounding will just automatically get without focusing or without investment, right. The still under contract so there's no worries that the rebound we won't be capturing. The focus is more on investments. So where is money being spent today, there is a good amount being spent in some of these resilient areas. The growth trajectories in those resilient areas are greater, excluding the rebound effect on some of the more cyclicals so that's why our focus has been there. But it doesn't mean we're not focusing on all the growth opportunities we have, for example, in South America, we still see some opportunities for decapping, in some areas that would be cyclical and we've done that in the '90s and it was very successful for us and we do it again now. So those kind of things continue to happen, but when we look at health care, we look at food and beverage, we look at some consumer-related end markets like refining and electronics, they are growing well. We're focusing our applications technology, our salesforce and even some of our acquisitions towards those resilient markets, and they'll give us a nice compounded growth that's more based on demographics or more resilient trends than kind of ups and downs that we see in some cycles. So the view is if we have more focus on their, we have those compound growth rate and cycles return, you could get a pretty strong growth and a growth rate that is a little more stable. So that's how we've been doing it. By no means do we regret any of the exposures we've had. They served us quite well and they continued to serve us well. It's just that the growth opportunities in those areas are not as great right now, in this current environment."

Global volume trends we",1099,"Good morning, everyone, and thanks for attending. First quarter EPS finished at $1.28, which was at the higher end of our expectations. Cost management and foreign exchange rates in March were better than we originally anticipated. Global volume trends were a bit mixed as we saw certain end markets improving with others remaining at fairly low levels. By the second half of this year, we will start to lap some of the more difficult prior year comparisons. So I anticipate year-over-year trends should improve. 
Starting in North America. Volumes were weaker across our major industrial end markets of energy, metals, chemicals and manufacturing. Chemicals and downstream energy were primarily driven by extensive turnaround activity in the U.S. Gulf Coast, which we expect to improve over the next few quarters. Metals, manufacturing and upstream energy trends have been driven by the commodity price collapse, coupled with the strong dollar impact to our U.S. market. I expect upstream energy to remain fairly sluggish as most wells are not being completed, therefore deferring the need for any nitrogen. We have seen some recent uptick in our steel customers as a combination of import duties and lower inventories have resulted in higher production volumes. 
On the manufacturing front, while we've seen some sequential improvement in our on-site and merchant business units, U.S. packaged gas volumes have still been quite weak, especially hardgoods. In fact, U.S. hardgoods alone are driving our volumes down a full percentage point on the global results. Part of this is from weaker demand due to the slower investment cycle and in part from us not participating in some low-margin hardgood business. We've seen this late-cycle reaction in our PDI business in the past, so it seems consistent with our prior experience. Looking forward, we may have a few more quarters to go with difficult U.S. packaged gas conditions. But the on-site and merchant businesses seem to be improving modestly. Canada continues to improve in the eastern part of the country from a weaker Canadian dollar, especially in the food, manufacturing and health care end markets while the west and north continue to struggle from low commodity pricing. And excluding the energy market, Mexico is growing mid-single digits from a weak peso and a very strong manufacturing base. 
In South America, the volume decline appears to be stabilizing, but it's quite difficult to predict anything there right now. While there has been a flurry of financial market activity related to the political situation in Brazil, we really haven't seen much change on the ground regarding industrial activity. We did see some sequential volume improvement in merchant and packaged gases off a very weak fourth quarter. Brazilian markets of health care and food and beverage are growing double digits from prior year while industrial markets continue to struggle. We're achieving mid-single-digit pricing in our merchant and packaged gas businesses, but it isn't enough to overcome current inflation. So we are initiating new price actions for this year and continuing our cost containment efforts. Margins have eroded from a combination of lower volumes, higher cost and continued excess dislocation costs from CO2-sourced outages. First quarter is always the weakest due to Carnival and summer holiday, but we did see volumes pick up in March and we anticipate further seasonal growth into the second quarter. 
Europe has been steadily improving each quarter. Year-over-year volumes have increased a few percentage points, supported by project startups and some volume growth in Southern Europe. Almost all end markets are up over last year with the exception of upstream energy. We've been able to capitalize this and achieve a steady improvement in operating margins, up to 19.4% for the quarter. We anticipate second quarter volumes will sequentially increase from project startups and the Yara acquisition. This acquisition will significantly grow our supply network and density for CO2, serving key Brazilian markets throughout Continental Europe. 
In our Asia segment, we continue to see mid-single-digit volume growth but a challenging price environment in China. The first quarter is seasonally the weakest in Asia due to the Lunar New Year, yet we still were able to achieve 6% volume growth, primarily from project startups. In China, industrial end markets continue to be plagued with overcapacity as the economy attempts to shift to more consumer- and service-driven growth. We haven't seen much impact yet on steel capacity reduction, but we feel good about our Tier 1 steel customers as they continue to run their operations throughout this period. Other infrastructure-related industries are also struggling as capacity is being rationalized. So we have seen our glass customers lower their production rates. 
And while Western expansion of coal-to-liquid projects has been significantly curtailed, we have limited our exposure there and instead focused on coal-to-chemical projects with highly competitive customers in the east. As such, chemical and electronic markets are growing well and we are increasing our focus toward food, health care and environmental applications. Our Indian business is growing mid-single digits, driven by a combination of project startups and stronger industrial activity. Korea performed as expected from consumer electronic trends and our Thai business has been growing in the food and transportation end markets. 
I'll wrap it up with our Surface Technologies business, which as you all know is a global business. PST serves 3 key end markets of aerospace, energy and industrial. The energy business has weighed negatively on the results due to collapse in oil price and subsequent reduction in coatings for oilfield equipment, although we have recently seen positive trends for coatings to industrial gas turbines. Industrial segment growth rates have also been lower due to global trends. Aerospace, however, continues to be a bright spot through our strong customer partnerships and air travel trends. We also have seen very high growth rates in our metal powders business serving the 3D printing market. Finally, we expect to start up our GE Aviation joint venture by middle of this year, which should improve the business growth rates. 
On balance, I'd say our first quarter trends were slightly better than we expected. We still have several challenged end markets and late-cycle laggers, but we are seeing some positive volume trends in key geographies. And while our EPS is still down year-over-year from a combination of negative foreign currency translation and softer volumes, this is the second quarter in a row that our operating cash flow has grown over prior year. Furthermore, we continue to tightly manage our CapEx spending, resulting in 100% increase in first quarter free cash flow. 
I'll now hand it over to Kelcey to walk through the financial results."

Overall sales were $2.5 billion, 1% lower than last year, excluding currency and cost pass-through. Price attainment contributed 1% growth and was achieved in most reporting segments. The majority of volume growth from new project startups occurred in Asia with the remainder of the revenue contribution largely in Europe. 
We continue to see solid growth out of the more resilient end markets globally with food and beverage and health care growing 7% and 3%, respectively. The volume decline year-over-year net of project contributions was primarily driven by weaker base volumes in North America, largely in the energy, manufacturing and metals end markets. Sequentially, volumes were down 1% versus the fourth quarter as the improvement in South America was offset by seasonal declines in Asia and the timing of customer turnarounds in North America. 
By operating segment, North America organic sales declined 4% year-over-year and 2% sequentially. The business achieved price improvements from merchant and packaged gases. Weaker packaged gas volumes drove about half of the 5% volume decline, largely hardgoods. The remaining volume softness included continued lower upstream energy and metal sales year-over-year. In addition, chemical and refinery volumes were negatively impacted by the timing of customer turnarounds. Sequentially, organic growth to metals and manufacturing customers was more than offset by the impact of customer turnarounds as well as modest further weakness in packaged gases. In Europe, organic sales grew 2% year-over-year and were down 2% sequentially. Year-over-year growth was primarily driven by project contribution in Russia and higher base volumes in Southern Europe. Sequential volume declines include the seasonal impact of the Easter holiday as well as further weakness in upstream energy. 
South America's organic sales grew 1% year-over-year as price attainment offset the impact of lower volumes. Year-over-year volumes again outperformed local industrial production as growth in health care and food and beverage mitigated volume declines in manufacturing. Sequentially, organic growth of 8% included 3% from new price actions as well as volume growth from health care, food and beverage and even a modest improvement in manufacturing off of a very weak fourth quarter base. Organic sales in Asia were 5% higher than last year, primarily driven by new project startups in China to chemical customers and in India to metals customers. Sequentially, volumes included the seasonal impact of Lunar New Year. Surface Technologies organic sales were down 5% year-over-year and 2% sequentially, driven by energy and industrial end markets. 
Operating profit of $554 million was down 4% from the prior year period, excluding currency. Higher pricing increased operating profit but was more than offset by lower volumes. Operating margin was 22.1% and the EBITDA margin grew 30 basis points to 33.3%. Earnings per share of $1.28 was down 3%, excluding foreign currency. Through relentless operational discipline, we generated strong operating cash flow of $547 million, 22% of sales. This funded acquisitions of $63 million and capital expenditures of $323 million, about 65% of which was in North America, given its greater share of projects in the backlog. In addition, the company paid $214 million of dividends. 
Our capital allocation process is consistent and disciplined. The remaining cash that we have after growth investments and dividends is directed towards stock repurchases. We continue to expect to spend approximately $500 million on acquisitions this year, including the Yara European carbon dioxide assets and the purchase of the remaining shares in our Yara Praxair joint venture. Given that we anticipate more capital will be allocated towards accretive acquisitions, we have temporarily reduced our stock repurchases. 
Our project backlog, which we define as projects with CapEx greater than $5 million and associated with a fully executed customer supply contract, is currently $1.5 billion, comprised of 17 projects. During the first quarter, we added a project located in the U.S. Gulf Coast region for expansion of carbon monoxide supply to the chemical end market and started projects in South America and Europe. Existing backlog projects will start up and contribute to growth during 2016 through 2018 as shown on Slide 13. North America continues to reflect about 55% of the backlog. 
And now I'll turn the call back to Matt to discuss our earnings guidance located on Slide #5."

It's safe to say that FX markets are volatile and likely will remain that way for the foreseeable future. In years past, we were able to rely on spot and forward rates as good indicators for near-term future rates, and thus incorporated them into our guidance. However, these have not proven to be very useful over the last several quarters as many currencies seem to be trading more on binary events than fundamentals. Speculation on political decisions or interest rate increases can move currency rates several percentage points in 1 day. In light of this, our current second quarter guidance reflects the recently improved foreign currency spot rates, but the back half of the year uses rates closer to first quarter average rates, given the uncertainty. 
For the second quarter guidance, we are estimating EPS in the range of $1.32 to $1.39. Sequentially, we are anticipating volumes to improve from a combination of seasonal patterns and current run rates from March. We still have some volume headwinds in specific end markets, but I anticipate prior year comparisons will ease by the second half. Looking at the full year, EPS guidance is in the range of $5.35 to $5.70. We raised the range $0.05 to account for updated currency impacts for the first half, but we then took the top end back down $0.05 in light of the North American volume trends, primarily related to U.S. packaged gas volumes. I believe we have a few more quarters of this late-cycle impact, which will reduce some of the upside potential for the next 6 to 9 months. Capital expenditures are anticipated to be $1.5 billion, which is consistent with our prior guidance. We continue to manage capital spending prudently, so I hope to improve on this number. 
In summary, our first quarter ended a little better than expected. Some of the macroeconomic headwinds have started to stabilize, but 1 quarter doesn't make a trend. Overall, we are executing the strategy to optimize the base business, prudently allocate capital for profitable growth and manage the things within our control to create long-term, intangible shareholder value. 
I'd now like to open up the call for Q&A."

So if the assumption were that large capital expenditures of our customers would either be delayed or deferred into future years, then yes, our free cash flow would continue to grow. And you've seen that over the last 18 months, frankly. We've had some very high free cash flow numbers. And a lot of that's been attributed to the reduced CapEx spend. But when I do look at the project opportunities, we still do see some U.S. Gulf Coast pretty large-scale projects that we're working on diligently. So I'd say as the projects are coming in, they will be larger and lumpier than they have in the past. We are seeing projects that tend to be both processed and atmospheric gases. So you tend to have larger investment than, I'd say, some of the normal investments we've seen. But to your scenario, yes, lower CapEx will mean higher free cash flow. And if we're not spending it on acquisitions, which are clearly another synergistic growth area for us, we'll just continue to raise the dividends and use any excess for some buyback."

So I can't speak to those projects specifically. To your point, we did not participate in those projects. But what I would say we're seeing on the ground in general is this. First of all, these are very high CapEx projects. They take a significant amount of capital for the gasifiers to basically gasify that coal and make whatever product you're looking to make. I think it's pretty clear and pretty well known that the liquidity situation for a lot of companies in China is not very strong. There's been a lot of stimulus that especially this most recent month or 2 that's not sustainable. So our view is if a project is permitted, there's a good chance it should be finished and built. If a project is not permitted in this space, our belief is it probably will not get built in any foreseeable future. Then the question is if it's built, will it run, given the low coal price?

North America is one of the few regions in the world where there are publicly announced price increases. You may have seen some through the press releases. So we are getting some price in merchant. We are getting some price in packaged. Clearly, there's a mix benefit with less hardgoods. However, there's also a mix hurt with less merchant going into energy and what's called supplemental liquid that would go into places like metals that may run stronger or liquid argon that may go into places like stainless steel. So I'd say on balance, probably not a lot of mix effect. This is really more a function of the price increases that are low single digit. And then when we show our price, it has a function of the entire revenue. So the number tends to always show a little lower because you have on-site in the denominator. And we don't count on-site as pricing. So we're still getting low single-digit pricing in both packaged and merchant overall. And this, I think, pretty much reflects that."

What I can start with were some of the headwinds we're facing, and then talk a little bit about some pickup. So with LOX, one area that's a headwind there is you tend to have, and I mentioned it earlier, supplemental oxygen on a liquid base as you can supply to steel mills. So when steel mills run very hard, especially in areas like tubular steel, they'll actually take liquid in addition to any on-site oxygen they have. Clearly that, on a year-over-year basis, is a headwind. Those volumes are definitely down. Similarly, LIN is the primary product that we put downhaul for fracturing in the oil well service business. And that, from Canada to U.S. to Mexico, is down significantly, given the challenges in the upstream energy business and the low oil price. So those are both down significantly in those end markets. Excluding those, we are starting to see some pickup, areas that are resilient like LIN for food. CO2, which I know you didn't ask about, but CO2 was actually growing quite well. We've been securing a lot of sources for CO2 as that is a game that's all about very integrated supply chain. And we're seeing a lot of strength there in food and beverage, especially things like our new CO2 business usage there for carbonated beverages. But other than that, we're seeing some moderate growth in LIN/LOX when you exclude those 2 sort of cyclical demand areas. On the LAR front, stainless is a little bit down year-over-year. We had some strong stainless last year, so you've got some comps here lapping there. And met fab is a little down, given the trends I spoke about in PDI. So from that perspective, I'd say LAR is down a bit. But LAR is still tight overall. As you imagine, when you have on-site customers that are oxygen base loads running lower, you have to make more premium argon. So argon is still a tight product despite the volumes being down in some of the end markets. And then liquid hydrogen is something that continues to be quite strong. We're seeing a lot of applications there, whether it's for space exploration or areas in some of the hydrogen-powered things like fork trucks. So hydrogen continues to be a pretty good growth product as well."

But consistent with what we've said in the prior quarters, we definitely do have some several steel customers that are running below and they continue to pay. This quarter is a little more difficult simply because you have Carnival and you have summer holidays. So we always tend to see a few more customers, even on a normal year, excluding what's going on in the ground, get below MTOP, similar to what you see in Asia with the Lunar New Year. So that's more, I'll call, seasonal dip. But primarily, steel customers, they are paying. And as you've seen from our numbers, we did see some sequential improvements, especially from a very low December. So I think that aspect has been pretty good. In fact, we had a couple of that who were below MTOP last quarter, and now they are above MTOP in Q1."

So I'll start on a high level. I think, Laurence, we are constantly reviewing our geographic portfolio around the world to evaluate, do we have the density that we believe we need to achieve the type of returns and the quality and the reliability of the business model that we need. So that is always an ongoing effort. And as you stated, we entered into certain countries in the Middle East. And I would say the countries that we are in, we do have a fairly meaningful density model but not where we'd want it to be and we're not participating in Saudi Arabia, which is the largest country in the Middle East. So we continue to evaluate Middle East and see what options we want to take there. But that's something our portfolio will always evaluate. Russia is another area. We've been building some density. Given the situation in Russia today, we've slowed that process down. But we have built some pretty strong density in the Volga region as well as out in Yekaterinburg. And the assets that we do have on the ground there are running as expected and running fairly well. So those are 2 regions that we do see some opportunity to modify our portfolio one way or the other. But we'll continue to evaluate that. As far as Iran, we will clearly work with the U.S. situation there and what they allow with companies. But to say the least, the Europeans will have a head start on that. Just given the U.S. relationship with Iran versus, I'd say, the European relationships will probably soften first. So we'll keep our eye on it, but it will be tough, I think, for American companies to get in there before any European companies."

So we haven't quite even had the anniversary of that yet. But that was a series of actions we took. And frankly, before we took that action, people were asking us that same question, what can we do? We seemed to have run out of levers. I'm not saying that we would go to another action of that nature. We feel that the actions we've taken are well in line with the market we're seeing. But I'd also say that we continually look for productivity opportunities. As the markets change, whether volumes go down or volumes go up, it makes new opportunities in our logistics management. You're seeing mill rates around the world change quite differently. And it makes projects, in some cases, more viable that we may have not done in prior years, whether it's an increase in mill rates or in some cases, a decrease in mill rates. And so as the dynamics change on these type of input cost for us, as the dynamics change in terms of the customers we serve, it can create new productivity opportunities that may not have given us a sufficient return under prior scenarios. So we're always looking at these changes. We're always trying to evaluate how long that they'll be like this. And then we'd attempt to take prudent actions. But we've had to have a lot of productivity just to sustain the margin levels we've had. As you know, every time we lose volume, it falls pretty at high margins. So we need to take a lot of actions in productivity and pricing to negate that effect. And that's what we've been doing. So we look to continue to do that. I'm not anticipating any headcount action at this point, given how we're seeing the markets. But I am anticipating we'll continue to push productivity the way we always have. And we'll continue to try and find some opportunities around that."

It will be price. And price tends to be, in my mind, more tied towards inflation. So if we do see some inflation here, that should help. We've seen in prior years with inflation. We've seen it in markets with inflation. It tends to be tied with acquisition activity. We are seeing more roll-up opportunities in this environment and where an example of some of the acquisitions we're doing. And then it's a function of both projects and organic volume. So on the project side, it's clear, backlogs are going down. Customers or potential customers are not making the capital investments they had. This is part of the cycle you see in the capital cycle. So that is something that if that returns or when that returns, especially in some industries that have been fairly muted for a while, like mining, heavy equipment and areas like that, that will give growth. But if that doesn't return anytime soon, then that will be an area of growth that will still be a little sluggish. And then finally, to your point, is this organic that we've usually used IP as proxy. And to your point, what we have always found is emerging market IP multiples almost always tend to be stronger than developed market IP growth multiples. And it makes logical sense because in an emerging market, it tends to be more infrastructure-related growth. You tend to have a lot more application-related growth. That gets to that whole intensity of industrial gas per capita. And that is a real thing we see. So when the emerging markets slowed and the commodity markets slowed, you saw a portion of the backlog projects be reduced as customers didn't spend money. You saw the highest IP multiple markets be reduced, in fact, go negative. And the combination of those things really did make the, call it, growth algorithm weaker. But the question is do you believe emerging markets are out forever? I personally don't believe that. I think we're in cycles like any other cycles. Some of the issues we have today are demand-driven. There's 1 or 2 that might be supply-driven. But when it does rebound, you get back to those multiples you've seen in prior years. Developed markets, in my mind, tend to be more closer to IP, a little bit above IP. But that's kind of how I view it. So those are the factors of growth. And right now, yes, we're in a position where a lot of people are not making investments, emerging markets are struggling. And that's created some dampening effect on the growth. But I do expect that will recover and return. When? I don't know, but we've seen these cycles in the past."

So we saw that drop off first over the last, I'll call it, 9 months or so. What we're seeing now is some of the equipment but also just consumables. And consumables, in my mind, tend to move with gas to an extent as far as how they drop. And if you need less shielding gas, you'd probably use less contact tips, you'll use less wire. Those things tend to run together. So I'd say at this point, we've already seen some of the leading indicators on equipment.

In fact, we have very, very little business direct to Petrobras. What I would say the impact of the Car Wash situation and the Petrobras situation in general has just been an overall kind of paralysis on any industrial investment. I mean, Petrobras, like PEMEX in Mexico, is a very, very big part of the economy. It creates a very large supplier chain network of many various industrial companies that supply Petrobras directly and indirectly. So there are many customers that we supply that supply Petrobras. And clearly, they are not doing as well. A perfect example, a steel company that makes tubular steel, they're not making much anymore, given Petrobras. But in my mind, the situation on that has been baked into our results for a year now. Their sort of negative reaction from Car Wash and some of the curtailment in their activity has already been reflected in several quarters. I think when you look at Brazil now, a question we get is, ""What's going on with the potential impeachment? Would that make any difference?"" And right now, we just don't know. Clearly, the financial markets have been reacting positively if you look at the real, if you look at the BOVESPA. But we haven't seen much industrial change yet. But I would say on an overall basis, the fact that they're trying to root out layers of corruption is a good thing. And that should position them well for a long-term improvement in the economy. And we're seeing some positive developments in Argentina with Macri coming in, with his ability to resolve some of the bond situation, his ability to issue bonds, is creating a positive effect and renewed interest in Argentina. So I hope with Brazil, we can get over this hump. But it's going to still take time to play out and we'll have to see. We're not anticipating much recovery in Brazil this year.

So I'd say when you exclude that upstream energy, we are getting organic growth in addition to our project contribution. So that part has been good. And you see some of it in the margins as well as we've been able to get the value of that volume contribution and capture it with some improved margins. I'd say Scandinavia in general is a little weaker as you would imagine, given it's an oil-based economy. We continue to see interest in investments and strong volumes in the Port of Antwerp area, which would make sense, given the euro is a little weaker, given oil is a little lower and sea shipping costs are much lower. And that really helps the competitiveness of that petchem enclave. And in Southern Europe, like I mentioned, Spain has continued to improve here. We'll have to see what the election situation, where that ends up, but it's still been improving. Our medical business, which we have a fairly large medical business, is quite strong across all of Europe. In fact, we just did some recent acquisitions, one in Italy in the medical and also the NOxBOX, which was U.K., which will serve more global. So that has been good. And I'd say in general in Russia, the on-site assets we have are running well as our customers are globally competitive especially at this lower ruble. And the merchant business and packaged business is somewhat soft, as you'd expect, in a stagflationary economy, which they still are today. So in general, the Northern and Benelux is doing well, Southern doing well, Scandinavia is weak, Russia on the ground is still a little weak and anything upstream energy is quite weak. But slow and steady improvement is the general view we have."

So yes, that would be the way to model it. Inversely with Yara, we would take what today is a minority interest impact and that would go away with the consolidation of the JV. And then with the Yara CO2, that would obviously just be a brand-new consolidated acquisition. And with the Yara version, we just have one more real regulatory hurdle here that we're not overly concerned about, which should be fine. So I expect both of those by back end of Q2 hopefully should be finalized. But you never know when the timing, so we just need to keep it open."

And then on the more resilient industries, we continue to see very strong results. And when you add that together plus the price you're getting with some of the inflation impacts there, it is allowing the organic growth to still be fairly respectable.

Yes, because my first answer would have been that the pricing is more geographic depending on a lot of cases, as you know. So within the U.S., I would say, and we had this discussion a little bit earlier, there will be some mix effect that could influence that when you have some higher-margin sales that are going away. And we've seen some of that. So that could negatively influence that. But I would say pricing is still very, very regional. It's within a couple of hundred mile radius. And it tends to be a function of any contracts that may be renewing and/or new opportunities that could be coming up in that region. And it will just be a function of the product supply available for that. But it's very, very small transaction-by-transaction. And that's why every time we continue to look at this, what we tend to see is at the top of the house, inflation tends to be a fairly good proxy for it. There are some regional differences that could be driven either by geographic differences, even within the U.S., right, where product might be tight or a little looser. And there could be some industry perspectives where, for example, a certain end market may get extreme high value out of the product and the pricing might be a little better than, say, another end market, where there are alternate substitutes maybe different than industrial gas. So from that perspective, I'd say it's not too different than what you may see in other industries. But given the contractual nature and given the proximity of supply, really on the top of the house, inflation still tends to be a good proxy in my mind."

Clearly, we continue to look at every market and we continue to look at it from a return perspective and an opportunity set. So our focus on resilient markets doesn't mean we're ignoring industrial markets. Now what it really means is this. When we look out at least in the near term, and it's no surprise that there's a bit of a commodity and an emerging market retrenchment going on right now, that some of these more cyclical markets could take some time before they'll show any new growth opportunities, right? A rebound of lows were already connected to them. Our pipe is already there, our tank is already there. So coming off of a low and rebounding, we'll just automatically get without focusing or without investment, right? They're still under contract, so there's no worry that the rebound, we wouldn't be capturing. The focus is more on new investments. So where is money being spent today? There is a good amount being spent in some of these resilient areas. The growth trajectories in those resilient areas are greater, excluding the rebound effect on some of the more cyclicals. So that's why our focus has been there. But it doesn't mean we're not focusing on all the growth opportunities we have. For example, in South America, we still see some opportunities for decapping in some areas that would be cyclical. And we've done that in the '90s and it was very successful for us and we'll do it again now. So those kind of things continue to happen. But when we look at health care, we look at food and beverage, we look at some consumer-related end markets, like refining and electronics, they are growing well. We're focusing our applications technology, our sales force and even some of our acquisitions towards those resilient markets. And they'll give us a nice compounded growth that's more based on either demographics or more resilient trends than kind of ups and downs that we'll see in some cycles. So the view is if we have more focus on there, we get those compound growth rates and cycles return, you can get a pretty strong growth and a growth rate that is a little more stable. So that's how we've been doing it. But by no means do we regret any of the exposures we've had. They've served us quite well and they continue to serve us well. It's just that the growth opportunities in those areas are not as great right now in this current environment."

Global volume trends we",1099,"Good morning, everyone, and thanks for attending. First quarter EPS finished at $1.28, which was at the higher end of our expectations. Cost management and foreign exchange rates in March were better than we originally anticipated. Global volume trends were a bit mixed as we saw certain end markets improving with others remaining at fairly low levels. By the second half of this year, we will start to lap some of the more difficult prior year comparisons. So I anticipate year-over-year trends should improve. 
Starting in North America. Volumes were weaker across our major industrial end markets of energy, metals, chemicals and manufacturing. Chemicals in downstream energy were primarily driven by extensive turnaround activity in the U.S. Gulf Coast, which we expect to improve over the next few quarters. Metals, manufacturing and upstream energy trends have been driven by the commodity price collapse, coupled with the strong dollar impact to our U.S. market. I expect upstream energy to remain fairly sluggish as most wells are not being completed, therefore deferring the need for any nitrogen. We have seen some recent uptick in our steel customers as a combination of import duties and lower inventories have resulted in higher production volumes. 
On the manufacturing front, while we've seen some sequential improvement in our on-site and merchant business units, U.S. packaged gas volumes have still been quite weak, especially hardgoods. In fact, U.S. hardgoods alone are driving our volumes down a full percentage point on the global results. Part of this is from weaker demand due to the slower investment cycle and in part from us not participating in some low-margin hardgood business. We've seen this late-cycle reaction in our PDI business in the past, so it seems consistent with our prior experience. Looking forward, we may have a few more quarters to go with difficult U.S. packaged gas conditions. But the on-site and merchant businesses seem to be improving modestly. Canada continues to improve in the eastern part of the country from a weaker Canadian dollar, especially in the food, manufacturing and health care end markets while the west and north continue to struggle from low commodity pricing. And excluding the energy market, Mexico is growing mid-single digits from a weak peso and a very strong manufacturing base. 
In South America, the volume decline appears to be stabilizing, but it's quite difficult to predict anything there right now. While there has been a flurry of financial market activity related to the political situation in Brazil, we really haven't seen much change on the ground regarding industrial activity. We did see some sequential volume improvement in merchant and packaged gases off a very weak fourth quarter. Brazilian markets of health care and food and beverage are growing double digits from prior year while industrial markets continue to struggle. We're achieving mid-single-digit pricing in our merchant and packaged gas businesses, but it isn't enough to overcome current inflation. So we are initiating new price actions for this year and continuing our cost containment efforts. Margins have eroded from a combination of lower volumes, higher cost and continued excess dislocation costs from CO2-sourced outages. First quarter is always the weakest due to Carnival and summer holiday, but we did see volumes pick up in March and we anticipate further seasonal growth into the second quarter. 
Europe has been steadily improving each quarter. Year-over-year volumes have increased a few percentage points, supported by project startups and some volume growth in Southern Europe. Almost all end markets are up over last year with the exception of upstream energy. We've been able to capitalize this and achieve a steady improvement in operating margins, up to 19.4% for the quarter. We anticipate second quarter volumes will sequentially increase from project startups and the Yara acquisition. This acquisition will significantly grow our supply network and density for CO2, serving key Brazilian markets throughout Continental Europe. 
In our Asia segment, we continue to see mid-single-digit volume growth but a challenging price environment in China. The first quarter is seasonally the weakest in Asia due to the Lunar New Year, yet we still were able to achieve 6% volume growth, primarily from project startups. In China, industrial end markets continue to be plagued with overcapacity as the economy attempts to shift to more consumer- and service-driven growth. We haven't seen much impact yet on steel capacity reduction, but we feel good about our Tier 1 steel customers as they continue to run their operations throughout this period. Other infrastructure-related industries are also struggling as capacity is being rationalized. So we have seen our glass customers lower their production rates. 
And while Western expansion of coal-to-liquid projects has been significantly curtailed, we have limited our exposure there and instead focused on coal-to-chemical projects with highly competitive customers in the east. As such, chemical and electronic markets are growing well and we are increasing our focus toward food, health care and environmental applications. Our Indian business is growing mid-single digits, driven by a combination of project startups and stronger industrial activity. Korea performed as expected from consumer electronic trends and our Thai business has been growing in the food and transportation end markets. 
I'll wrap it up with our Surface Technologies business, which as you all know is a global business. PST serves 3 key end markets of aerospace, energy and industrial. The energy business has weighed negatively on the results due to collapse in oil price and subsequent reduction in coatings for oilfield equipment, although we have recently seen positive trends for coatings to industrial gas turbines. Industrial segment growth rates have also been lower due to global trends. Aerospace, however, continues to be a bright spot through our strong customer partnerships and air travel trends. We also have seen very high growth rates in our metal powders business serving the 3D printing market. Finally, we expect to start up our GE Aviation joint venture by middle of this year, which should improve the business growth rates. 
On balance, I'd say our first quarter trends were slightly better than we expected. We still have several challenged end markets and late-cycle laggers, but we are seeing some positive volume trends in key geographies. And while our EPS is still down year-over-year from a combination of negative foreign currency translation and softer volumes, this is the second quarter in a row that our operating cash flow has grown over prior year. Furthermore, we continue to tightly manage our CapEx spending, resulting in 100% increase in first quarter free cash flow. 
I'll now hand it over to Kelcey to walk through the financial results."

Now please turn to Slide #4 for our consolidated results. Overall sales were $2.5 billion, 1% lower than last year, excluding currency and cost pass-through.

Overall sales were $2.5 billion, 1% lower than last year, excluding currency and cost pass-through. Price attainment contributed 1% growth and was achieved in most reporting segments. The majority of volume growth from new project startups occurred in Asia with the remainder of the revenue contribution largely in Europe. 
We continue to see solid growth out of the more resilient end markets globally with food and beverage and health care growing 7% and 3%, respectively. The volume decline year-over-year net of project contributions was primarily driven by weaker base volumes in North America, largely in the energy, manufacturing and metals end markets. Sequentially, volumes were down 1% versus the fourth quarter as the improvement in South America was offset by seasonal declines in Asia and the timing of customer turnarounds in North America. 
By operating segment, North America organic sales declined 4% year-over-year and 2% sequentially. The business achieved price improvements from merchant and packaged gases. Weaker packaged gas volumes drove about half of the 5% volume decline, largely hardgoods. The remaining volume softness included continued lower upstream energy and metal sales year-over-year. In addition, chemical and refinery volumes were negatively impacted by the timing of customer turnarounds. Sequentially, organic growth to metals and manufacturing customers was more than offset by the impact of customer turnarounds as well as modest further weakness in packaged gases. In Europe, organic sales grew 2% year-over-year and were down 2% sequentially. Year-over-year growth was primarily driven by project contribution in Russia and higher base volumes in Southern Europe. Sequential volume declines include the seasonal impact of the Easter holiday as well as further weakness in upstream energy. 
South America's organic sales grew 1% year-over-year as price attainment offset the impact of lower volumes. Year-over-year volumes again outperformed local industrial production as growth in health care and food and beverage mitigated volume declines in manufacturing. Sequentially, organic growth of 8% included 3% from new price actions as well as volume growth from health care, food and beverage and even a modest improvement in manufacturing off of a very weak fourth quarter base. Organic sales in Asia were 5% higher than last year, primarily driven by new project startups in China to chemical customers and in India to metals customers. Sequentially, volumes included the seasonal impact of Lunar New Year. Surface Technologies organic sales were down 5% year-over-year and 2% sequentially, driven by energy and industrial end markets. 
Operating profit of $554 million was down 4% from the prior year period, excluding currency. Higher pricing increased operating profit but was more than offset by lower volumes. Operating margin was 22.1% and the EBITDA margin grew 30 basis points to 33.3%. Earnings per share of $1.28 was down 3%, excluding foreign currency. Through relentless operational discipline, we generated strong operating cash flow of $547 million, 22% of sales. This funded acquisitions of $63 million and capital expenditures of $323 million, about 65% of which was in North America, given its greater share of projects in the backlog. In addition, the company paid $214 million of dividends. 
Our capital allocation process is consistent and disciplined. The remaining cash that we have after growth investments and dividends is directed towards stock repurchases. We continue to expect to spend approximately $500 million on acquisitions this year, including the Yara European carbon dioxide assets and the purchase of the remaining shares in our Yara Praxair joint venture. Given that we anticipate more capital will be allocated towards accretive acquisitions, we have temporarily reduced our stock repurchases. 
Our project backlog, which we define as projects with CapEx greater than $5 million and associated with a fully executed customer supply contract, is currently $1.5 billion, comprised of 17 projects. During the first quarter, we added a project located in the U.S. Gulf Coast region for expansion of carbon monoxide supply to the chemical end market and started projects in South America and Europe. Existing backlog projects will start up and contribute to growth during 2016 through 2018 as shown on Slide 13. North America continues to reflect about 55% of the backlog. 
And now I'll turn the call back to Matt to discuss our earnings guidance located on Slide #5."

It's safe to say that FX markets are volatile and likely will remain that way for the foreseeable future. In years past, we were able to rely on spot and forward rates as good indicators for near-term future rates, and thus incorporated them into our guidance. However, these have not proven to be very useful over the last several quarters as many currencies seem to be trading more on binary events than fundamentals. Speculation on political decisions or interest rate increases can move currency rates several percentage points in 1 day. In light of this, our current second quarter guidance reflects the recently improved foreign currency spot rates, but the back half of the year uses rates closer to first quarter average rates, given the uncertainty. 
For the second quarter guidance, we are estimating EPS in the range of $1.32 to $1.39. Sequentially, we are anticipating volumes to improve from a combination of seasonal patterns and current run rates from March. We still have some volume headwinds in specific end markets, but I anticipate prior year comparisons will ease by the second half. Looking at the full year, EPS guidance is in the range of $5.35 to $5.70. We raised the range $0.05 to account for updated currency impacts for the first half, but we then took the top end back down $0.05 in light of the North American volume trends, primarily related to U.S. packaged gas volumes. I believe we have a few more quarters of this late-cycle impact, which will reduce some of the upside potential for the next 6 to 9 months. Capital expenditures are anticipated to be $1.5 billion, which is consistent with our prior guidance. We continue to manage capital spending prudently, so I hope to improve on this number. 
In summary, our first quarter ended a little better than expected. Some of the macroeconomic headwinds have started to stabilize, but 1 quarter doesn't make a trend. Overall, we are executing the strategy to optimize the base business, prudently allocate capital for profitable growth and manage the things within our control to create long-term and tangible shareholder value. 
I'd now like to open up the call for Q&A."

So if the assumption were that large capital expenditures of our customers would either be delayed or deferred into future years, then yes, our free cash flow would continue to grow. And you've seen that over the last 18 months, frankly. We've had some very high free cash flow numbers. And a lot of that's been attributed to the reduced CapEx spend. But when I do look at the project opportunities, we still do see some U.S. Gulf Coast pretty large-scale projects that we're working on diligently. So I'd say as the projects are coming in, they will be larger and lumpier than they have in the past. We are seeing projects that tend to be both processed and atmospheric gases. So you tend to have larger investment than, I'd say, some of the normal investments we've seen. But to your scenario, yes, lower CapEx will mean higher free cash flow. And if we're not spending it on acquisitions, which are clearly another synergistic growth area for us, we'll just continue to raise the dividends and use any excess for some buyback."

So I can't speak to those projects specifically. To your point, we did not participate in those projects. But what I would say we're seeing on the ground in general is this. First of all, these are very high CapEx projects. They take a significant amount of capital for the gasifiers to basically gasify that coal and make whatever product you're looking to make. I think it's pretty clear and pretty well known that the liquidity situation for a lot of companies in China is not very strong. There's been a lot of stimulus that especially this most recent month or 2 that's not sustainable. So our view is if a project is permitted, there's a good chance it should be finished and built. If a project is not permitted in this space, our belief is it probably will not get built in any foreseeable future. Then the question is if it's built, will it run, given the low coal price? And that's just a function, I think, of the more profitable ones with liquidity will run and the ones that may have some financial difficulties may or may not run. So that remains to be seen. But our customers that we supply, they're large global chemical players. They're mostly in integrated parks. So there's multiple integrated petchem chain and they continue to run."

However, there's also a mix hurt with less merchant going into energy and what's called supplemental liquid that would go into places like metals that may run stronger or liquid argon that may go into places like stainless steel. So I'd say on balance, probably not a lot of mix effect. This is really more a function of the price increases that are low single digit. And then when we show our price, it has a function of the entire revenue. So the number tends to always show a little lower because you have on-site in the denominator. And we don't count on-site as pricing. So we're still getting low single-digit pricing in both packaged and merchant overall. And this, I think, pretty much reflects that."

What I can start with were some of the headwinds we're facing, and then talk a little bit about some pickup. So with LOX, one area that's a headwind there is you tend to have, and I mentioned it earlier, supplemental oxygen on a liquid base as you can supply to steel mills. So when steel mills run very hard, especially in areas like tubular steel, they'll actually take liquid in addition to any on-site oxygen they have. Clearly that, on a year-over-year basis, is a headwind. Those volumes are definitely down. Similarly, LIN is the primary product that we put down-hole for fracturing in the oil well service business. And that, from Canada to U.S. to Mexico, is down significantly, given the challenges in the upstream energy business and the low oil price. So those are both down significantly in those end markets. Excluding those, we are starting to see some pickup, areas that are resilient like LIN for food. CO2, which I know you didn't ask about, but CO2 was actually growing quite well. We've been securing a lot of sources for CO2 as that is a game that's all about very integrated supply chain. And we're seeing a lot of strength there in food and beverage, especially things like our new CO2 business usage there for carbonated beverages. But other than that, we're seeing some moderate growth in LIN/LOX when you exclude those 2 sort of cyclical demand areas. On the LAR front, stainless is a little bit down year-over-year. We had some strong stainless last year, so you've got some comps here lapping there. And met fab is a little down, given the trends I spoke about in PDI. So from that perspective, I'd say LAR is down a bit. But LAR is still tight overall. As you imagine, when you have on-site customers that are oxygen base loads running lower, you have to make more premium argon. So argon is still a tight product despite the volumes being down in some of the end markets. And then liquid hydrogen is something that continues to be quite strong. We're seeing a lot of applications there, whether it's for space exploration or areas in some of the hydrogen-powered things like Ford trucks. So hydrogen continues to be a pretty good growth product as well."

But consistent with what we've said in the prior quarters, we definitely do have some several steel customers that are running below and they continue to pay.

So we always tend to see a few more customers, even on a normal year, excluding what's going on in the ground, get below MTOP, similar to what you see in Asia with the Lunar New Year. So that's more, I'll call, seasonal dip. But primarily, steel customers, they are paying.

I think, Laurence, we are constantly reviewing our geographic portfolio around the world to evaluate, do we have the density that we believe we need to achieve the type of returns in the quality and the reliability of the business model that we need. So that is always an ongoing effort. And as you stated, we entered into certain countries in the Middle East. And I would say the countries that we are in, we do have a fairly meaningful density model but not where we'd want it to be and we're not participating in Saudi Arabia, which is the largest country in the Middle East. So we continue to evaluate Middle East and see what options we want to take there. But that's something our portfolio will always evaluate. Russia is another area. We've been building some density. Given the situation in Russia today, we've slowed that process down. But we have built some pretty strong density in the Volga region as well as out in Yekaterinburg. And the assets that we do have on the ground there are running as expected and running fairly well. So those are 2 regions that we do see some opportunity to modify our portfolio one way or the other. But we'll continue to evaluate that. As far as Iran, we will clearly work with the U.S. situation there and what they allow with companies. But to say the least, the Europeans will have a head start on that. Just given the U.S. relationship with Iran versus, I'd say, the European relationships will probably soften first. So we'll keep our eye on it, but it will be tough, I think, for American companies to get in there before any European companies."

So we haven't quite even had the anniversary of that yet. But that was a series of actions we took. And frankly, before we took that action, people were asking us that same question, what can we do? We seemed to have run out of levers. I'm not saying that we would go to another action of that nature. We feel that the actions we've taken are well in line with the market we're seeing. But I'd also say that we continually look for productivity opportunities. As the markets change, whether volumes go down or volumes go up, it makes new opportunities in our logistics management. You're seeing mill rates around the world change quite differently. And it makes projects, in some cases, more viable that we may have not done in prior years, whether it's an increase in mill rates or in some cases, a decrease in mill rates. And so as the dynamics change on these type of input cost for us, as the dynamics change in terms of the customers we serve, it can create new productivity opportunities that may not have given us a sufficient return under prior scenarios. So we're always looking at these changes. We're always trying to evaluate how long that they'll be like this. And then we'd attempt to take prudent actions. But we've had to have a lot of productivity just to sustain the margin levels we've had. As you know, every time we lose volume, it falls pretty at high margins. So we need to take a lot of actions in productivity and pricing to negate that effect. And that's what we've been doing. So we look to continue to do that. I'm not anticipating any headcount action at this point, given how we're seeing the markets. But I am anticipating we'll continue to push productivity the way we always have. And we'll continue to try and find some opportunities around that."

It will be price. And price tends to be, in my mind, more tied towards inflation. So if we do see some inflation here, that should help. We've seen in prior years with inflation. We've seen it in markets with inflation. It tends to be tied with acquisition activity. We are seeing more roll-up opportunities in this environment and where an example of some of the acquisitions we're doing. And then it's a function of both projects and organic volume. So on the project side, it's clear, backlogs are going down. Customers or potential customers are not making the capital investments they had. This is part of the cycle you see in the capital cycle. So that is something that if that returns or when that returns, especially in some industries that have been fairly muted for a while, like mining, heavy equipment and areas like that, that will give growth. But if that doesn't return anytime soon, then that will be an area of growth that will still be a little sluggish. And then finally, to your point, is this organic that we've usually used IP as proxy. And to your point, what we have always found is emerging market IP multiples almost always tend to be stronger than developed market IP growth multiples. And it makes logical sense because in an emerging market, it tends to be more infrastructure-related growth. You tend to have a lot more application-related growth. That gets to that whole intensity of industrial gas per capita. And that is a real thing we see. So when the emerging markets slowed and the commodity markets slowed, you saw a portion of the backlog projects be reduced as customers didn't spend money. You saw the highest IP multiple markets be reduced, in fact, go negative. And the combination of those things really did make the, call it, growth algorithm weaker. But the question is do you believe emerging markets are out forever? I personally don't believe that. I think we're in cycles like any other cycles. Some of the issues we have today are demand-driven. There's 1 or 2 that might be supply-driven. But when it does rebound, you get back to those multiples you've seen in prior years. Developed markets, in my mind, tend to be more closer to IP, a little bit above IP. But that's kind of how I view it. So those are the factors of growth. And right now, yes, we're in a position where a lot of people are not making investments, emerging markets are struggling. And that's created some dampening effect on the growth. But I do expect that will recover and return. When? I don't know, but we've seen these cycles in the past."

I mean, as you know, June will be another Fed decision. So our view is basically this. We felt, I'll use the word, comfortable enough to take spot rates and some forward rates as they stood a few weeks ago to call it for Q2. Come June, kind of all bets are off because we just don't know what could happen with the Fed decision. And frankly, we don't know what will happen tomorrow, let alone come June. But clearly, if rates are better or spot rates hold, holding all else equal, we will have better EPS than what the guidance says. And that's holding all else equal. So there clearly is some upside. I'd rather not get into numbers because what spot rate, what day, what currency, there's a lot of moving parts there. But you could probably do the math from what you get from our 10-Q we'll file. You'll see what the average rates were, and then you could plug in whatever spot rate assumptions you want. It probably would be a fairly rough proxy, but it could get you close enough."

The equipment portion of hardgoods does tend to be a leading indicator. Clearly, if people stop buying large automated equipment, if our customers are not confident in their backlog or growth prospects, they will not invest in new capital equipment. So we saw that drop off first over the last, I'll call it, 9 months or so. What we're seeing now is some of the equipment but also just consumables. And consumables, in my mind, tend to move with gas to an extent as far as how they drop. And if you need less shielding gas, you'd probably use less contact tips, you'll use less wire. Those things tend to run together. So I'd say at this point, we've already seen some of the leading indicators on equipment. And now we're kind of just seeing with gas and the consumables kind of down together."

In fact, we have very, very little business direct to Petrobras. What I would say the impact of the Car Wash situation and the Petrobras situation in general has just been an overall kind of paralysis on any industrial investment. I mean, Petrobras, like PEMEX in Mexico, is a very, very big part of the economy. It creates a very large supplier chain network of many various industrial companies that supply Petrobras directly and indirectly. So there are many customers that we supply that supply Petrobras. And clearly, they are not doing as well. A perfect example, a steel company that makes tubular steel, they're not making much anymore, given Petrobras. But in my mind, the situation on that has been baked into our results for a year now. Their sort of negative reaction from Car Wash and some of the curtailment in their activity has already been reflected in several quarters. I think when you look at Brazil now, a question we get is, ""What's going on with the potential impeachment? Would that make any difference?"" And right now, we just don't know. Clearly, the financial markets have been reacting positively if you look at the real, if you look at the BOVESPA. But we haven't seen much industrial change yet. But I would say on an overall basis, the fact that they're trying to root out layers of corruption is a good thing. And that should position them well for a long-term improvement in the economy. And we're seeing some positive developments in Argentina with Macri coming in, with his ability to resolve some of the bond situation, his ability to issue bonds, is creating a positive effect and renewed interest in Argentina. So I hope with Brazil, we can get over this hump. But it's going to still take time to play out and we'll have to see. We're not anticipating much recovery in Brazil this year. And we'll have to reevaluate for next year based on how we see the next few quarters play out."

On an organic volume basis, we've been seeing some good strength in Spain. Italy has not been as strong. But I'd say overall for Europe, it's kind of continued to improve slowly. Where we have the biggest headwind right now has been in our upstream energy business, primarily around the North Sea. And that has been a continual headwind that's really offsetting some of the organic growth rates in the rest of Continental Europe. So I'd say when you exclude that upstream energy, we are getting organic growth in addition to our project contribution. So that part has been good. And you see some of it in the margins as well as we've been able to get the value of that volume contribution and capture it with some improved margins. I'd say Scandinavia in general is a little weaker as you would imagine, given it's an oil-based economy. We continue to see interest in investments and strong volumes in the Port of Antwerp area, which would make sense, given the euro is a little weaker, given oil is a little lower and sea shipping costs are much lower. And that really helps the competitiveness of that petchem enclave. And in Southern Europe, like I mentioned, Spain has continued to improve here. We'll have to see what the election situation, where that ends up, but it's still been improving. Our medical business, which we have a fairly large medical business, is quite strong across all of Europe. In fact, we just did some recent acquisitions, one in Italy in the medical and also the NOxBOX, which was U.K., which will serve more global. So that has been good. And I'd say in general in Russia, the on-site assets we have are running well as our customers are globally competitive especially at this lower ruble. And the merchant business and packaged business is somewhat soft, as you'd expect, in a stagflationary economy, which they still are today. So in general, the Northern in Benelux is doing well, Southern doing well, Scandinavia is weak, Russia on the ground is still a little weak and anything upstream energy is quite weak. But slow and steady improvement is the general view we have."

So within the U.S., I would say, and we had this discussion a little bit earlier, there will be some mix effect that could influence that when you have some higher-margin sales that are going away. And we've seen some of that. So that could negatively influence that. But I would say pricing is still very, very regional. It's within a couple of hundred mile radius. And it tends to be a function of any contracts that may be renewing and/or new opportunities that could be coming up in that region. And it will just be a function of the product supply available for that. But it's very, very small transaction-by-transaction. And that's why every time we continue to look at this, what we tend to see is at the top of the house, inflation tends to be a fairly good proxy for it. There are some regional differences that could be driven either by geographic differences, even within the U.S., right, where product might be tight or a little looser. And there could be some industry perspectives where, for example, a certain end market may get extreme high value out of the product and the pricing might be a little better than, say, another end market, where there are alternate substitutes maybe different than industrial gas. So from that perspective, I'd say it's not too different than what you may see in other industries. But given the contractual nature and given the proximity of supply, really on the top of the house, inflation still tends to be a good proxy in my mind."

Clearly, we continue to look at every market and we continue to look at it from a return perspective and an opportunity set. So our focus on resilient markets doesn't mean we're ignoring industrial markets. Now what it really means is this. When we look out at least in the near term, and it's no surprise that there's a bit of a commodity and an emerging market retrenchment going on right now, that some of these more cyclical markets could take some time before they'll show any new growth opportunities, right? A rebound of lows we're already connected to them. Our pipe is already there, our tank is already there. So coming off of a low and rebounding, we'll just automatically get without focusing or without investment, right? They're still under contract, so there's no worry that the rebound, we wouldn't be capturing. The focus is more on new investments. So where is money being spent today? There is a good amount being spent in some of these resilient areas. The growth trajectories in those resilient areas are greater, excluding the rebound effect on some of the more cyclicals. So that's why our focus has been there. But it doesn't mean we're not focusing on all the growth opportunities we have. For example, in South America, we still see some opportunities for decapping in some areas that would be cyclical. And we've done that in the '90s and it was very successful for us and we'll do it again now. So those kind of things continue to happen. But when we look at health care, we look at food and beverage, we look at some consumer-related end markets, like refining and electronics, they are growing well. We're focusing our applications technology, our sales force and even some of our acquisitions towards those resilient markets. And they'll give us a nice compounded growth that's more based on either demographics or more resilient trends than kind of ups and downs that we'll see in some cycles. So the view is if we have more focus on there, we get those compound growth rates and cycles return, you can get a pretty strong growth and a growth rate that is a little more stable. So that's how we've been doing it. But by no means do we regret any of the exposures we've had. They've served us quite well and they continue to serve us well. It's just that the growth opportunities in those areas are not as great right now in this current environment."

Our second quarter EPS finished at $1.39, which was at the upper end of the guidance range. This was driven by a combination of factors, including volume trends, foreign exchange translation and a lower tax rate. Overall, we continue to see strong growth in our more resilient end markets, while the cyclical market trends have been mixed, with metals improving but manufacturing still a challenge. 
Global volumes were flat year-over-year but up 3% sequentially due to broad-based recovery off a weaker first quarter.
In North America, trends have played out as anticipated. We continue to see solid sequential volume improvement across our on-site business, specifically in metals and downstream energy. You may recall that the first quarter had significant turnaround activity in the U.S. Gulf Coast, but we saw a very strong rebound for the second quarter. 
In addition, steel import tariffs have supported margin improvements and hence production rates for our steel customers. Merchant volumes also have improved sequentially, as we continue to see strong demand from food, beverage and other consumer-related markets. However, the packaged gas business is still declining from weaker manufacturing activity. U.S. industrial production for the second quarter is down more than 1% from prior year, and both the machinery and fabricated metal market IP figures are down over 3%. Packaged gas and market trends often lag industrial cycles. So there'll likely be a few more quarters of challenging conditions. We are stepping up cost actions, given this outlook, so I expect some improvements by the fourth quarter. 
Finally, we continue to pursue new customer on-site opportunities connected to our expansive Gulf Coast pipeline network. While these projects take considerable time to bid and negotiate, we're making good progress toward new contract signings. 
South America appears to be stabilizing for a few months in a row. The political situation in Brazil has enabled an improvement in the financial market in the real, which should support higher industrial activity at some point in the future. 
Our volumes this quarter have grown 3% sequentially and 1% year-over-year, which represents the first year-over-year positive volume growth since 2014. Approximately 1/3 of our portfolio serves consumer-related markets, and they continue to grow quite well from the expansion of the middle class. Furthermore, we've seen sequential improvements in metals from a new project startup and a slight improvement in manufacturing, although off a fairly low level. 
The near-term outlook is still cautious for industrial activity, given current trends and the government challenges, but I'm confident that the business is well positioned when those industrial markets turn around. 
Europe is continuing on a path of slow and steady improvement. Volumes and price are up year-over-year, with a strong sequential improvement in volumes at 6%. Large project in Russia and Port of Antwerp are contributing as expected to the results. We also just completed 2 large acquisitions for the European CO2 business and bought out a partner from our Scandinavian joint venture. 
Fixed costs are higher this quarter due to one-time acquisition costs and integration of the acquired business, which has near-term pressure on margins. However, those costs will be managed as part of the deal synergies, which will lead to additional margin improvement into 2017.
In our Asia segment, we continue to see mid-single digit volume growth but a challenging pricing environment, primarily in China merchant liquid. Despite the industrial overcapacity across many regions in China, our Tier 1 on-site customers continue to run well as they operate some of the most competitive assets for their industry. Metals have improved sequentially due to seasonal patterns and a project startup in India. We continue to see growth in chemicals and electronic customers in China and Korea, and merchant growth rates are positive across most end markets. 
The pricing environment in China has pressured margins, but cost actions have helped mitigate most of the impact. We have several initiatives underway to migrate towards faster-growing, more resilient end markets like food, beverage, environmental and health care. These applications are smaller but highly accretive and less capital-intensive. 
Our Surface Technology business has had relatively flat performance sequentially and year-over-year. Improvements in aerospace and highly engineered materials, like powders for added manufacturing, have been offset by significant headwinds in the energy and industrial end markets. I anticipate we'll lap some of the more difficult comps for energy and manufacturing toward the back half of this year. Furthermore, the completion of a joint venture later this year should help further improvement aerospace growth opportunities.
In general, the second quarter trends have either been in line or slightly better than originally expected. On-site and merchant supply modes have mostly improved sequentially, while North American packaged gases continue to be challenged. The severe headwinds from Latin America, metals and upstream energy have stabilized, and we expect to lap most of them in the second half, although we are not projecting a recovery. 
The manufacturing end market remains quite weak, as the negative effects from the commodity collapse and strong U.S. dollar work their way through the supply chain. Despite these difficulties reflected in the income statement, we continued to deliver on cash generation. Operating cash flow this quarter grew almost 30% sequentially and was in line with prior year even with lower earnings. Net debt has increased approximately $200 million as expected to fund the $360 million of synergistic acquisitions when including both the CO2 assets and the buyout of our noncontrolling JV partner. Now that the large acquisitions have been completed, we plan to lower net debt for the remainder of the year while avoiding any share dilution. 
We remain firm on executing the strategy. We are optimizing the base business through self-help actions, which are visible in the business quality and strong free cash flow. We are growing resilient end markets, as demonstrated by the portfolio of growth trends. We are capitalizing on acquisition opportunities, the recently announced synergistic tuck-in deals, most of which serve Brazilian markets. And we are executing the backlog while positioning for key growth project wins in the U.S. Gulf Coast. 
I'd now like to hand it over to Kelcey to walk through the financial results."

Overall sales were $2.7 billion, 2% higher than last year, excluding currency and cost pass-through. Price attainment contributed 1% growth and was achieved in several reporting segment",871,"Thanks, Matt. Please turn to Slide #4 for our consolidated results. 
Overall sales were $2.7 billion, 2% higher than last year, excluding currency and cost pass-through. Price attainment contributed 1% growth and was achieved in several reporting segments. Acquisitions added 1% growth, largely due to the European carbon dioxide acquisition that was completed in early June. 
New on-site project start-ups contributed to volume growth, with the revenue more than half-weighted towards Asia and the remainder of the revenue contribution largely in Europe and South America.
In addition, we continue to see solid growth out of the more resilient end markets globally, with food and beverage and health care both growing 8% year-over-year. This growth was offset by lower base business volumes in the Americas due primarily to the weaker industrial manufacturing activity in the United States and Brazil as well as weaker upstream energy in North America. 
Sequentially, volumes were up 3% versus the first quarter. About half of the volume growth is related to hydrogen sales in North America, given fewer customer turnarounds, and the remaining half is attributed globally to seasonal improvement and project contribution. 
By operating segment, North America organic sales declined 1% year-over-year and grew 3% sequentially. The business achieved price in merchant and packaged gases. Weaker U.S. packaged gas volumes drove the majority of the volume decline year-over-year largely due to hard goods. The remaining volume softness included continued lower upstream energy sales in Canada, the U.S. and Mexico. However, this was partially offset by stronger margin growth to the more resilient end markets and the improvement in hydrogen sales to refineries, given fewer customer turnarounds. Sequentially, organic growth of 3% was largely driven by the increased hydrogen sales as well as volume growth to food and beverage, health care and chemicals end markets. 
In Europe, organic sales grew 4% year-over-year and 6% sequentially. Year-over-year growth was primarily driven by project contribution in Russia and Antwerp and merchant volume largely serving food and beverage and health care customers. Sequential volume growth includes a seasonal pickup from the Easter Holiday Inn the first quarter, project contribution and modest growth across all end markets. 
South America's organic sales grew 5% year-over-year and 6% sequentially. Year-over-year volumes again outperformed local industrial production, as growth in health care and food and beverage as well as project startup contribution mitigated continued volume declines in manufacturing. Sequentially, organic growth included higher price actions as well as volume growth from the health care end markets and a new on-site startup serving a metals customers. 
Organic sales in Asia were 5% higher than last year, primarily driven by new product startups in China and India. Sequentially, volume growth of 4% included seasonal improvements. 
Surface Technologies organic sales were down 2% year-over-year and sequentially, as growth in aerospace was more than offset by lower sales to energy and industrial end markets. Operating profit of $588 million was down 2% from the prior year period, excluding currency, as higher pricing increased operating profit but was impacted by lower volumes. Sequentially, operating profit grew 4%, excluding currency, in line with sales. Operating margin was 22.1%, and the EBITDA margin was 33.0%. Excluding foreign currency, earnings per share of $1.39 was comparable to the prior year quarter of $1.45. 
Through continued operating discipline, we generated strong operating cash flow of $706 million, which was 26% of sales. This funded capital expenditures of $357 million, about 2/3 of which was in North America, given its greater share of projects in the backlog. In addition, the company paid $214 million of dividends. 
Our project backlog, which we define as projects with CapEx greater than $5 million and associated with a fully executed long-term customer supply contracts, is currently $1.3 billion, comprised of 17 projects. In South America, during the second quarter, we added a project to the backlog serving a pulp and paper customer and started the CSP project in Northern Brazil, a joint venture between [indiscernible] and South Korean firms, [indiscernible] Steel and [indiscernible] Steel, exporting slabs to CFP's Korean partners. Existing backlog projects will start up and contribute to growth during the remainder of 2016 through 2018, as shown on Slide 12. 
North America has grown to reflect about 65% of the backlog, with more than $500 million of CapEx related to 2 projects on the U.S. Gulf Coast. New project bidding remains strongest on the U.S. Gulf Coast for various petrochemical opportunities in both atmospheric and process gases for customers taking advantage of lower feedstock costs and significant infrastructure in the region. Other secular new on-site project opportunities include refinery customers globally and customer outsourcing of select captive plants, where we can bring value to the customer through improved reliability and efficiency, typically located in emerging markets. In addition, our small on-site plant growth platform for new plants too small for the backlog threshold currently total about $65 million in CapEx for almost 20 projects under long-term contracts that will start up over the next 12 months. These projects are located in the Americas, Asia and Europe, serving a variety of customers, including wastewater treatment, automotive, chemicals and refineries. 
And now I'll turn the call back to Matt to discuss our earnings guidance located on Slide 5."

This guidance anticipates foreign exchange rates for Q3 to be consistent with Q2, so no sequential impact. 
We are expecting the benefits from recent acquisitions and project startups will be mostly offset by seasonally lower volumes. Aside from these effects, we're essentially assuming Q3 is a repeat of Q2. 
For the full year guidance, we have held the midpoint and narrowed both the top and bottom by $0.10 or a new range of $5.45 to $5.60. We believe it's appropriate and prudent to remain cautious in our earnings outlook. While some market trends and foreign exchange rates have stabilized, manufacturing growth rates are still fairly anemic in certain geographies, especially the Americas. We are diligently working to improve upon these numbers, but there are not enough positive signs to raise the midpoint at this time. 
Capital expenditures are anticipated to be about $1.4 billion for the year. The current trend in backlog of projects would result in a lower number, but we need to account for potential new projects that could be signed this year. 
In summary, we've had another solid quarter that was slightly better than prior expectations. Volumes, the macroeconomic trends are starting to stabilize and should lap more difficult comps for the back half of this year. We've been executing well on this strategy and prudently deploying capital for growth. However, based on the current outlook, we aren't in a position to declare any type of recovery. Therefore, expectations going forward are for a continuation of existing trends,coupled with normal seasonality and contribution from acquisitions and project startups. But no matter what ultimately happens in the economy, I'm confident our employees around the world will manage what they can to continuously improve the company and create value. 
I'd now like to hand the call over for Q&A."

As you may have noticed, our sequential energy globally was up 7%, and that was entirely driven by North America. And it would be downstream refining primarily, and that's hydrogen that's going in for both these authorization and some of the large hydrocracker units along the Gulf Coast. So clearly, we've seen significant step-ups, as we anticipated, coming off a turnaround season in Q1. So current trends on our existing hydrogen assets are quite strong and quite good. In addition, as you probably know, our current backlog has a pretty large project, in fact, the largest project in our company history, with the Yara-BASF ammonias [indiscernible] plant. And there, we also are leveraging our hydrogen network and expanding that to serve hydrogen into ammonia production. So we're not only seeing good, strong trends on hydrogen refining but also throughout the petrochemical space. And when I look at our current backlog opportunities and future backlog opportunities, a lot of them do evolve around opportunities in thin gas, in hydrogen and also CO. You may recall, we announced a project about a quarter or 2 ago around expanding our CO production in Louisiana, and that's primarily for MDI, TDI production. So we're seeing not just the hydrogen molecules themselves but also some of the by-products and coproducts, like CO, that continue to be in pretty high demand in the U.S. Gulf, as you continue to see the petchem chain build out. So we feel pretty good about it. And in addition, globally, you're seeing more interest in processing heavy crude. Now a lot of it is with some of the state-owned enterprises that fiscally probably have some issues they got to get their house in order before they'll be making investments. But the economics are there and the interest is still there. And so that's another area for opportunity. So we feel very good about not just hydrogen but process gases in general and the growth prospects that are there."

And the manufacturing, as I mentioned, was fairly weak in North America and U.S. specifically. So looking at that, I still think there's a few more quarters we'll have to get through, and that's most apparent in our packaged gas businesses. When I look inside of the second quarter, I'd say things were a little bit better in June than they were in the prior 2 months. When I look sequential from Q1 to Q2, roughly flat, I'd say, hardgoods probably a little worse. Our gas is a little better. But right now, we're expecting the trends in Q2 to kind of continue into Q3. We'll see where that ends up. But a lot of it is just, I think -- it's just commodity keeps working its way through and on top of a strong dollar. Our packaged gas business and a lot of the manufacturing base in the U.S. has a pretty deep supply chain, and I think they're getting a delayed effect from a lot of these headwinds that we saw, call it, a year ago in our more upstream customers in on-site and even merchant. So I think there's going to be a few more quarters at least. And as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, you look at this sub-IP categories like met fab and equipment, which tend to be big components of what you see in the packaged gas business, and those are still fairly weak, down more than 3% for the second quarter year-over-year.

So that's something that, on a margin basis, will be probably a little dilutive. We saw it this quarter. But that's something that will give us some opportunity going out. What we're seeing today, pretty consistent with what we saw the last few quarters. Our Southern Europe, still doing quite well. We're seeing nice recovery in Spain. Even Italy has been doing better. A lot of those for us are packaged gas and merchant customers. In addition, we have a pretty large health care business in both of those countries. That continues to do quite well. We have a large food business as well that's doing well. When I look to Northern Europe, it's a little different. I think Port of Antwerp has been strong, even beyond our most recent startups. And that's just a lot of that naphtha-based chemistry, and euro at 1 10 [ph] is just making it more competitive. So we've seen good volumes there and some good assets being operated. Russia, the startups have helped. What we're seeing on the ground there is still fairly weak. You have high inflation. You have some weak growth rates. But we are able to get some pricing. But the on-site business has been still quite good, and they're running quite hard, as our customers our global exporters. And with the ruble where it's at today are very competitive. And we have some pipelines also in Northern Europe that are running quite well in places like Germany. So the real weak part, I'd say, continues to be any energy-related. So we have an upstream energy business from the North Sea that's still very weak. The Scandinavian economy is a little weaker, given its dependence on oil. But for the most part, Europe has continued to steadily improve quarter-after-quarter for us."

Mike, I think when I look at this and probably start with a year-over-year way to look at it, a couple of things that how I perceive it. I think, first is that this demonstrates that we're executing well on our strategy. You look at the more consumer defensive industries of food, health care and some of the consumers like electronics, we're getting good, mid- to high single-digit growth. And remember, this excludes acquisitions. So we've been doing small roll-up acquisitions, and a lot of them have been in these areas, health care, some food. So they're adding even more on top of this. But that, in my mind, shows our ability to execute on what we said. I think another metals, right? Metals is something that have been a challenge for us. Yet, you never saw our metals really drop the level you've seen some of the underlying volumes of customers. And part of that is that we're tied to the most competitive producers in the world. Our contracts are quite strong, and I think that has helped us a lot in that arena. So that's an area that we've seen some positive lift, and hopefully, that's a trend that can continue. Manufacturing continues to be the top 1. Now energy is a two-tale story, as you know. The upstream has been extremely weak, and we'll be lapping that here in the back half come down stream has been quite good, and so I expect that number to prove manufacturing really is the challenge right now. And it tends to make sense, as it's usually end market that gets impacted later in cycles, and it tends to be a market that's heavily supplied by packaged gases. And when I look at the Americas, that's the area where we're seeing manufacturing still be fairly weak. In fact, the Americas are driving that whole drop. We're seeing pretty much a slight growth in other regions. So that's the one that, in my mind, started to see that trend turn around, and we can really start seeing some good positive growth rate. Now we're not anticipating that for the back half of this year. We're going to take some additional self-help actions to improve our results. But if we can get any traction on that, that should be quite helpful for us."

First, on the backlog, we should have one of our strongest contribution years in '17 in quite a long time, something that's more consistent with what we've laid out 3%, 4%, just given our backlog startups are laid out. So we feel pretty good about that. Also, we'll have the full year impact of the acquisitions that we've done. And in addition, we'll be further along in the synergies that we're undertaking. So I also feel pretty good about that. So as far as those bullet points there, that's something that will definitely be a tailwind for us into '17. As far as the volumes, any organic volume growth, especially merchant and on-site that's atmospheric, is quite accretive, as you can imagine. We already have the tanks there. We already have the contracts. We already have the trailers, the trucks to deliver it. There's really no increment to cost other than the power to liquefy it and the distribution costs to get it there. When we have HYCO, HYCO naturally is a lower-margin business just because such a substantial portion of HYCO is energy pass-through. So while that growth is very strong to our cash flows, and you saw it in the sequential here, our operating cash flow was up almost 30%. But it is a little dilutive to margins just because of that energy component. So it's still very good growth for us, but that's an area where it might be a little dilutive. But other than that, any incremental volume will be accretive. Project volume usually comes at about our average margins because you bring on depreciation. You need to bring on the costs of operators and property taxes and things like that. But any other incremental volume, yes, pretty accretive and should help us lift that number."

First, seasonally, it tends to be stronger, as you can imagine, in the Northern Hemisphere as you start to get into slightly warmer climate. So there are some seasonal impacts in North America, and that's normal. We tend to see that. But to your point, there's growth rate is stronger than even more seasonality. And it's a couple of things. First, when you look at our business like new CO2, it's more based on installations, not as much consumption of carbonated beverages. So as long as there's more restaurants, there's more quick serve fill areas for people that want to provide carbonated beverages, that will grow the sales in that business regardless of how much they consume. Food also is something that really is growing for us quite well. Part of it is just the trend of more convenient foods as you get things like dual income families, et cetera. We are seeing very strong growth in aquaculture as you're getting more consumption of seafood. Food safety continues to be quite strong. We're seeing a lot of applications and opportunities. So part of this is application-driven. Part are just demographics and trends. There is a little seasonality. But this is just, in my mind, demonstrates the focus we put and the effort we're putting on it. Rio, what you tend to find in Olympics, and as you know, first of all, Olympics are very concentrated in the city of Rio. So it's not like the World Cup where you are spread across all of Brazil. This is very focused just in Rio. What you tend to see sometimes are you'll see some large production in beverages early on, and then it'll sort of tone down right before the Olympic event. And we saw that, if you look at some of the large carbonated beverage producers in the area. I don't expect it to have a big impact, maybe slightly negative, just given things will slow down for a few weeks. But overall, I don't expect it to be that material very during the. We'll have to see."

So we're assuming second quarter trends aside, from seasonality, to just sort of play out as they bid. So that's how our outlook is based. But when I look at the tariff impact and start with, specifically, U.S., clearly, it's had a positive impact for U.S. producers of steel. You've seen the impact in the margins. You've seen inventories get a little tighter. And you've the production rates improve. So that's leveled the playing field, and it's made it a bit more fair, if you want to say, for U.S.-based producers to compete. And I think that's been a good thing, and it's been a positive impact to us as well as a supplier into that industry. I believe -- while it's hard to know for certain, I believe the loser in that equation will be mostly Chinese steel and I think a lot of the, call it, Tier 2, Tier 3 producers. So we don't supply them in China today. So we haven't seen the offset to that benefit. It's not something that's in our customer base. So that's been a net positive for us. You look at a country like India, they have very, very strict controls and import restrictions. So that's been pretty insulated, and the growth rates there have been much more a function of what's going on in the country rather than what's going on around it or outside of it. So that's been good, and we've seen continued improvements there. Europe is now obviously in a position to really start looking for some protectionism. And again, I don't see that as a harm for our current customer base. So a lot to see. But net-net, as I look at across the impact, it's been net positive for us and we'll just have to see if ultimately these results in capacity be taken out in the world. And if that happens, that would be even more increment of a positive for us because that would likely help the merchant markets in those areas since a lot of these steel mills produce their own merchant liquid."

So that adds to the amount of time that they take to execute. But we feel still feel quite good about it and the opportunity set that, that provides. Clearly, having the asset base there gives you an advantage because you can deliver the reliability. Remember, it's like -- you need to be reliable to that customer every day, every minute of everyday. This is large on-site quantities that are 24/7. So being able to give the confidence that you won't shut them down is what they're really looking for. And then on top of that, you've got to provide it cost effectively. So clearly, we're going to leverage our asset base the best that we can to ensure the reliability and be able to get a respectable return. And when you win these projects, sometime you're building production capacity. Sometimes you're building distribution capacity, which would mean more pipes and more compressors. So clearly, we have an opportunity to expand our distribution through getting an attractive return. We always want to be able to take that because that not only gives us a good project, but it gives us a platform to work off for new future opportunities as well. And so we're doing a combination of all the above. We're leveraging our asset base. We're extending our asset base. And the more opportunities we can add on to this, the reliability we can bring and quality products for our customers. So that's how we look at it, and that's how we approach it. As far as infrastructure, we have got a significant, both hydrogen, processed gas and atmospheric infrastructure, throughout the U.S. Gulf Coast in Texas as well as Louisiana. And in my opinion, it's pretty unrivaled, right? We have a very large operating hydrogen storage cavern, which is a very good asset to have to ensure reliability instantaneous needs for our customers. So it's been a great asset for us to try and win more business, and we continue to see good opportunities there."

So they tend to be lower operating margins. When you sell more, you get a little bit negative mix. The lower packaged gas also does hurt a bit, and that's because it tends to be variable margin you lose and the SG&A is fixed cost. But those are things that we're working on. That's why I feel we'll have that improved by Q4.

And I'd say, like I said on sequential basis, hardgoods has been a little better Q1 to Q2 but not much in gas has gotten a little better. So we'll have to see how that plays out in Q3. But those have been sort of the same-store sales trends that we saw."

But this is not that inconsistent, the trends we've seen from kind of the manufacturing curtailment you saw in 2009. Now it's not as severe as what we saw in 2009. But the pattern is fairly similar. So yes, what we did back then was the same thing. We had some costs actions. We had price actions where we could. Gas did not drop near as much as hardgoods. Rent hung in for the most part. And then you just manage through it, and then you start to see some form of recovery at the back end. And that's why we're saying at this point could be a couple of more quarters.

318049,372079458,1015648,"Praxair Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2016",2016-07-28,"Earnings Calls","Linde plc","Executives","Thanks, Kelcey, and good morning, everyone. Our second quarter EPS finished at $1.39, which was at the upper end of the guidance range. This was driven by a combination of factors, including volume trends, foreign exchange translation and a lower tax rate",1029,"Thanks, Kelcey, and good morning, everyone. Our second quarter EPS finished at $1.39, which was at the upper end of the guidance range. This was driven by a combination of factors, including volume trends, foreign exchange translation and a lower tax rate. Overall, we continue to see strong growth in our more resilient end markets, while the cyclical market trends have been mixed with metals improving but manufacturing still a challenge.
Global volumes were flat year-over-year but up 3% sequentially due to broad-based recovery off a weaker first quarter.
In North America, trends have played out as anticipated. We continue to see solid sequential volume improvement across our on-site business, specifically in metals and downstream energy. You may recall that the first quarter had significant turnaround activity in the U.S. Gulf Coast, but we saw a very strong rebound for the second quarter.
In addition, steel import tariffs have supported margin improvements and hence production rates for our steel customers. Merchant volumes also have improved sequentially as we continue to see strong demand from food, beverage and other consumer-related markets. However, the packaged gas business is still declining from weaker manufacturing activity. U.S. industrial production for the second quarter is down more than 1% from prior year, and both the machinery and fabricated metal market IP figures are down over 3%. Packaged gas and market trends often lag industrial cycles. So there'll likely be a few more quarters of challenging conditions. We are stepping up cost actions given this outlook, so I expect some improvements by the fourth quarter.
Finally, we continue to pursue new customer on-site opportunities connected to our expansive Gulf Coast pipeline network. While these projects take considerable time to bid and negotiate, we're making good progress toward new contract signings.
South America appears to be stabilizing for a few months in a row. The political situation in Brazil has enabled an improvement in the financial markets in the real, which should support higher industrial activity at some point in the future.
Our volumes this quarter have grown 3% sequentially and 1% year-over-year, which represents the first year-over-year positive volume growth since 2014. Approximately 1/3 of our portfolio serves consumer-related markets, and they continue to grow quite well from the expansion of the middle class. Furthermore, we've seen sequential improvements in metals from a new project start-up and a slight improvement in manufacturing, although off a fairly low level.
The near-term outlook is still cautious for industrial activity given current trends and the government challenges, but I'm confident that the business is well positioned when those industrial markets turn around.
Europe is continuing on a path of slow and steady improvement. Volumes and price are up year-over-year with a strong sequential improvement in volumes at 6%. Large projects in Russia and Port of Antwerp are contributing as expected to the results. We also just completed 2 large acquisitions for the European CO2 business and bought out the partner from our Scandinavian joint venture.
Fixed costs are higher this quarter due to onetime acquisition costs and integration of the acquired business, which has near-term pressure on margins. However, those costs will be managed as part of the deal synergies, which will lead to additional margin improvements into 2017.
In our Asia segment, we continue to see mid-single digit volume growth but a challenging pricing environment, primarily in China merchant liquid. Despite the industrial overcapacity across many regions in China, our Tier 1 on-site customers continue to run well as they operate some of the most competitive assets for their industry. Metals have improved sequentially due to seasonal patterns and a project start-up in India. We continue to see growth in chemicals and electronic customers in China and Korea, and merchant growth rates are positive across most end markets.
The pricing environment in China has pressured margins, but cost actions have helped mitigate most of the impact. We have several initiatives underway to migrate towards faster-growing, more resilient end markets, like food, beverage, environmental and health care. These applications are smaller but highly accretive and less capital-intensive.
Our Surface Technology business has had relatively flat performance sequentially and year-over-year. Improvements in aerospace and highly engineered materials, like powders for added manufacturing, have been offset by significant headwinds in the energy and industrial end markets. I anticipate we'll lap some of the more difficult comps for energy and manufacturing toward the back half of this year. Furthermore, the completion of the joint venture later this year should help further improve aerospace growth opportunities.
In general, the second quarter trends have either been in line or slightly better than originally expected. On-site and merchant supply modes have mostly improved sequentially, while North American packaged gases continue to be challenged. The severe headwinds from Latin America, metals and upstream energy have stabilized, and we expect to lap most of them in the second half, although we are not projecting a recovery.
The manufacturing end market remains quite weak as the negative effects from the commodity collapse and strong U.S. dollar work their way through the supply chain. Despite these difficulties reflected in the income statement, we continued to deliver on cash generation. Operating cash flow this quarter grew almost 30% sequentially and was in line with prior year, even with lower earnings. Net debt has increased approximately $200 million as expected to fund the $360 million of synergistic acquisitions when including both the CO2 assets and the buyout of our noncontrolling JV partner. Now that the large acquisitions have been completed, we plan to lower net debt for the remainder of the year while avoiding any share dilution.
We remain firm on executing the strategy. We are optimizing the base business through self-help actions, which are visible in the business quality and strong free cash flow. We are growing resilient end markets, as demonstrated by the portfolio of growth trends. We are capitalizing on acquisition opportunities, the recently announced synergistic tuck-in deals, most of which serve Brazilian markets. And we are executing the backlog while positioning for key growth project wins in the U.S. Gulf Coast.
I'd now like to hand it over to Kelcey to walk through the financial results."
318049,372079458,1015648,"Praxair Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2016",2016-07-28,"Earnings Calls","Linde plc","Executives","Thanks, Matt. Please turn to Slide #4 for our consolidated results. Overall sales were $2.7 billion, 2% higher than last year, excluding currency and cost pass-through.

Overall sales were $2.7 billion, 2% higher than last year, excluding currency and cost pass-through. Price attainment contributed 1% growth and was achieved in several reporting segments. Acquisitions added 1% growth, largely due to the European carbon dioxide acquisition that was completed in early June.
New on-site project start-ups contributed to volume growth with the revenue more than half-weighted towards Asia and the remainder of the revenue contribution largely in Europe and South America.
In addition, we continue to see solid growth out of the more resilient end markets globally with food and beverage and health care both growing 8% year-over-year. This growth was offset by lower base business volumes in the Americas, due primarily to the weaker industrial manufacturing activity in the United States and Brazil as well as weaker upstream energy in North America.
Sequentially, volumes were up 3% versus the first quarter. About half of the volume growth is related to hydrogen sales in North America given fewer customer turnarounds, and the remaining half is attributed globally to seasonal improvement and project contribution.
By operating segment, North America organic sales declined 1% year-over-year and grew 3% sequentially. The business achieved price in merchant and packaged gases. Weaker U.S. packaged gas volumes drove the majority of the volume decline year-over-year, largely due to hard goods. The remaining volume softness included continued lower upstream energy sales in Canada, the U.S. and Mexico. However, this was partially offset by stronger merchant growth to the more resilient end markets and the improvement in hydrogen sales to refineries, given fewer customer turnarounds. Sequentially, organic growth of 3% was largely driven by the increased hydrogen sales as well as volume growth to food and beverage, health care and chemicals end markets.
In Europe, organic sales grew 4% year-over-year and 6% sequentially. Year-over-year growth was primarily driven by project contribution in Russia and Antwerp and merchant volumes largely serving food and beverage and health care customers. Sequential volume growth includes a seasonal pickup from the Easter Holiday in the first quarter, project contribution and modest growth across all end markets.
South America's organic sales grew 5% year-over-year and 6% sequentially. Year-over-year volumes again outperformed local industrial production as growth in health care and food and beverage as well as project start-up contribution mitigated continued volume declines in manufacturing. Sequentially, organic growth included higher price actions as well as volume growth from the health care end markets and a new on-site start-up serving a metals customers.
Organic sales in Asia were 5% higher than last year, primarily driven by new project start-ups in China and India. Sequentially, volume growth of 4% included seasonal improvements.
Surface Technologies organic sales were down 2% year-over-year and sequentially as growth in aerospace was more than offset by lower sales to energy and industrial end markets. Operating profit of $588 million was down 2% from the prior year period, excluding currency, as higher pricing increased operating profit, but was impacted by lower volumes. Sequentially, operating profit grew 4%, excluding currency, in line with sales. Operating margin was 22.1%, and the EBITDA margin was 33.0%. Excluding foreign currency, earnings per share of $1.39 was comparable to the prior year quarter of $1.45.
Through continued operational discipline, we generated strong operating cash flow of $706 million, which was 26% of sales. This funded capital expenditures of $357 million, about 2/3 of which was in North America, given its greater share of projects in the backlog. In addition, the company paid $214 million of dividends.
Our project backlog, which we define as projects with CapEx greater than $5 million and associated with the fully executed long-term customer supply contract, is currently $1.3 billion, comprised of 17 projects. In South America, during the second quarter, we added a project to the backlog serving a pulp and paper customer and started the CFP project in Northern Brazil, a joint venture between Vale and South Korean firms, Dongkuk Steel and POSCO Steel, exporting slabs to CFP's Korean partners. Existing backlog projects will start up and contribute to growth during the remainder of 2016 through 2018, as shown on Slide 12.
North America has grown to reflect about 65% of the backlog with more than $500 million of CapEx related to 2 projects on the U.S. Gulf Coast. New project bidding remained strongest on the U.S. Gulf Coast for various petrochemical opportunities in both atmospheric and process gases for customers taking advantage of lower feedstock costs and significant infrastructure in the region. Other secular new on-site project opportunities include refinery customers globally and customer outsourcing of select captive plants, where we can bring value to the customer through improved reliability and efficiency, typically located in emerging markets. In addition, our small on-site plant growth platform for new plants too small for the backlog threshold currently total about $65 million in CapEx for almost 20 projects under long-term contracts that will start up over the next 12 months. These projects are located in the Americas, Asia and Europe, serving a variety of customers, including wastewater treatment, automotive, chemicals and refineries.
And now I'll turn the call back to Matt to discuss our earnings guidance located on Slide 5."

The midpoint of this range is roughly flat with the second quarter of this year. This guidance anticipates foreign exchange rates for Q3 to be consistent with Q2, so no sequential impact.
We are expecting the benefits from recent acquisitions and project start-ups will be mostly offset by seasonally lower volumes. Aside from these effects, we're essentially assuming Q3 is a repeat of Q2.
For the full year guidance, we have held the midpoint and narrowed both the top and bottom by $0.10 for a new range of $5.45 to $5.60. We believe it's appropriate and prudent to remain cautious in our earnings outlook. While some market trends and foreign exchange rates have stabilized, manufacturing growth rates are still fairly anemic in certain geographies, especially the Americas. We are diligently working to improve upon these numbers, but there are not enough positive signs to raise the midpoint at this time.
Capital expenditures are anticipated to be about $1.4 billion for the year. The current trend in backlog of projects would result in a lower number, but we need to account for potential new projects that could be signed this year.
In summary, we've had another solid quarter that was slightly better than prior expectations. Volumes and macroeconomic trends are starting to stabilize and should lap more difficult comps for the back half of this year. We've been executing well on this strategy and prudently deploying capital for growth. However, based on the current outlook, we aren't in a position to declare any type of recovery. Therefore, expectations going forward are for continuation of existing trends, coupled with normal seasonality and contribution from acquisitions and project start-ups. But no matter what ultimately happens in the economy, I'm confident our employees around the world will manage what they can to continuously improve the company and create value.
I'd now like to hand the call over for Q&A."

As you may have noticed, our sequential energy globally was up 7%, and that was entirely driven by North America. And it would be downstream refining primarily, and that's hydrogen that's going in for both [indiscernible] authorization and some of the large hydrocracker units along the Gulf Coast. So clearly, we've seen significant step-ups, as we anticipated, coming off a turnaround season in Q1. So current trends on our existing hydrogen assets are quite strong and quite good. In addition, as you probably know, our current backlog has a pretty large project, in fact, the largest project in our company history, with the Yara-BASF ammonias synthesis plant. And there, we also are leveraging our hydrogen network and expanding that to serve hydrogen into ammonia production. So we're not only seeing good, strong trends on hydrogen refining but also throughout the petrochemical space. And when I look at our current backlog opportunities and future backlog opportunities, a lot of them do evolve around opportunities in thin gas, in hydrogen and also CO. You may recall, we announced the project about a quarter or 2 ago around expanding our CO production in Louisiana, and that's primarily for MDI, TDI production. So we're seeing not just the hydrogen molecules themselves but also some of the byproducts and coal coproducts, like CO, that continue to be in pretty high demand in the U.S. Gulf, as you continue to see the petchem chain build out. So we feel pretty good about it. And in addition, globally, you're seeing more interest in processing heavy crude. Now lot of it is with some of the state-owned enterprises that fiscally probably have some issues, they got to get their house in order before they'll be making investments. But the economics are there and the interest is still there. And so that's another area for opportunity. So we feel very good about not just hydrogen but process gases in general and the growth prospects that are there."

I'd say hardgoods probably a little worse. Our gas is a little better. But right now, we're expecting the trends in Q2 to kind of continue into Q3. We'll see where that ends up. But a lot of it is just, I think -- it's just commodity keeps working its way through and on top of the strong dollar. Our packaged gas business and a lot of the manufacturing base in the U.S. has a pretty deep supply chain, and I think they're getting a delayed effect from a lot of these headwinds that we saw, call it, a year ago in our more upstream customers and on-site and even merchant. So I think there's going to be a few more quarters at least. And as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, you look at the sub-IP categories, like met fab and equipment, which tend to be big components of what you see in the packaged gas business, and those are still fairly weak, down more than 3% for the second quarter year-over-year.

So that's something that, on a margin basis, will be probably a little dilutive, and we saw it this quarter. But that's something that will give us some opportunity going out. What we're seeing today pretty consistent with what we saw the last few quarters. Southern Europe still doing quite well. We're seeing nice recovery in Spain. Even Italy has been doing better. A lot of those for us are packaged gas and merchant customers. In addition, we have a pretty large health care business in both of those countries that continues to do quite well. We have a large food business as well that's doing well. When I look to Northern Europe, it's a little different. I think Port of Antwerp has been strong, even beyond our most recent startups. And that's just a lot of that naphtha-based chemistry and euro at 1 10 is just making it more competitive. So we've seen good volumes there and some good assets being operated. Russia, the startups have helped. What we're seeing on the ground there is still fairly weak. You have high inflation. You have some weak growth rates. But we are able to get some pricing. But the on-site business has been still quite good, and they're running quite hard as our customers are global exporters. And with the ruble where it's at, they are very competitive. And we have some pipelines also in Northern Europe that are running quite well in places like Germany. So the real weak part, I'd say, continues to be anything energy-related. So we have an upstream energy business from the North Sea that's still very weak. The Scandinavian economy is a little weaker given its dependence on oil. But for the most part, Europe has continued to steadily improve quarter-after-quarter for us."

Yet, you never saw our metals really drop the level you've seen some of the underlying volumes of customers. And part of that is that we're tied to the most competitive producers in the world, our contracts are quite strong, and I think that's helped us a lot in that arena. So that's an area that we've seen some positive lift, and hopefully, that's a trend that can continue. Manufacturing continues to be the tough one. Now energy is a two-tale story, as you know. The upstream has been extremely weak, and we'll be lapping that here in the back half. Down stream has been quite good, and so I expect that number to improve. But manufacturing really is the challenge right now. And it tends to make sense as it's usually an end market that gets impacted later in cycles, and it tends to be a market that's heavily supplied by packaged gases. And when I look at the Americas, that's the area where we're seeing manufacturing still be fairly weak. In fact, the Americas are driving that whole drop, but we're seeing pretty much a slight growth in other regions. So that's the one that, in my mind, started to see that trend turn around, and we can really start seeing some good positive growth rates. Now we're not anticipating that for the back half of this year. We're going to take some additional self-help actions to improve our results. But if we can get any traction on that, that should be quite helpful for us."

I'll start with first on '17, and I'm not in a position to give guidance on '17, but I can just talk near-term how we perceive things right now.

I'll start with first on '17, and I'm not in a position to give guidance on '17, but I can just talk near-term how we perceive things right now. First, on the backlog, we should have one of our strongest contribution years in '17 in quite a long time, something that's more consistent with what we've laid out, 3%, 4%, given the way our backlog start-ups are laid out. So we feel pretty good about that. Also, we'll have the full year impact of the acquisitions that we've done. And in addition, we'll be further along in the synergies that we're undertaking. So I also feel pretty good about that. So as far as those bullet points there, that's something that will definitely be a tailwind for us into '17. As far as the volumes, any organic volume growth, especially merchant and on-site, that's atmospheric is quite accretive, as you can imagine. We already have the tanks there. We already have the contracts. We already have the trailers, the trucks to deliver it. So there's really no incremental cost other than the power to liquefy it and the distribution costs to get it there. When we have HyCO, HyCO naturally is a lower-margin business just because such a substantial portion of HyCO is energy pass-through. So while that growth is very strong to our cash flows, and you saw it in the sequential here, our operating cash flow is up almost 30%. But it is a little dilutive to margins just because of that energy component. So it's still very good growth for us, but that's an area where it might be a little dilutive. But other than that, any incremental volume will be accretive. Project volume usually comes at about our average margins because you bring on depreciation. You need to bring on the costs of operators and property taxes and things like that. But any other incremental volume, yes, pretty accretive and should help us lift that number."

First, seasonally, it tends to be stronger, as you can imagine, in the Northern Hemisphere as you start to get into slightly warmer climate. So there are some seasonal impacts in North America, and that's normal. We tend to see that. But to your point, this growth rate is stronger than even more seasonality. And it's a couple of things. First, when you look at our business like new CO2, it's more based on installations, not as much consumption of carbonated beverages. So as long as there's more restaurants, there's more quick serve fill areas for people that want to provide carbonated beverages, that will grow the sales in that business regardless of and how much they consume. Food also is something that really is growing for us quite well. Part of it is just the trend of more convenient foods as you get things like dual income families, et cetera. We are seeing very strong growth in aquaculture as you're getting more consumption of seafood. Food safety continues to be quite strong, where we're seeing a lot of applications and opportunities. So part of this is application-driven, part are just demographics and trends. There is a little seasonality. But this is -- just, in my mind, demonstrates the focus we put and the effort we're putting on it. Rio, what you tend to find in Olympics -- and as you know, first of all, Olympics are very concentrated in the city of Rio. So it's not like the World Cup where you are spread across all of Brazil. This is very focused just in Rio. What you tend to see sometimes are you'll see some large production in beverages early on, and then it'll sort of tone down right before the Olympic event. And we saw that, if you look at some of the large carbonated beverage producers in the area. I don't expect it to have a big impact, maybe slightly negative, just given things will slow down for a few weeks. But overall, I don't expect to be that material very during the games themselves, but we'll have to see."

So we're assuming second quarter trends, aside from seasonality, just sort of play out as they bid. So that's how our outlook is based. But when I look at the tariff impact and start with, specifically, U.S., clearly, it's had a positive impact for U.S. producers of steel. You've seen the impact in the margins, you've seen inventories get a little tighter, and you've seen the production rates improve. So that's leveled the playing field, and it's made it a bit more fair, if you want to say, for U.S.-based producers to compete. And I think that's been a good thing, and it's been a positive impact to us as well as a supplier into that industry. I believe -- while it's hard to know for certain, I believe the loser in that equation will be mostly Chinese steel, and I think a lot of the, call it, Tier 2, Tier 3 producers. So we don't supply them in China today, so we haven't seen the offset to that benefit. It's not something that's in our customer base. So that's been a net positive for us. You look at a country like India, they have very, very strict controls and import restrictions. So that's been pretty insulated, and the growth rates there have been much more a function of what's going on in the country rather than what's going on around it or outside of it. So that's been good, and we've seen continued improvements there. Europe is now, obviously, in a position to really start looking for some protectionism. And again, I don't see that as a harm for our current customer base. So a lot to see. But net-net, as I look at across the impact, it's been net positive for us, and we'll just have to see if ultimately this results in capacity be taken out in the world. And if that happens, that would be even more incrementally positive for us because that would likely help the merchant markets in those areas since a lot of these captive steel mills produce their own merchant liquid."

So that adds to the amount of time that they take to execute. But we feel -- still feel quite good about it and the opportunity set that, that provides. Clearly, having the asset base there gives you an advantage because you can deliver the reliability. Remember, it's like -- you need to be reliable to that customer every day, every minute of everyday. This is large on-site quantities that are 24/7. So being able to give the confidence that you won't shut them down is what they're really looking for. And then on top of that, you've got to provide it cost effectively. So clearly, we're going to leverage our asset base the best that we can to ensure the reliability and be able to get a respectable return. And when you win these projects, sometimes you're building production capacity, sometimes you're building distribution capacity, which would mean more pipes and more compressors. So clearly, we have an opportunity to expand our distribution through getting an attractive return. We always want to be able to take that because that not only gives us a good project, but it gives us a platform to work off for new future opportunities as well. And so we're doing a combination of all the above. We're leveraging our asset base. We're extending our asset base. And the more opportunities we can add on to this, the more reliability we can bring and quality product for our customers. So that's how we look at it, and that's how we approach it. As far as infrastructure, we have got a significant, both, hydrogen processed gas and atmospheric infrastructure throughout the U.S. Gulf Coast in Texas as well as Louisiana. And in my opinion, it's pretty unrivaled, right? We have a very large operating hydrogen storage cavern, which is a very good asset to have to ensure reliability and instantaneous needs for our customers.

Our second quarter EPS finished at $1.39, which was at the upper end of the guidance range. This was driven by a combination of factors, including volume trends, foreign exchange translation and a lower tax rate",1028,"Thanks, Kelcey, and good morning, everyone. Our second quarter EPS finished at $1.39, which was at the upper end of the guidance range. This was driven by a combination of factors, including volume trends, foreign exchange translation and a lower tax rate. Overall, we continue to see strong growth in our more resilient end markets, while the cyclical market trends have been mixed with metals improving but manufacturing still a challenge.
Global volumes were flat year-over-year but up 3% sequentially due to broad-based recovery off a weaker first quarter.
In North America, trends have played out as anticipated. We continue to see solid sequential volume improvement across our on-site business, specifically in metals and downstream energy. You may recall that the first quarter had significant turnaround activity in the U.S. Gulf Coast, but we saw a very strong rebound for the second quarter.
In addition, steel import tariffs have supported margin improvements and hence production rates for our steel customers. Merchant volumes also have improved sequentially as we continue to see strong demand from food, beverage and other consumer-related markets. However, the packaged gas business is still declining from weaker manufacturing activity. U.S. industrial production for the second quarter is down more than 1% from prior year, and both the machinery and fabricated metal market IP figures are down over 3%. Packaged gas end market trends often lag industrial cycles. So there'll likely be a few more quarters of challenging conditions. We are stepping up cost actions given this outlook, so I expect some improvements by the fourth quarter.
Finally, we continue to pursue new customer on-site opportunities connected to our expansive Gulf Coast pipeline network. While these projects take considerable time to bid and negotiate, we're making good progress toward new contract signings.
South America appears to be stabilizing for a few months in a row. The political situation in Brazil has enabled an improvement in the financial markets and the real, which should support higher industrial activity at some point in the future.
Our volumes this quarter have grown 3% sequentially and 1% year-over-year, which represents the first year-over-year positive volume growth since 2014. Approximately 1/3 of our portfolio serves consumer-related markets, and they continue to grow quite well from the expansion of the middle class. Furthermore, we've seen sequential improvements in metals from a new project start-up and a slight improvement in manufacturing, although off a fairly low level.
The near-term outlook is still cautious for industrial activity given current trends and the government challenges, but I'm confident that the business is well positioned when those industrial markets turn around.
Europe is continuing on a path of slow and steady improvement. Volumes and price are up year-over-year with a strong sequential improvement in volumes at 6%. Large projects in Russia and Port of Antwerp are contributing as expected to the results. We also just completed 2 large acquisitions for the European CO2 business and bought out the partner from our Scandinavian joint venture.
Fixed costs are higher this quarter due to onetime acquisition costs and integration of the acquired business, which has near-term pressure on margins. However, those costs will be managed as part of the deal synergies, which will lead to additional margin improvements into 2017.
In our Asia segment, we continue to see mid-single digit volume growth but a challenging pricing environment, primarily in China merchant liquid. Despite the industrial overcapacity across many regions in China, our Tier 1 on-site customers continue to run well as they operate some of the most competitive assets for their industry. Metals have improved sequentially due to seasonal patterns and a project start-up in India. We continue to see growth in chemicals and electronic customers in China and Korea, and merchant growth rates are positive across most end markets.
The pricing environment in China has pressured margins, but cost actions have helped mitigate most of the impact. We have several initiatives underway to migrate towards faster-growing, more resilient end markets, like food, beverage, environmental and health care. These applications are smaller but highly accretive and less capital-intensive.
Our Surface Technology business has had relatively flat performance sequentially and year-over-year. Improvements in aerospace and highly engineered materials, like powders for added manufacturing, have been offset by significant headwinds in the energy and industrial end markets. I anticipate we'll lap some of the more difficult comps for energy and manufacturing toward the back half of this year. Furthermore, the completion of the joint venture later this year should help further improve aerospace growth opportunities.
In general, the second quarter trends have either been in line or slightly better than originally expected. On-site and merchant supply modes have mostly improved sequentially, while North American packaged gases continue to be challenged. The severe headwinds from Latin America, metals and upstream energy have stabilized, and we expect to lap most of them in the second half, although we are not projecting a recovery.
The manufacturing end market remains quite weak as the negative effects from the commodity collapse and strong U.S. dollar work their way through the supply chain. Despite these difficulties reflected in the income statement, we continued to deliver on cash generation. Operating cash flow this quarter grew almost 30% sequentially and was in line with prior year, even with lower earnings. Net debt has increased approximately $200 million as expected to fund the $360 million of synergistic acquisitions when including both the CO2 assets and the buyout of our noncontrolling JV partner. Now that the large acquisitions have been completed, we plan to lower net debt for the remainder of the year while avoiding any share dilution.
We remain firm on executing the strategy. We are optimizing the base business through self-help actions, which are visible in the business quality and strong free cash flow. We are growing resilient end markets, as demonstrated by the portfolio growth trends. We are capitalizing on acquisition opportunities, through recently announced synergistic tuck-in deals, most of which serve Brazilian markets. And we are executing the backlog while positioning for key growth project wins in the U.S. Gulf Coast.
I'd now like to hand it over to Kelcey to walk through the financial results."

Overall sales were $2.7 billion, 2% higher than last year, excluding currency and cost pass-through.

Overall sales were $2.7 billion, 2% higher than last year, excluding currency and cost pass-through. Price attainment contributed 1% growth and was achieved in several reporting segments. Acquisitions added 1% growth, largely due to the European carbon dioxide acquisition that was completed in early June.
New on-site project start-ups contributed to volume growth with the revenue more than half-weighted towards Asia and the remainder of the revenue contribution largely in Europe and South America.
In addition, we continue to see solid growth out of the more resilient end markets globally with food and beverage and health care both growing 8% year-over-year. This growth was offset by lower base business volumes in the Americas, due primarily to the weaker industrial manufacturing activity in the United States and Brazil as well as weaker upstream energy in North America.
Sequentially, volumes were up 3% versus the first quarter. About half of the volume growth is related to hydrogen sales in North America given fewer customer turnarounds, and the remaining half is attributed globally to seasonal improvement and project contribution.
By operating segment, North America organic sales declined 1% year-over-year and grew 3% sequentially. The business achieved price in merchant and packaged gases. Weaker U.S. packaged gas volumes drove the majority of the volume decline year-over-year, largely due to hard goods. The remaining volume softness included continued lower upstream energy sales in Canada, the U.S. and Mexico. However, this was partially offset by stronger merchant growth to the more resilient end markets and the improvement in hydrogen sales to refineries, given fewer customer turnarounds. Sequentially, organic growth of 3% was largely driven by the increased hydrogen sales as well as volume growth to food and beverage, health care and chemicals end markets.
In Europe, organic sales grew 4% year-over-year and 6% sequentially. Year-over-year growth was primarily driven by project contribution in Russia and Antwerp and merchant volumes largely serving food and beverage and health care customers. Sequential volume growth includes a seasonal pickup from the Easter Holiday in the first quarter, project contribution and modest growth across all end markets.
South America's organic sales grew 5% year-over-year and 6% sequentially. Year-over-year volumes again outperformed local industrial production as growth in health care and food and beverage as well as project start-up contribution mitigated continued volume declines in manufacturing. Sequentially, organic growth included higher price actions as well as volume growth from the health care end markets and a new on-site start-up serving a metals customers.
Organic sales in Asia were 5% higher than last year, primarily driven by new project start-ups in China and India. Sequentially, volume growth of 4% included seasonal improvements.
Surface Technologies organic sales were down 2% year-over-year and sequentially as growth in aerospace was more than offset by lower sales to energy and industrial end markets. Operating profit of $588 million was down 2% from the prior year period, excluding currency, as higher pricing increased operating profit, but was impacted by lower volumes. Sequentially, operating profit grew 4%, excluding currency, in line with sales. Operating margin was 22.1%, and the EBITDA margin was 33.0%. Excluding foreign currency, earnings per share of $1.39 was comparable to the prior year quarter of $1.45.
Through continued operational discipline, we generated strong operating cash flow of $706 million, which was 26% of sales. This funded capital expenditures of $357 million, about 2/3 of which was in North America, given its greater share of projects in the backlog. In addition, the company paid $214 million of dividends.
Our project backlog, which we define as projects with CapEx greater than $5 million and associated with the fully executed long-term customer supply contract, is currently $1.3 billion, comprised of 17 projects. In South America, during the second quarter, we added a project to the backlog serving a pulp and paper customer and started the CFP project in Northern Brazil, a joint venture between Vale and South Korean firms, Dongkuk Steel and POSCO Steel, exporting slabs to CFP's Korean partners. Existing backlog projects will start up and contribute to growth during the remainder of 2016 through 2018, as shown on Slide 12.
North America has grown to reflect about 65% of the backlog with more than $500 million of CapEx related to 2 projects on the U.S. Gulf Coast. New project bidding remained strongest on the U.S. Gulf Coast for various petrochemical opportunities in both atmospheric and processed gases for customers taking advantage of lower feedstock costs and significant infrastructure in the region. Other secular new on-site project opportunities include refinery customers globally and customer outsourcing of select captive plants, where we can bring value to the customer through improved reliability and efficiency, typically located in emerging markets. In addition, our small on-site plant growth platform for new plants too small for the backlog threshold currently total about $65 million in CapEx for almost 20 projects under long-term contracts that will start up over the next 12 months. These projects are located in the Americas, Asia and Europe, serving a variety of customers, including wastewater treatment, automotive, chemicals and refineries.
And now I'll turn the call back to Matt to discuss our earnings guidance located on Slide 5."

The midpoint of this range is roughly flat with the second quarter of this year. This guidance anticipates foreign exchange rates for Q3 to be consistent with Q2, so no sequential impact.
We are expecting the benefits from recent acquisitions and project start-ups will be mostly offset by seasonally lower volumes. Aside from these effects, we're essentially assuming Q3 is a repeat of Q2.
For the full year guidance, we have held the midpoint and narrowed both the top and bottom by $0.10 for a new range of $5.45 to $5.60. We believe it's appropriate and prudent to remain cautious in our earnings outlook. While some market trends and foreign exchange rates have stabilized, manufacturing growth rates are still fairly anemic in certain geographies, especially the Americas. We are diligently working to improve upon these numbers, but there are not enough positive signs to raise the midpoint at this time.
Capital expenditures are anticipated to be about $1.4 billion for the year. The current trend in backlog of projects would result in a lower number, but we need to account for potential new projects that could be signed this year.
In summary, we've had another solid quarter that was slightly better than prior expectations. Volumes and macroeconomic trends are starting to stabilize and should lap more difficult comps for the back half of this year. We've been executing well on this strategy and prudently deploying capital for growth. However, based on the current outlook, we aren't in a position to declare any type of recovery. Therefore, expectations going forward are for continuation of existing trends, coupled with normal seasonality and contribution from acquisitions and project start-ups. But no matter what ultimately happens in the economy, I'm confident our employees around the world will manage what they can to continuously improve the company and create value.

As you may have noticed, our sequential energy globally was up 7%, and that was entirely driven by North America. And it would be downstream refining primarily, and that's hydrogen that's going in for both desulferization and some of the large hydrocracker units along the Gulf Coast. So clearly, we've seen significant step-ups, as we anticipated, coming off a turnaround season in Q1. So current trends on our existing hydrogen assets are quite strong and quite good. In addition, as you probably know, our current backlog has a pretty large project, in fact, the largest project in our company history, with the Yara-BASF ammonias synthesis plant. And there, we also are leveraging our hydrogen network and expanding that to serve hydrogen into ammonia production. So we're not only seeing good, strong trends on hydrogen refining but also throughout the petrochemical space. And when I look at our current backlog opportunities and future backlog opportunities, a lot of them do evolve around opportunities in thin gas, in hydrogen and also CO. You may recall, we announced the project about a quarter or 2 ago around expanding our CO production in Louisiana, and that's primarily for MDI, TDI production. So we're seeing not just the hydrogen molecules themselves but also some of the byproducts and coal coproducts, like CO, that continue to be in pretty high demand in the U.S. Gulf, as you continue to see the petchem chain build out. So we feel pretty good about it. And in addition, globally, you're seeing more interest in processing heavy crude. Now lot of it is with some of the state-owned enterprises that fiscally probably have some issues, they got to get their house in order before they'll be making investments. But the economics are there and the interest is still there. And so that's another area for opportunity. So we feel very good about not just hydrogen but processed gases in general and the growth prospects that are there."

I'd say hardgoods probably a little worse. Our gas is a little better. But right now, we're expecting the trends in Q2 to kind of continue into Q3. We'll see where that ends up. But a lot of it is just, I think -- it's just commodity keeps working its way through and on top of the strong dollar. Our packaged gas business and a lot of the manufacturing base in the U.S. has a pretty deep supply chain, and I think they're getting a delayed effect from a lot of these headwinds that we saw, call it, a year ago in our more upstream customers and on-site and even merchant. So I think there's going to be a few more quarters at least. And as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, you look at the sub-IP categories, like met fab and equipment, which tend to be big components of what you see in the packaged gas business, and those are still fairly weak, down more than 3% for the second quarter year-over-year. So I think there'll be a couple of more quarters we'll have to work through on that."

In addition, we'll get the full effect of the acquisitions that we just made. Now that will bring with it a lot of fixed cost, and that's part of the synergies that we'll have to work through. So that's something that, on a margin basis, will be probably a little dilutive, and we saw it this quarter. But that's something that will give us some opportunity going out. What we're seeing today pretty consistent with what we saw the last few quarters. Southern Europe still doing quite well. We're seeing nice recovery in Spain. Even Italy has been doing better. A lot of those for us are packaged gas and merchant customers. In addition, we have a pretty large health care business in both of those countries that continues to do quite well. We have a large food business as well that's doing well. When I look to Northern Europe, it's a little different. I think Port of Antwerp has been strong, even beyond our most recent startups. And that's just a lot of that naphtha-based chemistry and euro at 1 10 is just making it more competitive. So we've seen good volumes there and some good assets being operated. Russia, the startups have helped. What we're seeing on the ground there is still fairly weak. You have high inflation. You have some weak growth rates. But we are able to get some pricing. But the on-site business has been still quite good, and they're running quite hard as our customers are global exporters. And with the ruble where it's at, they are very competitive. And we have some pipelines also in Northern Europe that are running quite well in places like Germany. So the real weak part, I'd say, continues to be anything energy-related. So we have an upstream energy business from the North Sea that's still very weak. The Scandinavian economy is a little weaker given its dependence on oil. But for the most part, Europe has continued to steadily improve quarter-after-quarter for us."

Mike, I think when I look at this and probably starting with the year-over-year way to look at it, a couple of things that how I perceive it. I think first is that this demonstrates that we're executing well on our strategy. You look at the more consumer defensive industries of food, health care and some of the consumers like electronics, we're getting good, mid- to high single-digit growth. And remember, this excludes acquisitions. So we've been doing small roll-up acquisitions, and a lot of them have been in these areas, health care, some food. So they're adding even more on top of this. But that, in my mind, shows our ability to execute on what we said. I think another metals, right? Metals is something that has been a challenge for us. Yet, you never saw our metals really drop the level you've seen some of the underlying volumes of customers. And part of that is that we're tied to the most competitive producers in the world, our contracts are quite strong, and I think that's helped us a lot in that arena. So that's an area that we've seen some positive lift, and hopefully, that's a trend that can continue. Manufacturing continues to be the tough one. Now energy is a two-tale story, as you know. The upstream has been extremely weak, and we'll be lapping that here in the back half. Down stream has been quite good, and so I expect that number to improve. But manufacturing really is the challenge right now. And it tends to make sense as it's usually an end market that gets impacted later in cycles, and it tends to be a market that's heavily supplied by packaged gases. And when I look at the Americas, that's the area where we're seeing manufacturing still be fairly weak. In fact, the Americas are driving that whole drop, but we're seeing pretty much a slight growth in other regions. So that's the one that, in my mind, started to see that trend turn around, and we can really start seeing some good positive growth rates. Now we're not anticipating that for the back half of this year. We're going to take some additional self-help actions to improve our results. But if we can get any traction on that, that should be quite helpful for us."

I'll start with first on '17, and I'm not in a position to give guidance on '17, but I can just talk near-term how we perceive things right now.

I'll start with first on '17, and I'm not in a position to give guidance on '17, but I can just talk near-term how we perceive things right now. First, on the backlog, we should have one of our strongest contribution years in '17 in quite a long time, something that's more consistent with what we've laid out, 3%, 4%, given the way our backlog start-ups are laid out. So we feel pretty good about that. Also, we'll have the full year impact of the acquisitions that we've done. And in addition, we'll be further along in the synergies that we're undertaking. So I also feel pretty good about that. So as far as those bullet points there, that's something that will definitely be a tailwind for us into '17. As far as the volumes, any organic volume growth, especially merchant and on-site, that's atmospheric is quite accretive, as you can imagine. We already have the tanks there. We already have the contracts. We already have the trailers, the trucks to deliver it. So there's really no incremental cost other than the power to liquefy it and the distribution costs to get it there. When we have HyCO, HyCO naturally is a lower-margin business just because such a substantial portion of HyCO is energy pass-through. So while that grows it's very strong to our cash flows, and you saw it in the sequential here, our operating cash flow is up almost 30%. But it is a little dilutive to margins just because of that energy component. So it's still very good growth for us, but that's an area where it might be a little dilutive. But other than that, any incremental volume will be accretive. Project volume usually comes at about our average margins because you bring on depreciation. You need to bring on the costs of operators and property taxes and things like that. But any other incremental volume, yes, pretty accretive and should help us lift that number."

First, seasonally, it tends to be stronger, as you can imagine, in the Northern Hemisphere as you start to get into slightly warmer climate. So there are some seasonal impacts in North America, and that's normal. We tend to see that. But to your point, this growth rate is stronger than even more seasonality. And it's a couple of things. First, when you look at our business like new CO2, it's more based on installations, not as much consumption of carbonated beverages. So as long as there's more restaurants, there's more quick serve fill areas for people that want to provide carbonated beverages, that will grow the sales in that business regardless of and how much they consume. Food also is something that really is growing for us quite well. Part of it is just the trend of more convenient foods as you get things like dual income families, et cetera. We are seeing very strong growth in aquaculture as you're getting more consumption of seafood. Food safety continues to be quite strong, where we're seeing a lot of applications and opportunities. So part of this is application-driven, part are just demographics and trends. There is a little seasonality. But this is -- just, in my mind, demonstrates the focus we put and the effort we're putting on it. Rio, what you tend to find in Olympics -- and as you know, first of all, Olympics are very concentrated in the city of Rio. So it's not like the World Cup where you were spread across all of Brazil. This is very focused just in Rio. What you tend to see sometimes are you'll see some large production in beverages early on, and then it'll sort of tone down right before the Olympic event. And we saw that, if you look at some of the large carbonated beverage producers in the area. I don't expect it to have a big impact, maybe slightly negative, just given things will slow down for a few weeks. But overall, I don't expect to be that material very during the games themselves, but we'll have to see."

So we're assuming second quarter trends, aside from seasonality, just sort of play out as they bid. So that's how our outlook is based. But when I look at the tariff impact and start with, specifically, U.S., clearly, it's had a positive impact for U.S. producers of steel. You've seen the impact in the margins, you've seen inventories get a little tighter, and you've seen the production rates improve. So that's leveled the playing field, and it's made it a bit more fair, if you want to say, for U.S.-based producers to compete. And I think that's been a good thing, and it's been a positive impact to us as well as a supplier into that industry. I believe -- while it's hard to know for certain, I believe the loser in that equation will be mostly Chinese steel, and I think a lot of the, call it, Tier 2, Tier 3 producers. So we don't supply them in China today, so we haven't seen the offset to that benefit. It's not something that's in our customer base. So that's been a net positive for us. You look at a country like India, they have very, very strict controls and import restrictions. So that's been pretty insulated, and the growth rates there have been much more a function of what's going on in the country rather than what's going on around it or outside of it. So that's been good, and we've seen continued improvements there. Europe is now, obviously, in a position to really start looking for some protectionism. And again, I don't see that as a harm for our current customer base. So a lot to see. But net-net, as I look at across the impact, it's been net positive for us, and we'll just have to see if ultimately this results in capacity be taken out in the world. And if that happens, that would be even more incrementally positive for us because that would likely help the merchant markets in those areas since a lot of these captive steel mills produce their own merchant liquid."

Clearly, having the asset base there gives you an advantage because you can deliver the reliability. Remember, it's like -- you need to be reliable to that customer every day, every minute of every day. This is large on-site quantities that are 24/7. So being able to give the confidence that you won't shut them down is what they're really looking for. And then on top of that, you've got to provide it cost effectively. So clearly, we're going to leverage our asset base the best that we can to ensure the reliability and be able to get a respectable return. And when you win these projects, sometimes you're building production capacity, sometimes you're building distribution capacity, which would mean more pipes and more compressors. So clearly, we have an opportunity to expand our distribution through getting an attractive return. We always want to be able to take that because that not only gives us a good project, but it gives us a platform to work off for new future opportunities as well. And so we're doing a combination of all the above. We're leveraging our asset base. We're extending our asset base. And the more opportunities we can add on to this, the more reliability we can bring and quality product for our customers. So that's how we look at it, and that's how we approach it. As far as infrastructure, we have got a significant, both, hydrogen processed gas and atmospheric infrastructure throughout the U.S. Gulf Coast in Texas as well as Louisiana. And in my opinion, it's pretty unrivaled, right? We have a very large operating hydrogen storage cavern, which is a very good asset to have to ensure reliability and instantaneous needs for our customers.

And as I mentioned, they tend to be lower margin simply because there's so much energy that's passed through. So while we show a pass-through change in pass-through price, which is separate, there is just the fact that there is a big portion of what you are selling in HyCO as energy. So there tend to be lower operating margins. When you sell more, you get a little bit negative mix. The lower packaged gas also does hurt a bit, and that's because it tends to be variable margin you lose and the SG&A is fixed cost. But those are things that we're working on. That's why I feel we'll have that improved by Q4. And other than that, year-over-year, you've got the energy that we've talked about, that was higher-margin business that's almost completely disappeared. And that's been a pretty big headwind to margins for all of North America that we've had to manage through. So those have been sort of the main contributing factors, but I do expect, going forward, we're still going to expand our margins.

Our second quarter EPS finished at $1.39, which was at the upper end of the guidance range. This was driven by a combination of factors, including volume trends, foreign exchange translation and a lower tax rate",1028,"Thanks, Kelcey, and good morning, everyone. Our second quarter EPS finished at $1.39, which was at the upper end of the guidance range. This was driven by a combination of factors, including volume trends, foreign exchange translation and a lower tax rate. Overall, we continue to see strong growth in our more resilient end markets, while the cyclical market trends have been mixed with metals improving but manufacturing still a challenge.
Global volumes were flat year-over-year but up 3% sequentially due to broad-based recovery off a weaker first quarter.
In North America, trends have played out as anticipated. We continue to see solid sequential volume improvement across our on-site business, specifically in metals and downstream energy. You may recall that the first quarter had significant turnaround activity in the U.S. Gulf Coast, but we saw a very strong rebound for the second quarter.
In addition, steel import tariffs have supported margin improvements and hence production rates for our steel customers. Merchant volumes also have improved sequentially as we continue to see strong demand from food, beverage and other consumer-related markets. However, the packaged gas business is still declining from weaker manufacturing activity. U.S. industrial production for the second quarter is down more than 1% from prior year, and both the machinery and fabricated metal market IP figures are down over 3%. Packaged gas end market trends often lag industrial cycles. So there'll likely be a few more quarters of challenging conditions. We are stepping up cost actions given this outlook, so I expect some improvements by the fourth quarter.
Finally, we continue to pursue new customer on-site opportunities connected to our expansive Gulf Coast pipeline network. While these projects take considerable time to bid and negotiate, we're making good progress toward new contract signings.
South America appears to be stabilizing for a few months in a row. The political situation in Brazil has enabled an improvement in the financial markets and the real, which should support higher industrial activity at some point in the future.
Our volumes this quarter have grown 3% sequentially and 1% year-over-year, which represents the first year-over-year positive volume growth since 2014. Approximately 1/3 of our portfolio serves consumer-related markets, and they continue to grow quite well from the expansion of the middle class. Furthermore, we've seen sequential improvements in metals from a new project start-up and a slight improvement in manufacturing, although off a fairly low level.
The near-term outlook is still cautious for industrial activity given current trends and the government challenges, but I'm confident that the business is well positioned when those industrial markets turn around.
Europe is continuing on a path of slow and steady improvement. Volumes and price are up year-over-year with a strong sequential improvement in volumes at 6%. Large projects in Russia and Port of Antwerp are contributing as expected to the results. We also just completed 2 large acquisitions for the European CO2 business and bought out the partner from our Scandinavian joint venture.
Fixed costs are higher this quarter due to onetime acquisition costs and integration of the acquired business, which has near-term pressure on margins. However, those costs will be managed as part of the deal synergies, which will lead to additional margin improvements into 2017.
In our Asia segment, we continue to see mid-single digit volume growth but a challenging pricing environment, primarily in China merchant liquid. Despite the industrial overcapacity across many regions in China, our Tier 1 on-site customers continue to run well as they operate some of the most competitive assets for their industry. Metals have improved sequentially due to seasonal patterns and a project start-up in India. We continue to see growth in chemicals and electronic customers in China and Korea, and merchant growth rates are positive across most end markets.
The pricing environment in China has pressured margins, but cost actions have helped mitigate most of the impact. We have several initiatives underway to migrate towards faster-growing, more resilient end markets, like food, beverage, environmental and health care. These applications are smaller but highly accretive and less capital-intensive.
Our Surface Technology business has had relatively flat performance sequentially and year-over-year. Improvements in aerospace and highly engineered materials, like powders for added manufacturing, have been offset by significant headwinds in the energy and industrial end markets. I anticipate we'll lap some of the more difficult comps for energy and manufacturing toward the back half of this year. Furthermore, the completion of the joint venture later this year should help further improve aerospace growth opportunities.
In general, the second quarter trends have either been in line or slightly better than originally expected. On-site and merchant supply modes have mostly improved sequentially, while North American packaged gases continue to be challenged. The severe headwinds from Latin America, metals and upstream energy have stabilized, and we expect to lap most of them in the second half, although we are not projecting a recovery.
The manufacturing end market remains quite weak as the negative effects from the commodity collapse and strong U.S. dollar work their way through the supply chain. Despite these difficulties reflected in the income statement, we continued to deliver on cash generation. Operating cash flow this quarter grew almost 30% sequentially and was in line with prior year, even with lower earnings. Net debt has increased approximately $200 million as expected to fund the $360 million of synergistic acquisitions when including both the CO2 assets and the buyout of our noncontrolling JV partner. Now that the large acquisitions have been completed, we plan to lower net debt for the remainder of the year while avoiding any share dilution.
We remain firm on executing the strategy. We are optimizing the base business through self-help actions, which are visible in the business quality and strong free cash flow. We are growing resilient end markets, as demonstrated by the portfolio growth trends. We are capitalizing on acquisition opportunities, through recently announced synergistic tuck-in deals, most of which serve Brazilian markets. And we are executing the backlog while positioning for key growth project wins in the U.S. Gulf Coast.
I'd now like to hand it over to Kelcey to walk through the financial results."

Overall sales were $2.7 billion, 2% higher than last year, excluding currency and cost pass-through.

Overall sales were $2.7 billion, 2% higher than last year, excluding currency and cost pass-through. Price attainment contributed 1% growth and was achieved in several reporting segments. Acquisitions added 1% growth, largely due to the European carbon dioxide acquisition that was completed in early June.
New on-site project start-ups contributed to volume growth with the revenue more than half-weighted towards Asia and the remainder of the revenue contribution largely in Europe and South America.
In addition, we continue to see solid growth out of the more resilient end markets globally with food and beverage and health care both growing 8% year-over-year. This growth was offset by lower base business volumes in the Americas, due primarily to the weaker industrial manufacturing activity in the United States and Brazil as well as weaker upstream energy in North America.
Sequentially, volumes were up 3% versus the first quarter. About half of the volume growth is related to hydrogen sales in North America given fewer customer turnarounds, and the remaining half is attributed globally to seasonal improvement and project contribution.
By operating segment, North America organic sales declined 1% year-over-year and grew 3% sequentially. The business achieved price in merchant and packaged gases. Weaker U.S. packaged gas volumes drove the majority of the volume decline year-over-year, largely due to hard goods. The remaining volume softness included continued lower upstream energy sales in Canada, the U.S. and Mexico. However, this was partially offset by stronger merchant growth to the more resilient end markets and the improvement in hydrogen sales to refineries, given fewer customer turnarounds. Sequentially, organic growth of 3% was largely driven by the increased hydrogen sales as well as volume growth to food and beverage, health care and chemicals end markets.
In Europe, organic sales grew 4% year-over-year and 6% sequentially. Year-over-year growth was primarily driven by project contribution in Russia and Antwerp and merchant volumes largely serving food and beverage and health care customers. Sequential volume growth includes a seasonal pickup from the Easter Holiday in the first quarter, project contribution and modest growth across all end markets.
South America's organic sales grew 5% year-over-year and 6% sequentially. Year-over-year volumes again outperformed local industrial production as growth in health care and food and beverage as well as project start-up contribution mitigated continued volume declines in manufacturing. Sequentially, organic growth included higher price actions as well as volume growth from the health care end markets and a new on-site start-up serving a metals customers.
Organic sales in Asia were 5% higher than last year, primarily driven by new project start-ups in China and India. Sequentially, volume growth of 4% included seasonal improvements.
Surface Technologies organic sales were down 2% year-over-year and sequentially as growth in aerospace was more than offset by lower sales to energy and industrial end markets. Operating profit of $588 million was down 2% from the prior year period, excluding currency, as higher pricing increased operating profit, but was impacted by lower volumes. Sequentially, operating profit grew 4%, excluding currency, in line with sales. Operating margin was 22.1%, and the EBITDA margin was 33.0%. Excluding foreign currency, earnings per share of $1.39 was comparable to the prior year quarter of $1.45.
Through continued operational discipline, we generated strong operating cash flow of $706 million, which was 26% of sales. This funded capital expenditures of $357 million, about 2/3 of which was in North America, given its greater share of projects in the backlog. In addition, the company paid $214 million of dividends.
Our project backlog, which we define as projects with CapEx greater than $5 million and associated with the fully executed long-term customer supply contract, is currently $1.3 billion, comprised of 17 projects. In South America, during the second quarter, we added a project to the backlog serving a pulp and paper customer and started the CFP project in Northern Brazil, a joint venture between Vale and South Korean firms, Dongkuk Steel and POSCO Steel, exporting slabs to CFP's Korean partners. Existing backlog projects will start up and contribute to growth during the remainder of 2016 through 2018, as shown on Slide 12.
North America has grown to reflect about 65% of the backlog with more than $500 million of CapEx related to 2 projects on the U.S. Gulf Coast. New project bidding remained strongest on the U.S. Gulf Coast for various petrochemical opportunities in both atmospheric and processed gases for customers taking advantage of lower feedstock costs and significant infrastructure in the region. Other secular new on-site project opportunities include refinery customers globally and customer outsourcing of select captive plants, where we can bring value to the customer through improved reliability and efficiency, typically located in emerging markets. In addition, our small on-site plant growth platform for new plants too small for the backlog threshold currently total about $65 million in CapEx for almost 20 projects under long-term contracts that will start up over the next 12 months. These projects are located in the Americas, Asia and Europe, serving a variety of customers, including wastewater treatment, automotive, chemicals and refineries.

While some market trends and foreign exchange rates have stabilized, manufacturing growth rates are still fairly anemic in certain geographies, especially the Americas. We are diligently working to improve upon these numbers, but there are not enough positive signs to raise the midpoint at this time.
Capital expenditures are anticipated to be about $1.4 billion for the year. The current trend in backlog of projects would result in a lower number, but we need to account for potential new projects that could be signed this year.
In summary, we've had another solid quarter that was slightly better than prior expectations. Volumes and macroeconomic trends are starting to stabilize and should lap more difficult comps for the back half of this year. We've been executing well on this strategy and prudently deploying capital for growth. However, based on the current outlook, we aren't in a position to declare any type of recovery. Therefore, expectations going forward are for continuation of existing trends, coupled with normal seasonality and contribution from acquisitions and project start-ups. But no matter what ultimately happens in the economy, I'm confident our employees around the world will manage what they can to continuously improve the company and create value.
I'd now like to hand the call over for Q&A."

As you may have noticed, our sequential energy globally was up 7%, and that was entirely driven by North America. And it would be downstream refining primarily, and that's hydrogen that's going in for both desulfurization and some of the large hydrocracker units along the Gulf Coast. So clearly, we've seen significant step-ups, as we anticipated, coming off a turnaround season in Q1. So current trends on our existing hydrogen assets are quite strong and quite good. In addition, as you probably know, our current backlog has a pretty large project, in fact, the largest project in our company history, with the Yara-BASF ammonias synthesis plant. And there, we also are leveraging our hydrogen network and expanding that to serve hydrogen into ammonia production. So we're not only seeing good, strong trends on hydrogen refining but also throughout the petrochemical space. And when I look at our current backlog opportunities and future backlog opportunities, a lot of them do evolve around opportunities in thin gas, in hydrogen and also CO. You may recall, we announced the project about a quarter or 2 ago around expanding our CO production in Louisiana, and that's primarily for MDI, TDI production. So we're seeing not just the hydrogen molecules themselves but also some of the byproducts and coal coproducts, like CO, that continue to be in pretty high demand in the U.S. Gulf, as you continue to see the petchem chain build out. So we feel pretty good about it. And in addition, globally, you're seeing more interest in processing heavy crude. Now lot of it is with some of the state-owned enterprises that fiscally probably have some issues, they got to get their house in order before they'll be making investments. But the economics are there and the interest is still there. And so that's another area for opportunity. So we feel very good about not just hydrogen but processed gases in general and the growth prospects that are there."

And the manufacturing, as I mentioned, was fairly weak in North America and U.S. specifically. So looking at that, I still think there's a few more quarters we'll have to get through, and that's most apparent in our packaged gas business. When I look inside of the second quarter, I'd say things were a little bit better in June than they were in the prior 2 months. When I look sequential from Q1 to Q2, roughly flat. I'd say hardgoods probably a little worse. Our gas is a little better. But right now, we're expecting the trends in Q2 to kind of continue into Q3. We'll see where that ends up. But a lot of it is just, I think -- it's just commodity keeps working its way through and on top of the strong dollar. Our packaged gas business and a lot of the manufacturing base in the U.S. has a pretty deep supply chain, and I think they're getting a delayed effect from a lot of these headwinds that we saw, call it, a year ago in our more upstream customers and on-site and even merchant. So I think there's going to be a few more quarters at least. And as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, you look at the sub-IP categories, like met fab and equipment, which tend to be big components of what you see in the packaged gas business, and those are still fairly weak, down more than 3% for the second quarter year-over-year. So I think there'll be a couple of more quarters we'll have to work through on that."

In addition, we'll get the full effect of the acquisitions that we just made. Now that will bring with it a lot of fixed cost, and that's part of the synergies that we'll have to work through. So that's something that, on a margin basis, will be probably a little dilutive, and we saw it this quarter. But that's something that will give us some opportunity going out. What we're seeing today pretty consistent with what we saw the last few quarters. Southern Europe still doing quite well. We're seeing nice recovery in Spain. Even Italy has been doing better. A lot of those for us are packaged gas and merchant customers. In addition, we have a pretty large health care business in both of those countries that continues to do quite well. We have a large food business as well that's doing well. When I look to Northern Europe, it's a little different. I think Port of Antwerp has been strong, even beyond our most recent startups. And that's just a lot of that naphtha-based chemistry and euro at 1 10 is just making it more competitive. So we've seen good volumes there and some good assets being operated. Russia, the startups have helped. What we're seeing on the ground there is still fairly weak. You have high inflation. You have some weak growth rates. But we are able to get some pricing. But the on-site business has been still quite good, and they're running quite hard as our customers are global exporters. And with the ruble where it's at, they are very competitive. And we have some pipelines also in Northern Europe that are running quite well in places like Germany. So the real weak part, I'd say, continues to be anything energy-related. So we have an upstream energy business from the North Sea that's still very weak. The Scandinavian economy is a little weaker given its dependence on oil. But for the most part, Europe has continued to steadily improve quarter-after-quarter for us."

Mike, I think when I look at this and probably starting with the year-over-year way to look at it, a couple of things that how I perceive it. I think first is that this demonstrates that we're executing well on our strategy. You look at the more consumer defensive industries of food, health care and some of the consumers like electronics, we're getting good, mid- to high single-digit growth. And remember, this excludes acquisitions. So we've been doing small roll-up acquisitions, and a lot of them have been in these areas, health care, some food. So they're adding even more on top of this. But that, in my mind, shows our ability to execute on what we said. I think another metals, right? Metals is something that has been a challenge for us. Yet, you never saw our metals really drop the level you've seen some of the underlying volumes of customers. And part of that is that we're tied to the most competitive producers in the world, our contracts are quite strong, and I think that's helped us a lot in that arena. So that's an area that we've seen some positive lift, and hopefully, that's a trend that can continue. Manufacturing continues to be the tough one. Now energy is a two-tale story, as you know. The upstream has been extremely weak, and we'll be lapping that here in the back half. Downstream has been quite good, and so I expect that number to improve. But manufacturing really is the challenge right now. And it tends to make sense as it's usually an end market that gets impacted later in cycles, and it tends to be a market that's heavily supplied by packaged gases. And when I look at the Americas, that's the area where we're seeing manufacturing still be fairly weak. In fact, the Americas are driving that whole drop, but we're seeing pretty much a slight growth in other regions. So that's the one that, in my mind, started to see that trend turn around, and we can really start seeing some good positive growth rates. Now we're not anticipating that for the back half of this year. We're going to take some additional self-help actions to improve our results. But if we can get any traction on that, that should be quite helpful for us."

I'll start with first on '17, and I'm not in a position to give guidance on '17, but I can just talk near-term how we perceive things right now.

I'll start with first on '17, and I'm not in a position to give guidance on '17, but I can just talk near-term how we perceive things right now. First, on the backlog, we should have one of our strongest contribution years in '17 in quite a long time, something that's more consistent with what we've laid out, 3%, 4%, given the way our backlog start-ups are laid out. So we feel pretty good about that. Also, we'll have the full year impact of the acquisitions that we've done. And in addition, we'll be further along in the synergies that we're undertaking. So I also feel pretty good about that. So as far as those bullet points there, that's something that will definitely be a tailwind for us into '17. As far as the volumes, any organic volume growth, especially merchant and on-site, that's atmospheric is quite accretive, as you can imagine. We already have the tanks there. We already have the contracts. We already have the trailers, the trucks to deliver it. So there's really no incremental cost other than the power to liquefy it and the distribution costs to get it there. When we have HyCO, HyCO naturally is a lower-margin business just because such a substantial portion of HyCO is energy pass-through. So while that grows, it's very strong to our cash flows, and you saw it in the sequential here, our operating cash flow is up almost 30%. But it is a little dilutive to margins just because of that energy component. So it's still very good growth for us, but that's an area where it might be a little dilutive. But other than that, any incremental volume will be accretive. Project volume usually comes at about our average margins because you bring on depreciation. You need to bring on the costs of operators and property taxes and things like that. But any other incremental volume, yes, pretty accretive and should help us lift that number."

First, seasonally, it tends to be stronger, as you can imagine, in the Northern Hemisphere as you start to get into slightly warmer climate. So there are some seasonal impacts in North America, and that's normal. We tend to see that. But to your point, this growth rate is stronger than even more seasonality. And it's a couple of things. First, when you look at our business like new CO2, it's more based on installations, not as much consumption of carbonated beverages. So as long as there's more restaurants, there's more quick serve fill areas for people that want to provide carbonated beverages, that will grow the sales in that business regardless of and how much they consume. Food also is something that really is growing for us quite well. Part of it is just the trend of more convenient foods as you get things like dual income families, et cetera. We are seeing very strong growth in aquaculture as you're getting more consumption of seafood. Food safety continues to be quite strong, where we're seeing a lot of applications and opportunities. So part of this is application-driven, part are just demographics and trends. There is a little seasonality. But this is -- just, in my mind, demonstrates the focus we put and the effort we're putting on it. Rio, what you tend to find in Olympics -- and as you know, first of all, Olympics are very concentrated in the city of Rio. So it's not like the World Cup where you were spread across all of Brazil. This is very focused just in Rio. What you tend to see sometimes are you'll see some large production in beverages early on, and then it'll sort of tone down right before the Olympic event. And we saw that, if you look at some of the large carbonated beverage producers in the area. I don't expect it to have a big impact, maybe slightly negative, just given things will slow down for a few weeks. But overall, I don't expect to be that material very during the games themselves, but we'll have to see."

So we're assuming second quarter trends, aside from seasonality, just sort of play out as they bid. So that's how our outlook is based. But when I look at the tariff impact and start with, specifically, U.S., clearly, it's had a positive impact for U.S. producers of steel. You've seen the impact in the margins, you've seen inventories get a little tighter, and you've seen the production rates improve. So that's leveled the playing field, and it's made it a bit more fair, if you want to say, for U.S.-based producers to compete. And I think that's been a good thing, and it's been a positive impact to us as well as a supplier into that industry. I believe -- while it's hard to know for certain, I believe the loser in that equation will be mostly Chinese steel, and I think a lot of the, call it, Tier 2, Tier 3 producers. So we don't supply them in China today, so we haven't seen the offset to that benefit. It's not something that's in our customer base. So that's been a net positive for us. You look at a country like India, they have very, very strict controls and import restrictions. So that's been pretty insulated, and the growth rates there have been much more a function of what's going on in the country rather than what's going on around it or outside of it. So that's been good, and we've seen continued improvements there. Europe is now, obviously, in a position to really start looking for some protectionism. And again, I don't see that as a harm for our current customer base. So a lot to see. But net-net, as I look at across the impact, it's been net positive for us, and we'll just have to see if ultimately this results in capacity be taken out in the world. And if that happens, that would be even more incrementally positive for us because that would likely help the merchant markets in those areas since a lot of these captive steel mills produce their own merchant liquid."

Clearly, having the asset base there gives you an advantage because you can deliver the reliability. Remember, it's like -- you need to be reliable to that customer every day, every minute of every day. This is large on-site quantities that are 24/7. So being able to give the confidence that you won't shut them down is what they're really looking for. And then on top of that, you've got to provide it cost effectively. So clearly, we're going to leverage our asset base the best that we can to ensure the reliability and be able to get a respectable return. And when you win these projects, sometimes you're building production capacity, sometimes you're building distribution capacity, which would mean more pipes and more compressors. So clearly, we have an opportunity to expand our distribution through getting an attractive return. We always want to be able to take that because that not only gives us a good project, but it gives us a platform to work off for new future opportunities as well. And so we're doing a combination of all the above. We're leveraging our asset base. We're extending our asset base. And the more opportunities we can add on to this, the more reliability we can bring and quality product for our customers. So that's how we look at it, and that's how we approach it. As far as infrastructure, we have got a significant, both, hydrogen processed gas and atmospheric infrastructure throughout the U.S. Gulf Coast in Texas as well as Louisiana. And in my opinion, it's pretty unrivaled, right?

So had I not done the acquisitions, I would have been able to lower net debt of it. But at a minimum, I want to reduce this $200 million we just raised. We'll probably spend the next 1 to 2 quarters lowering net debt of it, but we'll not allow dilution to happen. I don't expect any more large acquisitions at this point. So it should be more normal run rate. And then once we get debt back down to kind of flat-line level, we'll be in a position to reevaluate for things like either more buybacks or whatever opportunities that there are. But I'll have to reevaluate that with our CapEx outlook and other uses of cash. So right now, probably more debt paydown next 2 quarters, and then we'll reevaluate in '17 based on where things are."

So while we show a pass-through change in pass-through price, which is separate, there is just the fact that there is a big portion of what you are selling in HyCO as energy. So there tend to be lower operating margins. When you sell more, you get a little bit negative mix. The lower packaged gas also does hurt a bit, and that's because it tends to be variable margin you lose and the SG&A is fixed cost. But those are things that we're working on. That's why I feel we'll have that improved by Q4. And other than that, year-over-year, you've got the energy that we've talked about, that was higher-margin business that's almost completely disappeared. And that's been a pretty big headwind to margins for all of North America that we've had to manage through.

I'm going to cover 3 areas before I turn it over to Matt. I'm going to review what we are seeing around the world. I'm going to give you an update on the implementation of our strategy, which I reviewed with you this",1574,"Thanks, Juan. Good morning, everyone. I'm going to cover 3 areas before I turn it over to Matt. I'm going to review what we are seeing around the world. I'm going to give you an update on the implementation of our strategy, which I reviewed with you this time last year, and I have a few comments on the discussions we held with Lindy about a potential merger. 
I'll start with the U.S., which is very much a mixed bag. Our volumes to the chemical industry continued to be healthy as very end markets are more diverse and consumer-driven. Hydrogen volumes to refiners are starting to moderate as diesel demand weakens and refinery margins compress. This is offset somewhat by higher hydrogen intensity as refiners are turning to sour feedstocks to boost margins. 
Food and beverage volumes in the U.S. are strong. I'll comment more on that later. Our volumes into the steel mills along the Great Lakes are softening as auto production, which makes up about 28% of their end market sales, is coming down off the peak production rates. I expect this trend to stay with us until either energy or non-resi construction demand can pick up the slack or global excess supplies rationalize. 
The bigger worry card for us is manufacturing, where we saw weak volumes in July and August, especially in our packaged gas business. September did improve sequentially, but given the general weakness observed in Q3, we were forced to make adjustments to our cost structure, and I'll speak more to that later. 
Canada remains a tale of 2 markets as growth in health care and food and beverage in the East helps mitigate the drop in energy-related volumes experienced in the West. Mexico, x-energy, continues to grow at a healthy mid-single-digit pace as the manufacturing sector continues to favor Mexico as a preferred hub to serve North America. Our volumes into the oil well services sector are almost nonexistent today as PEMEX continues to struggle with low energy prices and their own internal issues. The economy in Brazil seems to have bottomed, albeit at a low level. By focusing on growth in nonindustrial market such as health care and food and beverage and new applications, we are able to generate growth, while our traditional metals and manufacturing markets remained quite weak. We did benefit this last quarter from a project startup in DCAP in the metals sector. 
Far for me to predict Brazil's economy. My personal view is that will not happen until inflation can be brought under control and interest rates lowered to stimulate domestic demand and the government decides to spend less on themselves and more on needed infrastructure, neither of which I expect to see in the immediate future. 
With that as a backdrop, we thought it necessary to take [Audio Gap] to better align our cost structure with the market reality. Could I be too pessimistic about Brazil's economy? Perhaps, but I would rather plan for no improvement and be pleasantly surprised if things turn around sooner than expected. 
Europe is performing better overall. Our pipeline businesses serving steel and petrochemical customers in Spain, Germany and the Benelux continue to do well. Spain continues to reemerge from a deep recession. Italy remains weak, but we are able to capitalize on small acquisitions there to build density and expand our home care business. Germany and the Benelux is more steady-state, while Scandinavia remains challenged by the pullback in energy investment. But overall, Europe is better than it has been in quite some time. 
Turning to Asia. China's underlying economy is growing at a mid-single-digit pace. Consumer-driven activity, namely electronics, health care and environmental solutions, has replaced fixed asset investment activity as the best prospects for growth. Though nothing transformative has taken place yet in India with respect to much-needed infrastructure investment, our core business continues to grow at a healthy mid-single-digit pace. 
In Korea, electronics is growing modestly, while the export-oriented manufacturing sector continues to struggle. Thailand, where we are focused on the growth of our CO2 business into food and beverage and energy end markets continues to do well. 
Turning to Page 5. The first prong of our strategy is to optimize the base business. This is all about operational discipline and execution, without which we would not have been able to deliver the solid cash flow we reported this quarter. Matt will speak more to this in his comments. 
We continue to make solid gains in our resilient market growth focus. The objective is to grow our exposure to more resilient markets from about 1/4 of our total sales to about 1/3. Included in this segment will be food and beverage, health care, aerospace and specialty gases, many of which are used in environmental applications. 
I want to touch on just a few of these areas. We closed our Yara CO2 acquisition in June, which gives us an excellent platform to grow our food and beverage business in Continental Europe and the U.K. That acquisition is off to an excellent start. We continue to add CO2 sources in the U.S. to further penetrate the food and beverage market and to keep up with the growth of our new CO2 business, which is the beverage carbonation service we acquired in 2013. Over the last 3 years, we have increased our CO2 capacity in the U.S. by almost 50%. Today, CO2 represents about 10% of our total sales and is growing in the mid- to high single-digit range globally. 
In health care, we have seen excellent growth in Canada, Mexico, South America and Southern Europe, both organically and through small acquisitions. In China, we had avoided hospital gases historically due to our own concerns over corruption. However, given the effectiveness of the government's new anticorruption campaign, we have stepped up our efforts to penetrate this market, and we are starting to see nice growth, albeit off a low base. 
Earlier this month, we closed our joint venture with GE on aircraft engine coatings. Our expectation is that between increased scope, share gain and the production ramp of the GE leap engine, our coating sales with GE will triple over the next 3 to 4 years over $200 million in sales. 
Project activity in the U.S. Gulf Coast remains robust. Based on what we have signed and to be announced, I fully expect to start the new year with $1.5 billion in the backlog, 2/3 of which is in the U.S. Gulf Coast. As a result, project contributions, which have been low over the last several years, should contribute, on average, 3% per year to the bottom line from 2017 to 2020. Between continued weakness and manufacturing across the Americas, a pullback in project activity in emerging markets, the need to reduce overhead costs in our Asia operations and the desire to accelerate cost benefits from our 2 Yara acquisitions, we have implemented a restructuring program resulting in a Q3 charge of $96 million. We expect this action to generate $45 million in annualized cost savings. 
We know that many of the headwinds we are facing will abate and more than likely turn back in our favor at some point. Though the win is hard to predict. What I have described to you is how we will grow profitably regardless of macro environment. My expectation is this strategy will produce mid-single-digit top line, and that will better bottom line over the next several years, assuming constant currency and no help from base volumes. Of course, any base volume recovery will fall through heavily to the bottom line given, in most cases, we have sufficient capacity already in place to accommodate growth. 
My last comment will be on the potential merger. First of all, we have not had any discussions with them since we announced that talks were terminated. It was reported that we cannot reach agreement on the role of Linde's headquarters. The fact is discussions were halted before we had a chance to fully vet that subject. Would I be open to resuming discussions? The answer is yes, but there's no guarantee that, that will happen. And if it does, there is no guarantee that we will reach an agreement. I've been asked about the strategic logic of this combination. First of all, our complementary geographical positions would allow us to leverage the individual strengths of each company: Linde's technology and engineering and Praxair's operational excellence, and do that across a much greater footprint. The combined portfolio would be more balanced and resilient than either standalone. The expected synergies will be compelling. The resulting balance sheet would be robust, with strong cash flows as a result of the expected synergies. Obviously, we felt any potential divestitures were manageable, otherwise we would not have pursued to this opportunity. How do we evaluate the attractiveness of this potential deal? The answer is the value of half of the combined company, including synergies, must be significantly greater than our stand-alone case. Why significantly? Because of the inherent risk involved. However, that could have been mitigated by ensuring upfront that leadership is unambiguous and the company is operated in a clear and consistent way. 
This is all I have to say on the subject. As stated at the onset, we are confident in our base strategy and remain fully committed to its implementation. I will now turn it over to Matt to discuss third quarter results and our outlook."

Please turn to Slide 7 for an overview of our third quarter results. Sales of $2.7 billion are 1% above prior year and 2% above the second quarter. Looking year-over-year, ongoing price improvements of 1% and contributions from the Yara acq",775,"Thanks, Steve. Please turn to Slide 7 for an overview of our third quarter results. Sales of $2.7 billion are 1% above prior year and 2% above the second quarter. Looking year-over-year, ongoing price improvements of 1% and contributions from the Yara acquisition of 1% partially offset by 1% headwind from foreign currency translation. As exchange rates stabilized, we're finally starting to lap the FX headwinds we've experienced over the last few years. Volume growth is flat as project gains and organic improvements in our defensive end markets are offset by lower volumes in manufacturing and upstream energy. Sequentially, we have the benefit of a full quarter from the Yara acquisition. Overall sustained national gas pass-through up 1%, which doesn't materially impact operating profit dollars, but does dilute operating margins by 20 basis points. The sequential effect is even greater in our North American segment, negatively affecting the segment operating margin by 50 basis points. 
Operating profit of $597 million is 4% below prior year and 2% above last quarter. Third quarter operating margin of 22% is in line with the second quarter, but 100 basis points below last year. This decline is primarily driven by North American manufacturing and upstream energy volume declines, especially in the packaged gas business, where we lost variable margin without corresponding overhead costs. This is why we undertook the cost-reduction effort this quarter to better align our businesses with the market trends. This action resulted in annualized savings of $45 million from a reduction of about 730 employees, with almost half in the North American segment. Earnings per share for the quarter are $1.41. Note that this excludes $100 million operating cost or $0.23 per share related to the cost actions and the pension settlement charge. EPS increased in the second quarter as project contribution and cost management efforts more than offset manufacturing weakness and normal seasonal declines in Europe. As Steve mentioned, we're executing the strategy, and the cash flow generation is a good example of our success. 
Operating cash flow is $788 million, 17% above last year and 12% above last quarter. This figure represents 29% of sales, which is one of our highest quarters ever. So despite some of the macroeconomic challenges, our employees continue to prudently control capital. In fact, third quarter free cash flow of over $400 million enabled us to reduce net debt this quarter by almost $200 million, essentially eliminating our debt increase last quarter from the acquisitions. 
In addition to strong cash generation, we continue to position the business for future growth. The project backlog increased to $1.4 billion as new on-site projects in the U.S., South Korea and Brazil more than offset the startups this quarter in Peru and Europe. We are particularly pleased with the opportunities in the U.S. Gulf coast to build up our asset network for both atmospheric and processed gases. We recently executed a contract to supply oxygen and nitrogen to MEGlobal for their new ethylene glycol plant in Freeport, Texas. We won this contract by leveraging our pipeline network to deliver high reliability at a competitive cost. In fact, we feel confident in our ability to announce additional U.S. Gulf Coast project wins by the end of this year. 
In summary, we continue to see the benefits of executing our strategy to improve cash generation, key project wins and portfolio enhancements. 
I'd now like to briefly cover guidance on Page 8. Fourth quarter EPS guidance is in the range of $1.36 to $1.43. The midpoint of this range is roughly flat with the third quarter. This guidance assumes that full quarter project contribution and benefits from the cost action are offset by weaker U.S. metals and more negative seasonal effects in South America. Fourth quarter last year was quite weak for both metals and South America due to extended outages, and we believe we may see similar trends this year. The full year guidance range is $5.44 to $5.51. The midpoint is about $0.05 lower than the prior guidance. This reduction is primarily due to weaker-than-anticipated manufacturing and metals volumes, especially in North America. We're actively working to improve upon this number, but there simply aren't enough positive signs to predict any volume recovery at this time. But rest assured, we'll continue to execute the strategy of profitable growth independent of the economic environment. 
And finally, before we open up the line, I just want to remind everyone that we don't have any further comments to make on the terminated Linde merger, so I appreciate your efforts to refrain from any questions on this topic. 
I'd now like to turn the call over to Q&A."

And I've heard other vendors talk about this. It just was very, very weak in July and August. And September did get a little better sequentially, but not enough to really give us a lot of optimism in terms of the run rates. That's why we decided to take the cost actions that we did. What's behind that? Obviously, the whole energy supply chain continued to draw down throughout the course of the year. Commodities continued to be weak. Ag continues to be weak. Anything -- any producer that's driven by exports is penalized by the strong dollar. So mining continues to be weak. So just not enough going on from an end markets standpoint. We do have some positive segments, obviously, especially gases does better. Hospitals does better, others like that. But the major end markets that are metal fabrication-driven, railcar production was off. You heard me talk earlier about diesel demand being weaker. That's because less product is being moved from coast to coast. So that whole sector has been weak. And essentially, what we did, we just carried that run rate forward into Q4 and assumed that we weren't going to see any help in Q4.

Obviously, Embraer that we don't supply a lot to, but they do fine. Agriculture does fine. People that are shipping slabs -- steel slabs out of Brazil to go to other places, those volumes are fine. But we did continue to see the manufacturing sector continue to weaken. My -- our concern and what's reflected in the guidance that Matt gave us as we go into the holidays, they'll do what they did last year. They'll take extended shutdowns beginning early December. It might not come up that quickly. So you -- the good news is we have -- we've removed the political instability. I have President Timber, and so we don't have all that drama. But then again, they have some work to do. Interest rates -- the steel grade [ph] is 14%. Inflation is like 8% or 9%, so that needs to be brought under control. That is their intention. As they do that, we expect to see the economy rebound, but that needs to happen. And the people that I've talked to on the ground in Brazil, and I'm focusing on my comments on Brazil, believe that '17 will be a little bit better because they believe it's bottomed. So I think it remains to be seen. And I want to watch it very carefully this quarter and beginning next year, but in terms of what needs to happen, operating margins is back to 20% range as we need some lift in manufacturing, which is merchant liquid business. That's the packaged gas business. And that's very much tied to manufacturing. Just to give you a couple indicators. Our automotive production is down 40% over the last 2 years. 4-0. Capital goods are down 35%. So it that feels like those of bottomed, but they're extremely low levels. So hopefully, north is the only direction we can go from here, but it remains to be seen."

Brazil manufacturing, weak. That's high-margin business. Metals that we serve off our oxygen pipeline, it's all high-margin business. So the rent rates that we're going to see and expect to see are going to be very important in terms of how we think about profitability next year. So it's not just the absolute base volume number, it's the composition of the base volume. But just a couple other things I'll add to that. Obviously, we're going to have some benefit from the restructuring actions that we just took in $45 million will translate to about a 2% EPS lift. We're going to have greater contributions from large projects than we've had in prior years. Now a lot of that is second half, just about all of it is second half loaded. But assuming they come up when I believe they will, and we have very strong contracts there that will protect us, that'll be stronger contribution than we've seen. Acquisitions will be higher, just on a carryover basis, from the Yara acquisitions. And then price, we always seem to find a way to eke out at least 1%. That will be my expectation going forward next year. So I think the wild card is going to be the base volume run rate composition of the base volume, and we should assume from that when we give you guidance."

And so when they seek various bidders for their projects, they want to understand how you can ensure reliability to meet availability of 98, 99-plus percent on a 365-day basis. So having a pipeline complex, having the ability to store products, make products, buy product and channel it through a very large network of pipes really helps improve that reliability. So if one unit goes down, you have 30 other units that you can put into the system to help back it up. So yes, this asset will be interconnected, which gives a very strong reliability. And then obviously, it gives us some cost opportunities and efficiencies we can do along our whole system as well with that density.

I'm going to cover 3 areas before I turn it over to Matt. I'm going to review what we are seeing around the world. I'm going to give you an update on the implementation of our strategy, which I reviewed with you this",1581,"Thanks, Juan. Good morning, everyone. I'm going to cover 3 areas before I turn it over to Matt. I'm going to review what we are seeing around the world. I'm going to give you an update on the implementation of our strategy, which I reviewed with you this time last year, and I have a few comments on the discussions we held with Linde about a potential merger. 
I'll start with the U.S., which is very much a mixed bag. Our volumes to the chemical industry continued to be healthy as varying end markets are more diverse and consumer-driven. Hydrogen volumes to refiners are starting to moderate as diesel demand weakens and refinery margins compress. This is offset somewhat by higher hydrogen intensity as refiners are turning to sour feedstocks to boost margins. 
Food and beverage volumes in the U.S. are strong. I'll comment more on that later. Our volumes into the steel mills along the Great Lakes are softening as auto production, which makes up about 28% of their end market sales, is coming down off of peak production rates. I expect this trend to stay with us until either energy or non-resi construction demand can pick up the slack, or global excess supplies rationalize. 
The bigger worry card for us is manufacturing, where we saw weak volumes in July and August, especially in our packaged gas business. September did improve sequentially, but given the general weakness observed in Q3, we were forced to make adjustments to our cost structure, and I'll speak more to that later. 
Canada remains a tale of 2 markets as growth in health care and food and beverage in the East helps mitigate the drop in energy-related volumes experienced in the West. Mexico, ex energy, continues to grow at a healthy mid-single-digit pace as the manufacturing sector continues to favor Mexico as a preferred hub to serve North America. Our volumes into the oil well services sector are almost nonexistent today as PEMEX continues to struggle with low energy prices and their own internal issues. The economy in Brazil seems to have bottomed, albeit at a low level. By focusing on growth in nonindustrial markets such as health care and food and beverage and new applications, we are able to generate growth, while our traditional metals and manufacturing markets remained quite weak. We did benefit this last quarter from a project startup in DCAP [ph] in the metals sector. 
Far be it for me to predict the turn in Brazil's economy, my personal view is that will not happen until inflation can be brought under control and interest rates lowered to stimulate domestic demand, and the government decides to spend less on themselves and more on needed infrastructure, neither of which I expect to see in the immediate future. 
With that as a backdrop, we thought it necessary to take... 
[Audio Gap] 
to better align our cost structure with the market reality. Could I be too pessimistic about Brazil's economy? Perhaps, but I would rather plan for no improvement and be pleasantly surprised if things turn around sooner than expected. 
Europe is performing better overall. Our pipeline businesses serving steel and petrochemical customers in Spain, Germany and the Benelux continue to do well. Spain continues to reemerge from a deep recession. Italy remains weak, but we are able to capitalize on small acquisitions there to build density and expand our home care business. Germany and the Benelux is more steady-state, while Scandinavia remains challenged by the pullback in energy investment. But overall, Europe is better than it has been in quite some time. 
Turning to Asia. China's underlying economy is growing at a mid-single-digit pace. Consumer-driven activity, namely electronics, health care and environmental solutions, has replaced fixed asset investment activity as the best prospects for growth. Though nothing transformative has taken place yet in India with respect to much-needed infrastructure investment, our core business continues to grow at a healthy mid-single-digit pace. 
In Korea, electronics is growing modestly, while the export-oriented manufacturing sector continues to struggle. Thailand, where we are focused on the growth of our CO2 business into food and beverage and energy end markets continues to do well. 
Turning to Page 5. The first prong of our strategy is to optimize the base business. This is all about operational discipline and execution, without which we would not have been able to deliver the solid cash flow we reported this quarter. Matt will speak more to this in his comments. 
We continue to make solid gains in our resilient market growth focus. The objective is to grow our exposure to more resilient markets from about 1/4 of our total sales to about 1/3. Included in this segment would be food and beverage, health care, aerospace and specialty gases, many of which are used in environmental applications. 
I want to touch on just a few of these areas. We closed our Yara CO2 acquisition in June, which gives us an excellent platform to grow our food and beverage business in Continental Europe and the U.K. That acquisition is off to an excellent start. We continue to add CO2 sources in the U.S. to further penetrate the food and beverage market and to keep up with the growth of our new CO2 business, which is the beverage carbonation service we acquired in 2013. Over the last 3 years, we have increased our CO2 capacity in the U.S. by almost 50%. Today, CO2 represents about 10% of our total sales and is growing in the mid- to high single-digit range globally. 
In health care, we have seen excellent growth in Canada, Mexico, South America and Southern Europe, both organically and through small acquisitions. In China, we had avoided hospital gases historically due to our own concerns over corruption. However, given the effectiveness of the government's new anticorruption campaign, we have stepped up our efforts to penetrate this market, and we are starting to see nice growth, albeit off a low base. 
Earlier this month, we closed our joint venture with GE on aircraft engine coatings. Our expectation is that between increased scope, share gain and the production ramp of the GE LEAP engine, our coating sales with GE will triple over the next 3 to 4 years over $200 million in sales. 
Project activity in the U.S. Gulf Coast remains robust. Based on what we have signed and to be announced, I fully expect to start the new year with $1.5 billion in the backlog, 2/3 of which is in the U.S. Gulf Coast. As a result, project contributions, which have been low over the last several years, should contribute, on average, 3% per year to the bottom line from 2017 to 2020. Between continued weakness in manufacturing across the Americas, a pullback in project activity in emerging markets, the need to reduce overhead costs in our Asia operations and the desire to accelerate cost benefits from our 2 Yara acquisitions, we have implemented a restructuring program resulting in a Q3 charge of $96 million. We expect this action to generate $45 million in annualized cost savings. 
We know that many of the headwinds we are facing will abate and more than likely turn back in our favor at some point, though the win is hard to predict. What I had described to you is how we will grow profitably regardless of macro environment. My expectation is this strategy will produce mid-single-digit top line, and that or better bottom line over the next several years, assuming constant currency and no help from base volumes. Of course, any base volume recovery will fall through heavily to the bottom line given, in most cases, we have sufficient capacity already in place to accommodate growth. 
My last comment will be on the potential Linde merger. First of all, we have not had any discussions with them since we announced that talks were terminated. It was reported that we cannot reach agreement on the role of Linde's headquarters. The fact is discussions were halted before we had a chance to fully vet that subject. Would I be open to resuming discussions? The answer is yes, but there's no guarantee that, that will happen. And if it does, there is no guarantee that we will reach an agreement. I had been asked about the strategic logic of this combination. First of all, our complementary geographical positions would allow us to leverage the individual strengths of each company: Linde's technology and engineering and Praxair's operational excellence, and do that across a much greater footprint. The combined portfolio would be more balanced and resilient than either standalone. The expected synergies would be compelling. The resulting balance sheet would be robust with strong cash flow as a result of the expected synergies. Obviously, we felt any potential divestitures were manageable, otherwise we would not have pursued this opportunity. How do we evaluate the attractiveness of this potential deal? The answer is the value of half of the combined company, including synergies, must be significantly greater than our stand-alone case. Why significantly? Because of the inherent risk involved. However, that could have been mitigated by ensuring upfront that leadership is unambiguous and the company is operated in a clear and consistent way. 
This is all I have to say on the subject. As stated at the onset, we are confident in our base strategy and remain fully committed to its implementation. 
I'll now turn it over to Matt to discuss third quarter results and our outlook."

Looking year-over-year, ongoing price improvements of 1% and contributions from the Yara acq",775,"Thanks, Steve. Please turn to Slide 7 for an overview of our third quarter results. Sales of $2.7 billion are 1% above prior year and 2% above the second quarter. Looking year-over-year, ongoing price improvements of 1% and contributions from the Yara acquisition of 1% were partially offset by 1% headwind from foreign currency translation. As exchange rates stabilized, we're finally starting to lap the FX headwinds we've experienced over the last few years. Volume growth is flat as project gains and organic improvements in our defensive end markets are offset by lower volumes in manufacturing and upstream energy. Sequentially, we have the benefit of a full quarter from the Yara acquisition. Overall sustained national gas pass-through up 1%, which doesn't materially impact operating profit dollars, but does dilute operating margins by 20 basis points. The sequential effect is even greater in our North American segment, negatively affecting the segment operating margin by 50 basis points. 
Operating profit of $597 million is 4% below prior year and 2% above last quarter. Third quarter operating margin of 22% is in line with the second quarter, but 100 basis points below last year. This decline is primarily driven by North American manufacturing and upstream energy volume declines, especially in the packaged gas business, where we've lost variable margin without corresponding overhead costs. This is why we undertook the cost-reduction effort this quarter to better align our businesses with market trends. This action resulted in annualized savings of $45 million from a reduction of about 730 employees, with almost half in the North American segment. Earnings per share for the quarter are $1.41. Note that this excludes $100 million operating cost or $0.23 per share related to the cost actions and the pension settlement charge. EPS increased in the second quarter as project contribution and cost management efforts more than offset manufacturing weakness and normal seasonal declines in Europe. As Steve mentioned, we're executing the strategy, and the cash flow generation is a good example of our success. 
Operating cash flow is $788 million, 17% above last year and 12% above last quarter. This figure represents 29% of sales, which is one of our highest quarters ever. So despite some of the macroeconomic challenges, our employees continued to prudently control capital. In fact, third quarter free cash flow of over $400 million enabled us to reduce net debt this quarter by almost $200 million, essentially eliminating our debt increase last quarter from the acquisitions. 
In addition to strong cash generation, we continue to position the business for future growth. The project backlog increased to $1.4 billion as new on-site projects in the U.S., South Korea and Brazil more than offset the startups this quarter in Peru and Europe. We are particularly pleased with the opportunities in the U.S. Gulf Coast to build up our asset network for both atmospheric and processed gases. We recently executed a contract to supply oxygen and nitrogen to MEGlobal for their new ethylene glycol plant in Freeport, Texas. We won this contract by leveraging our pipeline network to deliver high reliability at a competitive cost. In fact, we feel confident in our ability to announce additional U.S. Gulf Coast project wins by the end of this year. 
In summary, we continue to see the benefits of executing our strategy through improved cash generation, key project wins and portfolio enhancements. 
I'd now like to briefly cover guidance on Page 8. Fourth quarter EPS guidance is in the range of $1.36 to $1.43. The midpoint of this range is roughly flat with the third quarter. This guidance assumes that full quarter project contribution and benefits from the cost action are offset by weaker U.S. metals and more negative seasonal effects in South America. Fourth quarter last year was quite weak for both metals and South America due to extended outages, and we believe we may see similar trends this year. The full year guidance range is $5.44 to $5.51. The midpoint is about $0.05 lower than the prior guidance. This reduction is primarily due to weaker-than-anticipated manufacturing and metals volumes, especially in North America. We're actively working to improve upon this number, but there simply aren't enough positive signs to predict any volume recovery at this time. But rest assured, we'll continue to execute the strategy of profitable growth independent of the economic environment. 
And finally, before we open up the line, I just want to remind everyone that we don't have any further comments to make on the terminated Linde merger, so I appreciate your efforts to refrain from any questions on this topic. 
I'd now like to turn the call over to Q&A."

And if you can capture those, you're in a great position to continue to grow from that source in that local market. If I look at new CO2, we have replicated that model in Brazil quite successfully.

The gas part, I'll call it gas, rent and other, is down low single digits. Hardgoods is down mid-teens, and that's year-over-year. And then sequentially, it's down low single digits. So I don't know if you recall, we had a fairly nice step-up Q2 over Q1 in the packaged gas business. We were hoping that was going to continue through Q3, possibly grow. What happened in July and August, and I've heard other vendors talk about this, it just was very, very weak in July and August. And September did get a little better sequentially, but not enough to really give us a lot of optimism in terms of the run rates. That's why we decided to take the cost actions that we did. What's behind that? Obviously, the whole energy supply chain continued to draw down throughout the course of the year. Commodities continued to be weak. Ag continues to be weak. Anything -- any producer that's driven by exports is penalized by the strong dollar. So mining continues to be weak. So just not enough going on from an end market's standpoint. We do have some positive segments, obviously, especially gases does better. Hospitals does better. Others like that, but the major end markets that are metal fabrication-driven, railcar production was off. You heard me talk earlier about diesel demand being weaker. That's because less product is being moved from coast to coast. So that whole sector has been weak. And essentially, what we did, we just carried that run rate forward into Q4 and assumed that we weren't going to see any help in Q4. And quite possibly, as we get closer to the holidays, we may start to see extended shutdowns in the U.S. and probably will in Brazil, but we may start to see that in the U.S. as well."

Obviously, Embraer that we don't supply a lot to, but they do fine. Agriculture does fine. People that are shipping slabs -- steel slabs out of Brazil to go to other places, those volumes are fine. But we did continue to see the manufacturing sector continue to weaken. My -- our concern and what's reflected in the guidance that Matt gave us is that as we go into the holidays, they'll do what they did last year. They'll take extended shutdowns beginning early December, and might not come up that quickly. So you -- the good news is we have -- we've removed the political instability. I have President Temer, and so we don't have all that drama. But then again, they have some work to do. Interest rates -- the steel, it creates 14%. Inflation is like 8% or 9%, so that needs to be brought under control. That is their intention. As they do that, we expect to see the economy rebound, but that needs to happen. And the people that I've talked to on the ground in Brazil, and I'm focusing on my comments on Brazil, believe that '17 will be a little bit better because they believe it's bottomed. So I think it remains to be seen. And I want to watch it very carefully this quarter and beginning next year, but in terms of what needs to happen, say, to get our operating margins back to 20% range is we need some lift in manufacturing, which is merchant liquid business. That's the packaged gas business, and that's very much tied to manufacturing. Just to give you a couple indicators, our automotive production is down 40% over the last 2 years, 4-0. Capital goods are down 35%. So that feels like those have bottomed, but they're extremely low levels. So hopefully, north is the only direction we can go from here, but it remains to be seen."

Brazil manufacturing, weak. That's high-margin business. Metals off of our -- that we serve off our oxygen pipeline, it's all high-margin business. So the run rates that we're going to see and expect to see are going to be very important in terms of how we think about profitability next year. So it's not just the absolute base volume number, it's the composition of the base volume. But just a couple other things that I'll add to that. Obviously, we're going to have some benefit from the restructuring actions that we just took, and $45 million will translate to about a 2% EPS lift. We're going to have greater contributions from large projects than we've had in prior years. Now a lot of that is second half -- well, just about all of it is second half loaded. But assuming they come up when I believe they will, and we have very strong contracts there that will protect us, that'll be stronger contribution than we've seen. Acquisitions will be higher, just on a carryover basis, from the Yara acquisitions. And then price, we always seem to find a way to eke out at least 1%. That will be my expectation going forward next year. So I think the wild card is going to be the base volume run rate, composition of the base volume, and we should assume from that when we give you guidance."

Argon is certainly a higher capacity utilization than that. And if we look around the world, we're probably -- the answer is probably 70s no matter what country you look at from a capacity utilization standpoint. So there is capacity there to serve growth as it materializes. And in the U.S., I wouldn't say there's a lot that we can do to rationalize capacity.

I mean, these operations run 24/7, and they're making these investments based on long-term view of their ability to produce their product and supply their product and get the return on those investments they're making. So it's absolutely critical that all suppliers, especially industrial gas suppliers, are able to keep them running and onstream. And so when they seek various bidders for their projects, they want to understand how you can ensure reliability to meet availability of 98%, 99-plus percent on a 365-day basis. So having a pipeline complex, having the ability to store products, make products, buy product and channel it through a very large network of pipes really helps improve that reliability. So if one unit goes down, you have 30 other units that you can put into the system to help back it up. So yes, that this asset will be interconnected, which gives a very strong reliability. And then obviously, it gives us some cost opportunities and efficiencies we can do along our whole system as well with that density. So this really plays into the density, and particularly on an on-site basis, but reliability and total cost of solution are the 2 most important things for somewhat of this type of nature.

I'm going to cover 3 areas before I turn it over to Matt. I'm going to review what we are seeing around the world. I'm going to give you an update on the implementation of our strategy, which I reviewed with you this",1580,"Thanks, Juan. Good morning, everyone. I'm going to cover 3 areas before I turn it over to Matt. I'm going to review what we are seeing around the world. I'm going to give you an update on the implementation of our strategy, which I reviewed with you this time last year, and I have a few comments on the discussions we held with Linde about a potential merger. 
I'll start with the U.S., which is very much a mixed bag. Our volumes to the chemical industry continued to be healthy as varying markets are more diverse and consumer-driven. Hydrogen volumes to refiners are starting to moderate as diesel demand weakens and refinery margins compress. This is offset somewhat by higher hydrogen intensity as refiners are turning to sour feedstocks to boost margins. 
Food and beverage volumes in the U.S. are strong. I'll comment more on that later. Our volumes into the steel mills along the Great Lakes are softening as auto production, which makes up about 28% of their end market sales, is coming down off of peak production rates. I expect this trend to stay with us until either energy or non-resi construction demand can pick up the slack, or global excess supplies rationalize. 
The bigger worry card for us is manufacturing, where we saw weak volumes in July and August, especially in our packaged gas business. September did improve sequentially, but given the general weakness observed in Q3, we were forced to make adjustments to our cost structure, and I'll speak more to that later. 
Canada remains a tale of 2 markets as growth in health care and food and beverage in the East helps mitigate the drop in energy-related volumes experienced in the West. Mexico, ex energy, continues to grow at a healthy mid-single-digit pace as the manufacturing sector continues to favor Mexico as a preferred hub to serve North America. Our volumes into the oil well services sector are almost nonexistent today as PEMEX continues to struggle with low energy prices and their own internal issues. The economy in Brazil seems to have bottomed, albeit at a low level. By focusing on growth in nonindustrial markets such as health care and food and in new applications, we are able to generate growth, while our traditional metals and manufacturing markets remained quite weak. We did benefit this last quarter from a project startup in DCAP [ph] in the metals sector. 
Far be it for me to predict the turn in Brazil's economy, my personal view is that will not happen until inflation can be brought under control and interest rates lowered to stimulate domestic demand, and the government decides to spend less on themselves and more on needed infrastructure, neither of which I expect to see in the immediate future. 
With that as a backdrop, we thought it necessary to take... 
[Audio Gap] 
to better align our cost structure with the market reality. Could I be too pessimistic about Brazil's economy? Perhaps, but I would rather plan for no improvement and be pleasantly surprised if things turn around sooner than expected. 
Europe is performing better overall. Our pipeline businesses serving steel and petrochemical customers in Spain, Germany and the Benelux continue to do well. Spain continues to reemerge from a deep recession. Italy remains weak, but we are able to capitalize on small acquisitions there to build density and expand our home care business. Germany and the Benelux is more steady-state, while Scandinavia remains challenged by the pullback in energy investment. But overall, Europe is better than it has been in quite some time. 
Turning to Asia. China's underlying economy is growing at a mid-single-digit pace. Consumer-driven activity, namely electronics, health care and environmental solutions, has replaced fixed asset investment activity as the best prospects for growth. Though nothing transformative has taken place yet in India with respect to much-needed infrastructure investment, our core business continues to grow at a healthy mid-single-digit pace. 
In Korea, electronics is growing modestly, while the export-oriented manufacturing sector continues to struggle. Thailand, where we are focused on the growth of our CO2 business into food and beverage and energy end markets continues to do well. 
Turning to Page 5. The first prong of our strategy is to optimize the base business. This is all about operational discipline and execution, without which we would not have been able to deliver the solid cash flow we reported this quarter. Matt will speak more to this in his comments. 
We continue to make solid gains in our resilient market growth focus. The objective is to grow our exposure to more resilient markets from about 1/4 of our total sales to about 1/3. Included in this segment would be food and beverage, health care, aerospace and specialty gases, many of which are used in environmental applications. 
I want to touch on just a few of these areas. We closed our Yara CO2 acquisition in June, which gives us an excellent platform to grow our food and beverage business in Continental Europe and the U.K. That acquisition is off to an excellent start. We continue to add CO2 sources in the U.S. to further penetrate the food and beverage market and to keep up with the growth of our new CO2 business, which is the beverage carbonation service we acquired in 2013. Over the last 3 years, we have increased our CO2 capacity in the U.S. by almost 50%. Today, CO2 represents about 10% of our total sales and is growing in the mid- to high single-digit range globally. 
In health care, we have seen excellent growth in Canada, Mexico, South America and Southern Europe, both organically and through small acquisitions. In China, we had avoided hospital gases historically due to our own concerns over corruption. However, given the effectiveness of the government's new anticorruption campaign, we have stepped up our efforts to penetrate this market, and we are starting to see nice growth, albeit off a low base. 
Earlier this month, we closed our joint venture with GE on aircraft engine coatings. Our expectation is that between increased scope, share gain and the production ramp of the GE LEAP engine, our coating sales with GE will triple over the next 3 to 4 years to over $200 million in sales. 
Project activity in the U.S. Gulf Coast remains robust. Based on what we have signed and to be announced, I fully expect to start the new year with $1.5 billion in the backlog, 2/3 of which is in the U.S. Gulf Coast. As a result, project contributions, which have been low over the last several years, should contribute, on average, 3% per year to the bottom line from 2017 to 2020. Between continued weakness in manufacturing across the Americas, a pullback in project activity in emerging markets, the need to reduce overhead costs in our Asia operations and the desire to accelerate cost benefits from our 2 Yara acquisitions, we have implemented a restructuring program resulting in a Q3 charge of $96 million. We expect this action to generate $45 million in annualized cost savings. 
We know that many of the headwinds we are facing will abate and more than likely turn back in our favor at some point, though the win is hard to predict. What I have described to you is how we will grow profitably regardless of macro environment. My expectation is this strategy will produce mid-single-digit top line and that or better bottom line over the next several years, assuming constant currency and no help from base volumes. Of course, any base volume recovery will fall through heavily to the bottom line given, in most cases, we have sufficient capacity already in place to accommodate growth. 
My last comment will be on the potential Linde merger. First of all, we have not had any discussions with them since we announced that talks were terminated. It was reported that we cannot reach agreement on the role of Linde's headquarters. The fact is discussions were halted before we had a chance to fully vet that subject. Would I be open to resuming discussions? The answer is yes, but there's no guarantee that that will happen. And if it does, there is no guarantee that we will reach an agreement. I have been asked about the strategic logic of this combination. First of all, our complementary geographical positions would allow us to leverage the individual strengths of each company, Linde's technology and engineering and Praxair's operational excellence, and do that across a much greater footprint. The combined portfolio would be more balanced and resilient than either standalone. The expected synergies would be compelling. The resulting balance sheet would be robust with strong cash flow as a result of the expected synergies. Obviously, we felt any potential divestitures were manageable, otherwise we would not have pursued this opportunity. How do we evaluate the attractiveness of this potential deal? The answer is the value of half of the combined company, including synergies, must be significantly greater than our stand-alone case. Why significantly? Because of the inherent risk involved. However, that could have been mitigated by ensuring upfront that leadership is unambiguous and the company is operated in a clear and consistent way. 
This is all I have to say on the subject. As stated at the onset, we are confident in our base strategy and remain fully committed to its implementation. 
I'll now turn it over to Matt to discuss third quarter results and our outlook."

Please turn to Slide 7 for an overview of our third quarter results. Sales of $2.7 billion are 1% above prior year and 2% above the second quarter. Looking year-over-year, ongoing price improvements of 1% and contributions from the Yara acq",774,"Thanks, Steve. Please turn to Slide 7 for an overview of our third quarter results. Sales of $2.7 billion are 1% above prior year and 2% above the second quarter. Looking year-over-year, ongoing price improvements of 1% and contributions from the Yara acquisition of 1% were partially offset by 1% headwind from foreign currency translation. As exchange rates stabilized, we're finally starting to lap the FX headwinds we've experienced over the last few years. Volume growth is flat as project gains and organic improvements in our defensive end markets are offset by lower volumes in manufacturing and upstream energy. Sequentially, we have the benefit of a full quarter from the acquisition. Overall sustained national gas pass-through up 1%, which doesn't materially impact operating profit dollars, but does dilute operating margins by 20 basis points. The sequential effect is even greater in our North American segment, negatively affecting the segment operating margin by 50 basis points. 
Operating profit of $597 million is 4% below prior year and 2% above last quarter. Third quarter operating margin of 22% is in line with the second quarter, but 100 basis points below last year. This decline is primarily driven by North American manufacturing and upstream energy volume declines, especially in the packaged gas business, where we've lost variable margin without corresponding overhead costs. This is why we undertook the cost-reduction effort this quarter to better align our businesses with market trends. This action resulted in annualized savings of $45 million from a reduction of about 730 employees, with almost half in the North American segment. Earnings per share for the quarter are $1.41. Note that this excludes $100 million operating cost or $0.23 per share related to the cost actions and the pension settlement charge. EPS increased in the second quarter as project contribution and cost management efforts more than offset manufacturing weakness and normal seasonal declines in Europe. As Steve mentioned, we're executing the strategy, and the cash flow generation is a good example of our success. 
Operating cash flow is $788 million, 17% above last year and 12% above last quarter. This figure represents 29% of sales, which is one of our highest quarters ever. So despite some of the macroeconomic challenges, our employees continued to prudently control capital. In fact, third quarter free cash flow of over $400 million enabled us to reduce net debt this quarter by almost $200 million, essentially eliminating our debt increase last quarter from the acquisitions. 
In addition to strong cash generation, we continue to position the business for future growth. The project backlog increased to $1.4 billion as new on-site projects in the U.S., South Korea and Brazil more than offset the startups this quarter in Peru and Europe. We are particularly pleased with the opportunities in the U.S. Gulf Coast to build up our asset network for both atmospheric and processed gases. We recently executed a contract to supply oxygen and nitrogen to MEGlobal for their new ethylene glycol plant in Freeport, Texas. We won this contract by leveraging our pipeline network to deliver high reliability at a competitive cost. In fact, we feel confident in our ability to announce additional U.S. Gulf Coast project wins by the end of this year. 
In summary, we continue to see the benefits of executing our strategy through improved cash generation, key project wins and portfolio enhancements. 
I'd now like to briefly cover guidance on Page 8. Fourth quarter EPS guidance is in the range of $1.36 to $1.43. The midpoint of this range is roughly flat with the third quarter. This guidance assumes that full quarter project contribution and benefits from the cost action are offset by weaker U.S. metals and more negative seasonal effects in South America. Fourth quarter last year was quite weak for both metals and South America due to extended outages, and we believe we may see similar trends this year. The full year guidance range is $5.44 to $5.51. The midpoint is about $0.05 lower than the prior guidance. This reduction is primarily due to weaker-than-anticipated manufacturing and metals volumes, especially in North America. We're actively working to improve upon this number, but there simply aren't enough positive signs to predict any volume recovery at this time. But rest assured, we'll continue to execute the strategy of profitable growth independent of the economic environment. 
And finally, before we open up the line, I just want to remind everyone that we don't have any further comments to make on the terminated Linde merger, so I appreciate your efforts to refrain from any questions on this topic. 
I'd now like to turn the call over to Q&A."

So I don't know if you'll recall, we had a fairly nice step-up Q2 over Q1 in the packaged gas business. We were hoping that was going to continue through Q3, possibly grow. What happened in July and August, and I've heard other vendors talk about this, it just was very, very weak in July and August. And September did get a little better sequentially, but not enough to really give us a lot of optimism in terms of the run rates. That's why we decided to take the cost actions that we did. What's behind that? Obviously, the whole energy supply chain continued to draw down throughout the course of the year. Commodities continued to be weak. Ag continues to be weak. Anything -- any producer that's driven by exports is penalized by the strong dollar. So mining continues to be weak. So just not enough going on from an end market's standpoint. We do have some positive segments, obviously, specialty gases does better. Hospitals does better. Others like that. But the major end markets that are metal fabrication-driven -- railcar production was off. You heard me talk earlier about diesel demand being weaker. That's because less product is being moved from coast to coast. So that whole sector has been weak. And essentially, what we did, we just carried that run rate forward into Q4 and assumed that we weren't going to see any help in Q4. And quite possibly, as we get closer to the holidays, we may start to see extended shutdowns in the U.S. and probably will in Brazil, but we may start to see that in the U.S. as well."

But we did continue to see the manufacturing sector continue to weaken. My -- our concern and what's reflected in the guidance that Matt gave us as we go into the holidays, they'll do what they did last year. They'll take extended shutdowns beginning early December. It might not come up that quickly. So you -- the good news is we have -- we've removed the political instability. I have President Temer, and so we don't have all that drama. But then again, they have some work to do. Interest rates -- the SELIC rate is 14%. Inflation is like 8% or 9%, so that needs to be brought under control. That is their intention. As they do that, we expect to see the economy rebound, but that needs to happen. And the people that I've talked to on the ground in Brazil, and I'm focusing all my comments on Brazil, believe that '17 will be a little bit better because they believe it's bottomed. So I think it remains to be seen. And I want to watch it very carefully this quarter and beginning next year, but in terms of what needs to happen, say, to get our operating margins back to 20% ranges we need some lift in manufacturing, which is merchant liquid business. That's the packaged gas business, and that's very much tied to manufacturing. Just to give you a couple indicators, our automotive production is down 40% over the last 2 years, 4-0. Capital goods are down 35%. So that feels like those have bottomed, but they're extremely low levels. So hopefully, north is the only direction we can go from here, but it remains to be seen."

We're going to have greater contributions from large projects than we've had in prior years. Now a lot of that is second half -- well, just about all of it is second half loaded. But assuming they come up when I believe they will, and we have very strong contracts there that will protect us, that'll be stronger contribution than we've seen. Acquisitions will be higher, just on a carryover basis, from the Yara acquisitions. And then price, we always seem to find a way to eke out at least 1%. That will be my expectation going forward next year. So I think the wild card is going to be the base volume run rate, composition of the base volume, and we should assume from that when we give you guidance."

I said today 2/3 of the backlog when we start off the year, is going to be in the U.S. Gulf Coast. That percent is going to -- I project is going to go up over the next couple years. So unless the commodity market reverse and you see some dramatic improvement in economic activity in some of the emerging markets around the world, I really don't expect to see hardly anything in the way of new proposal activity other than maybe a refinery project here or there as places like -- places in Asia and also in other parts of the world need more transportation. Fuel is cleaner, fuel, all of that. I expect we might see some refinery opportunities. But as far as core ASUs that are tied to some of the basic market that we supply, I really don't expect to see much in the way activity. And you've heard me say this, I don't think China needs another plant of any kind. I think they have enough capacity for a long time."

But I've been out of the U.S. home care market for a while. I think we exited in 2010, something like that.

Argon is certainly a higher capacity utilization than that. And if we look around the world, we're probably -- the answer is probably 70s no matter what country you look at from a capacity utilization standpoint. So there is capacity there to serve growth as it materializes. And in the U.S., I wouldn't say there's a lot that we can do to rationalize capacity.

I mean, these operations run 24/7, and they're making these investments based on long-term view of their ability to produce their product and supply their product and get the return on those investments they're making. So it's absolutely critical that all suppliers, especially industrial gas suppliers, are able to keep them running and onstream. And so when they seek various bidders for their projects, they want to understand how you can ensure reliability to meet availability of 98%, 99-plus percent on a 365-day basis. So having a pipeline complex, having the ability to store products, make products, buy product and channel it through a very large network of pipes really helps improve that reliability. So if one unit goes down, you have 30 other units that you can put into the system to help back it up. So yes, that this asset will be interconnected, which gives a very strong reliability. And then obviously, it gives us some cost opportunities and efficiencies we can do along our whole system as well with that density. So this really plays into the density, and particularly on an on-site basis, but reliability and total cost of solution are the 2 most important things for somewhat of this type of nature.

I'm going to cover 3 areas before I turn it over to Matt. I'm going to review what we are seeing around the world. I'm going to give you an update on the implementation of our strategy, which I reviewed with you this",1580,"Thanks, Juan. Good morning, everyone. I'm going to cover 3 areas before I turn it over to Matt. I'm going to review what we are seeing around the world. I'm going to give you an update on the implementation of our strategy, which I reviewed with you this time last year, and I have a few comments on the discussions we held with Linde about a potential merger. 
I'll start with the U.S., which is very much a mixed bag. Our volumes to the chemical industry continued to be healthy as varying markets are more diverse and consumer-driven. Hydrogen volumes to refiners are starting to moderate as diesel demand weakens and refinery margins compress. This is offset somewhat by higher hydrogen intensity as refiners are turning to sour feedstocks to boost margins. 
Food and beverage volumes in the U.S. are strong. I'll comment more on that later. Our volumes into the steel mills along the Great Lakes are softening as auto production, which makes up about 28% of their end market sales, is coming down off of peak production rates. I expect this trend to stay with us until either energy or non-resi construction demand can pick up the slack, or global excess supplies rationalize. 
The bigger worry card for us is manufacturing, where we saw weak volumes in July and August, especially in our packaged gas business. September did improve sequentially, but given the general weakness observed in Q3, we were forced to make adjustments to our cost structure, and I'll speak more to that later. 
Canada remains a tale of 2 markets as growth in health care and food and beverage in the East helps mitigate the drop in energy-related volumes experienced in the West. Mexico, ex energy, continues to grow at a healthy mid-single-digit pace as the manufacturing sector continues to favor Mexico as a preferred hub to serve North America. Our volumes into the oil well services sector are almost nonexistent today as PEMEX continues to struggle with low energy prices and their own internal issues. The economy in Brazil seems to have bottomed, albeit at a low level. By focusing on growth in nonindustrial markets such as health care and food and in new applications, we are able to generate growth, while our traditional metals and manufacturing markets remained quite weak. We did benefit this last quarter from a project startup in DCAP [ph] in the metals sector. 
Far be it for me to predict the turn in Brazil's economy, my personal view is that will not happen until inflation can be brought under control and interest rates lowered to stimulate domestic demand, and the government decides to spend less on themselves and more on needed infrastructure, neither of which I expect to see in the immediate future. 
With that as a backdrop, we thought it necessary to take... 
[Audio Gap] 
to better align our cost structure with the market reality. Could I be too pessimistic about Brazil's economy? Perhaps, but I would rather plan for no improvement and be pleasantly surprised if things turn around sooner than expected. 
Europe is performing better overall. Our pipeline businesses serving steel and petrochemical customers in Spain, Germany and the Benelux continue to do well. Spain continues to reemerge from a deep recession. Italy remains weak, but we are able to capitalize on small acquisitions there to build density and expand our home care business. Germany and the Benelux is more steady-state, while Scandinavia remains challenged by the pullback in energy investment. But overall, Europe is better than it has been in quite some time. 
Turning to Asia. China's underlying economy is growing at a mid-single-digit pace. Consumer-driven activity, namely electronics, health care and environmental solutions, has replaced fixed asset investment activity as the best prospects for growth. Though nothing transformative has taken place yet in India with respect to much-needed infrastructure investment, our core business continues to grow at a healthy mid-single-digit pace. 
In Korea, electronics is growing modestly, while the export-oriented manufacturing sector continues to struggle. Thailand, where we are focused on the growth of our CO2 business into food and beverage and energy end markets continues to do well. 
Turning to Page 5. The first prong of our strategy is to optimize the base business. This is all about operational discipline and execution, without which we would not have been able to deliver the solid cash flow we reported this quarter. Matt will speak more to this in his comments. 
We continue to make solid gains in our resilient market growth focus. The objective is to grow our exposure to more resilient markets from about 1/4 of our total sales to about 1/3. Included in this segment would be food and beverage, health care, aerospace and specialty gases, many of which are used in environmental applications. 
I want to touch on just a few of these areas. We closed our Yara CO2 acquisition in June, which gives us an excellent platform to grow our food and beverage business in Continental Europe and the U.K. That acquisition is off to an excellent start. We continue to add CO2 sources in the U.S. to further penetrate the food and beverage market and to keep up with the growth of our new CO2 business, which is the beverage carbonation service we acquired in 2013. Over the last 3 years, we have increased our CO2 capacity in the U.S. by almost 50%. Today, CO2 represents about 10% of our total sales and is growing in the mid- to high single-digit range globally. 
In health care, we have seen excellent growth in Canada, Mexico, South America and Southern Europe, both organically and through small acquisitions. In China, we had avoided hospital gases historically due to our own concerns over corruption. However, given the effectiveness of the government's new anticorruption campaign, we have stepped up our efforts to penetrate this market, and we are starting to see nice growth, albeit off a low base. 
Earlier this month, we closed our joint venture with GE on aircraft engine coatings. Our expectation is that between increased scope, share gain and the production ramp of the GE LEAP engine, our coating sales with GE will triple over the next 3 to 4 years to over $200 million in sales. 
Project activity in the U.S. Gulf Coast remains robust. Based on what we have signed and to be announced, I fully expect to start the new year with $1.5 billion in the backlog, 2/3 of which is in the U.S. Gulf Coast. As a result, project contributions, which have been low over the last several years, should contribute, on average, 3% per year to the bottom line from 2017 to 2020. Between continued weakness in manufacturing across the Americas, a pullback in project activity in emerging markets, the need to reduce overhead costs in our Asia operations and the desire to accelerate cost benefits from our 2 Yara acquisitions, we have implemented a restructuring program resulting in a Q3 charge of $96 million. We expect this action to generate $45 million in annualized cost savings. 
We know that many of the headwinds we are facing will abate and more than likely turn back in our favor at some point, though the win is hard to predict. What I have described to you is how we will grow profitably regardless of macro environment. My expectation is this strategy will produce mid-single-digit top line and that or better bottom line over the next several years, assuming constant currency and no help from base volumes. Of course, any base volume recovery will fall through heavily to the bottom line given, in most cases, we have sufficient capacity already in place to accommodate growth. 
My last comment will be on the potential Linde merger. First of all, we have not had any discussions with them since we announced that talks were terminated. It was reported that we cannot reach agreement on the role of Linde's headquarters. The fact is discussions were halted before we had a chance to fully vet that subject. Would I be open to resuming discussions? The answer is yes, but there's no guarantee that that will happen. And if it does, there is no guarantee that we will reach an agreement. I have been asked about the strategic logic of this combination. First of all, our complementary geographical positions would allow us to leverage the individual strengths of each company, Linde's technology and engineering and Praxair's operational excellence, and do that across a much greater footprint. The combined portfolio would be more balanced and resilient than either standalone. The expected synergies would be compelling. The resulting balance sheet would be robust with strong cash flow as a result of the expected synergies. Obviously, we felt any potential divestitures were manageable, otherwise we would not have pursued this opportunity. How do we evaluate the attractiveness of this potential deal? The answer is the value of half of the combined company, including synergies, must be significantly greater than our stand-alone case. Why significantly? Because of the inherent risk involved. However, that could have been mitigated by ensuring upfront that leadership is unambiguous and the company is operated in a clear and consistent way. 
This is all I have to say on the subject. As stated at the onset, we are confident in our base strategy and remain fully committed to its implementation. 
I'll now turn it over to Matt to discuss third quarter results and our outlook."

Please turn to Slide 7 for an overview of our third quarter results. Sales of $2.7 billion are 1% above prior year and 2% above the second quarter. Looking year-over-year, ongoing price improvements of 1% and contributions from the Yara acq",774,"Thanks, Steve. Please turn to Slide 7 for an overview of our third quarter results. Sales of $2.7 billion are 1% above prior year and 2% above the second quarter. Looking year-over-year, ongoing price improvements of 1% and contributions from the Yara acquisition of 1% were partially offset by 1% headwind from foreign currency translation. As exchange rates stabilized, we're finally starting to lap the FX headwinds we've experienced over the last few years. Volume growth is flat as project gains and organic improvements in our defensive end markets are offset by lower volumes in manufacturing and upstream energy. Sequentially, we have the benefit of a full quarter from the acquisition. Overall sustained national gas pass-through up 1%, which doesn't materially impact operating profit dollars, but does dilute operating margins by 20 basis points. The sequential effect is even greater in our North American segment, negatively affecting the segment operating margin by 50 basis points. 
Operating profit of $597 million is 4% below prior year and 2% above last quarter. Third quarter operating margin of 22% is in line with the second quarter, but 100 basis points below last year. This decline is primarily driven by North American manufacturing and upstream energy volume declines, especially in the packaged gas business, where we've lost variable margin without corresponding overhead costs. This is why we undertook the cost-reduction effort this quarter to better align our businesses with market trends. This action resulted in annualized savings of $45 million from a reduction of about 730 employees, with almost half in the North American segment. Earnings per share for the quarter are $1.41. Note that this excludes $100 million operating cost or $0.23 per share related to the cost actions and the pension settlement charge. EPS increased in the second quarter as project contribution and cost management efforts more than offset manufacturing weakness and normal seasonal declines in Europe. As Steve mentioned, we're executing the strategy, and the cash flow generation is a good example of our success. 
Operating cash flow is $788 million, 17% above last year and 12% above last quarter. This figure represents 29% of sales, which is one of our highest quarters ever. So despite some of the macroeconomic challenges, our employees continued to prudently control capital. In fact, third quarter free cash flow of over $400 million enabled us to reduce net debt this quarter by almost $200 million, essentially eliminating our debt increase last quarter from the acquisitions. 
In addition to strong cash generation, we continue to position the business for future growth. The project backlog increased to $1.4 billion as new on-site projects in the U.S., South Korea and Brazil more than offset the startups this quarter in Peru and Europe. We are particularly pleased with the opportunities in the U.S. Gulf Coast to build up our asset network for both atmospheric and processed gases. We recently executed a contract to supply oxygen and nitrogen to MEGlobal for their new ethylene glycol plant in Freeport, Texas. We won this contract by leveraging our pipeline network to deliver high reliability at a competitive cost. In fact, we feel confident in our ability to announce additional U.S. Gulf Coast project wins by the end of this year. 
In summary, we continue to see the benefits of executing our strategy through improved cash generation, key project wins and portfolio enhancements. 
I'd now like to briefly cover guidance on Page 8. Fourth quarter EPS guidance is in the range of $1.36 to $1.43. The midpoint of this range is roughly flat with the third quarter. This guidance assumes that full quarter project contribution and benefits from the cost action are offset by weaker U.S. metals and more negative seasonal effects in South America. Fourth quarter last year was quite weak for both metals and South America due to extended outages, and we believe we may see similar trends this year. The full year guidance range is $5.44 to $5.51. The midpoint is about $0.05 lower than the prior guidance. This reduction is primarily due to weaker-than-anticipated manufacturing and metals volumes, especially in North America. We're actively working to improve upon this number, but there simply aren't enough positive signs to predict any volume recovery at this time. But rest assured, we'll continue to execute the strategy of profitable growth independent of the economic environment. 
And finally, before we open up the line, I just want to remind everyone that we don't have any further comments to make on the terminated Linde merger, so I appreciate your efforts to refrain from any questions on this topic. 
I'd now like to turn the call over to Q&A."

And September did get a little better sequentially, but not enough to really give us a lot of optimism in terms of the run rates. That's why we decided to take the cost actions that we did. What's behind that? Obviously, the whole energy supply chain continued to draw down throughout the course of the year. Commodities continued to be weak. Ag continues to be weak. Anything -- any producer that's driven by exports is penalized by the strong dollar. So mining continues to be weak. So just not enough going on from an end market's standpoint. We do have some positive segments, obviously, specialty gases does better. Hospitals does better. Others like that. But the major end markets that are metal fabrication-driven -- railcar production was off. You heard me talk earlier about diesel demand being weaker. That's because less product is being moved from coast to coast. So that whole sector has been weak.

Obviously, Embraer that we don't supply a lot to, but they do fine. Agriculture does fine. People that are shipping slabs -- steel slabs out of Brazil to go to other places, those volumes are fine. But we did continue to see the manufacturing sector continue to weaken. My -- our concern and what's reflected in the guidance that Matt gave us as we go into the holidays, they'll do what they did last year. They'll take extended shutdowns beginning early December. It might not come up that quickly. So you -- the good news is we have -- we've removed the political instability. I have President Temer, and so we don't have all that drama. But then again, they have some work to do. Interest rates -- the SELIC rate is 14%. Inflation is like 8% or 9%, so that needs to be brought under control. That is their intention. As they do that, we expect to see the economy rebound, but that needs to happen. And the people that I've talked to on the ground in Brazil, and I'm focusing all my comments on Brazil, believe that '17 will be a little bit better because they believe it's bottomed. So I think it remains to be seen. And I want to watch it very carefully this quarter and beginning next year, but in terms of what needs to happen, say, to get our operating margins back to 20% ranges we need some lift in manufacturing, which is merchant liquid business. That's the packaged gas business, and that's very much tied to manufacturing. Just to give you a couple indicators, our automotive production is down 40% over the last 2 years, 4-0. Capital goods are down 35%. So that feels like those have bottomed, but they're extremely low levels. So hopefully, north is the only direction we can go from here, but it remains to be seen."

It's the composition of the base volume because not all volume is created equal from a profitability standpoint, right? When you're OL services, 8 -- up 80%, that's high-margin business. Brazil manufacturing, weak. That's high-margin business. Metals off of our -- that we serve off our oxygen pipeline, that's all high-margin business. So the run rates that we're going to see and expect to see are going to be very important in terms of how we think about profitability next year. So it's not just the absolute base volume number, it's the composition of the base volume. But just a couple other things I'll add to that: obviously, we're going to have some benefit from the restructuring actions that we just took, and $45million will translate to about a 2% EPS lift. We're going to have greater contributions from large projects than we've had in prior years. Now a lot of that is second half -- well, just about all of it is second half loaded. But assuming they come up when I believe they will, and we have very strong contracts there that will protect us, that'll be stronger contribution than we've seen. Acquisitions will be higher, just on a carryover basis, from the Yara acquisitions. And then price, we always seem to find a way to eke out at least 1%. That will be my expectation going forward next year. So I think the wild card is going to be the base volume run rate, composition of the base volume, and we should assume from that when we give you guidance."

I mean, these operations run 24/7, and they're making these investments based on long-term view of their ability to produce their product and supply their product and get the return on those investments they're making. So it's absolutely critical that all suppliers, especially industrial gas suppliers, are able to keep them running and onstream. And so when they seek various bidders for their projects, they want to understand how you can ensure reliability to meet availability of 98%, 99-plus percent on a 365-day basis. So having a pipeline complex, having the ability to store products, make products, buy product and channel it through a very large network of pipes really helps improve that reliability. So if one unit goes down, you have 30 other units that you can put into the system to help back it up. So yes, that this asset will be interconnected, which gives a very strong reliability. And then obviously, it gives us some cost opportunities and efficiencies we can do along our whole system as well with that density. So this really plays into the density, and particularly on an on-site basis, but reliability and total cost of solution are the 2 most important things for somewhat of this type of nature. And that's what we're able to provide."

I'm going to cover 3 areas before I turn it over to Matt. I'm going to review what we are seeing around the world. I'm going to give you an update on the implementation of our strategy, which I reviewed with you this",1580,"Thanks, Juan. Good morning, everyone. I'm going to cover 3 areas before I turn it over to Matt. I'm going to review what we are seeing around the world. I'm going to give you an update on the implementation of our strategy, which I reviewed with you this time last year, and I have a few comments on the discussions we held with Linde about a potential merger. 
I'll start with the U.S., which is very much a mixed bag. Our volumes to the chemical industry continued to be healthy as varying markets are more diverse and consumer-driven. Hydrogen volumes to refiners are starting to moderate as diesel demand weakens and refinery margins compress. This is offset somewhat by higher hydrogen intensity as refiners are turning to sour feedstocks to boost margins. 
Food and beverage volumes in the U.S. are strong. I'll comment more on that later. Our volumes into the steel mills along the Great Lakes are softening as auto production, which makes up about 28% of their end market sales, is coming down off of peak production rates. I expect this trend to stay with us until either energy or non-resi construction demand can pick up the slack, or global excess supplies rationalize. 
The bigger worry card for us is manufacturing, where we saw weak volumes in July and August, especially in our packaged gas business. September did improve sequentially, but given the general weakness observed in Q3, we were forced to make adjustments to our cost structure, and I'll speak more to that later. 
Canada remains a tale of 2 markets as growth in health care and food and beverage in the East helps mitigate the drop in energy-related volumes experienced in the West. Mexico, ex energy, continues to grow at a healthy mid-single-digit pace as the manufacturing sector continues to favor Mexico as a preferred hub to serve North America. Our volumes into the oil well services sector are almost nonexistent today as PEMEX continues to struggle with low energy prices and their own internal issues. The economy in Brazil seems to have bottomed, albeit at a low level. By focusing on growth in nonindustrial markets such as health care and food and in new applications, we are able to generate growth, while our traditional metals and manufacturing markets remained quite weak. We did benefit this last quarter from a project startup in DCAP [ph] in the metals sector. 
Far be it for me to predict the turn in Brazil's economy, my personal view is that will not happen until inflation can be brought under control and interest rates lowered to stimulate domestic demand, and the government decides to spend less on themselves and more on needed infrastructure, neither of which I expect to see in the immediate future. 
With that as a backdrop, we thought it necessary to take... 
[Audio Gap] 
to better align our cost structure with the market reality. Could I be too pessimistic about Brazil's economy? Perhaps, but I would rather plan for no improvement and be pleasantly surprised if things turn around sooner than expected. 
Europe is performing better overall. Our pipeline businesses serving steel and petrochemical customers in Spain, Germany and the Benelux continue to do well. Spain continues to reemerge from a deep recession. Italy remains weak, but we are able to capitalize on small acquisitions there to build density and expand our home care business. Germany and the Benelux is more steady-state, while Scandinavia remains challenged by the pullback in energy investment. But overall, Europe is better than it has been in quite some time. 
Turning to Asia. China's underlying economy is growing at a mid-single-digit pace. Consumer-driven activity, namely electronics, health care and environmental solutions, has replaced fixed asset investment activity as the best prospects for growth. Though nothing transformative has taken place yet in India with respect to much-needed infrastructure investment, our core business continues to grow at a healthy mid-single-digit pace. 
In Korea, electronics is growing modestly, while the export-oriented manufacturing sector continues to struggle. Thailand, where we are focused on the growth of our CO2 business into food and beverage and energy end markets continues to do well. 
Turning to Page 5. The first prong of our strategy is to optimize the base business. This is all about operational discipline and execution, without which we would not have been able to deliver the solid cash flow we reported this quarter. Matt will speak more to this in his comments. 
We continue to make solid gains in our resilient market growth focus. The objective is to grow our exposure to more resilient markets from about 1/4 of our total sales to about 1/3. Included in this segment would be food and beverage, health care, aerospace and specialty gases, many of which are used in environmental applications. 
I want to touch on just a few of these areas. We closed our Yara CO2 acquisition in June, which gives us an excellent platform to grow our food and beverage business in Continental Europe and the U.K. That acquisition is off to an excellent start. We continue to add CO2 sources in the U.S. to further penetrate the food and beverage market and to keep up with the growth of our new CO2 business, which is the beverage carbonation service we acquired in 2013. Over the last 3 years, we have increased our CO2 capacity in the U.S. by almost 50%. Today, CO2 represents about 10% of our total sales and is growing in the mid- to high single-digit range globally. 
In health care, we have seen excellent growth in Canada, Mexico, South America and Southern Europe, both organically and through small acquisitions. In China, we had avoided hospital gases historically due to our own concerns over corruption. However, given the effectiveness of the government's new anticorruption campaign, we have stepped up our efforts to penetrate this market, and we are starting to see nice growth, albeit off a low base. 
Earlier this month, we closed our joint venture with GE on aircraft engine coatings. Our expectation is that between increased scope, share gain and the production ramp of the GE LEAP engine, our coating sales with GE will triple over the next 3 to 4 years to over $200 million in sales. 
Project activity in the U.S. Gulf Coast remains robust. Based on what we have signed and to be announced, I fully expect to start the new year with $1.5 billion in the backlog, 2/3 of which is in the U.S. Gulf Coast. As a result, project contributions, which have been low over the last several years, should contribute, on average, 3% per year to the bottom line from 2017 to 2020. Between continued weakness in manufacturing across the Americas, a pullback in project activity in emerging markets, the need to reduce overhead costs in our Asia operations and the desire to accelerate cost benefits from our 2 Yara acquisitions, we have implemented a restructuring program resulting in a Q3 charge of $96 million. We expect this action to generate $45 million in annualized cost savings. 
We know that many of the headwinds we are facing will abate and more than likely turn back in our favor at some point, though the win is hard to predict. What I have described to you is how we will grow profitably regardless of macro environment. My expectation is this strategy will produce mid-single-digit top line and that or better bottom line over the next several years, assuming constant currency and no help from base volumes. Of course, any base volume recovery will fall through heavily to the bottom line given, in most cases, we have sufficient capacity already in place to accommodate growth. 
My last comment will be on the potential Linde merger. First of all, we have not had any discussions with them since we announced that talks were terminated. It was reported that we cannot reach agreement on the role of Linde's headquarters. The fact is discussions were halted before we had a chance to fully vet that subject. Would I be open to resuming discussions? The answer is yes, but there's no guarantee that that will happen. And if it does, there is no guarantee that we will reach an agreement. I have been asked about the strategic logic of this combination. First of all, our complementary geographical positions would allow us to leverage the individual strengths of each company, Linde's technology and engineering and Praxair's operational excellence, and do that across a much greater footprint. The combined portfolio would be more balanced and resilient than either standalone. The expected synergies would be compelling. The resulting balance sheet would be robust with strong cash flow as a result of the expected synergies. Obviously, we felt any potential divestitures were manageable, otherwise we would not have pursued this opportunity. How do we evaluate the attractiveness of this potential deal? The answer is the value of half of the combined company, including synergies, must be significantly greater than our stand-alone case. Why significantly? Because of the inherent risk involved. However, that could have been mitigated by ensuring upfront that leadership is unambiguous and the company is operated in a clear and consistent way. 
This is all I have to say on the subject. As stated at the onset, we are confident in our base strategy and remain fully committed to its implementation. 
I'll now turn it over to Matt to discuss third quarter results and our outlook."

Looking year-over-year, ongoing price improvements of 1% and contributions from the Yara acq",774,"Thanks, Steve. Please turn to Slide 7 for an overview of our third quarter results. Sales of $2.7 billion are 1% above prior year and 2% above the second quarter. Looking year-over-year, ongoing price improvements of 1% and contributions from the Yara acquisition of 1% were partially offset by 1% headwind from foreign currency translation. As exchange rates stabilized, we're finally starting to lap the FX headwinds we've experienced over the last few years. Volume growth is flat as project gains and organic improvements in our defensive end markets are offset by lower volumes in manufacturing and upstream energy. Sequentially, we have the benefit of a full quarter from the acquisition. Overall sustained national gas pass-through up 1%, which doesn't materially impact operating profit dollars, but does dilute operating margins by 20 basis points. The sequential effect is even greater in our North American segment, negatively affecting the segment operating margin by 50 basis points. 
Operating profit of $597 million is 4% below prior year and 2% above last quarter. Third quarter operating margin of 22% is in line with the second quarter, but 100 basis points below last year. This decline is primarily driven by North American manufacturing and upstream energy volume declines, especially in the packaged gas business, where we've lost variable margin without corresponding overhead costs. This is why we undertook the cost-reduction effort this quarter to better align our businesses with market trends. This action resulted in annualized savings of $45 million from a reduction of about 730 employees, with almost half in the North American segment. Earnings per share for the quarter are $1.41. Note that this excludes $100 million operating cost or $0.23 per share related to the cost actions and the pension settlement charge. EPS increased in the second quarter as project contribution and cost management efforts more than offset manufacturing weakness and normal seasonal declines in Europe. As Steve mentioned, we're executing the strategy, and the cash flow generation is a good example of our success. 
Operating cash flow is $788 million, 17% above last year and 12% above last quarter. This figure represents 29% of sales, which is one of our highest quarters ever. So despite some of the macroeconomic challenges, our employees continued to prudently control capital. In fact, third quarter free cash flow of over $400 million enabled us to reduce net debt this quarter by almost $200 million, essentially eliminating our debt increase last quarter from the acquisitions. 
In addition to strong cash generation, we continue to position the business for future growth. The project backlog increased to $1.4 billion as new on-site projects in the U.S., South Korea and Brazil more than offset the startups this quarter in Peru and Europe. We are particularly pleased with the opportunities in the U.S. Gulf Coast to build up our asset network for both atmospheric and processed gases. We recently executed a contract to supply oxygen and nitrogen to MEGlobal for their new ethylene glycol plant in Freeport, Texas. We won this contract by leveraging our pipeline network to deliver high reliability at a competitive cost. In fact, we feel confident in our ability to announce additional U.S. Gulf Coast project wins by the end of this year. 
In summary, we continue to see the benefits of executing our strategy through improved cash generation, key project wins and portfolio enhancements. 
I'd now like to briefly cover guidance on Page 8. Fourth quarter EPS guidance is in the range of $1.36 to $1.43. The midpoint of this range is roughly flat with the third quarter. This guidance assumes that full quarter project contribution and benefits from the cost action are offset by weaker U.S. metals and more negative seasonal effects in South America. Fourth quarter last year was quite weak for both metals and South America due to extended outages, and we believe we may see similar trends this year. The full year guidance range is $5.44 to $5.51. The midpoint is about $0.05 lower than the prior guidance. This reduction is primarily due to weaker-than-anticipated manufacturing and metals volumes, especially in North America. We're actively working to improve upon this number, but there simply aren't enough positive signs to predict any volume recovery at this time. But rest assured, we'll continue to execute the strategy of profitable growth independent of the economic environment. 
And finally, before we open up the line, I just want to remind everyone that we don't have any further comments to make on the terminated Linde merger, so I appreciate your efforts to refrain from any questions on this topic. 
I'd now like to turn the call over to Q&A."

The mills in Northern Spain, the mills in Southern Germany are very good mills for those companies, and they continue to produce, supporting both automotive and the growth in other steel sectors. So I would say Europe is more positive than it's been. Obviously, in South America, there's a lot of weakness in metals, generally speaking, those volumes for the entire steel industry are down about 10% to 15% year-over-year. If I were to go to India, the metals volumes are up. If I were to go to China, I'd say the volumes are flat. And so while Q3 volumes year-over-year looked pretty decent in North America, we did start to see a softening trend. And again, we concluded that's because of weaker automotive demand."

The gas part, I'll call it gas, rent and other, is down low single digits. Hardgoods is down mid-teens, and that's year-over-year. And then sequentially, it's down low single digits. So I don't know if you'll recall, we had a fairly nice step-up Q2 over Q1 in the packaged gas business. We were hoping that was going to continue through Q3, possibly grow. What happened in July and August, and I've heard other vendors talk about this, it just was very, very weak in July and August. And September did get a little better sequentially, but not enough to really give us a lot of optimism in terms of the run rates. That's why we decided to take the cost actions that we did. What's behind that? Obviously, the whole energy supply chain continued to draw down throughout the course of the year. Commodities continued to be weak. Ag continues to be weak. Anything -- any producer that's driven by exports is penalized by the strong dollar. So mining continues to be weak. So just not enough going on from an end market's standpoint. We do have some positive segments, obviously, specialty gases does better. Hospitals does better. Others like that. But the major end markets that are metal fabrication-driven -- railcar production was off. You heard me talk earlier about diesel demand being weaker. That's because less product is being moved from coast to coast. So that whole sector has been weak. And essentially, what we did, we just carried that run rate forward into Q4 and assumed that we weren't going to see any help in Q4. And quite possibly, as we get closer to the holidays, we may start to see extended shutdowns in the U.S. and probably will in Brazil, but we may start to see that in the U.S. as well."

Obviously, Embraer that we don't supply a lot to, but they do fine. Agriculture does fine. People that are shipping slabs -- steel slabs out of Brazil to go to other places, those volumes are fine. But we did continue to see the manufacturing sector continue to weaken. My -- our concern and what's reflected in the guidance that Matt gave us as we go into the holidays, they'll do what they did last year. They'll take extended shutdowns beginning early December. It might not come up that quickly. So you -- the good news is we have -- we've removed the political instability. I have President Temer, and so we don't have all that drama. But then again, they have some work to do. Interest rates -- the SELIC rate is 14%. Inflation is like 8% or 9%, so that needs to be brought under control. That is their intention. As they do that, we expect to see the economy rebound, but that needs to happen. And the people that I've talked to on the ground in Brazil, and I'm focusing all my comments on Brazil, believe that '17 will be a little bit better because they believe it's bottomed. So I think it remains to be seen. And I want to watch it very carefully this quarter and beginning next year, but in terms of what needs to happen, say, to get our operating margins back to 20% ranges we need some lift in manufacturing, which is merchant liquid business. That's the packaged gas business, and that's very much tied to manufacturing. Just to give you a couple indicators, our automotive production is down 40% over the last 2 years, 4-0. Capital goods are down 35%. So that feels like those have bottomed, but they're extremely low levels. So hopefully, north is the only direction we can go from here, but it remains to be seen."

Brazil manufacturing, weak. That's high-margin business. Metals off of our -- that we serve off our oxygen pipeline, that's all high-margin business. So the run rates that we're going to see and expect to see are going to be very important in terms of how we think about profitability next year. So it's not just the absolute base volume number, it's the composition of the base volume. But just a couple other things I'll add to that: obviously, we're going to have some benefit from the restructuring actions that we just took, and $45million will translate to about a 2% EPS lift. We're going to have greater contributions from large projects than we've had in prior years. Now a lot of that is second half -- well, just about all of it is second half loaded. But assuming they come up when I believe they will, and we have very strong contracts there that will protect us, that'll be stronger contribution than we've seen. Acquisitions will be higher, just on a carryover basis, from the Yara acquisitions. And then price, we always seem to find a way to eke out at least 1%. That will be my expectation going forward next year. So I think the wild card is going to be the base volume run rate, composition of the base volume, and we should assume from that when we give you guidance."

It looked for a while that you might be back in U.S. home health care. Yet that's a market you exited many years ago due to Medicare reimbursement issues. So I'm just wondering what's changed? What makes that market sort of more attractive to you now?"

The hospital business really depends on the local market. Some markets are -- have a favorable conditions to participate in the home care market. Others do not, so we look at that very carefully. But hospital universally has been a good business. And I said I wasn't going to comment further on Linde, and I think that was kind of what that question was alluding to. But I've been out of the U.S. home care market for a while. I think we exited in 2010, something like that. And I know that they've been through many, many rounds of auctions, competitive bidding, and that has driven the pricing down considerably. But I also understand that that's probably run its course. And so if you ever want to participate in the U.S. home care market, now would be a much better time to start entertaining those thoughts than, say, 5 years ago before the onslaught started in terms of competitive bidding."

Should we idle this plant? So that's kind of something we look at on an ongoing basis. You are correct in terms of where the capacity utilizations reside. I think we touched 80% in the U.S. this quarter. And we're talking about LOX/LIN. So obviously, it really depends on which product you're talking about. LOX/LIN are the 2 largest products. Argon is certainly a higher capacity utilization than that. And if we look around the world, we're probably -- the answer is probably 70s no matter what country you look at from a capacity utilization standpoint. So there is capacity there to serve growth as it materializes. And in the U.S., I wouldn't say there's a lot that we can do to rationalize capacity. We already have swap agreements -- product swap agreements with our competitors. They've been in place for a long time. It's something we continue to look at. But I would say in the U.S., we're pretty sophisticated in terms of going through that analysis."

You get better at distribution. And so that would be more so the synergy, I would say, from an operating efficiency standpoint. And then from a growth standpoint, I do believe that this has a lot of legs in terms of mid- to high single-digit growth going forward. So it will -- I don't know what the math is going to be, but it will increase from 10% of our sales today to something higher going forward. And if you -- the announcement that we made with MEGlobal, where as Matt discussed, we're supplying oxygen and nitrogen to their greenfield ethylene glycol plant, we're also taking CO2 off of that plant, some 450 tons per day. And we're going to build a CO2 plant, and we're going to serve that local market. So that's 3 years out before that plant will start up.

Matt, you indicated your ability to get that project had to do with your pipeline reliability, but yet you're building an ASU for that project. Can you just comment a little bit about that? Is it that being tied into your pipeline, does that enable you to build a perhaps a smaller-than-necessary ASU? Or does it -- is it that the ASU has the backup from the pipeline and you can then have greater capacity in the pipeline?

I mean, these operations run 24/7, and they're making these investments based on long-term view of their ability to produce their product and supply their product and get the return on those investments they're making. So it's absolutely critical that all suppliers, especially industrial gas suppliers, are able to keep them running and onstream. And so when they seek various bidders for their projects, they want to understand how you can ensure reliability to meet availability of 98%, 99-plus percent on a 365-day basis. So having a pipeline complex, having the ability to store products, make products, buy product and channel it through a very large network of pipes really helps improve that reliability. So if one unit goes down, you have 30 other units that you can put into the system to help back it up. So yes, that this asset will be interconnected, which gives a very strong reliability. And then obviously, it gives us some cost opportunities and efficiencies we can do along our whole system as well with that density. So this really plays into the density, and particularly on an on-site basis, but reliability and total cost of solution are the 2 most important things for somewhat of this type of nature. And that's what we're able to provide."
