First, Mike and I will briefly address fourth quarter performance. Then I'll share my perspective regarding our outlook and how we plan to drive improved execution and results going forward. There will be plenty of time at the end for your questions. Let me get right into it. 
Mike will address our fourth quarter results in more detail in a moment. But at a high-level, our worse than expected top line performance reflected both the negative impact of warmer weather and the continued impact of our efforts to move quickly to capital efficiencies toward integration, which inadvertently led to disruption in servicing our customers and supporting our stores. This combination of factors resulted in negative comparable sales of 2.5%. We are not satisfied with these results.
We have, however, made considerable progress and believe many of the major execution challenges are behind us. That being said, we still have work to do to drive efficiency across the company. As I say that we have made progress, let me be clear that we fully understand that we are in mode. Some of the big parts of the integration are now completed, including corporate consolidations, the integration of our field teams and pricing alignment work. In addition, we have completed the first major tranche of the Carquest market conversions and substantially all of our product alignment work. We also made significant progress in our cost cutting initiatives in 2015, delivering over $50 million in incremental costs synergy savings and driving efficiency by closing approximately 80 underperforming stores.
Through actions to date, we have mitigated the disruption caused by integration work, and we are moving ahead with our plans to deliver improved and more consistent performance. Going forward, we will focus continuing the Carquest market conversion program and building on our prior success, which has enable us to deliver mid-single-digit comps across multiple markets where conversions have already taken place. We are also doing the work to align our supply chain and store systems. 
As we exited 2015, we began to see improvement in our store level availability. In the field, our teams are refocusing our base business and await the integration efforts that dominated the much of 2015. We are clear about the work that lies ahead, but confident in our ability to enhance our efficiency, performance and profitability.
In a few moments, I'll talk about our plans to implement a more field-centric organization, drive additional cost reductions and relentlessly pursue opportunities to increase efficiency across our operations. 
But first, let me turn it over to Mike to provide some brief context around the quarter. Mike?"

We delivered comparable cash EPS of $1.22 for the fourth quarter despite the softer than expected sales. This result included a $0.03 hit from foreign currency and $0.03 benefit from incremental synergy realization. 
Fourth quarter net sales declined 2.6%, with comparable sales down 2.5%. Comparable store sales were negatively impacted by approximately 90 basis points due to the timing of the New Year's Day holiday, which was in our 53rd week last year, and 46 basis points of negative foreign currency impact, partially offset by a favorable impact from our Carquest store consolidations. The unseasonably warm start to winter impacted both our commercial and DIY businesses, particularly in batteries and cold weather related hard parts categories, such as starters, alternators and related products. With fewer customers seeking cold weather parts, this also resulted in lower add-on sales. Partially offsetting this performance was continued strong results in our brake business across both our commercial and DIY businesses.
In our commercial business, performance was primarily driven by mid-single-digit sales declines in our Great Lakes and planes cold-weather markets, while the and Southeast faired better. The softness in seasonal category sales was partially offset by a modest increase in our commercial ticket size and the strength I noted in our brake business. nonetheless, we continue to expand our customer base with our national accounts business going in the mid-single digits and TechNet, which partnered with the independent repair shops, adding 600 new members in the quarter. 
Within DIY, strong brake results only partially offset the softness in battery and battery accessories sales, as well as other winter seasonal categories resulting in a sequential decline. Despite the softness, we continue to expand our speed purchase program, which now has over 10 million members, and it will be an important driver of our ability to increase customer loyalty going forward. Our gross profit rate decline of 15 basis points was primarily the result of supply chain expense deleverage to the comparable store sales decline, partially offset by a lower shrink expenses. 
Our fourth quarter comparable SG&A rate increased 33 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to the expense deleverage from the comp store sales decline, partially offset by our continued cost reduction initiatives and disciplined efforts to lower administrative and support costs.
All in, fourth quarter operating income on a comparable basis decreased 8.2% to $157.6 million and the comparable operating margin decreased 48 basis points over the same period last year to 7.7%. 
Free cash flow for 2015 was $454.9 million versus $480.5 million last year, driven by a decrease in our AP ratio to 76.7% versus 78.6% last year. This decrease was principally driven by transitional inventory growth resulting from our product integration work, the CARQUEST consolidation work and the growth in WORLDPAC branches.
Turning to balance sheet and leverage. 
Adjusted debt to EBITDAR was 2.5x at year end. During the quarter, we repaid $80 million in debt, and we remain at or below our maximum state of leverage ratio of 2.5x. We are committed to preserving a balanced and disciplined approach to capital allocation to drive shareholder value while maintaining our investment grade ratings.
We remain focused on taking the actions required to achieve our 12% adjusted operating income margin target. To reach this objective, we will deliver improved gross margins and reduce costs by approximately 100 basis points through a combination of G&A reductions and improved store productivity. This includes capturing the remaining $50 million of our previously disclosed $160 million in cost synergies. 
Before I turn it back to George, let me touch briefly on the remaining integration initiatives we are pursuing in 2016.
We are focused on 2 areas: one, continued execution of CARQUEST market conversion program; and 2, development of testing -- to development and testing to enable us to combine our AAP and CARQUEST supply chain and store systems into 1 network. We are also pursuing supply chain optimization work, including the closing of our Satin, Massachusetts distribution center. In conjunction with these efforts, we expect to incur additional onetime costs of $75 million to $90 million in 2016, including $65 million to $75 million related to ongoing integration efforts and $10 million to $15 million related to supply chain optimization work. 
We are pleased with our progress in our CARQUEST conversion markets, nearly all of which are experiencing comp increases, which average in the mid to upper single digits in the fourth quarter. This year, we plan to execute approximately 350 market conversion projects. In terms of our store network and supply chain projects, we expect to begin in-store system pilots by early quarter 2 and supply chain pilots in early quarter 4. As previously indicated, full-scale rollout is expected to be in 2017. 
With that, let me turn it back to George to discuss our plans for 2016 and beyond. George?"

We have a tremendous platform across commercial and DIY, and I am confident in our ability to drive improved profitability and generate increased shareholder value. As at the outset, our plans include implementing the more field-centric",1448,"Thanks, Mike. 
We have a tremendous platform across commercial and DIY, and I am confident in our ability to drive improved profitability and generate increased shareholder value. 
As at the outset, our plans include implementing the more field-centric organizations to provide increased customer satisfaction and improve repeat business and revenue, further reduces cost and relentlessly pursuing an opportunity to drive additional operational efficiencies.
We at the company made up of approximately 5,300 hyper local businesses. In order to be successful, we must meet the needs of our customers at a local level by aggressively empowering our teams to make decisions in their local markets and providing the appropriate operational infrastructure to execute against those decisions. As this field centric system is not concept, it is something that we are in the early stages of executing. 
There are 3 key pillars that underpin our objectives as a field-centric organization: 1, providing superior availability to ensure we deliver the right part at the right place at the right time; 2, providing the right infrastructure to achieve outstanding customer service through flawless execution; and 3, providing the right tools and incentives to develop focused and inspired teams with a desire to win. Let me share a few insights on each.
The pillar availability. Having the right part in the right place at the right time is essential to running a great commercial business. It also benefits DIY. Because we run approximately 5,300 local commercial businesses, serving the customer requires input from and empowerment of local store teams. Trying to manage those 5,300 businesses in a central office is both inefficient and ineffective. We are changing that. In order to drive more effective local execution, we are investing to improve inventory coverage to support our stores, while simultaneously developing a field-centric process that empowers the general management of the stores to make decisions and inventories to best serve the unique local customer base. We are piloting this process in 5 regions. And while it's very early in the program, we are seeing high levels of store engagement and believe will translate to improved commercial sales over time. The goal is clear: having the right part, in the right place at the right time. We will continue to leverage our in-market HUB and super HUB stores and extend delivery frequency to stores from our DCs, but we'll do so on the most efficient basis. We are making sure that we think the supply chain and frequency by first determining the best answer for each store and its customers. How can we provide the best in stock and availability, and therefore, the best overall service for our customer? After we determine the optimal goal of the stores, we can then determine the most effective and efficient supply chain delivery process and system. That means we will make sense to have daily delivery, we will have it. But daily delivery is not an answer by itself. Delivery scheduling is a means to provide the stores with what they need to satisfy the customer. Daily delivery will not be justified for every store. We're looking at deliveries frequency, in-market availability, hub frequency, and evaluating which combination is the best local market answer to enable us to serve our customers most effectively.
Second, outstanding customer service. We are laser-focused on achieving excellence in commercial through flawless execution. Unlike the retail side of the business, our interactions with commercial customers take place on a daily basis. We believe we do a great job focusing our commercial build, we naturally build the availability and the can-do attitude in the stores, which will also help the retail. With average commercial sales of approximately $730,000 per program, we are already among the industry leaders, but we can do more as we shift our identity from a retail culture to a commercial focus. We nailed it as we do a better job servicing our commercial customers who will then drive frequency. To be clear, while we'll be a commercial first organization, we will not lose focus on DIY. Commercial is our most significant growth opportunity. But we believe our commercial focus will have synergistic benefits to DIY because of the same fundamentals apply across the businesses. We continue to be focused on growing our Speed Perks membership program and satisfying our DIY customers through our knowledgeable team members and well-placed locations. In 2016, we'll be investing to further develop great commercial field and store teams, deliver focused sales and service execution and scale key programs, such as our strategic accounts, and membership programs like TechNet and Rewards. 
Our third pillar, having focused and inspired teams, is about inspiring and empowering those teams by providing them incentives and support that positions them to win. The first step is to provide our teams with broader authority as business owners. We are improving our communication approach to support a sales organization versus an operational organization. As part of this, I engage directly every quarter with our field organization leadership to address business priorities, field-centric leadership and changes throughout the organization in an unfiltered manner. I want to make sure they hear directly from me about our goals, expectations and challenges as we develop greater accountability and transparency across the organization.
In addition, we are positioning our store to have simplified and customer-focused operating model. We are also working to limit disruptions across the system so our stores and regions can focus on the vital business priorities we have ahead of us this year. We are also testing new compensation approaches to support a field-centric ownership mentality. 
As we execute against these 3 pillars, we are focused on continuing to drive improvements across the organization to deliver profitable growth.
Let me be clear. While we see opportunities to take costs out of or improve efficiency, that does not affect the customer experience, we'll move in an aggressive pace and our actions accordingly. This means not only capturing remaining cost-saving synergies we highlighted, but continuing to look for other ways to further reduce costs. It means examining structural changes to optimize our supply chain, such as our plans to open a new DC in Nashville, Tennessee and close RDC in Sutton, Massachusetts. We will continue to focus on improving productivity and profitability across our store base. We are now applying a higher threshold of performance acceptability to stores DC entities look at all parts of our business to improve returns. We expect to take further actions to address underperforming assets and unnecessary costs. We will make sure to analyze all customer facing cost savings opportunities, with a strong balance towards improving service levels. W are looking at all areas and want to make the best decisions possible.
This work does not happen overnight, but we will follow the analysis where it leads and take the appropriate steps to continue to improve performance and drive value. 
The bottom line is clear. We much drive improved profitability as we go our top line. Our comps will go up when our customers can rely on us to get them the parts they want, when they want them. We must execute flawlessly for the customer by becoming a commercial parts business, with leading parts availability, great teams and efficient operations.
Turning to our outlook for 2016. 
We expect modest top line growth, driven by comparable store sales in the low single digits. We also expect open 65 to 75 new stores, including 46 WORLDPAC branches and one new WORLDPAC distribution center. At the same time, we are maintaining a tight control over costs. And we are laser focused on achieving our stated 12% adjusted operating margin goal for 2016, which has not changed. 
In closing, the changes we are making to our organization are both real and substantial. We begun to make the shift to operating our businesses more locally, and we'll keep advancing that agenda. Our teams know our customers best and they're embracing their new responsibilities as we drive more local decision-making. I've been equally impressed with the pace and commitment with which our store support center teams have enthusiastically shifted decision-making. responsibly that in some cases, while accepting greater accountability in others, with the singular focus on winning the market. I'm also encouraged by the ability of our organization to learn and adapt, ensuring we don't repeat mistakes of either action or inaction. We are making the right decisions to change our profit formula to yield better outcomes.
Finally, before we open up to your questions, I'd like to take a moment to thank all of our team members for their continued focus and commitment to customer service.

So if you ask us the SKU availability, we're going to absolutely say yes to that question every time. Our business fundamentally is quite simple. A customer asks that the part and we get it to them that quickly operate, and that is how we operate and that's how run and that's how we will drive comps over time. So yes, to having the parts is absolutely critical for us and getting availability right, and we feel that we've made some good progress on that, is absolutely a job won us. That being said, there are other initiatives that have an impact on comp sales during the course of the year. Certainly, our consolidation of CARQUEST stores will impact our comp sales. The Speed Perks program at 10 million numbers will impact our comp sales. More investments in inventory and hubs will affect our comp stores. And the move to multi-day delivery will affect comp sales as well. So we had a waterfall of activities that we built out that we think will drive comp sales methodically, but clearly, it starts from availability."

Good morning. Let me try to take that in sequence. I think if you look at, first of all, our comments around what you're describing our stores, which was a group of stores that disproportionately affected our sales mix, a couple of actions there. #1, as we previously mentioned and mentioned on the scrip, we close some stores during the course of the fourth quarter. You can fully expect that they were among those bottom 10% performers. So that's a small group of stores and that's not entire difference. We also are moving into a period right now where we're currently executing accelerated consolidations of poor performing stores. So in this case, specific CARQUEST stores that were not meeting our expeditions that we've now begun to consolidate into auto parts stores and that will for another part of the stores. There are still outlier stores and there will be, so our field teams continue to work on the performance of some of our outliers. As you look at the consolidation or the market conversions and look at results, we're generally pleased, we're pretty much pleased across the board. So that number, that initial number that you referred to was clearly inflated due to the CARQUEST conversions. So once the market begins to undergo a conversion that there is, as you'd expect, a negative sales impact. And it really lasts for anywhere from 5 to 6 weeks. So we see these created about 1 month to 1.5 months when there's actually physical construction going on in the stores, team members are changing, parts are changing, in some cases, that we see comps go down and then we see it ramp back up. And our effort has been to take that time for it and compress it as much as possible, and we have. So in the early consolidations, it was a longer period of time. So we've seen that narrow down pretty nicely over time to the point where, and obviously, we'll work to continue to improve that to be shorter and shorter. In about 5 to 6 weeks that there's a negative impact and then the store begins to emerge with better results. And that generally shows up in form of double-digit in consolidations and anywhere from single, mid-single to high single to double-digit comps in our conversion stores."

That may be 5 hub runs a day, that may be 7 hub runs day. That may be an in-markets super hub, may not be. So it is just -- it is calibrating our market needs to the needs of customers, the pace of the commercial business and making sure that it's right. So we still continue to work to that formula. We feel great about some markets and we clearly recognize we have opportunities in other markets."

First, Mike and I will briefly address fourth quarter performance. Then I'll share my perspective regarding our outlook and how we plan to drive improved execution and results going forward. There will be plenty of time at the end for your questions. Let me get right into it. 
Mike will address our fourth quarter results in more detail in a moment. But at a high-level, our worse than expected top line performance reflected both the negative impact of warmer weather and the continued impact of our efforts to move quickly to capture efficiencies for integration, which inadvertently led to disruption in servicing our customers and supporting our stores. This combination of factors resulted in negative comparable sales of 2.5%. We are not satisfied with these results.
We have, however, made considerable progress and believe many of the major execution challenges are behind us. That being said, we still have work to do to drive efficiency across the company. As I say that we have made progress, let me be clear that we fully understand that we are in proven [ph] mode. Some of big parts of integration are now completed, including corporate consolidations, the integration of our field teams and pricing alignment work. In addition, we have completed the first major tranche of the CARQUEST market conversions and substantially all of our product alignment work. 
We also made significant progress in our cost cutting initiatives in 2015, delivering over $50 million in incremental cost synergy savings and driving efficiency by closing approximately 80 underperforming stores.
Through actions to date, we have mitigated the disruption caused by integration work, and we are moving ahead with our plans to deliver improved and more consistent performance. Going forward, we will focus on continuing the CARQUEST market conversion program and building on our prior success, which has enabled us to deliver mid-single-digit comps across multiple markets where conversions have already taken place. We are also doing the work to align our supply chain and store systems. 
As we exited 2015, we began to see improvement in our store level availability. In the field, our teams are refocusing on our base business and away from the integration efforts that dominated much of 2015. We are clear about the work that lies ahead, but confident in our ability to enhance our efficiency, performance and profitability.
In a few moments, I'll talk about our plans to implement a more field-centric organization, drive additional cost reductions and relentlessly pursue opportunities to increase efficiency across our operations. 
But first, let me turn it over to Mike to provide some brief context around the quarter. Mike?"
24333,316762880,931659,"Advance Auto Parts Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 11, 2016",2016-02-11,"Earnings Calls","Advance Auto Parts, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, George, and good morning, everyone.

We delivered comparable cash EPS of $1.22 for the fourth quarter despite the softer than expected sales. This result included a $0.03 hit from foreign currency and $0.03 benefit from the incremental synergy realization. 
Fourth quarter net sales declined 2.6%, with comparable sales down 2.5%. Comparable store sales were negatively impacted by approximately 90 basis points due to the timing of the New Year's Day holiday, which was in our 53rd week last year, and 46 basis points of negative foreign currency impact, partially offset by a favorable impact from our CARQUEST store consolidations. The unseasonably warm start to winter impacted both our commercial and DIY businesses, particularly in batteries and cold weather-related hard parts categories, such as starters, alternators and related products. With fewer customers seeking cold weather parts, this also resulted in lower add-on sales. Partially offsetting this performance was continued strong results in our brake business across both our commercial and DIY businesses.
In our commercial business, performance was primarily driven by mid-single-digit sales declines in our Great Lakes and planes cold-weather markets, while the Midsouth and Southeast faired better. The softness in seasonal category sales was partially offset by a modest increase in our commercial ticket size and the strength I noted in our brake business. Nonetheless, we continued to expand our customer base with our national accounts business growing in the mid-single digits and TechNet, which partnered with the independent repair shops, adding 600 new members in the quarter. 
Within DIY, strong brake results only partially offset the softness in battery and battery accessory sales, as well as other winter seasonal categories resulting in a sequential decline. Despite the softness, we continued to expand our Speed Perks program, which now has over 10 million members, and it will be an important driver of our ability to increase customer loyalty going forward. Our gross profit rate decline of 15 basis points was primarily the result of supply chain expense deleverage to the comparable store sales decline, partially offset by lower shrink expenses. 
Our fourth quarter comparable SG&A rate increased 33 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to the expense deleverage from the comp store sales decline, partially offset by our continued cost reduction initiatives and disciplined efforts to lower administrative and support costs.
All-in, fourth quarter operating income on a comparable basis decreased 8.2% to $157.6 million and the comparable operating margin decreased 48 basis points over the same period last year to 7.7%. 
Free cash flow for 2015 was $454.9 million versus $480.5 million last year, driven by a decrease in our AP ratio to 76.7% versus 78.6% last year. This decrease was principally driven by transitional inventory growth resulting from our product integration work, the CARQUEST consolidation work and the growth in WORLDPAC branches.
Turning to balance sheet and leverage. Adjusted debt to EBITDAR was 2.5x at year end. During the quarter, we repaid $80 million in debt, and we remain at or below our maximum state of leverage ratio of 2.5x. We are committed to preserving a balanced and disciplined approach to capital allocation to drive shareholder value while maintaining our investment grade ratings.
We remain focused on taking the actions required to achieve our 12% adjusted operating income margin target. To reach this objective, we will deliver improved gross margins and reduce costs by approximately 100 basis points through a combination of G&A reductions and improved store productivity. This includes capturing the remaining $50 million of our previously disclosed $160 million in cost synergies. 
Before I turn it back to George, let me touch briefly on the remaining integration initiatives we are pursuing in 2016.
We are focused on 2 areas: one, continued execution of CARQUEST market conversion programs; and 2, development of testing -- to development and testing to enable us to combine our AAP and CARQUEST supply chain and store systems into 1 network. We are also pursuing supply chain optimization work, including the closing of our Sutton, Massachusetts distribution center. In conjunction with these efforts, we expect to incur additional onetime costs of $75 million to $90 million in 2016, including $65 million to $75 million related to ongoing integration efforts and $10 million to $15 million related to supply chain optimization work. 
We are pleased with our progress in our CARQUEST conversion markets, nearly all of which are experiencing comp increases, which average in the mid to upper single digits in the fourth quarter. This year, we plan to execute approximately 350 market conversion projects. 
In terms of our store network and supply chain projects, we expect to begin in-store system pilots by early quarter 2 and supply chain pilots in early quarter 4. As previously indicated, full-scale rollout is expected to be in 2017. 
With that, let me turn it back to George to discuss our plans for 2016 and beyond. George?"
24333,316762880,931659,"Advance Auto Parts Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 11, 2016",2016-02-11,"Earnings Calls","Advance Auto Parts, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mike.

We have a tremendous platform across commercial and DIY, and I am confident in our ability to drive improved profitability and generate increased shareholder value. 
As [indiscernible]  At the outset, our plans include implementing a more field-centric organization to drive increased customer satisfaction and improve repeat business and revenue, further reducing cost and relentlessly pursuing opportunities to drive additional operational efficiencies.
We are a company made up of approximately 5,300 hyper local businesses. In order to be successful, we must meet the needs of our customers at a local level by aggressively empowering our teams to make decisions in their local markets and providing the appropriate operational infrastructure to execute against those decisions. Developing a field-centric system is not a concept, it is something that we are in the early stages of executing. 
There are 3 key pillars that underpin our objectives as a field-centric organization: 1, providing superior availability to ensure we deliver the right part at the right place at the right time; 2, providing the right infrastructure to achieve outstanding customer service through flawless execution; and 3, providing the right tools and incentives to develop focused and inspired teams with a desire to win. Let me share a few insights on each.
The [indiscernible] availability, having the right part in the right place at the right time is essential to running a great commercial business and also benefits DIY. Because we run approximately 5,300 local commercial businesses, serving the customer requires input from and empowerment of local store teams. Trying to manage those 5,300 businesses from a central office is both inefficient and ineffective. We are changing that. In order to drive more effective local execution, we are investing to improve inventory coverage to support our stores, while simultaneously developing a field-centric process that empowers the general managers of the stores to make decisions and tailor their inventories to best serve the unique local customer base. 
We are piloting this process in 5 regions. And while it is very early in the program, we are seeing high levels of store engagement and believe will translate to improved commercial sales over time. The goal is clear: having the right part, in the right place at the right time. 
We will continue to leverage our in-market HUB and super HUB stores and expand delivery frequency to stores from our DCs, but we'll do so on the most efficient basis. We are making sure that we think out of the supply chain and delivery frequency by first determining the best answer for each store and its customers. How can we provide the best in-stock and availability, and therefore, the best overall service for our customer? After we determine the optimal goal for the stores, we can then determine the most effective and efficient supply chain delivery process and system. That means will it make sense to have daily delivery, we will have it. But daily delivery is not an answer by itself. Delivery scheduling is a means to provide the stores with what they need to satisfy the customer. Daily delivery will not be justified for every store. We're working at delivery frequency, in-market availability, HUB-owner frequency, and evaluating which combination is the best local market answer to enable us to serve our customers most effectively.
Second, outstanding customer service. We are laser-focused on achieving excellence in commercial through flawless execution. Unlike the retail side of the business, our interactions with commercial customers take place on a daily basis. We believe we do a great job focusing on commercial, will naturally build the availability and the can-do attitude in the stores, which will also help retail. With the average commercial sales of approximately $730,000 per program, we are already among the industry leaders, but we can do more as we shift our identity from a retail culture to a commercial focus. We know that as we do a better job servicing our commercial customers, we will then drive frequency. 
To be clear, while we'll be a commercial first organization, we will not lose focus on DIY. Commercial is our most significant growth opportunity. But we believe our commercial focus will have synergistic benefits to DIY because of the same -- because the same fundamentals apply across the businesses. 
We continue to be focused on growing our Speed Perks membership program and satisfying our DIY customers through our knowledgeable team members and well-placed locations. 
In 2016, we'll be investing to further develop great commercial field and store teams, deliver focused sales and service execution and scale key programs, such as our strategic accounts, and membership programs like TechNet and ProRewards. 
Our third pillar, having focused and inspired teams, is about inspiring and empowering those teams by providing them incentives and support that position them to win. The first step is to provide our teams with broader authority as business owners. We are improving our communication approach to support the sales organization versus an operational organization. As part of this, I engage directly every quarter with our field organization leadership to address business priorities, field-centric leadership and changes throughout the organization in an unfiltered manner. I want to make sure they hear directly from me about our goals, expectations and challenges as we develop greater accountability and transparency across the organization.
In addition, we are positioning our stores to have a simplified and customer-focused operating model. We are also working to limit disruptions across the system so our stores and regions can focus on the vital business priorities we have ahead of us this year. We are also testing new compensation approaches to support a field-centric ownership mentality. 
As we execute against these 3 pillars, we are focused on continuing to drive improvements across the organization to deliver profitable growth.
Let me be clear. Where we see opportunities to take cost out or improve efficiency, that does not affect the customer experience, we'll move in an aggressive pace and prioritize our actions accordingly. This means not only capturing remaining cost-saving synergies we've highlighted, but continuing to look for other ways to further reduce cost. It means examining structural changes to optimize our supply chain, such as our plans to open a new DC in Nashville, Tennessee and close RDC in Sutton, Massachusetts. 
We will continue to focus on improving productivity and profitability across our store base. We are now applying a higher threshold of performance acceptability of the stores and continue to look at all parts of our business to improve returns. 
We expect to take further actions to address underperforming assets and unnecessary costs. We will make sure to analyze all customer facing cost savings opportunities with a strong balance toward improving service levels. We are looking at all areas and want to make the best decisions possible.
This work does not happen overnight, but we will follow the analysis where it leads and take the appropriate steps to continue to improve performance and drive value. 
The bottom line is clear. We must drive improved profitability as we grow our top line. Our comps will go up and our customers can rely on us to get them the parts they want, when they want them. We must execute flawlessly for the customer by becoming a commercial first business, with leading parts availability, great teams and efficient operations.
Turning to our outlook for 2016. We expect modest top line growth, driven by comparable store sales in the low single digits. We also expect to open 65 to 75 new stores, including 46 WORLDPAC branches and one new WORLDPAC distribution center. At the same time, we are maintaining a tight control over costs. And we are laser-focused on achieving our stated 12% adjusted operating margin goal for 2016, which has not changed. 
In closing, the changes we are making to our organization are both real and substantial. We begun to make the shift to operating our businesses more locally, and we'll keep advancing that agenda. Our teams know our customers best and they're embracing their new responsibilities as we drive more local decision-making. I've been equally impressed with the pace and commitment with which our store support center teams have enthusiastically shifted decision-making, senior responsibly in some cases, while accepting greater accountability in others, with a singular focus on winning the market. 
I'm also encouraged by the ability of our organization to learn and adapt, ensuring we don't repeat mistakes of either action or inaction. We are making the right decisions to change our profit formula to yield better outcomes.
Finally, before we open up to your questions, I'd like to take a moment to thank all of our team members for their continued focus and commitment to customer service.

And as a business that's been quite now spoken about beig commercial first, everyone needs to be willing and able to pick up the telephone and help a commercial customer or hop in a truck and make a delivery. So we are pleased with that aspect of it. The compensation pilot is just that. It's a pilot in a limited amount of stores that is not having much impact nor is it intended to right now across the entire chain of stores, it's a learning event for us right now. And my focus is to get the empowerment to the field that allows for a true sense of business ownership before putting in a compensation system that rewards business ownership."

A customer asks us, if we have the part, and can we get it to him quickly? And that is how we operate and that's how we run and that's how we will drive comps over time. So yes, to having the part is absolutely critical for us and getting availability right, and we feel we've made some good progress on that, is absolutely job won for us. That being said, there are other initiatives that have an impact on comp sales during the course of the year. Certainly, our consolidation of CARQUEST stores will impact our comp sales. The Speed Perks program at 10 million numbers will impact our comp sales. More investments in inventory and hubs will affect our comp stores. And the move to multi-day delivery will affect comp sales as well. So we had a waterfall of activities that we built out that we think will drive comp sales methodically, but clearly, it starts from availability."

Good morning. Let me try to take that in sequence. I think if you look at, first of all, our comments around what you're describing our outlier stores, which was a group of stores that disproportionately affected our sales miss, a couple of actions there. #1, as we previously mentioned and mentioned in the script, we closed some stores during the course of the fourth quarter. You can fully expect that they were among those bottom 10% performers. So that's a small group of stores and that's not the entire difference. We also are moving into a period right now where we're currently executing accelerated consolidations of poor performing stores. So in this case, specific CARQUEST stores that were not meeting our expectations that we've now begun to consolidate into Advance Auto Part stores and that will stall for another tranche of the stores. There are still outlier stores and there will be. So our field teams continue to work on the performance of some of our outliers. As you look at the consolidation or the market conversions and look at results, we're generally pleased, and we're pretty much pleased across the board. So that number, that initial number that you referred to was clearly inflated due to the CARQUEST conversions. So once the market begins to undergo conversion there is, as you'd expect, a negative sales impact. And it really lasts for anywhere from 5 to 6 weeks. So we see these created about 1 month to 1.5 months when there's actually physical construction going on in the stores, team members are changing, parts are changing in some cases, that we see comps go down and then we see it ramp back up. And our effort has been to take that time for it and compress it as much as possible, and we have. So in the early consolidations, it was a longer period of time. So we've seen that narrow down pretty nicely over time to the point where -- and obviously, we will work to continue to improve that to be shorter and shorter. That's about 5 to 6 weeks that there's a negative impact and then the store begins to emerge with better results. And that generally shows up in the form of double-digit comps [indiscernible] in consolidations and anywhere from single, mid-single to high single up to double-digit comps in our conversion stores."

First, Mike and I will briefly address fourth quarter performance. Then I'll share my perspective regarding our outlook and how we plan to drive improved execution and results going forward. There will be plenty of time at the end for your questions. Let me get right into it. 
Mike will address our fourth quarter results in more detail in a moment. But at a high-level, our worse than expected top line performance reflected both the negative impact of warmer weather and the continued impact of our efforts to move quickly to capture efficiencies for integration, which inadvertently led to disruption in servicing our customers and supporting our stores. This combination of factors resulted in negative comparable sales of 2.5%. We are not satisfied with these results.
We have, however, made considerable progress and believe many of the major execution challenges are behind us. That being said, we still have work to do to drive efficiency across the company. As I say that we have made progress, let me be clear that we fully understand that we're in improvement mode. Some of big parts of integration are now completed, including corporate consolidations, the integration of our field teams and pricing alignment work. In addition, we have completed the first major tranche of the CARQUEST market conversions and substantially all of our product alignment work. 
We also made significant progress in our cost cutting initiatives in 2015, delivering over $50 million in incremental cost synergy savings and driving efficiency by closing approximately 80 underperforming stores.
Through actions to date, we have mitigated the disruption caused by integration work, and we are moving ahead with our plans to deliver improved and more consistent performance. Going forward, we will focus on continuing the CARQUEST market conversion program and building on our prior success, which has enabled us to deliver mid-single-digit comps across multiple markets where conversions have already taken place. We are also doing the work to align our supply chain and store systems. 
As we exited 2015, we began to see improvement in our store level availability. In the field, our teams are refocusing on our base business and away from the integration efforts that dominated much of 2015. We are clear about the work that lies ahead, but confident in our ability to enhance our efficiency, performance and profitability.
In a few moments, I'll talk about our plans to implement a more field-centric organization, drive additional cost reductions and relentlessly pursue opportunities to increase efficiency across our operations. 
But first, let me turn it over to Mike to provide some brief context around the quarter. Mike?"

We delivered comparable cash EPS of $1.22 for the fourth quarter despite the softer than expected sales. This result included a $0.03 hit from foreign currency and $0.03 benefit from the incremental synergy realization. 
Fourth quarter net sales declined 2.6%, with comparable sales down 2.5%. Comparable store sales were negatively impacted by approximately 90 basis points due to the timing of the New Year's Day holiday, which was in our 53rd week last year, and 46 basis points of negative foreign currency impact, partially offset by a favorable impact from our CARQUEST store consolidations. The unseasonably warm start to winter impacted both our commercial and DIY businesses, particularly in batteries and cold weather-related hard parts categories, such as starters, alternators and related products. With fewer customers seeking cold weather parts, this also resulted in lower add-on sales. Partially offsetting this performance was continued strong results in our brake business across both our commercial and DIY businesses.
In our commercial business, performance was primarily driven by mid-single-digit sales declines in our Great Lakes and Plains cold-weather markets, while the Mid-South and Southeast fared better. The softness in seasonal category sales was partially offset by a modest increase in our commercial ticket size and the strength I noted in our brake business. Nonetheless, we continued to expand our customer base with our national accounts business growing in the mid-single digits and TechNet, which partnered with the independent repair shops, adding 600 new members in the quarter. 
Within DIY, strong brake results only partially offset the softness in battery and battery accessory sales, as well as other winter seasonal categories resulting in a sequential decline. Despite the softness, we continued to expand our Speed Perks program, which now has over 10 million members, and it will be an important driver of our ability to increase customer loyalty going forward. Our gross profit rate decline of 15 basis points was primarily the result of supply chain expense deleverage to the comparable store sales decline, partially offset by lower shrink expenses. 
Our fourth quarter comparable SG&A rate increased 33 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to the expense deleverage from the comp store sales decline, partially offset by our continued cost reduction initiatives and disciplined efforts to lower administrative and support costs.
All-in, fourth quarter operating income on a comparable basis decreased 8.2% to $157.6 million and the comparable operating margin decreased 48 basis points over the same period last year to 7.7%. 
Free cash flow for 2015 was $454.9 million versus $480.5 million last year, driven by a decrease in our AP ratio to 76.7% versus 78.6% last year. This decrease was principally driven by transitional inventory growth resulting from our product integration work, the CARQUEST consolidation work and the growth in WORLDPAC branches.
Turning to balance sheet and leverage. Adjusted debt to EBITDAR was 2.5x at year end. During the quarter, we repaid $80 million in debt, and we remain at or below our maximum stated leverage ratio of 2.5x. We are committed to preserving a balanced and disciplined approach to capital allocation to drive shareholder value, while maintaining our investment grade ratings.
We remain focused on taking the actions required to achieve our 12% adjusted operating income margin target. To reach this objective, we will deliver improved gross margins and reduce costs by approximately 100 basis points through a combination of G&A reductions and improved store productivity. This includes capturing the remaining $50 million of our previously disclosed $160 million in cost synergies. 
Before I turn it back to George, let me touch briefly on the remaining integration initiatives we are pursuing in 2016.
We are focused on 2 areas: one, continued execution of CARQUEST market conversion programs; and two, development of testing -- to development and testing to enable us to combine our AAP and CARQUEST supply chain and store systems into 1 network. We are also pursuing supply chain optimization work, including the closing of our Sutton, Massachusetts distribution center. In conjunction with these efforts, we expect to incur additional onetime costs of $75 million to $90 million in 2016, including $65 million to $75 million related to ongoing integration efforts and $10 million to $15 million related to supply chain optimization work. 
We are pleased with our progress in our CARQUEST conversion markets, nearly all of which are experiencing comp increases, which average in the mid to upper single digits in the fourth quarter. This year, we plan to execute approximately 350 market conversion projects. 
In terms of our store network and supply chain projects, we expect to begin in-store system pilots by early quarter 2 and supply chain pilots in early quarter 4. As previously indicated, full-scale rollout is expected to be in 2017. 
With that, let me turn it back to George to discuss our plans for 2016 and beyond. George?"

We have a tremendous platform across commercial and DIY, and I'm confident in our ability to drive improved profitability and generate increased shareholder value. 
As [indiscernible]  At the outset, our plans include implementing a more field-centric organization to drive increased customer satisfaction and improve repeat business and revenue, further reducing cost and relentlessly pursuing opportunities to drive additional operational efficiencies.
We are a company made up of approximately 5,300 hyper-local businesses. In order to be successful, we must meet the needs of our customers at a local level by aggressively empowering our teams to make decisions in their local markets and providing the appropriate operational infrastructure to execute against those decisions. Developing a field-centric system is not a concept, it is something that we are in the early stages of executing. 
There are 3 key pillars that underpin our objectives as a field-centric organization: one, providing superior availability to ensure we deliver the right part at the right place at the right time; two, providing the right infrastructure to achieve outstanding customer service through flawless execution; and three, providing the right tools and incentives to develop focused and inspired teams with a desire to win. Let me share a few insights on each.
Superior availability, having the right part in the right place at the right time is essential to running a great commercial business and also benefits DIY. Because we run approximately 5,300 local commercial businesses, serving the customer requires input from and empowerment of local store teams. Trying to manage those 5,300 businesses from a central office is both inefficient and ineffective. We are changing that. In order to drive more effective local execution, we are investing to improve inventory coverage to support our stores, while simultaneously developing a field-centric process that empowers the general managers of the stores to make decisions and tailor their inventories to best serve the unique local customer base. 
We are piloting this process in 5 regions. And while it is very early in the program, we are seeing high levels of store engagement and believe it will translate to improved commercial sales over time. The goal is clear: having the right part, in the right place at the right time. 
We will continue to leverage our in-market HUB and super HUB stores and expand delivery frequency to stores from our DCs, but we'll do so on the most efficient basis. We are making sure that we think out the supply chain and delivery frequency by first determining the best answer for each store and its customers. How can we provide the best in-stock and availability, and therefore, the best overall service for our customer? After we determine the optimal goal for the stores, we can then determine the most effective and efficient supply chain delivery process and system. That means will it make sense to have daily delivery? We will have it. But daily delivery is not an answer by itself. Delivery scheduling is a means to provide the stores with what they need to satisfy the customer. Daily delivery will not be justified for every store. We're looking at delivery frequency, in-market availability, HUB-owner frequency, and evaluating which combination is the best local market answer to enable us to serve our customers most effectively.
Second, outstanding customer service. We are laser-focused on achieving excellence in commercial through flawless execution. Unlike the retail side of the business, our interactions with commercial customers take place on a daily basis. We believe if we do a great job focusing on commercial, we will naturally build the availability and the can-do attitude in the stores, which will also help retail. With the average commercial sales of approximately $730,000 per program, we are already among the industry leaders, but we can do more as we shift our identity from a retail culture to a commercial focus. We know that as we do a better job servicing our commercial customers, we will then drive frequency. 
To be clear, while we'll be a commercial first organization, we will not lose focus on DIY. Commercial is our most significant growth opportunity. But we believe our commercial focus will have synergistic benefits to DIY because of the same -- because the same fundamentals apply across the businesses. 
We continue to be focused on growing our Speed Perks membership program and satisfying our DIY customers through our knowledgeable team members and well-placed locations. 
In 2016, we'll be investing to further develop great commercial field and store teams, deliver focused sales and service execution and scale key programs, such as our strategic accounts, and membership programs like TechNet and ProRewards. 
Our third pillar, having focused and inspired teams, is about inspiring and empowering those teams by providing them incentives and support that position them to win. The first step is to provide our teams with broader authority as business owners. We are improving our communication approach to support a sales organization versus an operational organization. As part of this, I engage directly every quarter with our field organization leadership to address business priorities, field-centric leadership and changes throughout the organization in an unfiltered manner. I want to make sure they hear directly from me about our goals, expectations and challenges as we develop greater accountability and transparency across the organization.
In addition, we are positioning our stores to have a simplified and customer-focused operating model. We are also working to limit disruptions across the system so our stores and regions can focus on the vital business priorities we have ahead of us this year. We are also testing new compensation approaches to support a field-centric ownership mentality. 
As we execute against these 3 pillars, we are focused on continuing to drive improvements across the organization to deliver profitable growth.
Let me be clear. Where we see opportunities to take cost out or improve efficiency, that does not affect the customer experience, we'll move in an aggressive pace and prioritize our actions accordingly. This means not only capturing the remaining cost-saving synergies we've highlighted, but continuing to look for other ways to further reduce cost. It means examining structural changes to optimize our supply chain, such as our plans to open a new DC in Nashville, Tennessee and close our DC in Sutton, Massachusetts. 
We will continue to focus on improving productivity and profitability across our store base. We are now applying a higher threshold of performance acceptability of the stores and continue to look at all parts of our business to improve returns. 
We expect to take further actions to address underperforming assets and unnecessary costs. We will make sure to analyze all customer facing cost savings opportunities with a strong balance toward improving service levels. We are looking at all areas and want to make the best decisions possible.
This work does not happen overnight, but we will follow the analysis where it leads and take the appropriate steps to continue to improve performance and drive value. 
The bottom line is clear. We must drive improved profitability as we grow our top line. Our comps will go up and our customers can rely on us to get them the parts they want, when they want them. We must execute flawlessly for the customer by becoming a commercial first business, with leading parts availability, great teams and efficient operations.
Turning to our outlook for 2016. We expect modest top line growth, driven by comparable store sales in the low single digits. We also expect to open 65 to 75 new stores, including 4 to 6 WORLDPAC branches and one new WORLDPAC distribution center. At the same time, we are maintaining a tight control over costs. And we are laser-focused on achieving our stated 12% adjusted operating margin goal for 2016, which has not changed. 
In closing, the changes we are making to our organization are both real and substantial. We've begun to make the shift to operating our businesses more locally, and we'll keep advancing that agenda. Our teams know our customers best and they're embracing their new responsibilities as we drive more local decision-making. I've been equally impressed with the pace and commitment with which our store support center teams have enthusiastically shifted decision-making, seeing the responsibly in some cases, while accepting greater accountability in others, with a singular focus on winning the market. 
I'm also encouraged by the ability of our organization to learn and adapt, ensuring we don't repeat mistakes of either action or inaction. We are making the right decisions to change our profit formula to yield better outcomes.
Finally, before we open up to your questions, I'd like to take a moment to thank all of our team members for their continued focus and commitment to customer service.

So I think one of the biggest themes that we are working on right now is a quick move towards field-centricity. We recognize that we run very, very local businesses and they're all unique in their own way. We feel that we can get things 90%-plus right out of the Support Center, but we're empowering our teams to take it the right -- the rest of the way to 100%. So they now have more and more autonomy over adding SKUs to their assortment, adding more product to the supply chain system, we think that will have some of the most immediate benefits. The single selling model is -- we're in sustained mode on that one. The team is becoming more and more comfortable with it. And we believe that, fundamentally, it's the right thing to do, to serve all customers that walk in or call our stores. And as a business that's been quite outspoken about being commercial first, everyone needs to be willing and able to pick up the telephone and help a commercial customer or hop in a truck and make a delivery. So we're pleased with that aspect of it. The compensation pilot is just that. It's a pilot in a limited amount of stores that is not having much impact, nor is it intended to right now, across the entire chain of stores. It's a learning event for us right now. And my focus is to get the empowerment to the field that allows for a true sense of business ownership before putting in a compensation system that rewards business ownership."

And that is how we operate and that's how we run and that's how we will drive comps over time. So yes, to having the part is absolutely critical for us and getting availability right, and we feel that we've made some good progress on that, is absolutely job 1 for us. That being said, there are other initiatives that have an impact on comp sales during the course of the year. Certainly, our consolidation of CARQUEST stores will impact our comp sales. The Speed Perks program, at 10 million numbers, will impact our comp sales. More investments in inventory and hubs will affect our comp stores. And the move to multi-day delivery will affect comp sales as well. So we had a waterfall of activities that we've built out that we think will drive comp sales methodically, but clearly, it starts from availability."

Good morning. Let me try to take that in sequence. I think if you look at, first of all, our comments around what you're describing our outlier stores, which was a group of stores that disproportionately affected our sales miss, a couple of actions there. #1, as we previously mentioned and mentioned in the script, we closed some stores during the course of the fourth quarter. You can fully expect that they were among those bottom 10% performers. So that's a small group of stores, and that's not the entire difference. We also are moving into a period right now where we're currently executing accelerated consolidations of poor performing stores. So in this case, specific CARQUEST stores that were not meeting our expectations that we've now begun to consolidate into Advance Auto Part stores and that will stall for another tranche of the stores. There are still outlier stores, and there will be. So our field teams continue to work on the performance of some of our outliers. As you look at the consolidation or the market conversions and look at results, we're generally pleased, and we're pretty much pleased across the board. So that number, that initial number that you referred to was clearly inflated due to the CARQUEST conversions. So once the market begins to undergo conversion there is, as you'd expect, a negative sales impact. And it really lasts for anywhere from 5 to 6 weeks. So we see this created about 1 month to 1.5 months when there's actually physical construction going on in the stores, team members are changing, parts are changing in some cases, that we see comps go down and then we see it ramp back up. And our effort has been to take that time for it and compress it as much as possible, and we have. So in the early consolidations, it was a longer period of time. So we've seen that narrow down pretty nicely over time to the point where -- and obviously, we will work to continue to improve that to be shorter and shorter. But it's about 5 to 6 weeks that there's a negative impact and then the store begins to emerge with better results. And that generally shows up in the form of double-digit comps [indiscernible] in consolidations and anywhere from single, mid-single to high single up to double-digit comps in our conversion stores."

Since I walked in the door on April 11, I've been working very closely with the leadership team. Importantly, I spend most of my time out in the field, speaking with customers and team members to get a deeper understanding of our capabilities, challenges and opportunities. I've been in my role for just over a month, so admittedly, it's very early. 
Having said that, based on what I've seen so far, and what you saw in today's earnings release, it's clear we're facing real challenges. The good news is I have tremendous confidence that we have an extraordinary opportunity to create value going forward even more than I thought before I joined the company. 
On today's call, I'll share my initial observations on the business and the quarter. Then I'll turn the call over to Mike to address first quarter performance before coming back to discuss the overarching themes that will guide our path forward. We'll leave plenty of time at the end for questions. 
Allow me to start with a bit of context on why I decided to join Advance. I wasn't looking for just any CEO position as I transition from a great role in another great company. I was looking for a CEO position in a company with scale, a company in a growing industry and a company filled with potential, a company with a terrific opportunity where I could help dramatically improve performance and value. Without question, Advance hits on each of these objectives. 
First, scale. Not only is Advance a large company based on revenue and market cap, we also have over 70,000 team members and a comprehensive North American footprint. Over the past few weeks, I've been consistently impressed by the quality and commitment of our field team in both our store support center and in the field. Given this context, Advance provides the opportunity for me to do what I enjoy most, lead a large team and put tremendous focus on meeting the needs of our customers, engage directly with team members to develop and execute plans to meet those needs and, ultimately, to drive financial and marketplace performance as well as shareholder value. 
Secondly, growing. We operate in a very large and attractive $100 billion-plus industry with strong growth rates. Candidly, there are very few industries that offer the compelling growth rates that exist in our space. 
And finally, filled with potential. As many analysts have delineated, Advance has enormous upside potential. In particular, we have a tremendous opportunity to improve our customer service and competitiveness in the marketplace to accelerate growth. In addition, I know we can drive significant productivity and capability improvements in our supply chain and throughout Advance. And without question, we can do a better job of attracting, developing and retaining talent in our company. Each of these by themselves will contribute upside in our performance. Together, in the context of a large and growing industry, we'll generate meaningful value for shareholders. The past several weeks have fully validated the perspective I had as I was considering the opportunity. There's no question, we have work to do. But it's clear, the board and my leadership team are prepared to take decisive actions on a number of fronts to create real value for shareholders over time. 
Allow me to briefly touch on our Q1 results and outlook. Our comp performance in the quarter was disappointing. We continue to experience shortfalls on execution, driven by availability and service levels. From my perspective as a new CEO coming to Advance, it's clear, these challenges are within our control and can certainly be addressed. We've been outflanked on supply chain, outperformed on core productivity metrics and out-executed on customer service. As a result, our growth rate and profitability have them below that of our peers for several years. Recently this is partly due to our focused on the CARQUEST integration. The integration has been a necessary but distracting agenda for our entire team. It's caused us to be internally focused versus externally focused. The sum of all of this resulted in continued challenges in Q1 with negative comp sales of down 1.9%. 
While these results are unacceptable from our standpoint, the entire Advance team and I are excited by the areas where we see room for substantial improvement. We can and will make the necessary changes that will improve our value proposition and service levels for our customers. Clearly, we are not where we need to be in terms of competing at the highest levels to earn more trust from more customers to accelerate growth. My team and I are in the midst of a deep dive on our business and current performance. While we still have work to do, we have a view of the challenges facing the business and where we fall in short. We've developed short-term action plans to address these challenges and that begins with consistently meeting the needs of our customers. In fact, we're all very passionate about this. In order to return the company to a substantial growth trajectory, we must deliver improved bill rates, availability and in stock. In addition, we need to dramatically simplify the business and remove obstacles for our field teams so they can execute with excellence. These focused plans are now in motion. The reality is performance improvement won't happen overnight. Our Q1 comps were down primarily due to the internal challenges I outlined a moment ago, notably, our shortfalls with availability and service levels. 
We also experienced accelerated declines on demand, particularly in our colder weather markets late in Q1, and that has continued into Q2. Based on this trend, we believe it's prudent to take a conservative approach and revise our assumption for annual comp sales to range between down 3% and down 5%. In addition, we're no longer targeting the 12% adjusted operating margin rate for 2016 that we've previously communicated. Make no mistake, we can and will do better. But we must be thoughtful regarding our expectations to ensure we set ourselves up for long-term growth and margin expansion. Right now we're maniacally focused on what we can control, availability, customer service, productivity and performance. We're redoubling our efforts around accelerating growth, reducing costs and driving efficiencies throughout the organization. At the same time, we're confident in our business, our people and the opportunity that lies ahead. In fact, we see significant sales growth and operating margin expansion opportunities over time. We're going to be very disciplined about how we drive growth and profitability. I've tackled this kind of challenge more than once in the past and I'm extremely confident this business can deliver operating margins well above 12% over time. 
The reality is that achieving the target this year would prevent us from creating a platform we need to enable sustainable growth and operating leverage. For the balance of the year, we'll sharpen our focus on execution and ensure we're responding to customers by delivering the parts they want, where they want and they want them. While it won't take place overnight, we're committed to making significant improvement on this critical metric. 
In a few minutes, I'll highlight 3 overarching themes that will guide our path forward. Before I turn the call over to Mike for some brief comments on the quarter, I want to say a few words about the CFO transition we announced earlier today. First, I want to thank Mike for his 8 years of strong financial leadership, during the time when the company more than doubled its market cap. Mike's played a key role in developing a strong finance team and building a capital structure to support our future growth. I'm very appreciative of Mike's willingness to support our transition with his leadership, passion and experience. We commenced an external search for a new CFO and have agreed with Mike that he will stay on until a successor has joined and an orderly transition has taken place. We've not set a time frame to complete the search as it has just begun, but we'll move as expeditiously as possible to bring in the best person for the role. 
With that, let me turn it over to Mike."

Before I get into my comments in the quarter, I want to say it has been an absolute pleasure to be part of the Advance team for the past 8 years. While I've decided that now is a good time to make a transition, I remain confident in the company's future and look forward to working with Tom and the rest of the team to ensure we have a smooth transition. 
Now turning to the quarter. We delivered adjusted cash EPS of $2.51 for the first quarter primarily driven by softer-than-expected sales. Turning to sales. Overall as Tom said, we were disappointed with our results as first quarter comparable store sales were down 1.9%. These declines were partially offset by positive growth and comp performance from WORLDPAC, CARQUEST Canada and from our store conversions and consolidations. As Tom touched on, top line performance reflected continued challenges with availability and lack of execution to improve service levels. We are intensely attacking these areas with urgency to make the needed improvements. With regards to external factors, we saw a continuation of the milder winter weather that we experienced in Q4 that negatively impacted our sales with lower demand towards the end of the quarter as we experienced a late start to spring primarily in our colder weather markets where approximately 40% of our stores are located. Seasonal categories with the largest impact during the quarter, was seen in batteries and hard parts categories, which were partially offset by continued strong results in our brake business across both commercial and DIY, which saw high single-digit growth during the quarter compared to mid-single-digit growth in the third and fourth quarters of 2015. 
In our Commercial Business, the comp sales declines were more pronounced in our Northeast and Great Lake markets. The softness in seasonal category sales were partially offset by a modest increase in our commercial ticket size and the strength I noted in our brake business. We continue to expand our customer base with our national account business in TechNet, which partnered with independent repair shops also continuing to add new members in the quarter. Within DIY, we continue to see strong brake results but that only partially offset softness in our battery and battery accessory as well as other seasonal categories. Our gross profit rate decline of 58 basis points was primarily the result of supply chain, expense deleverage due to the comparable store sales decline. Our first quarter adjusted SG&A rate decreased 100 basis points year-over-year driven by our continued cost reduction initiatives and disciplined efforts to lower administrative and support cost offset by fixed cost deleverage of our comparable store sales decline. All-in, first quarter adjusted EPS increased 5% compared to last year and adjusted operating income increased approximately 2.2% to $315 million and adjusted operating margin increased 43 basis points over the same period last year to 10.6%. Operating cash flow for the first quarter was approximately $75.3 million versus $102.2 million last year driven by a decrease in our AP ratio to 74.8% versus 76.5% last year. This decrease was principally driven by transitional inventory growth resulting from strategic investments and availability, the new WORLDPAC DC and lower-than-expected sales. Our adjusted debt to EBITDAR was 2.5x at the end of the quarter, and we remain at our maximum state of leverage ratio of 2.5x. We are committed to maintaining a balanced and disciplined approach to capital allocation to drive shareholder value while preserving our investment grade ratings. 
Turning to the balance of the year. As Tom mentioned, we now estimate our annual comparable stores sales to be in the range of negative 3% to negative 5%. Our highest priority and focus is to accelerate our top line sales momentum. Despite deferring our 12% target, we remain committed to improving our profitability which must be driven by sales growth and also continuing to simplify our business and remove cost furthest away from our customer, allowing the organization to be more efficient and effective. 
As outlined on our fourth quarter call, our integration activities this year are focused on 2 main areas: one, development and testing work to enable us to combine our AAP and CARQUEST supply chain and store systems into one network; and two, the continued execution of CARQUEST market conversion programs. 
With that, let me turn it back to Tom."

I'd like to provide some perspective on the path forward based on what I've seen and heard over the past few weeks. There's 3 themes which come to mind as I reflect on this: appreciate the past, acknowledge the present and anticipate the future. Let me start by appreciating the past. I spent considerable time with the people who built this business over the years. These leaders have provided me with some timeless fundamental principles that remain true to this day. 
The late Arthur Todman started Advance Auto Parts way back in the 1930s in the middle of a Great Depression. I've watched the videos and read speeches he delivered. He had a simple mantra: trust and listen to your customers and treat your employees like family. His son, Nick Todman, shared some of his perspective on Advance with me directly. Perhaps the most inspiring was when Nick told me the best part of the Advance Auto Parts story is ahead of us. Temple Sloan Jr. was way ahead of his time when he founded General Parts and, ultimately, CARQUEST. He decided to focus on the independence and major in the commercial parts business back in the 1970s. His son, Temple Sloan III, met with me recently and reinforced the key levers of success on the commercial side: making the right merchandising decisions, gaining acceptance and trust of commercial people in our stores, along with the owners and technicians they serve, and taking care of our people. Both Nick and Temple were maniacally focused on serving their customers and enabling their people. 
I could not agree more with the advice I've received from Nick and from Temple. In addition, I'd like to personally thank the Todman and Sloan family for being so incredibly welcoming to me as I've assumed this responsibility. Others like Jim Wade, Garnet Smith and Darren Jackson could not have been more accessible and helpful in my onboarding. 
I intend to keep the communication lines open with those who built this business. While it's important to know where we've come from to intelligently plan for where we must go, it's also clear that we must be willing to continue to adapt and improve. 
Turning to the present. Make no mistake, I enter this role with eyes wide open and an expectation that there were going to be many areas for improvement. As such, I'm going to call it as I see it. There are many areas that need attention and have substantial room for improvement. That's what got me excited about this opportunity. And I believe that our near-term challenges provide an even greater mandate to materially improve the business operations. We're in the midst of a deep dive on operational diagnostics and areas for improvement. Over the next few months, we'll be highly engaged in a thorough assessment of our business and current opportunities. My intention is to come back to you later this year with our long-term vision for the company along with specific goals and strategic imperatives necessary to achieve our vision. We're very hard at work. We need to understand precisely what's working, what's not working and the lessons learned surrounding our performance over the past few years. In the short term, we'll ensure all of our team members are taking actions that propel our business forward. With an appreciation for the past, and an acknowledgment of the present, our focus is on anticipating the future and the role Advance will play in shaping our industry and delivering results going forward. 
Allow me to [indiscernible] we. Have a tremendous opportunity to create value at Advance, much more than I envisioned when I joined the company. Over the coming weeks, we'll construct a multi-year strategic business plan to get after our biggest opportunities. This process is well underway and I already know one thing. Our framework will contain 3 primary chapters. First, growth. We'll develop a demand-based growth strategy that puts the focus squarely on customers and getting the right parts to the right places at the right time, predictably, reliably and consistently. Secondly, productivity. We'll instill a relentless focus on productivity while ensuring that we build new capabilities as we reduce waste and cost in our system. We'll reinvest some of these cost savings in future growth with much of the savings also dropping to the bottom line. 
People and culture. Our people strategy will support our business strategy and foster a diverse culture which mirrors the market and empowers our people to win in the marketplace every day in every way. Allow me to provide a little more detail. On growth, everything we do starts and stops with the customer. We're going to make certain we understand precisely what's important to commercial customers and to DIY customers. To improve our customer service, we need to elevate our operating intensity and customer responsiveness. We also need to increase the pace at which we make decisions and execute them. Bottom line, we need to become much more externally focused, and in doing so, we'll get the right part to the right customer faster and more efficiently. 
This leads to my second point around improving productivity. Our relentless focus on productivity necessitates establishing a clearly defined productivity pipeline that will reduce cost and remove waste while building new capabilities. This pipeline will be built around investing in those tasks that matter most in meeting customer needs and eliminating those that do not. We'll also focus on a thorough assessment of our DC network, fleet, procurement, store productivity and zero-based budgeting. Productivity will be the engine that fuels our growth. 
Finally, nothing is more important than mobilizing our team members across all of Advance. We have an incredibly talented and committed team across the country and we must listen to them much more than we have, empower them to act and provide them with the tools and technology they need to win in the marketplace. Our team members who are closest to the customers know them best. When we empower them and provide them the right tools, they can make decisions that improve execution and drive sales. We're a company comprised of 5,200 hyper local businesses in any given market. We're only as good as the talented district managers, general managers, commercial Parts Pros and commercial account managers and the rest of our team members in each market that help serve our customers every day. We intend to meet the needs of our local teams in delivering for their customers. Our field teams have told us that Advance has been too reliant on the store support center to make decisions and instill processes. We're listening. George and the rest of the Advance team are implementing a much more field-centric organization, where our team members are empowered to make decisions and held accountable for their actions. I know this by itself will expedite our transition as we provide local leaders the tools, training and technology required to succeed and win in the marketplace. 
In closing, I'm humbled and honored to lead this great organization. We have a strong foundation upon which to build, to grow and to thrive in a terrific industry. We're in the early days of developing and implementing a disciplined and comprehensive path forward. And you'll see more later this summer. Until then, our reorganization remains focused on delivering near-term commitments and business initiatives. Without a doubt, we have a lot of work to do. At the same time, I have tremendous confidence that, over time, we'll deliver superior execution for our customers, an outstanding environment for our people, and ultimately, we'll drive decrease profitability and shareholder value. 
Before we open it up to questions. I'd like to take a minute to thank all of our team members for building this business to what it is today. I'm excited to work together with my new team to help Advance reach its full potential.

It's possible that at the tail end of an extraordinarily mild winter, we feel he may have pulled forward some of the business earlier in the year now resulting in [indiscernible] hard part business in the spring. I won't blame it on the whether or count on the weather to help us. I see a lot of areas inside our business where we aren't performing, executing or strategizing as well as we should and, certainly, not as well as I expect. So we're going to act and plan to improve our business and executive better to improve our performance with an even greater sense of urgency. It could be that this is a short-term blip versus a trend, but we're not going to count on that and we're going to run our business based on the guidance that we gave you. We can't just hope for weather to get better. Hope is just not a strategy."

I will say that -- and George has been addressing this over the last several months, we've got to a point where the center is making many more decisions than we feel is appropriate. I think the biggest contrast would be the frontline organization at Frito-Lay, the frontline organization is essentially how we drive our business. If the frontline is delivering out there in the marketplace, we're going to win every day. I would say that at Frito-Lay, we do engage and allow the frontline to make more decisions than they do here, and that's why George has evolved this model to more of a field-centric or more customer-centric model. I think that's the biggest difference. And I think over time, we can certainly address that. We've got great field leaders. We have no lack of talent out there, so we got to remove obstacles for them to compete and win in the marketplace and we're very, very focused against that."

The challenge we have when we don't have at the top line cooking is we got a pretty high fixed cost model. And when you have a high fixed cost model, when the sales come in softer, you just deleverage. So I think those 2 work together. You get the top line going again and we expect us to see better leverage on the bottom line. But and the other fact is, while we're going to continue to take costs out, there is going to be some reinvestment required. As we look at this different parts of the business and reigniting our sales base, so there'll be balance there, but I think the primary focus is getting sales going.

Tom has talked about that on this call in his remarks, so that's the first one. The second one is managing our working capital. That's the second big driver in this industry, as you know. And you saw our inventory grew higher than we would have anticipated in the first quarter. The 3 big drivers around that were: one, WORLDPAC was -- their inventory was up, I want to say, close to 11% because we're opening a DC so that one we're going to continue to do. The other big driver is the CARQUEST inventory was up quite a bit as we invest in availability in that business. It was starved prior and we did a lot of investments last year. So we're going to continue to invest in inventory, but we anticipate by the end of the year, the inventory growth is probably at low single digits versus where it was and the other big driver was we delivered lower sales. So that drove the inventory up. So we're going to be focused on improving our earnings and improving our working capital and that's what we're going to be focused. On and in relation to the deployment of capital, as you know, first and foremost, getting the earnings going, that's first. And then as we think about that, as we think about buyback, maintaining our leverage ratio was important to us. So we maintained our investment grade ratings, that's a priority. And then after we're done that, we've done a great job paying down our debt, which gives us the flexibility to allocate capital to investing in the business or doing share buyback. We currently have $415 million that we're hoping to buy for a buyback."

Well, first of all, just a comment on the integration, Seth, I think anytime I've been involved in a couple of these were either an acquisition, and integration, some type of large-scale structural change, the complexity associated with a change like this is significant. And I think that in my brief time here, it's clear that the complexity was significant with this change. I think it's been distracting. It's caused us to be internally focused. We put obviously necessary resources against it. But as we go forward, as we move out of this era, I feel terrific about getting focused on the customer and making sure that we deliver the right part to the right customer at the right time reliably, predictably and consistently every single time. And Charles and the supply chain team are doing a lot of work right now to really elevate our capabilities there. So I think we're moving into a very focused agenda on the supply chain side.

Since I walked in the door on April 11, I've been working very closely with the leadership team. Importantly, I spend most of my time out in the field, speaking with customers and team members, to get a deeper understanding of our capabilities, challenges and opportunities. I've been in my role for just over a month, so admittedly, it's very early.
Having said that, based on what I've seen so far, and what you saw in today's earnings release, it's clear, we're facing real challenges. The good news is I have tremendous confidence that we have an extraordinary opportunity to create value going forward, even more than I thought before I joined the company.
On today's call, I'll share my initial observations on the business and the quarter. Then I'll turn the call over to Mike to address first quarter performance before coming back to discuss the overarching themes that will guide our path forward. We'll leave plenty of time at the end for questions.
Allow me to start with a bit of context on why I decided to join Advance. I wasn't looking for just any CEO position as I transition from a great role in another great company, I was looking for a CEO position in a company with scale, a company in a growing industry and a company filled with potential, a company with a terrific opportunity where I could help dramatically improve performance and value. Without question, Advance hits on each of these objectives.
First, scale. Not only is Advance a large company based on revenue and market cap, we also have over 70,000 team members and a comprehensive North American footprint. Over the past few weeks, I've been consistently impressed by the quality and commitment of our field team in both our store support center and in the field. Given this context, Advance provides the opportunity for me to do what I enjoy most, lead a large team and put tremendous focus on meeting the needs of our customers, engage directly with team members to develop and execute plans to meet those needs and, ultimately, to drive financial and marketplace performance as well as shareholder value.
Secondly, growing. We operate in a very large and attractive $100 billion-plus industry with strong growth rates. Candidly, there are very few industries that offer the compelling growth rates that exist in our space.
And finally, filled with potential. As many analysts have delineated, Advance has enormous upside potential. In particular, we have a tremendous opportunity to improve our customer service and competitiveness in the marketplace to accelerate growth. In addition, I know we can drive significant productivity and capability improvements in our supply chain and throughout Advance. And without question, we can do a better job of attracting, developing and retaining talent in our company. Each of these by themselves will contribute upside in our performance. Together, in the context of a large and growing industry, we'll generate meaningful value for shareholders. The past several weeks have fully validated the perspective I had as I was considering the opportunity. There's no question, we have work to do. But it's clear, the board and my leadership team are prepared to take decisive actions on a number of fronts to create real value for shareholders over time.
Allow me to briefly touch on our Q1 results and outlook. Our comp performance in the quarter was disappointing. We continue to experience shortfalls on execution, driven by availability and service levels. From my perspective, as a new CEO coming to Advance, it's clear these challenges are within our control and can certainly be addressed. We've been outflanked on supply chain, outperformed on core productivity metrics and out-executed on customer service. As a result, our growth rate and profitability have been below that of our peers for several years. Recently, this is partly due to our focus on the CARQUEST integration. The integration has been a necessary but distracting agenda for our entire team. It's caused us to be internally focused versus externally focused. The sum of all of this resulted in continued challenges in Q1 with negative comp sales of down 1.9%.
While these results are unacceptable from our standpoint, the entire Advance team and I are excited by the areas where we see room for substantial improvement. We can and will make the necessary changes that will improve our value proposition and service levels for our customers. Clearly, we are not where we need to be in terms of competing at the highest levels to earn more trust from more customers to accelerate growth.
My team and I are in the midst of a deep dive on our business and current performance. While we still have work to do, we have a view of the challenges facing the business and where we fall in short. We've developed short-term action plans to address these challenges, and that begins with consistently meeting the needs of our customers. In fact, we're all very passionate about this. In order to return the company to a substantial growth trajectory, we must deliver improved bill rates, availability and in stock. In addition, we need to dramatically simplify the business and remove obstacles for our field teams so they can execute with excellence. These focused plans are now in motion. The reality is performance improvement won't happen overnight. Our Q1 comps were down primarily due to the internal challenges I outlined a moment ago, notably, our shortfalls with availability and service levels.
We also experienced accelerated declines on demand, particularly in our colder weather markets late in Q1, and that has continued into Q2. Based on this trend, we believe it's prudent to take a conservative approach and revise our assumption for annual comp sales to range between down 3% and down 5%. In addition, we're no longer targeting the 12% adjusted operating margin rate for 2016 that we've previously communicated. Make no mistake, we can and will do better. But we must be thoughtful regarding our expectations to ensure we set ourselves up for long-term growth and margin expansion. Right now, we're maniacally focused on what we can control, availability, customer service, productivity and performance. We're redoubling our efforts around accelerating growth, reducing costs and driving efficiencies throughout the organization. At the same time, we're confident in our business, our people and the opportunity that lies ahead. In fact, we see significant sales growth and operating margin expansion opportunities over time. We're going to be very disciplined about how we drive growth and profitability. I've tackled this kind of challenge more than once in the past, and I'm extremely confident this business can deliver operating margins well above 12% over time.
The reality is that achieving the target this year would prevent us from creating a platform we need to enable sustainable growth and operating leverage. For the balance of the year, we'll sharpen our focus on execution and ensure we're responding to customers by delivering the parts they want, where they want and when they want them. While it won't take place overnight, we're committed to making significant improvement on this critical metric.
In a few minutes, I'll highlight 3 overarching themes that will guide our path forward. Before I turn the call over to Mike for some brief comments on the quarter, I want to say a few words about the CFO transition we announced earlier today. First, I want to thank Mike for his 8 years of strong financial leadership during a time when the company more than doubled its market cap. Mike's played a key role in developing a strong finance team and building a capital structure to support our future growth. I'm very appreciative of Mike's willingness to support our transition with his leadership, passion and experience. We've commenced an external search for a new CFO and have agreed with Mike that he will stay on until a successor has joined and an orderly transition has taken place. We've not set a time frame to complete the search as it has just begun, but we'll move as expeditiously as possible to bring in the best person for the role.
With that, let me turn it over to Mike."

Before I get into my comments in the quarter, I want to say it has been an absolute pleasure to be part of the Advance team for the past 8 years. While I've decided that now is a good time to make a transition, I remain confident in the company's future and look forward to working with Tom and the rest of the team to ensure we have a smooth transition.
Now turning to the quarter. We delivered adjusted cash EPS of $2.51 for the first quarter, primarily driven by softer-than-expected sales.
Turning to sales. Overall, as Tom said, we were disappointed with our results as first quarter comparable store sales were down 1.9%. These declines were partially offset by positive growth and comp performance from WORLDPAC, CARQUEST Canada and from our store conversions and consolidations. As Tom touched on, top line performance reflected continued challenges with availability and lack of execution to improve service levels. We are intensely attacking these areas with urgency to make the needed improvements.
With regards to external factors, we saw a continuation of the milder winter weather that we experienced in Q4 that negatively impacted our sales with lower demand towards the end of the quarter as we experienced a late start to spring, primarily, in our colder weather markets where approximately 40% of our stores are located. Seasonal categories with the largest impact during the quarter was seen in batteries and hard parts categories, which were partially offset by continued strong results in our brake business across both commercial and DIY, which saw high single-digit growth during the quarter compared to mid-single-digit growth in the third and fourth quarters of 2015.
In our Commercial Business, the comp sales declines were more pronounced in our Northeast and Great Lake markets. The softness in seasonal category sales were partially offset by a modest increase in our commercial ticket size and the strength I noted in our brake business. We continue to expand our customer base with our national account business in TechNet, which partnered with independent repair shops also continuing to add new members in the quarter. Within DIY, we continue to see strong brake results, but that only partially offset softness in our battery and battery accessory as well as other seasonal categories.
Our gross profit rate decline of 58 basis points was primarily the result of supply chain expense deleverage due to the comparable store sales decline. Our first quarter adjusted SG&A rate decreased 100 basis points year-over-year, driven by our continued cost reduction initiatives and disciplined efforts to lower administrative and support cost, offset by fixed cost deleverage of our comparable store sales decline.
All in, first quarter adjusted EPS increased 5% compared to last year, and adjusted operating income increased approximately 2.2% to $315 million and adjusted operating margin increased 43 basis points over the same period last year to 10.6%. Operating cash flow for the first quarter was approximately $75.3 million versus $102.2 million last year, driven by a decrease in our AP ratio to 74.8% versus 76.5% last year. This decrease was principally driven by transitional inventory growth resulting from strategic investments and availability, the new WORLDPAC DC and lower-than-expected sales.
Our adjusted debt to EBITDAR was 2.5x at the end of the quarter, and we remain at our maximum stated leverage ratio of 2.5x. We are committed to maintaining a balanced and disciplined approach to capital allocation to drive shareholder value, while preserving our investment grade ratings.
Turning to the balance of the year. As Tom mentioned, we now estimate our annual comparable stores sales to be in the range of negative 3% to negative 5%. Our highest priority and focus is to accelerate our top line sales momentum. Despite deferring our 12% target, we remain committed to improving our profitability, which must be driven by sales growth, and also continuing to simplify our business and remove cost furthest away from our customer, allowing the organization to be more efficient and effective.
As outlined on our fourth quarter call, our integration activities this year are focused on 2 main areas: one, development and testing work to enable us to combine our AAP and CARQUEST supply chain and store systems into one network; and two, the continued execution of CARQUEST market conversion programs.
With that, let me turn it back to Tom."

I'd like to provide some perspective on the path forward based on what I've seen and heard over the past few weeks. There's 3 themes which come to mind as I reflect on this: appreciate the past, acknowledge the present and anticipate the future.
Let me start by appreciating the past. I spent considerable time with the people who've built this business over the years. These leaders have provided me with some timeless fundamental principles that remain true to this day.
The late Arthur Todman started Advance Auto Parts way back in the 1930s in the middle of the Great Depression. I've watched the videos and read speeches he delivered. He had a simple mantra: trust and listen to your customers and treat your employees like family. His son, Nick Todman, shared some of his perspective on Advance with me directly. Perhaps the most inspiring was when Nick told me the best part of the Advance Auto Parts story is ahead of us. Temple Sloan Jr. was way ahead of his time when he founded General Parts and, ultimately, CARQUEST. He decided to focus on the independence and major in the commercial parts business back in the 1970s. His son, Temple Sloan III, met with me recently and reinforced the key levers of success on the commercial side: making the right merchandising decisions; gaining acceptance and trust of commercial people in our stores, along with the owners and technicians they serve; and taking care of our people. Both Nick and Temple were maniacally focused on serving their customers and enabling their people.
I could not agree more with the advice I've received from Nick and from Temple. In addition, I'd like to personally thank the Todman and Sloan family for being so incredibly welcoming to me as I've assumed this responsibility. Others like Jim Wade, Garnet Smith and Darren Jackson could not have been more accessible and helpful in my onboarding.
I intend to keep the communication lines open with those who've built this business. While it's important to know where we've come from to intelligently plan for where we must go, it's also clear that we must be willing to continue to adapt and improve.
Turning to the present. Make no mistake, I entered this role with eyes wide open and an expectation that there were going to be many areas for improvement. As such, I'm going to call it as I see it. There are many areas that need attention and have substantial room for improvement. That's what got me excited about this opportunity. And I believe that our near-term challenges provide an even greater mandate to materially improve the business operations. We're in the midst of a deep dive on operational diagnostics and areas for improvement. Over the next few months, we'll be highly engaged in a thorough assessment of our business and current opportunities. My intention is to come back to you later this year with our long-term vision for the company, along with specific goals and strategic imperatives necessary to achieve our vision. We're very hard at work. We need to understand precisely what's working, what's not working and the lessons learned surrounding our performance over the past few years. In the short term, we'll ensure all of our team members are taking actions that propel our business forward. With an appreciation for the past and an acknowledgment of the present, our focus is on anticipating the future and the role Advance will play in shaping our industry and delivering results going forward.
Allow me to reinforce [ph]. We have a tremendous opportunity to create value at Advance, much more than I envisioned when I joined the company. Over the coming weeks, we'll construct a multi-year strategic business plan to get after our biggest opportunities. This process is well underway, and I already know one thing, our framework will contain 3 primary chapters: first, growth. We'll develop a demand-based growth strategy that puts the focus squarely on customers and getting the right parts to the right places at the right time, predictably, reliably and consistently.
Secondly, productivity. We'll instill a relentless focus on productivity, while ensuring that we build new capabilities as we reduce waste and cost in our system. We'll reinvest some of these cost savings in future growth, with much of the savings also dropping to the bottom line.
People and culture. Our people strategy will support our business strategy and foster a diverse culture which mirrors the market and empowers our people to win in the marketplace every day in every way.
Allow me to provide a little more detail. On growth, everything we do starts and stops with the customer. We're going to make certain we understand precisely what's important to commercial customers and to DIY customers. To improve our customer service, we need to elevate our operating intensity and customer responsiveness. We also need to increase the pace at which we make decisions and execute them. Bottom line, we need to become much more externally focused. And in doing so, we'll get the right part to the right customer faster and more efficiently.
This leads to my second point around improving productivity. Our relentless focus on productivity necessitates establishing a clearly-defined productivity pipeline that will reduce cost and remove waste, while building new capabilities. This pipeline will be built around investing in those tasks that matter most in meeting customer needs and eliminating those that do not. We'll also focus on a thorough assessment of our DC network, fleet, procurement, store productivity and zero-based budgeting. Productivity will be the engine that fuels our growth.
Finally, nothing is more important than mobilizing our team members across all of Advance. We have an incredibly talented and committed team across the country, and we must listen to them, much more than we have, empower them to act and provide them with the tools and technology they need to win in the marketplace. Our team members, who are closest to the customers, know them best. When we empower them and provide them the right tools, they can make decisions that improve execution and drive sales. We're a company comprised of 5,200 hyperlocal businesses in any given market. We're only as good as the talented district managers, general managers, commercial parts pros and commercial account managers and the rest of our team members in each market that help serve our customers every day. We intend to meet the needs of our local teams in delivering for their customers. Our field teams have told us that Advance has been too reliant on the store support center to make decisions and instill processes. We're listening. George and the rest of the Advance team are implementing a much more field-centric organization, where our team members are empowered to make decisions and held accountable for their actions. I know this, by itself, will expedite our transition as we provide local leaders the tools, training and technology required to succeed and win in the marketplace.
In closing, I'm humbled and honored to lead this great organization. We have a strong foundation upon which to build, to grow and to thrive in a terrific industry. We're in the early days of developing and implementing a disciplined and comprehensive path forward and you'll see more later this summer. Until then, our organization remains focused on delivering near-term commitments and business initiatives. Without a doubt, we have a lot of work to do. At the same time, I have tremendous confidence that, over time, we'll deliver superior execution for our customers, an outstanding environment for our people, and ultimately, we'll drive increased profitability and shareholder value.
Before we open it up to questions, I'd like to take a minute to thank all of our team members for building this business to what it is today. I'm excited to work together with my new team to help Advance reach its full potential. With that, let's open up the call for questions. Operator?"

I will say that, and George has been addressing this over the last several months, we've got to a point where the center is making many more decisions than we feel is appropriate. I think the biggest contrast would be the frontline organization at Frito-Lay, the frontline organization here is essentially how we drive our business. If the frontline is delivering out there in the marketplace, we're going to win every day. I would say that at Frito-Lay, we do engage and allow the frontline to make more decisions than they do here, and that's why George has evolved this model to more of a field-centric or more customer-centric model. I think that's the biggest difference. And I think over time, we can certainly address that. We've got great field leaders. We have no lack of talent out there, so we got to remove obstacles for them to compete and win in the marketplace, and we're very, very focused against that."

We're really pleased with the progress we're making on cost, and we're going to continue to look at cost to make ourselves more efficient and simplify the business. So those are things we can control. The challenge we have when we don't have the top line cooking is we've got a pretty high fixed cost model. And when you have a high fixed cost model, when the sales come in softer, you just deleverage. So I think those 2 work together. You get the top line going again, and we expect us to see better leverage on the bottom line. But -- and the other fact is while we're going to continue to take costs out, there is going to be some reinvestment required. As we look at this different parts of the business and reigniting our sales base, so there'll be a balance there, but I think the primary focus is getting sales going.

Tom has talked about that on this call in his remarks, so that's the first one. The second one is managing our working capital. That's the second big driver in this industry, as you know. And you saw our inventory grew higher than we would have anticipated in the first quarter. The 3 big drivers around that were: one, WORLDPAC was -- their inventory was up, I want to say, close to 11%, because we're opening a DC. So that one, we're going to continue to do. The other big driver is the CARQUEST inventory was up quite a bit as we invest in availability in that business. It was starved prior, and we did a lot of investments last year. So we're going to continue to invest in inventory, but we anticipate by the end of the year, the inventory growth is probably at low single digits versus where it was, and the other big driver was we delivered lower sales. So -- and so that drove the inventory up. So we're going to be focused on improving our earnings and improving our working capital, and that's what we're going to be focused on. And then, in relation to the deployment of capital, as you know, first and foremost, getting the earnings going, that's first. And then as we think about that, as we think about buyback, maintaining our leverage ratio was important to us. So we maintained our investment grade ratings. That's a priority. And then after we've done that, we've done a great job paying down our debt, which gives us the flexibility to allocate capital to investing in the business or doing share buyback. We currently have $415 million and are hoping to buy -- for a buyback."

Since I walked in the door on April 11, I've been working very closely with the leadership team. Importantly, I spent most of my time out in the field, speaking with customers and team members, to get a deeper understanding of our capabilities, challenges and opportunities. I've been in my role for just over a month, so admittedly, it's very early.
Having said that, based on what I've seen so far, and what you saw in today's earnings release, it's clear, we're facing real challenges. The good news is I have tremendous confidence that we have an extraordinary opportunity to create value going forward, even more than I thought before I joined the company.
On today's call, I'll share my initial observations on the business and the quarter. Then I'll turn the call over to Mike to address first quarter performance before coming back to discuss the overarching themes that will guide our path forward. We'll leave plenty of time at the end for questions.
Allow me to start with a bit of context on why I decided to join Advance. I wasn't looking for just any CEO position as I transitioned from a great role in another great company, I was looking for a CEO position in a company with scale, a company in a growing industry and a company filled with potential, a company with a terrific opportunity where I could help dramatically improve performance and value. Without question, Advance hits on each of these objectives.
First, scale. Not only is Advance a large company based on revenue and market cap, we also have over 70,000 team members and a comprehensive North American footprint. Over the past few weeks, I've been consistently impressed by the quality and commitment of our field team in both our store support center and in the field. Given this context, Advance provides the opportunity for me to do what I enjoy most, lead a large team and put tremendous focus on meeting the needs of our customers, engage directly with team members to develop and execute plans to meet those needs and, ultimately, to drive financial and marketplace performance as well as shareholder value.
Secondly, growing. We operate in a very large and attractive $100 billion-plus industry with strong growth rates. Candidly, there are very few industries that offer the compelling growth rates that exist in our space.
And finally, filled with potential. As many analysts have delineated, Advance has enormous upside potential. In particular, we have a tremendous opportunity to improve our customer service and competitiveness in the marketplace to accelerate growth. In addition, I know we can drive significant productivity and capability improvements in our supply chain and throughout Advance. And without question, we can do a better job of attracting, developing and retaining talent in our company. Each of these by themselves will contribute upside in our performance. Together, in the context of a large and growing industry, they'll generate meaningful value for shareholders. The past several weeks have fully validated the perspective I had as I was considering the opportunity. There's no question, we have work to do. But it's clear, the board and my leadership team are prepared to take decisive actions on a number of fronts to create real value for shareholders over time.
Allow me to briefly touch on our Q1 results and outlook. Our comp performance in the quarter was disappointing. We continue to experience shortfalls on execution, driven by availability and service levels. From my perspective, as a new CEO coming to Advance, it's clear these challenges are within our control and can certainly be addressed. We've been outflanked on supply chain, outperformed on core productivity metrics and out-executed on customer service. As a result, our growth rate and profitability have been below that of our peers for several years. Recently, this is partly due to our focus on the CARQUEST integration. The integration has been a necessary but distracting agenda for our entire team. It's caused us to be internally focused versus externally focused. The sum of all of this resulted in continued challenges in Q1 with negative comp sales of down 1.9%.
While these results are unacceptable from our standpoint, the entire Advance team and I are excited by the areas where we see room for substantial improvement. We can and will make the necessary changes that will improve our value proposition and service levels for our customers. Clearly, we are not where we need to be in terms of competing at the highest level to earn more trust from more customers to accelerate growth.
My team and I are in the midst of a deep dive on our business and current performance. While we still have work to do, we have a view of the challenges facing the business and where we fall in short. We've developed short-term action plans to address these challenges, and that begins with consistently meeting the needs of our customers. In fact, we're all very passionate about this. In order to return the company to a substantial growth trajectory, we must deliver improved fill rates, availability and in-stock. In addition, we need to dramatically simplify the business and remove obstacles for our field teams so they can execute with excellence. These focused plans are now in motion. The reality is performance improvement won't happen overnight. Our Q1 comps were down primarily due to the internal challenges I outlined a moment ago, notably, our shortfalls with availability and service levels.
We also experienced accelerated declines on demand, particularly in our colder weather markets late in Q1, and that has continued into Q2. Based on this trend, we believe it's prudent to take a conservative approach and revise our assumption for annual comp sales to range between down 3% and down 5%. In addition, we're no longer targeting the 12% adjusted operating margin rate for 2016 that we've previously communicated. Make no mistake, we can and will do better. But we must be thoughtful regarding our expectations to ensure we set ourselves up for long-term growth and margin expansion. Right now, we're maniacally focused on what we can control, availability, customer service, productivity and performance. We're redoubling our efforts around accelerating growth, reducing cost and driving efficiencies throughout the organization. At the same time, we're confident in our business, our people and the opportunity that lies ahead. In fact, we see significant sales growth and operating margin expansion opportunities over time. We're going to be very disciplined about how we drive growth and profitability. I've tackled this kind of challenge more than once in the past, and I'm extremely confident this business can deliver operating margins well above 12% over time.
The reality is that achieving the target this year would prevent us from creating the platform we need to enable sustainable growth and operating leverage. For the balance of the year, we'll sharpen our focus on execution and ensure we're responding to customers by delivering the parts they want, where they want and when they want them. While it won't take place overnight, we're committed to making significant improvement on this critical metric.
In a few minutes, I'll highlight 3 overarching themes that will guide our path forward. Before I turn the call over to Mike for some brief comments on the quarter, I want to say a few words about the CFO transition we announced earlier today. First, I want to thank Mike for his 8 years of strong financial leadership during a time when the company more than doubled its market cap. Mike has played a key role in developing a strong finance team and building a capital structure to support our future growth. I'm very appreciative of Mike's willingness to support our transition with his leadership, passion and experience. We've commenced an external search for a new CFO and have agreed with Mike that he will stay on until a successor has joined and an orderly transition has taken place. We've not set a time frame to complete the search as it has just begun, but we'll move as expeditiously as possible to bring in the best person for the role.
With that, let me turn it over to Mike."

Before I get into my comments on the quarter, I want to say it has been an absolute pleasure to be part of the Advance team for the past 8 years. While I've decided that now is a good time to make a transition, I remain confident in the company's future and look forward to working with Tom and the rest of the team to ensure we have a smooth transition.
Now turning to the quarter. We delivered adjusted cash EPS of $2.51 for the first quarter, primarily driven by softer-than-expected sales.
Turning to sales. Overall, as Tom said, we were disappointed with our results as first quarter comparable store sales were down 1.9%. These declines were partially offset by positive growth and comp performance from WORLDPAC, CARQUEST Canada and from our store conversions and consolidations. As Tom touched on, top line performance reflected continued challenges with availability and lack of execution to improve service levels. We are intensely attacking these areas with urgency to make the needed improvements.
With regards to external factors, we saw a continuation of the milder winter weather that we experienced in Q4 that negatively impacted our sales with lower demand towards the end of the quarter as we experienced a late start to spring, primarily, in our colder weather markets where approximately 40% of our stores are located. Seasonal categories with the largest impact during the quarter was seen in batteries and hard parts categories, which were partially offset by continued strong results in our brake business across both commercial and DIY, which saw high single-digit growth during the quarter compared to mid-single-digit growth in the third and fourth quarters of 2015.
In our Commercial Business, the comp sales declines were more pronounced in our Northeast and Great Lakes markets. The softness in seasonal category sales were partially offset by a modest increase in our commercial ticket size and the strength I noted in our brake business. We continue to expand our customer base with our national account business in TechNet, which partners with independent repair shops, also continuing to add new members in the quarter. Within DIY, we continue to see strong brake results, but that only partially offset softness in our battery and battery accessory, as well as other seasonal categories.
Our gross profit rate decline of 58 basis points was primarily the result of supply chain expense deleverage due to the comparable store sales decline. Our first quarter adjusted SG&A rate decreased 100 basis points year-over-year, driven by our continued cost reduction initiatives and disciplined efforts to lower administrative and support costs, offset by fixed-cost deleverage of our comparable store sales decline.
All in, first quarter adjusted EPS increased 5% compared to last year, and adjusted operating income increased approximately 2.2% to $315 million and adjusted operating margin increased 43 basis points over the same period last year to 10.6%. Operating cash flow for the first quarter was approximately $75.3 million versus $102.2 million last year, driven by a decrease in our AP ratio to 74.8% versus 76.5% last year. This decrease was principally driven by transitional inventory growth resulting from strategic investments and availability, the new WORLDPAC DC and lower-than-expected sales.
Our adjusted debt to EBITDAR was 2.5x at the end of the quarter, and we remain at our maximum stated leverage ratio of 2.5x. We are committed to maintaining a balanced and disciplined approach to capital allocation to drive shareholder value, while preserving our investment grade ratings.
Turning to the balance of the year. As Tom mentioned, we now estimate our annual comparable stores sales to be in the range of negative 3% to negative 5%. Our highest priority and focus is to accelerate our top line sales momentum. Despite deferring our 12% target, we remain committed to improving our profitability, which must be driven by sales growth, and also continuing to simplify our business and remove costs furthest away from our customer, allowing the organization to be more efficient and effective.
As outlined on our fourth quarter call, our integration activities this year are focused on 2 main areas: one, development and testing work to enable us to combine our AAP and CARQUEST supply chain and store systems into one network; and two, the continued execution of CARQUEST market conversion programs.
With that, let me turn it back to Tom."

I'd like to provide some perspective on the path forward based on what I've seen and heard over the past few weeks. There's 3 themes which come to mind as I reflect on this: appreciate the past, acknowledge the present and anticipate the future.
Let me start by appreciating the past. I've spent considerable time with the people who built this business over the years. These leaders have provided me with some timeless fundamental principles that remain true to this day.
The late Arthur Todman started Advance Auto Parts way back in the 1930s in the middle of the Great Depression. I've watched videos and read speeches he delivered. He had a simple mantra: trust and listen to your customers and treat your employees like family. His son, Nick Todman, shared some of his perspective on Advance with me directly. Perhaps the most inspiring was when Nick told me the best part of the Advance Auto Parts story is ahead of us. Temple Sloan Jr. was way ahead of his time when he founded General Parts and, ultimately, CARQUEST. He decided to focus on the independents and major in the commercial parts business back in the 1970s. His son, Temple Sloan III, met with me recently and reinforced the key levers of success on the commercial side: making the right merchandising decisions; gaining acceptance and trust of commercial people in our stores, along with the owners and technicians they serve; and taking care of our people. Both Nick and Temple were maniacally focused on serving their customers and enabling their people.
I could not agree more with the advice I've received from Nick and from Temple. In addition, I'd like to personally thank the Todman and Sloan family for being so incredibly welcoming to me as I've assumed this responsibility. Others like Jim Wade, Garnet Smith and Darren Jackson could not have been more accessible and helpful in my onboarding.
I intend to keep the communication lines open with those who've built this business. While it's important to know where we've come from to intelligently plan for where we must go, it's also clear that we must be willing to continue to adapt and improve.
Turning to the present. Make no mistake, I entered this role with eyes wide open and an expectation that there were going to be many areas for improvement. As such, I'm going to call it as I see it. There are many areas that need attention and have substantial room for improvement. That's what got me excited about this opportunity. And I believe that our near-term challenges provide an even greater mandate to materially improve the business operations. We're in the midst of a deep dive on operational diagnostics and areas for improvement. Over the next few months, we'll be highly engaged in a thorough assessment of our business and current opportunities. My intention is to come back to you later this year with our long-term vision for the company, along with specific goals and strategic imperatives necessary to achieve our vision. We're very hard at work. We need to understand precisely what's working, what's not working and the lessons learned surrounding our performance over the past few years. In the short term, we'll ensure all of our team members are taking actions that propel our business forward. With an appreciation for the past and an acknowledgment of the present, our focus is on anticipating the future and the role Advance will play in shaping our industry and delivering results going forward.
Allow me to reinforce [ph]. We have a tremendous opportunity to create value at Advance, much more than I envisioned when I joined the company. Over the coming weeks, we'll construct a multi-year strategic business plan to get after our biggest opportunities. This process is well underway, and I already know one thing, our framework will contain 3 primary chapters: first, growth. We'll develop a demand-based growth strategy that puts the focus squarely on customers and getting the right parts to the right places at the right time, predictably, reliably and consistently.
Secondly, productivity. We'll instill a relentless focus on productivity, while ensuring that we build new capabilities as we reduce waste and cost in our system. We'll reinvest some of these cost savings in future growth, with much of the savings also dropping to the bottom line.
People and culture. Our people strategy will support our business strategy and foster a diverse culture which mirrors the market and empowers our people to win in the marketplace every day in every way.
Allow me to provide a little more detail. On growth, everything we do starts and stops with the customer. We're going to make certain we understand precisely what's important to commercial customers and to DIY customers. To improve our customer service, we need to elevate our operating intensity and customer responsiveness. We also need to increase the pace at which we make decisions and execute them. Bottom line, we need to become much more externally focused. And in doing so, we'll get the right part to the right customer faster and more efficiently.
This leads to my second point around improving productivity. Our relentless focus on productivity necessitates establishing a clearly-defined productivity pipeline that will reduce cost and remove waste, while building new capabilities. This pipeline will be built around investing in those tasks that matter most in meeting customer needs and eliminating those that do not. We'll also focus on a thorough assessment of our DC network, fleet, procurement, store productivity and zero-based budgeting. Productivity will be the engine that fuels our growth.
Finally, nothing is more important than mobilizing our team members across all of Advance. We have an incredibly talented and committed team across the country, and we must listen to them, much more than we have, empower them to act and provide them with the tools and technology they need to win in the marketplace. Our team members, who are closest to the customers, know them best. When we empower them and provide them the right tools, they can make decisions that improve execution and drive sales. We're a company comprised of 5,200 hyper-local businesses in any given market. We're only as good as the talented district managers, general managers, commercial parts pros and commercial account managers and the rest of our team members in each market that help serve our customers every day. We intend to meet the needs of our local teams in delivering for their customers. Our field teams have told us that Advance has been too reliant on the store support center to make decisions and instill processes. We're listening. George and the rest of the Advance team are implementing a much more field-centric organization, where our team members are empowered to make decisions and held accountable for their actions. I know this, by itself, will expedite our transition as we provide local leaders the tools, training and technology required to succeed and win in the marketplace.
In closing, I'm humbled and honored to lead this great organization. We have a strong foundation upon which to build, to grow and to thrive in a terrific industry. We're in the early days of developing and implementing a disciplined and comprehensive path forward and you'll see more later this summer. Until then, our organization remains focused on delivering near-term commitments and business initiatives. Without a doubt, we have a lot of work to do. At the same time, I have tremendous confidence that, over time, we'll deliver superior execution for our customers, an outstanding environment for our people, and ultimately, we'll drive increased profitability and shareholder value.
Before we open it up to questions, I'd like to take a minute to thank all of our team members for building this business to what it is today. I'm excited to work together with my new team to help Advance reach its full potential. With that, let's open up the call for questions. Operator?"

I will say that, and George has been addressing this over the last several months, we've got to a point where the center is making many more decisions than we feel is appropriate. I think the biggest contrast would be the frontline organization at Frito-Lay, the frontline organization here is essentially how we drive our business. If the frontline is delivering out there in the marketplace, we're going to win every day. I would say that at Frito-Lay, we do engage and allow the frontline to make more decisions than they do here, and that's why George has evolved this model to more of a field-centric or more customer-centric model. I think that's the biggest difference. And I think over time, we can certainly address that. We've got great field leaders. We have no lack of talent out there, but we've got to remove obstacles for them to compete and win in the marketplace, and we're very, very focused against that."

We're really pleased with the progress we're making on cost, and we're going to continue to look at cost to make ourselves more efficient and simplify the business. So those are things we can control. The challenge we have when we don't have at the top line clicking in is we've got a pretty high fixed-cost model. And when you have a high fixed-cost model, when the sales come in softer, you just deleverage. So I think those 2 work together. You get the top line going again, and we expect to see better leverage on the bottom line. But -- and the other fact is while we're going to continue to take cost out, there is going to be some reinvestment required. As we look at this different parts of the business and reigniting our sales base, so there'll be a balance there, but I think the primary focus is getting sales going.

Tom has talked about that on this call in his remarks, so that's the first one. The second one is managing our working capital. That's the second big driver in this industry, as you know. And you saw our inventory grew higher than we would have anticipated in the first quarter. The 3 big drivers around that were: one, WORLDPAC was -- their inventory was up, I want to say, close to 11%, because we're opening a DC. So that one, we're going to continue to do. The other big driver is the CARQUEST inventory was up quite a bit as we invest in availability in that business. It was starved prior, and we did a lot of investments last year. So we're going to continue to invest in inventory, but we anticipate by the end of the year, the inventory growth is probably up low single digits versus where it was, and the other big driver was we delivered lower sales. So -- and so that drove the inventory up. So we're going to be focused on improving our earnings and improving our working capital, and that's what we're going to be focused on. And then, in relation to the deployment of capital, as you know, first and foremost, getting the earnings going, that's first. And then as we think about that, as we think about buyback, maintaining our leverage ratio is important to us, so we maintain our investment grade ratings. That's a priority. And then after we've done that -- we've done a great job paying down our debt, which gives us the flexibility to allocate capital to investing in the business or doing share buyback. We currently have $415 million and are hoping to buy -- for a buyback."

We've kicked off the work, and we're going to take a very close look at how we get a lot better at the execution side, but it is going to require a very deep dive on where we think the future of this industry is headed, where we think demand is going, which geographies are going to grow faster than others and integrating that into the supply chain strategy itself."

Since I walked in the door on April 11, I've been working very closely with the leadership team. Importantly, I spent most of my time out in the field, speaking with customers and team members, to get a deeper understanding of our capabilities, challenges and opportunities. I've been in my role for just over a month, so admittedly, it's very early.
Having said that, based on what I've seen so far, and what you saw in today's earnings release, it's clear, we're facing real challenges. The good news is I have tremendous confidence that we have an extraordinary opportunity to create value going forward, even more than I thought before I joined the company.
On today's call, I'll share my initial observations on the business and the quarter. Then I'll turn the call over to Mike to address first quarter performance before coming back to discuss the overarching themes that will guide our path forward. We'll leave plenty of time at the end for questions.
Allow me to start with a bit of context on why I decided to join Advance. I wasn't looking for just any CEO position as I transitioned from a great role in another great company, I was looking for a CEO position in a company with scale, a company in a growing industry and a company filled with potential, a company with a terrific opportunity where I could help dramatically improve performance and value. Without question, Advance hits on each of these objectives.
First, scale. Not only is Advance a large company based on revenue and market cap, we also have over 70,000 team members and a comprehensive North American footprint. Over the past few weeks, I've been consistently impressed by the quality and commitment of our field team in both our store support center and in the field. Given this context, Advance provides the opportunity for me to do what I enjoy most, lead a large team and put tremendous focus on meeting the needs of our customers, engage directly with team members to develop and execute plans to meet those needs and, ultimately, to drive financial and marketplace performance as well as shareholder value.
Secondly, growing. We operate in a very large and attractive $100 billion-plus industry with strong growth rates. Candidly, there are very few industries that offer the compelling growth rates that exist in our space.
And finally, filled with potential. As many analysts have delineated, Advance has enormous upside potential. In particular, we have a tremendous opportunity to improve our customer service and competitiveness in the marketplace to accelerate growth. In addition, I know we can drive significant productivity and capability improvements in our supply chain and throughout Advance. And without question, we can do a better job of attracting, developing and retaining talent in our company. Each of these by themselves will contribute upside in our performance. Together, in the context of a large and growing industry, they'll generate meaningful value for shareholders. The past several weeks have fully validated the perspective I had as I was considering the opportunity. There's no question, we have work to do. But it's clear, the board and my leadership team are prepared to take decisive actions on a number of fronts to create real value for shareholders over time.
Allow me to briefly touch on our Q1 results and outlook. Our comp performance in the quarter was disappointing. We continue to experience shortfalls on execution, driven by availability and service levels. From my perspective, as a new CEO coming to Advance, it's clear these challenges are within our control and can certainly be addressed. We've been outflanked on supply chain, outperformed on core productivity metrics and out-executed on customer service. As a result, our growth rate and profitability have been below that of our peers for several years. Recently, this is partly due to our focus on the CARQUEST integration. The integration has been a necessary but distracting agenda for our entire team. It's caused us to be internally focused versus externally focused. The sum of all of this resulted in continued challenges in Q1 with negative comp sales of down 1.9%.
While these results are unacceptable from our standpoint, the entire Advance team and I are excited by the areas where we see room for substantial improvement. We can and will make the necessary changes that will improve our value proposition and service levels for our customers. Clearly, we are not where we need to be in terms of competing at the highest level to earn more trust from more customers to accelerate growth.
My team and I are in the midst of a deep dive on our business and current performance. While we still have work to do, we have a view of the challenges facing the business and where we fall in short. We've developed short-term action plans to address these challenges, and that begins with consistently meeting the needs of our customers. In fact, we're all very passionate about this. In order to return the company to a substantial growth trajectory, we must deliver improved fill rates, availability and in-stock. In addition, we need to dramatically simplify the business and remove obstacles for our field teams so they can execute with excellence. These focused plans are now in motion. The reality is performance improvement won't happen overnight. Our Q1 comps were down primarily due to the internal challenges I outlined a moment ago, notably, our shortfalls with availability and service levels.
We also experienced accelerated declines on demand, particularly in our colder weather markets late in Q1, and that has continued into Q2. Based on this trend, we believe it's prudent to take a conservative approach and revise our assumption for annual comp sales to range between down 3% and down 5%. In addition, we're no longer targeting the 12% adjusted operating margin rate for 2016 that we've previously communicated. Make no mistake, we can and will do better. But we must be thoughtful regarding our expectations to ensure we set ourselves up for long-term growth and margin expansion. Right now, we're maniacally focused on what we can control, availability, customer service, productivity and performance. We're redoubling our efforts around accelerating growth, reducing cost and driving efficiencies throughout the organization. At the same time, we're confident in our business, our people and the opportunity that lies ahead. In fact, we see significant sales growth and operating margin expansion opportunities over time. We're going to be very disciplined about how we drive growth and profitability. I've tackled this kind of challenge more than once in the past, and I'm extremely confident this business can deliver operating margins well above 12% over time.
The reality is that achieving the target this year would prevent us from creating the platform we need to enable sustainable growth and operating leverage. For the balance of the year, we'll sharpen our focus on execution and ensure we're responding to customers by delivering the parts they want, where they want and when they want them. While it won't take place overnight, we're committed to making significant improvement on this critical metric.
In a few minutes, I'll highlight 3 overarching themes that will guide our path forward. Before I turn the call over to Mike for some brief comments on the quarter, I want to say a few words about the CFO transition we announced earlier today. First, I want to thank Mike for his 8 years of strong financial leadership during a time when the company more than doubled its market cap. Mike has played a key role in developing a strong finance team and building a capital structure to support our future growth. I'm very appreciative of Mike's willingness to support our transition with his leadership, passion and experience. We've commenced an external search for a new CFO and have agreed with Mike that he will stay on until a successor has joined and an orderly transition has taken place. We've not set a time frame to complete the search as it has just begun, but we'll move as expeditiously as possible to bring in the best person for the role.
With that, let me turn it over to Mike."

Before I get into my comments on the quarter, I want to say it has been an absolute pleasure to be part of the Advance team for the past 8 years. While I've decided that now is a good time to make a transition, I remain confident in the company's future and look forward to working with Tom and the rest of the team to ensure we have a smooth transition.
Now turning to the quarter. We delivered adjusted cash EPS of $2.51 for the first quarter, primarily driven by softer-than-expected sales.
Turning to sales. Overall, as Tom said, we were disappointed with our results as first quarter comparable store sales were down 1.9%. These declines were partially offset by positive growth and comp performance from WORLDPAC, CARQUEST Canada and from our store conversions and consolidations. As Tom touched on, top line performance reflected continued challenges with availability and lack of execution to improve service levels. We are intensely attacking these areas with urgency to make the needed improvements.
With regards to external factors, we saw a continuation of the milder winter weather that we experienced in Q4 that negatively impacted our sales with lower demand towards the end of the quarter as we experienced a late start to spring, primarily, in our colder weather markets where approximately 40% of our stores are located. Seasonal categories with the largest impact during the quarter was seen in batteries and hard parts categories, which were partially offset by continued strong results in our brake business across both commercial and DIY, which saw high single-digit growth during the quarter compared to mid-single-digit growth in the third and fourth quarters of 2015.
In our Commercial Business, the comp sales declines were more pronounced in our Northeast and Great Lakes markets. The softness in seasonal category sales were partially offset by a modest increase in our commercial ticket size and the strength I noted in our brake business. We continue to expand our customer base with our national account business in TechNet, which partners with independent repair shops, also continuing to add new members in the quarter. Within DIY, we continue to see strong brake results, but that only partially offset softness in our battery and battery accessory as well as other seasonal categories.
Our gross profit rate decline of 58 basis points was primarily the result of supply chain expense deleverage due to the comparable store sales decline. Our first quarter adjusted SG&A rate decreased 100 basis points year-over-year, driven by our continued cost reduction initiatives and disciplined efforts to lower administrative and support costs, offset by fixed cost deleverage of our comparable store sales decline.
All in, first quarter adjusted EPS increased 5% compared to last year, and adjusted operating income increased approximately 2.2% to $315 million and adjusted operating margin increased 43 basis points over the same period last year to 10.6%. Operating cash flow for the first quarter was approximately $75.3 million versus $102.2 million last year, driven by a decrease in our AP ratio to 74.8% versus 76.5% last year. This decrease was principally driven by transitional inventory growth resulting from strategic investments and availability, the new WORLDPAC DC and lower-than-expected sales.
Our adjusted debt to EBITDAR was 2.5x at the end of the quarter, and we remain at our maximum stated leverage ratio of 2.5x. We are committed to maintaining a balanced and disciplined approach to capital allocation to drive shareholder value, while preserving our investment grade ratings.
Turning to the balance of the year. As Tom mentioned, we now estimate our annual comparable stores sales to be in the range of negative 3% to negative 5%. Our highest priority and focus is to accelerate our top line sales momentum. Despite deferring our 12% target, we remain committed to improving our profitability, which must be driven by sales growth, and also continuing to simplify our business and remove costs furthest away from our customer, allowing the organization to be more efficient and effective.
As outlined on our fourth quarter call, our integration activities this year are focused on 2 main areas: one, development and testing work to enable us to combine our AAP and CARQUEST supply chain and store systems into one network; and two, the continued execution of CARQUEST market conversion programs.
With that, let me turn it back to Tom."

I'd like to provide some perspective on the path forward based on what I've seen and heard over the past few weeks. There's 3 themes which come to mind as I reflect on this: appreciate the past, acknowledge the present and anticipate the future.
Let me start by appreciating the past. I've spent considerable time with the people who built this business over the years. These leaders have provided me with some timeless fundamental principles that remain true to this day.
The late Arthur Todman started Advance Auto Parts way back in the 1930s in the middle of the Great Depression. I've watched videos and read speeches he delivered. He had a simple mantra: trust and listen to your customers and treat your employees like family. His son, Nick Todman, shared some of his perspective on Advance with me directly. Perhaps the most inspiring was when Nick told me the best part of the Advance Auto Parts story is ahead of us. Temple Sloan Jr. was way ahead of his time when he founded General Parts and, ultimately, CARQUEST. He decided to focus on the independents and major in the commercial parts business back in the 1970s. His son, Temple Sloan III, met with me recently and reinforced the key levers of success on the commercial side: making the right merchandising decisions; gaining acceptance and trust of commercial people in our stores, along with the owners and technicians they serve; and taking care of our people. Both Nick and Temple were maniacally focused on serving their customers and enabling their people.
I could not agree more with the advice I've received from Nick and from Temple. In addition, I'd like to personally thank the Todman and Sloan family for being so incredibly welcoming to me as I've assumed this responsibility. Others like Jim Wade, Garnet Smith and Darren Jackson could not have been more accessible and helpful in my onboarding.
I intend to keep the communication lines open with those who've built this business. While it's important to know where we've come from to intelligently plan for where we must go, it's also clear that we must be willing to continue to adapt and improve.
Turning to the present. Make no mistake, I entered this role with eyes wide open and an expectation that there were going to be many areas for improvement. As such, I'm going to call it as I see it. There are many areas that need attention and have substantial room for improvement. That's what got me excited about this opportunity. And I believe that our near-term challenges provide an even greater mandate to materially improve the business operations. We're in the midst of a deep dive on operational diagnostics and areas for improvement. Over the next few months, we'll be highly engaged in a thorough assessment of our business and current opportunities. My intention is to come back to you later this year with our long-term vision for the company, along with specific goals and strategic imperatives necessary to achieve our vision. We're very hard at work. We need to understand precisely what's working, what's not working and the lessons learned surrounding our performance over the past few years. In the short term, we'll ensure all of our team members are taking actions that propel our business forward. With an appreciation for the past and an acknowledgment of the present, our focus is on anticipating the future and the role Advance will play in shaping our industry and delivering results going forward.
Allow me to reinforce [ph]. We have a tremendous opportunity to create value at Advance, much more than I envisioned when I joined the company. Over the coming weeks, we'll construct a multi-year strategic business plan to get after our biggest opportunities. This process is well underway, and I already know one thing, our framework will contain 3 primary chapters: first, growth. We'll develop a demand-based growth strategy that puts the focus squarely on customers and getting the right parts to the right places at the right time, predictably, reliably and consistently.
Secondly, productivity. We'll instill a relentless focus on productivity, while ensuring that we build new capabilities as we reduce waste and cost in our system. We'll reinvest some of these cost savings in future growth, with much of the savings also dropping to the bottom line.
People and culture. Our people strategy will support our business strategy and foster a diverse culture which mirrors the market and empowers our people to win in the marketplace every day in every way.
Allow me to provide a little more detail. On growth, everything we do starts and stops with the customer. We're going to make certain we understand precisely what's important to commercial customers and to DIY customers. To improve our customer service, we need to elevate our operating intensity and customer responsiveness. We also need to increase the pace at which we make decisions and execute them. Bottom line, we need to become much more externally focused. And in doing so, we'll get the right part to the right customer faster and more efficiently.
This leads to my second point around improving productivity. Our relentless focus on productivity necessitates establishing a clearly-defined productivity pipeline that will reduce cost and remove waste, while building new capabilities. This pipeline will be built around investing in those tasks that matter most in meeting customer needs and eliminating those that do not. We'll also focus on a thorough assessment of our DC network, fleet, procurement, store productivity and zero-based budgeting. Productivity will be the engine that fuels our growth.
Finally, nothing is more important than mobilizing our team members across all of Advance. We have an incredibly talented and committed team across the country, and we must listen to them, much more than we have, empower them to act and provide them with the tools and technology they need to win in the marketplace. Our team members, who are closest to the customers, know them best. When we empower them and provide them the right tools, they can make decisions that improve execution and drive sales. We're a company comprised of 5,200 hyper-local businesses in any given market. We're only as good as the talented district managers, general managers, commercial parts pros and commercial account managers and the rest of our team members in each market that help serve our customers every day. We intend to meet the needs of our local teams in delivering for their customers. Our field teams have told us that Advance has been too reliant on the store support center to make decisions and instill processes. We're listening. George and the rest of the Advance team are implementing a much more field-centric organization, where our team members are empowered to make decisions and held accountable for their actions. I know this, by itself, will expedite our transition as we provide local leaders the tools, training and technology required to succeed and win in the marketplace.
In closing, I'm humbled and honored to lead this great organization. We have a strong foundation upon which to build, to grow and to thrive in a terrific industry. We're in the early days of developing and implementing a disciplined and comprehensive path forward and you'll see more later this summer. Until then, our organization remains focused on delivering near-term commitments and business initiatives. Without a doubt, we have a lot of work to do. At the same time, I have tremendous confidence that, over time, we'll deliver superior execution for our customers, an outstanding environment for our people, and ultimately, we'll drive increased profitability and shareholder value.
Before we open it up to questions, I'd like to take a minute to thank all of our team members for building this business to what it is today. I'm excited to work together with my new team to help Advance reach its full potential. With that, let's open up the call for questions. Operator?"

I will say that, and George has been addressing this over the last several months, we've got to a point where the center is making many more decisions than we feel is appropriate. I think the biggest contrast would be the frontline organization at Frito-Lay, the frontline organization here is essentially how we drive our business. If the frontline is delivering out there in the marketplace, we're going to win every day. I would say that at Frito-Lay, we do engage and allow the frontline to make more decisions than they do here, and that's why George has evolved this model to more of a field-centric or more customer-centric model. I think that's the biggest difference. And I think over time, we can certainly address that. We've got great field leaders. We have no lack of talent out there, but we've got to remove obstacles for them to compete and win in the marketplace, and we're very, very focused against that."

We're really pleased with the progress we're making on cost, and we're going to continue to look at cost to make ourselves more efficient and simplify the business. So those are things we can control. The challenge we have when we don't have at the top line clicking in is we've got a pretty high fixed cost model. And when you have a high fixed cost model, when the sales come in softer, you just deleverage. So I think those 2 work together. You get the top line going again, and we expect to see better leverage on the bottom line. But -- and the other fact is while we're going to continue to take cost out, there is going to be some reinvestment required. As we look at this different parts of the business and reigniting our sales base, so there'll be a balance there, but I think the primary focus is getting sales going.

So first of all, the first big driver of free cash flow is getting our business going.

Tom has talked about that on this call in his remarks, so that's the first one. The second one is managing our working capital. That's the second big driver in this industry, as you know. And you saw our inventory grew higher than we would have anticipated in the first quarter. The 3 big drivers around that were: one, WORLDPAC was -- their inventory was up, I want to say, close to 11%, because we're opening a DC. So that one, we're going to continue to do. The other big driver is the CARQUEST inventory was up quite a bit as we invest in availability in that business. It was starved prior, and we did a lot of investments last year. So we're going to continue to invest in inventory, but we anticipate by the end of the year, the inventory growth is probably up low single digits versus where it was, and the other big driver was we delivered lower sales. So -- and so that drove the inventory up. So we're going to be focused on improving our earnings and improving our working capital, and that's what we're going to be focused on. And then, in relation to the deployment of capital, as you know, first and foremost, getting the earnings going, that's first. And then as we think about that, as we think about buyback, maintaining our leverage ratio is important to us, so we maintain our investment grade ratings. That's a priority. And then after we've done that -- we've done a great job paying down our debt, which gives us the flexibility to allocate capital to investing in the business or doing share buyback. We currently have $415 million and are hoping to buy -- for a buyback."

George was there with his division presidents walking through the plans. They, obviously, asked tough questions and really engaged in trying to help us think through the journey ahead. So they're very, very involved. That's the first point you should know. In addition to that, they understand the challenges we face. I mean, clearly, as all of you on the phone recognize, there's a step function improvement that's required for our business, and we're all committed to the achievement of that, and we're going to lay all that out in the strategic plan. So I mean, we're going to move as rapidly as humanly possible to get to that level of success and accelerated growth, reduced costs and much more engaged people out there in the marketplace.

I joined Advance Auto Parts 4 months ago, and I'm even more energized today than I was when I started. We're conducting a deep dive into our business to fully understand the challenges we faced over the past few years. I'm finding many areas for significant improvement based on actions and strategies that are well within our control. I have no doubt we will address these challenges. In fact, we're developing a long-term strategy to put this behind us to accelerate growth and to drive profitability. 
We need to always put the customer first. This is essential to drive growth. We must earn and retain the trust of our customers which can only be achieved through outstanding service every single day, every single time. As you saw from our release, our current performance in the quarter was a disappointing negative 4.1%. These results are certainly not acceptable given our potential. They are in line with the near-term expectations we provided the last quarter. This is in part because we've been spending our time working on the real changes required to put us in the leadership position we expect. We'll execute better with more accountability in the near term. In parallel, we're working on material and significant change for the long term, specifically, identifying issues and opportunities while creating a sound win strategy for Advance which we can execute flawlessly. We know we have work to do. I remain extremely confident in our ability to address the current challenges we face which largely have been self-inflicted. 
In terms of profitability, our adjusted operating margin rate of 10.8% and adjusted EPS of $1.90 reflect the impact of lower-than-expected gross margin performance in the quarter, higher supply chain expenses and operating deleverage. There were a couple of drivers of sales and profit performance in the quarter. First of all, our customer service metrics were just not where we need them to be. In Q2, we conducted significant primary research with both our commercial customers and DIY consumers. We now know in excruciating detail what's important to them. We know where opportunities exist to better serve customers for Advance as well as for our competitors. Of course, consistent product availability is at the very top of the list. It's table fix in our business. Our performance against the availability metrics that matter to customers were just not where we need them to be and that cost us in Q2. As in Q1, we experienced availability challenges in several key markets. There are clear areas for improvement here and we're addressing them today and we know that they're fixable. At the same time, while inventory was down slightly on a sequential basis over Q1, inventories still grew 7.3% over last year. As indicated on our Q1 call, inventory growing faster than sales without the requisite improvement and availability is inconsistent with our objectives. We've dedicated a team against this challenge and they're focused on ensuring the improved inventory productivity and consistency of product availability while improving working capital and ROIC going forward. 
Secondly, another factor in our [indiscernible] flow-through in Q2 was a sizable insurance adjustment. Mike will explain this in a few minutes. Finally, our performance in the quarter was disproportionally impacted by results in the Northeast and Great Lakes regions. In retrospect, we just didn't adequately plan for a transition to daily replenishment in these markets. We move too far too fast, significantly burdening our DCs with unnecessary complexity over the past few months. And we didn't sufficiently prepare our DC field leaders for the substantial changes we're asking them to execute. Not only did this materially increase our supply chain cost in the quarter, this initiative negatively impacted our bill accuracy in the North East. As a result, the stores that were being serviced by these DCs were actually experiencing much worse availability as a result of the move to daily replenishment. Obviously, increasing cost and complexity with inconsistent availability is just not acceptable. Since my arrival in April, we've been intensely analyzing our supply chain and distribution processes and we're currently working on near- and long-term changes to improve order and accuracy and, ultimately, availability to best-in-class levels. What's most important to customers is the reliability and consistency of our service. They have to be able to trust us to have the right part at the right time. Therefore, our primary objective is to provide best-in-class service to our customers by delivering high-quality great value parts accurately, reliably and consistently exactly when our customers need them. That is the goal. DC, the store delivered frequency, is not our goal. 
We've been carefully analyzing our asset base and processes and we're confident we can leverage our assets in a manner that enables us to efficiently deliver best-in-class customer service while lowering costs and inventory. The great news is we're already seeing a positive impact on our performance from the initial steps we've taken and we absolutely expect the improvement in customer service metrics and inventory reduction in the second half of the year in these markets. I have no doubt we can do a much better job leveraging our assets in order to provide the best service for our customers while producing the best returns for our shareholders. 
To sum up Q2, we're not where we need to be. I know that and my team knows that. There's a heightened sense of urgency and accountability at Advance and we will drive it throughout the organization. Given where we are, we do not expect to turn our performance around overnight. We simply can't. We will execute better but we need to make sure we focus on the material and significant step change opportunity in front of us and make certain we execute these changes flawlessly versus trying to fix aspects of our existing strategy that are flawed in the current state. Our goal at the present time is to build a rocksolid foundation for future growth and we won't compromise on this goal to [indiscernible] short-term results. Therefore, our annual comp store sales estimate remains unchanged in the range of down 3 to 5 for the year. Accelerating growth and transforming our business is an exciting opportunity. The changes necessary to win are well within our control and there are no structural impediments to our success. While we now know many of the areas where we can improve, we cannot rush. We need to be thoughtful and disciplined as we transform and create a growing platform for the future. 
That said, today, we are taking decisive actions to deliver near-term improvement in 2 key areas: commercial growth and execution. Allow me to talk first about how we're going to accelerate commercial growth. Our Commercial Business accounts for approximately 60% of our business and will be an area of growth for years to come. Getting our structure and people right in commercial is foundational to improved performance and position us for longer-term growth and market leadership. As you saw in today's release, we named Bob Cushing, formerly President of WORLDPAC, to serve in the newly created position of Executive Vice President, Commercial. Bob's going to oversee all of the company's commercial operations including Advance, CARQUEST, Autoparts International and, of course, WORLDPAC. 
As I look at the organizational structure of Advance today, it's clear we need a unified leader for the entirety of our Commercial Business. As we consider the leadership skills necessary to accelerate growth, we have to start with the customer. Therefore, we need a leader who puts the customer first always. We need a leader who deeply understands customer service and customer intimacy. And finally, we need a leader with a track record for driving growth, improving profitability and building industry-leading capabilities. Fortunately, Bob Cushing is the perfect person for the role and he's uniquely qualified to spearhead this effort. Bob is an exceptionally talented industry metric with over 30 years of experience as he's the driving force behind WORLDPAC's tremendous growth and market-leading position. He has a proven track record of delivering results and he's an industry pioneer who long ago recognized the role of technology and e-commerce in better serving customers. Last but not least, Bob is competitive. He's going to be relentless on driving outcomes and he'll expect nothing less than the best as he instills a high-performing culture and ensures we execute and we win in the marketplace. This is a significant first step in a transformative process to leverage all of our assets to create the leading commercial organization in North America which provides the absolute best service to customers. 
Secondly, I'll comment on the importance of improving execution. Two weeks ago, we flattened our organizational structure when we announced our 3 division field leaders as well as others will now report directly to me. These changes will facilitate faster, more efficient decision-making and I'm confident this change will elevate operating intensity, drive greater accountability and improve execution across the organization. To summarize these actions, we're moving thoughtfully and swiftly to improve the trajectory of our business. 
In addition to driving near-term performance, these changes are important steps in strengthening our foundation for the future. To that end, we're hard at work in constructing a comprehensive 5-year strategic business plan with the goal of delivering industry-leading performance. As we outlined for you last quarter, the focus of the plant is around 3 value drivers: growth, productivity and people. We're excited with our progress and our potential. With respect to growth, as I indicated earlier, we've conducted a deep dive into the drivers of demand for our business and we've collected volumes of customer insights that the organization has never had before. We're laser focused on customer needs as well as future trends to help guide us in how we position the business for tomorrow. The drivers of demand are key inputs for our growth agenda and will inform us on our holistic supply chain and availability strategy. In terms of supply chain, we're doing considerable work on improving the consistency of part availability, dedicating disproportionate resources toward addressing this massive opportunity for Advance. The goal is clear, get the right part to the right customer at the right time, accurately, reliably and consistently. We'll be making changes in how we distribute, assort and deliver parts to our customers and we'll do it faster, more accurately and more consistently than we do today. We're testing multiple solutions to address these opportunities and we have several pilot programs across the country to assess alternative strategies to improve product assortment, reduce delivery time and to reduce inventory. While it's early, our results from the pilots are extremely encouraging and will drive growth going forward. 
That leads us to our secondary area of focus, productivity. We're building a clearly defined productivity pipeline aimed at improving margins and profitability while building new capabilities to fuel our future growth agenda. This includes establishing productivity targets for our DCs, network, fleet, procurement and stores. We're looking across our entire supply chain and we're challenging each discrete cost. We've identified multiple projects which will yield savings in 2017 and beyond. In the second quarter, we also launched zero-based budgeting. I know many of you are familiar with zero-based budgeting and the proven track record this approach has had in other companies and other industries. We plan to move as fast as possible on ZBD while remaining mindful that we cannot affect service to our customers. In fact, the plan is to drive out unnecessary costs such that we can invest in better service for our customers. I believe the productivity opportunity in Advance is significant and will fuel our growth for years to come. 
Finally, people and culture, our major component of our strategic business plan. We're in the process of developing a comprehensive people strategy to support our business strategy. In Q2, we established HR as a separate function. It was previously combined with our legal team. We subsequently hired a talented and experienced Senior Vice President of HR, Natalie Rossman. Natalie joins us from Texaco following a highly successful career there. Natalie and the team are also hard at work developing our people strategy. Specifically, we're making sure that we have the right talent to succeed, the right culture to attract and retain a diverse and high-performing team and the right capabilities to compete at the highest level to differentiate us and to win with our customers. You'll hear more about growth, productivity and people when we provide an overview of our strategic business plan later this fall. 
With that, allow me to turn it over to Mike."

Total sales for the second quarter decreased 4.8% to $2.26 billion, principally driven by our comp store sales decline of 4.1%, the store closures we executed in 2015 and the effect of our CARQUEST consolidations.",575,"Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. Total sales for the second quarter decreased 4.8% to $2.26 billion, principally driven by our comp store sales decline of 4.1%, the store closures we executed in 2015 and the effect of our CARQUEST consolidations. The declines were partially offset by positive growth at WORLDPAC, our store conversions and new stores opened. Tom also talked about some of our internal challenges on availability and on certain geographies earlier. 
In our Commercial Business the comp store sales declines were more pronounced in our Northeast and great Lakes markets. Within DIY, the declines were primarily seen in our under car, brakes and ride control categories offset by higher wiper blades sales due to the weather conditions in the Southeast during the early part of the quarter. Our gross profit rate decline of 110 basis points was primarily driven by supply chain expense deleverage due to the comp store sales decline and higher supply chain expenses driven by our move to daily replenishment. Our adjusted SG&A expenses were down nearly $35 million versus our second quarter last year. Despite this, our second quarter adjusted SG&A rate increased 17 basis points year-over-year driven primarily by fixed costs deleverage due to our comp store sales decline. We also experienced approximately $12 million of higher self-insurance costs or 56 basis points as we cycled roughly a $7 million insurance benefit from last year versus higher insurance costs this year. These costs were partially offset by lower incentive costs and our continued focus to reduce expenses. All in, second quarter adjusted EPS decreased 16.3% compared to last year and adjusted operating income decreased 14.8% to $243.2 million. Adjusted operating margin decreased 127 basis points over the same period last year to 10.8%. Additionally, we had a $7.7 million adjustment to our income tax expense related to a GPI income tax audit for time periods prior to our acquisition that inflated our Q2 tax rate. The majority of this adjustment was offset in other income below the operating income as this amount is recoverable under our GPI indemnification agreement. 
Operating cash flow through the second quarter was $192.9 million versus $330.8 million last year primarily driven by an increase in inventory versus last year and lower-than-expected sales. The increase in inventory was principally driven by our CARQUEST consolidations, store closures, new Dallas WORLDPAC DC and lower-than-expected sales. We expect to reduce the inventory growth through the balance of the year and expert total inventory at the end of the year to be up low-single digits versus last year. 
Our adjusted debt to EBITDAR was 2.5x at the end of the quarter and will remain within our maximum stated leverage ratio target of 2.5x. We continue to be focused on improving our business performance while preserving our investment grade ratings. While we have not provided an annual EPS outlook we did, however, want to give you some context to how we are thinking about the back half. Based on our current sales outlook, we expect continued fixed cost deleverage of our SG&A and supply chain costs and are making some investments to improve our service and availability. Additionally, as we reduce our inventory in the back half of the year as part of our ongoing efforts to improve our inventory productivity, we expect to experience gross margin headwinds driven by the expensing of previously capitalized supply chain costs.

Based on that down 3 to down 5 for the full year, we are going to continue to see SG&A and supply chain deleverage. Our model needs sales, and with an 80% roughly fixed cost model you just deleverage, that will be the largest driver of our operating margins in the back half. Second of all, we're going to make investments in service and availability that Tom talked about earlier. And then third is, we've got -- as you could see our inventory in the second quarter was up 7.3%, we are planning on our inventory being up low-single digits by the end of the year. There are some capitalized supply chain cost that will be a headwind as we go into the back half of the year. So those will be the 3 drivers.

Obviously, at our AAP branded stores, there are going to be some improvements there. We're making investments in availability and we've got some new stores, but also we're getting more productive with our inventory and we're looking at areas that we can get better in AAP. And then the third one is WORLDPAC. One of the drivers of our 7 3 increase was WORLDPAC and WORLDPAC's inventory growth was up about 15% and the reason is we've got a new Dallas DC for WORLDPAC.

So first of all, at the highest level, WORLDPAC had continued to grow their business. And I think we mentioned it in our remarks they will end up bright spots in the quarter for us, so they continue to grow. And then in terms of cannibalization, I think it's a little bit different for a commercial-only business when they open up. Because almost 90% of their business is controlled by a systems, meaning their customers order online, when they actually open another branch, they actually move those customers that were serviced out of one branch and they move them to another branch. So they actually -- so cannibalization is actually -- they're actually changing their systems, so we don't view that as a bad thing. What typically happens is when they open up a new branch, that was close to where another branch was, they see cannibalization of the original branch because they deliberately move the customers because they can give them better service by servicing them out of the new branch. And then what happens is both branches grown. So the cannibalization, if you look at their total growth and I think that's a better way to view the WORLDPAC business, their total business is growing as they're opening up new branches. And that cannibalization that they see in the original branch, that just grows back, the businesses grow back and it actually grows back strong in both branches."

I joined Advance Auto Parts 4 months ago, and I'm even more energized today than I was when I started. We're conducting a deep dive into our business to fully understand the challenges we faced over the past few years. I'm finding many areas for significant improvement based on actions and strategies that are well within our control. I have no doubt we will address these challenges. In fact, we're developing a long-term strategy to put this behind us to accelerate growth and to drive profitability.
We need to always put the customer first. This is essential to drive growth. We must earn and retain the trust of our customers which can only be achieved through outstanding service every single day, every single time. As you saw from our release, our current performance in the quarter was a disappointing negative 4.1%. These results are certainly not acceptable given our potential. They are in line with the near-term expectations we provided last quarter. This is, in part, because we've been spending our time working on the real changes required to put us in the leadership position we expect. We'll execute better with more accountability in the near term. In parallel, we're working on material and significant change for the long term, specifically, identifying issues and opportunities while creating a sound winning strategy for Advance, which we can execute flawlessly. We know we have work to do. I remain extremely confident in our ability to address the current challenges we face, which largely have been self-inflicted. 
In terms of profitability, our adjusted operating margin rate of 10.8% and adjusted EPS of $1.90 reflect the impact of lower-than-expected gross margin performance in the quarter, higher supply chain expenses and operating deleverage. There were a couple of drivers of sales and profit performance in the quarter. First of all, our customer service metrics were just not where we need them to be. In Q2, we conducted significant primary research with both our commercial customers and DIY consumers. We now know, in excruciating detail, what's important to them. We know where opportunities exist to better serve customers for Advance as well as for our competitors. Of course, consistent product availability is at the very top of the list. It's table fix in our business. Our performance against the availability metrics that matter to customers were just not where we need them to be and that cost us in Q2. As in Q1, we experienced availability challenges in several key markets. There are clear areas for improvement here and we're addressing them today and we know that they're fixable. At the same time, while inventory was down slightly on a sequential basis over Q1, inventories still grew 7.3% over last year. As indicated on our Q1 call, inventory growing faster than sales without the requisite improvement and availability is inconsistent with our objectives. We've dedicated a team against this challenge and they're focused on ensuring the improved inventory productivity and consistency of product availability while improving working capital and ROIC going forward. 
Secondly, another factor in our P&L flow-through in Q2 was a sizable insurance adjustment. Mike will explain this in a few minutes. Finally, our performance in the quarter was disproportionally impacted by results in the Northeast and Great Lakes regions. In retrospect, we just didn't adequately plan for a transition to daily replenishment in these markets. We moved too far too fast, significantly burdening our DCs with unnecessary complexity over the past few months. And we didn't sufficiently prepare our DC and field leaders for the substantial changes we're asking them to execute. Not only did this materially increase our supply chain costs in the quarter, this initiative negatively impacted our fill accuracy in the Northeast. As a result, the stores that were being serviced by these DCs were actually experiencing much worse availability, as a result of the move to daily replenishment. Obviously, increasing costs and complexity with inconsistent availability is just not acceptable. Since my arrival in April, we've been intensely analyzing our supply chain and distribution processes and we're currently working on near- and long-term changes to improve order and fill accuracy and ultimately, availability to best-in-class levels. What's most important to customers is the reliability and consistency of our service. They have to be able to trust us to have the right part at the right time. Therefore, our primary objective is to provide best-in-class service to our customers by delivering high-quality great value parts accurately, reliably and consistently exactly when our customers need them. That is the goal. DC to [ph] store delivered frequency, is not our goal. We've been carefully analyzing our asset base and processes and we're confident we can leverage our assets in a manner that enables us to efficiently deliver best-in-class customer service while lowering costs and inventory. The great news is, we're already seeing a positive impact on our performance from the initial steps we've taken and we absolutely expect the improvement in customer service metrics and inventory reduction in the second half of the year in these markets. I have no doubt we can do a much better job leveraging our assets in order to provide the best service for our customers while producing the best returns for our shareholders. 
To sum up Q2. We're not where we need to be. I know that and my team knows that. There's a heightened sense of urgency and accountability at Advance and we will drive it throughout the organization. Given where we are, we do not expect to turn our performance around overnight. We simply can't. We will execute better but we need to make sure we focus on the material and significant step change opportunity in front of us and make certain we execute these changes flawlessly versus trying to fix aspects of our existing strategy that are flawed in the current state. Our goal at the present time is to build a rock solid foundation for future growth and we won't compromise on this goal to prop up short-term results. Therefore, our annual comp store sales estimate remains unchanged in the range of down 3% to 5% for the year. 
Accelerating growth and transforming our business is an exciting opportunity. The changes necessary to win are well within our control and there are no structural impediments to our success. While we now know many of the areas where we can improve, we cannot rush. We need to be thoughtful and disciplined as we transform and create a growing platform for the future. 
That said, today, we are taking decisive actions to deliver near-term improvement in 2 key areas: commercial growth; and execution. Allow me to talk first, about how we're going to accelerate commercial growth. Our Commercial Business accounts for approximately 60% of our business and will be an area of growth for years to come. Getting our structure and people right in commercial is foundational to improved[ph] performance and position us for longer-term growth and market leadership. As you saw in today's release, we named Bob Cushing, formerly President of WORLDPAC, to serve in the newly created position of Executive Vice President, Commercial. Bob's going to oversee all of the company's commercial operations including Advance, CARQUEST, Autoparts International and, of course, WORLDPAC. 
As I look at the organizational structure of Advance today, it's clear we need a unified leader for the entirety of our Commercial Business. As we consider the leadership skills necessary to accelerate growth, we have to start with the customer. Therefore, we need a leader who puts the customer first always. We need a leader who deeply understands customer service and customer intimacy. And finally, we need a leader with a track record for driving growth, improving profitability and building industry-leading capabilities. Fortunately, Bob Cushing is the perfect person for the role and he's uniquely qualified to spearhead this effort. Bob is an exceptionally talented industry veteran with over 30 years of experience, has been the driving force behind WORLDPAC's tremendous growth and market-leading position. He has a proven track record of delivering results and he's an industry pioneer, who long ago recognized the role of technology and e-commerce in better serving customers. Last but not least, Bob is competitive. He's going to be relentless on driving outcomes and he'll expect nothing less than the best as he instills a high-performing culture and ensures we execute and we win in the marketplace. This is a significant first step in a transformative process to leverage all of our assets to create the leading commercial organization in North America which provides the absolute best service to customers. 
Secondly, I'll comment on the importance of improving execution. Two weeks ago, we flattened our organizational structure when we announced our 3 division field leaders as well as others, who will now report directly to me. These changes will facilitate faster, more efficient decision-making and I'm confident this change will elevate operating intensity, drive greater accountability and improve execution across the organization. 
To summarize these actions, we're moving thoughtfully and swiftly to improve the trajectory of our business. In addition to driving near-term performance, these changes are important steps in strengthening our foundation for the future. To that end, we're hard at work [ph] in constructing a comprehensive 5-year strategic business plan with the goal of delivering industry-leading performance. As we outlined for you last quarter, the focus of the plan is around 3 value drivers: growth; productivity; and people. We're excited with our progress and our potential. With respect to growth, as I indicated earlier, we've conducted a deep dive into the drivers of demand for our business and we've collected volumes of customer insights that the organization has never had before. We're laser focused on customer needs as well as future trends to help guide us in how we position the business for tomorrow. The drivers of demand are key inputs for our growth agenda and will inform us on our holistic supply chain and availability strategy. 
In terms of supply chain, we're doing considerable work on improving the consistency of part availability, dedicating disproportionate resources toward addressing this massive opportunity for Advance. The goal is clear, get the right part to the right customer at the right time, accurately, reliably and consistently. We'll be making changes in how we distribute, assort and deliver parts to our customers and we'll do it faster, more accurately and more consistently than we do today. We're testing multiple solutions to address these opportunities and we have several pilot programs across the country to assess alternative strategies to improve product assortment, reduce delivery time and to reduce inventory. While it's early, our results from the pilots are extremely encouraging and will drive growth going forward. 
That leads us to our second area of focus, productivity. We're building a clearly defined productivity pipeline, aimed at improving margins and profitability while building new capabilities to fuel our future growth agenda. This includes establishing productivity targets for our DCs, network, fleet, procurement and stores. We're looking across our entire supply chain and we're challenging each discrete costs. We've identified multiple projects which will yield savings in 2017 and beyond. In the second quarter, we also launched zero-based budgeting. I know many of you are familiar with zero-based budgeting and the proven track record this approach has had in other companies and other industries. We plan to move as fast as possible on ZBB, while remaining mindful that we cannot affect service to our customers. In fact, the plan is to drive out unnecessary costs, such that we can invest in better service for our customers. I believe the productivity opportunity in Advance is significant and it will fuel our growth for years to come. 
Finally, people and culture, are our major component of our strategic business plan. We're in the process of developing a comprehensive people strategy to support our business strategy. In Q2, we established HR as a separate function. It was previously combined with our legal team. We subsequently hired a talented and experienced Senior Vice President of HR, Natalie Rothman. Natalie joins us from PepsiCo, following a highly successful career there. Natalie and the team are also hard at work developing our people strategy. Specifically, we're making sure that we have the right talent to succeed, the right culture to attract and retain a diverse and high-performing team and the right capabilities to compete at the highest level to differentiate us and to win with our customers. You'll hear more about growth, productivity and people when we provide an overview of our strategic business plan later this fall. 
With that, allow me to turn it over to Mike."

Total sales for the second quarter decreased 4.8% to $2.26 billion, principally driven by our comp store sales decline of 4.1%, the store closures we executed in 2015, and the effect of our CARQUEST consolidations. The declines were partially offset by positive growth at WORLDPAC, our store conversions and new stores opened. Tom also talked about some of our internal challenges on availability and in certain geographies earlier. In our Commercial Business, the comp store sales declines were more pronounced in our Northeast and Great Lakes markets. Within DIY, the declines were primarily seen in our undercar, brakes and ride control categories offset by higher wiper blade sales due to the weather conditions in the Southeast during the early part of the quarter. 
Our gross profit rate decline of a 110 basis points was primarily driven by supply chain expense deleverage due to the comp store sales decline and higher supply chain expenses driven by our move to daily replenishment. Our adjusted SG&A expenses were down nearly $35 million versus our second quarter last year. Despite this, our second quarter adjusted SG&A rate increased 17 basis points year-over-year driven primarily by fixed costs deleverage due to our comp store sales decline. We also experienced approximately $12 million of higher self-insurance costs or 56 basis points, as we cycled roughly a $7 million insurance benefit from last year versus higher insurance cost this year. These costs were partially offset by lower incentive costs and our continued focus to reduce expenses. All in, second quarter adjusted EPS decreased 16.3% compared to last year and adjusted operating income decreased 14.8% to $243.2 million (sic) [ $243.1 million ]. Adjusted operating margin decreased 127 basis points over the same period last year to 10.8%. Additionally, we had a $7.7 million adjustment to our income tax expense related to a GPI income tax audit for time periods prior to our acquisition that inflated our Q2 tax rate. The majority of this adjustment was offset in other income below the operating income as this amount is recoverable under our GPI indemnification agreement. 
Operating cash flow through the second quarter was $192.9 million versus $330.8 million last year primarily driven by an increase in inventory versus last year and lower-than-expected sales. The increase in inventory was principally driven by our CARQUEST consolidations, store closures, new Dallas WORLDPAC DC and lower-than-expected sales. We expect to reduce the inventory growth through the balance of the year and expect total inventory at the end of the year to be up low-single digits versus last year. 
Our adjusted debt to EBITDAR was 2.5x at the end of the quarter and will remain within our maximum stated leverage ratio target of 2.5x. We continue to be focused on improving our business performance while preserving our investment grade ratings. 
While we have not provided an annual EPS outlook, we did, however, want to give you some context to how we are thinking about the back half. Based on our current sales outlook, we expect continued fixed cost deleverage of our SG&A and supply chain costs and are making some investments to improve our service and availability. Additionally, as we reduce our inventory in the back half of the year as part of our ongoing efforts to improve our inventory productivity, we expect to experience gross margin headwinds driven by the expensing of previously capitalized supply chain costs.

First of all, Scot, when we think about constructing the productivity pipeline that I just described, we obviously want more than just necessary to expand margins. So we're targeting to have enough cost take-out that we can invest back and expand margins at the same time. So we have to self-fund our growth. And given the first half we have had on this, we'll be in a good position to do that in 2017. The question is how much investment is going to be required to stimulate the top line in 2017, but over time, we've done the 5-year. There's no question that we can build this business with sustainable top line growth and expand margins at the same time."

Now I don't think that we're going to get to that particular dimension right out of the gate, but we're going to look at it. I mean, clearly on the customer side, we've never had a holistic strategy between Advance and AI and WORLDPAC. We've had multiple organizations going out there selling to commercial customers admittedly with different products. But as import vehicles are growing, private label is becoming increasingly important, which is Auto Parts International specialty. We do see an opportunity to look across and clearly leverage some of the capabilities more broadly. On the supply chain itself, I mean think there are elements of the supply chain where it could make sense. As an example, we have an Advance store close by here the office that gets 8 deliveries a day from the WORLDPAC brands, and yet we're also delivering from the Advance store going to the WORLDPAC brand. So integrating the transportation management systems on those supply chains can help us reduce costs and be more efficient. And there's many other things that Bob's going to look at. So we're very excited about this change. Bob's a terrific leader. He's got -- they've built this online capability out there in WORLDPAC that is really as good as anybody's in the industry. And with the growth in online coming up in the future years, our intention is to leverage their online and e-commerce capabilities more broadly across Advance."

So first of all, at the highest level, WORLDPAC had continued to grow their business. And I think, we mentioned it in our remarks, they will end up bright spots in the quarter for us, so they continue to grow. And then in terms of cannibalization, I think it's a little bit different for a commercial-only business. When they open up a -- because almost 90% of their business is controlled via systems, meaning their customers order online. When they actually open another branch, they actually move those customers that were serviced out of one branch and they move them to another branch. So they actually move -- so cannibalization is actually -- they're actually changing their systems, so we don't view that as a bad thing. What typically happens is when they open up a new branch, that was close to where another branch was, they see cannibalization of the original branch because they deliberately move the customers because they can give them better service by servicing them out of the new branch. And then what happens is both branches grow. So the cannibalization, if you look at their total growth and I think that's a better way to view the WORLDPAC business, their total business is growing as they're opening up new branches. And that cannibalization that they see in the original branch, that just grows back, the businesses grow back and it actually grows back strong in both branches."

I joined Advance Auto Parts 4 months ago, and I'm even more energized today than I was when I started. We're conducting a deep dive into our business to fully understand the challenges we've faced over the past few years. I'm finding many areas for significant improvement based on actions and strategies that are well within our control. I have no doubt we will address these challenges. In fact, we're developing a long-term strategy to put this behind us, to accelerate growth and to drive profitability.
We need to always put the customer first. This is essential to drive growth. We must earn and retain the trust of our customers, which can only be achieved through outstanding service every single day, every single time. As you saw from our release, our current performance in the quarter was a disappointing negative 4.1%. These results are certainly not acceptable given our potential. They are in line with the near-term expectations we provided last quarter. This is, in part, because we've been spending our time working on the real changes required to put us in the leadership position we expect. We'll execute better with more accountability in the near term. In parallel, we're working on material and significant change for the long term, specifically, identifying issues and opportunities while creating a sound winning strategy for Advance, which we can execute flawlessly. We know we have work to do. I remain extremely confident in our ability to address the current challenges we face, which largely have been self-inflicted. 
In terms of profitability, our adjusted operating margin rate of 10.8% and adjusted EPS of $1.90 reflect the impact of lower-than-expected gross margin performance in the quarter, higher supply chain expenses and operating deleverage. There were a couple of drivers of sales and profit performance in the quarter. First of all, our customer service metrics were just not where we need them to be. In Q2, we conducted significant primary research with both our commercial customers and DIY consumers. We now know, in excruciating detail, what's important to them. We know where opportunities exist to better serve customers for Advance as well as for our competitors. Of course, consistent product availability is at the very top of the list. It's table stakes in our business. Our performance against the availability metrics that matter to customers were just not where we need them to be and that cost us in Q2. As in Q1, we experienced availability challenges in several key markets. There are clear areas for improvement here and we're addressing them today and we know that they're fixable. At the same time, while inventory was down slightly on a sequential basis over Q1, inventories still grew 7.3% over last year. As indicated on our Q1 call, inventory growing faster than sales without the requisite improvement in availability is inconsistent with our objectives. We've dedicated a team against this challenge and they're focused on ensuring the improved inventory productivity and consistency of product availability while improving working capital and ROIC going forward. 
Secondly, another factor in our P&L flow-through in Q2 was a sizable insurance adjustment. Mike will explain this in a few minutes. Finally, our performance in the quarter was disproportionally impacted by results in the Northeast and Great Lakes regions. In retrospect, we just didn't adequately plan for a transition to daily replenishment in these markets. We moved too far too fast, significantly burdening our DCs with unnecessary complexity over the past few months. And we didn't sufficiently prepare our DC and field leaders for the substantial changes we were asking them to execute. Not only did this materially increase our supply chain costs in the quarter, this initiative negatively impacted our fill accuracy in the Northeast. As a result, the stores that were being serviced by these DCs were actually experiencing much worse availability as a result of the move to daily replenishment. Obviously, increasing costs and complexity with inconsistent availability is just not acceptable. Since my arrival in April, we've been intensely analyzing our supply chain and distribution processes, and we're currently working on near- and long-term changes to improve order and fill accuracy and ultimately, availability to best-in-class levels. What's most important to customers is the reliability and consistency of our service. They have to be able to trust us to have the right part at the right time. Therefore, our primary objective is to provide best-in-class service to our customers by delivering high-quality great value parts accurately, reliably and consistently exactly when our customers need them. That is the goal. DC to store delivered frequency, is not our goal. We've been carefully analyzing our asset base and processes and we're confident we can leverage our assets in a manner that enables us to efficiently deliver best-in-class customer service while lowering costs and inventory. The great news is we're already seeing a positive impact on our performance from the initial steps we've taken, and we absolutely expect to see improvement in customer service metrics and inventory reduction in the second half of the year in these markets. I have no doubt we can do a much better job leveraging our assets in order to provide the best service for our customers while producing the best returns for our shareholders. 
To sum up Q2. We're not where we need to be. I know that and my team knows that. There's a heightened sense of urgency and accountability at Advance and we will drive it throughout the organization. Given where we are, we do not expect to turn our performance around overnight. We simply can't. We will execute better, but we need to make sure we focus on the material and significant step change opportunity in front of us and make certain we execute these changes flawlessly, versus trying to fix aspects of our existing strategy that are flawed in the current state. Our goal at the present time is to build a rock solid foundation for future growth and we won't compromise on this goal to prop up short-term results. Therefore, our annual comp store sales estimate remains unchanged in the range of down 3% to 5% for the year. 
Accelerating growth and transforming our business is an exciting opportunity. The changes necessary to win are well within our control, and there are no structural impediments to our success. While we now know many of the areas where we can improve, we cannot rush. We need to be thoughtful and disciplined as we transform and create a growing platform for the future. 
That said, today, we are taking decisive actions to deliver near-term improvement in 2 key areas: commercial growth; and execution. Allow me to talk first about how we're going to accelerate commercial growth. Our Commercial business accounts for approximately 60% of our business and will be an area of growth for years to come. Getting our structure and people right in commercial is foundational to improve performance and position us for longer-term growth and market leadership. As you saw in today's release, we named Bob Cushing, formerly President of WORLDPAC, to serve in the newly created position of Executive Vice President, Commercial. Bob's going to oversee all of the company's commercial operations including Advance, CARQUEST, Autopart International and, of course, WORLDPAC. 
As I look at the organizational structure of Advance today, it's clear we need a unified leader for the entirety of our Commercial business. As we consider the leadership skills necessary to accelerate growth, we have to start with the customer. Therefore, we need a leader who puts the customer first, always. We need a leader who deeply understands customer service and customer intimacy. And finally, we need a leader with a track record for driving growth, improving profitability and building industry-leading capabilities. Fortunately, Bob Cushing is the perfect person for the role, and he's uniquely qualified to spearhead this effort. Bob is an exceptionally talented industry veteran with over 30 years of experience, has been the driving force behind WORLDPAC's tremendous growth and market-leading position. He has a proven track record of delivering results and he's an industry pioneer, who long ago recognized the role of technology and e-commerce in better serving customers. Last but not least, Bob is competitive. He's going to be relentless on driving outcomes, and he'll expect nothing less than the best as he instills a high-performing culture and ensures we execute and we win in the marketplace. This is a significant first step in a transformative process to leverage all of our assets to create the leading commercial organization in North America which provides the absolute best service to customers. 
Secondly, I'll comment on the importance of improving execution. Two weeks ago, we flattened our organizational structure when we announced our 3 division field leaders as well as others will now report directly to me. These changes will facilitate faster, more efficient decision-making. And I'm confident this change will elevate operating intensity, drive greater accountability and improve execution across the organization. 
To summarize these actions, we're moving thoughtfully and swiftly to improve the trajectory of our business. In addition to driving near-term performance, these changes are important steps in strengthening our foundation for the future. To that end, we're hard at work in constructing a comprehensive 5-year strategic business plan with the goal of delivering industry-leading performance. As we outlined for you last quarter, the focus of the plan is around 3 value drivers: growth, productivity, and people. We're excited with our progress and our potential. With respect to growth, as I indicated earlier, we've conducted a deep dive into the drivers of demand for our business, and we've collected volumes of customer insights that the organization has never had before. We're laser-focused on customer needs as well as future trends to help guide us in how we position the business for tomorrow. The drivers of demand are key inputs for our growth agenda and will inform us on our holistic supply chain and availability strategy. 
In terms of supply chain, we're doing considerable work on improving the consistency of part availability, dedicating disproportionate resources toward addressing this massive opportunity for Advance. The goal is clear: get the right part to the right customer at the right time, accurately, reliably and consistently. We'll be making changes in how we distribute, assort and deliver parts to our customers, and we'll do it faster, more accurately and more consistently than we do today. We're testing multiple solutions to address these opportunities, and we have several pilot programs across the country to assess alternative strategies to improve product assortment, reduce delivery time and to reduce inventory. While it's early, our results from the pilots are extremely encouraging and will drive growth going forward. 
That leads us to our second area of focus, productivity. We're building a clearly defined productivity pipeline, aimed at improving margins and profitability while building new capabilities to fuel our future growth agenda. This includes establishing productivity targets for our DCs, network, fleet, procurement and stores. We're looking across our entire supply chain and we're challenging each discrete cost. We've identified multiple projects which will yield savings in 2017 and beyond. In the second quarter, we also launched zero-based budgeting. I know many of you are familiar with zero-based budgeting and the proven track record this approach has had in other companies and other industries. We plan to move as fast as possible on ZBB, while remaining mindful that we cannot affect service to our customers. In fact, the plan is to drive out unnecessary costs, such that we can invest in better service for our customers. I believe the productivity opportunity in Advance is significant, and it will fuel our growth for years to come. 
Finally, people and culture are a major component of our strategic business plan. We're in the process of developing a comprehensive people strategy to support our business strategy. In Q2, we established HR as a separate function. It was previously combined with our legal team. We subsequently hired a talented and experienced Senior Vice President of HR, Natalie Rothman. Natalie joins us from PepsiCo, following a highly successful career there. Natalie and the team are also hard at work developing our people strategy. Specifically, we're making sure that we have the right talent to succeed, the right culture to attract and retain a diverse and high-performing team and the right capabilities to compete at the highest level to differentiate us and to win with our customers. You'll hear more about growth, productivity and people when we provide an overview of our strategic business plan later this fall. 
With that, allow me to turn it over to Mike."

Total sales for the second quarter decreased 4.8% to $2.26 billion, principally driven by our comp store sales decline of 4.1%, the store closures we executed in 2015 and the effect of our CARQUEST consolidations.",579,"Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. Total sales for the second quarter decreased 4.8% to $2.26 billion, principally driven by our comp store sales decline of 4.1%, the store closures we executed in 2015 and the effect of our CARQUEST consolidations. The declines were partially offset by positive growth at WORLDPAC, our store conversions and new stores opened. Tom also talked about some of our internal challenges on availability and in certain geographies earlier. In our Commercial business, the comp store sales declines were more pronounced in our Northeast and Great Lakes markets. Within DIY, the declines were primarily seen in our undercar, brakes and ride control categories offset by higher wiper blade sales due to the wetter conditions in the Southeast during the early part of the quarter. 
Our gross profit rate decline of a 110 basis points was primarily driven by supply chain expense deleverage due to the comp store sales decline and higher supply chain expenses driven by our move to daily replenishment. Our adjusted SG&A expenses were down nearly $35 million versus our second quarter last year. Despite this, our second quarter adjusted SG&A rate increased 17 basis points year-over-year driven primarily by fixed costs deleverage due to our comp store sales decline. We also experienced approximately $12 million of higher self-insurance costs or 56 basis points, as we cycled, roughly, a $7 million insurance benefit from last year versus higher insurance cost this year. These costs were partially offset by lower incentive costs and our continued focus to reduce expenses. All-in, second quarter adjusted EPS decreased 16.3% compared to last year and adjusted operating income decreased 14.8% to $243.2 million (sic) [ $243.1 million ]. Adjusted operating margin decreased 127 basis points over the same period last year to 10.8%. Additionally, we had a $7.7 million adjustment to our income tax expense related to a GPI income tax audit for time periods prior to our acquisition that inflated our Q2 tax rate. The majority of this adjustment was offset in other income below the operating income as this amount is recoverable under our GPI indemnification agreement. 
Operating cash flow through the second quarter was $192.9 million versus $330.8 million last year primarily driven by an increase in inventory versus last year and lower-than-expected sales. The increase in inventory was principally driven by our CARQUEST consolidations, store closures, new Dallas WORLDPAC DC and lower-than-expected sales. We expect to reduce the inventory growth through the balance of the year and expect total inventory at the end of the year to be up low single-digits versus last year. 
Our adjusted debt to EBITDAR was 2.5x at the end of the quarter and will remain within our maximum stated leverage ratio target of 2.5x. We continue to be focused on improving our business performance while preserving our investment grade ratings. 
While we have not provided an annual EPS outlook, we did, however, want to give you some context to how we are thinking about the back half. Based on our current sales outlook, we expect continued fixed cost deleverage of our SG&A and supply chain costs and are making some investments to improve our service and availability. Additionally, as we reduce our inventory in the back half of the year as part of our ongoing efforts to improve our inventory productivity, we expect to experience gross margin headwinds driven by the expensing of previously capitalized supply chain costs.

One, as Tom's talked at length about the need to improve our performance and that will drive free cash flow and that'll drive, obviously, an ability to return back to shareholders. The second biggest opportunity we have and the opportunity that drove the AP ratio a little bit lower than last year was our inventory management, and there is a very large focus around that, Tom talked about it in his remarks. We're going to see in the back half some of that movement happen, as we move through the transitional inventory, particularly in our CARQUEST branded stores, first, the consolidations we've done on the closed stores. Obviously, at our AAP branded stores, there's going to be some improvements there. We're making investments in availability, and we've got some new stores, but also we're getting more productive with our inventory, and we're looking at areas that we can get better at in AAP. And then the third one is WORLDPAC. One of the drivers of our 7.3% increase was WORLDPAC, and WORLDPAC's inventory growth was up about 15% and the reason is, is we've got a new Dallas DC for WORLDPAC. So what we anticipate is inventory management is going to be a big driver of the opportunity to improve the free cash flow and as you return in -- and obviously the return back to shareholders."

As you know, we've got others where it's exclusively Advance. And where we have the 2 of them, we do believe that we can have them coexist in the same market. We've just got to figure out how those 2 banners can operate in a way that are incremental and play a different role.

But we're obviously going to take the learnings from the pilots and the ones that can be applied immediately and leverage those. Other aspects are going to take longer, but the pilots are really exciting for us. I mean, they're designed to, at the same time, provide greater availability for our customers, improve the quality of the assortment and make sure that we're delivering parts faster and more consistently to our customers, while we're taking cost out of our supply chain and reducing inventory. So it has really the triple benefit of doing all 3. We're measuring against a very, very detailed dashboard that looks at all of those metrics in tandem, and we're iterating as we go. But the early results are very good. So I feel like we can move faster than perhaps you may have indicated. We won't be able to roll everything out at once. I mean, again, given it's phased, once we get past the first checkpoint, there's other things that we want to explore.

Now I don't think that we're going to get to that particular dimension right out of the gate, but we're going to look at it. I mean, clearly on the customer side, we've never had a holistic strategy between Advance and AI and WORLDPAC. We've had multiple organizations going out there selling to commercial customers, admittedly with different products. But as import vehicles are growing, private label is becoming increasingly important, which is Autopart International's specialty. We do see an opportunity to look across and clearly leverage some of the capabilities more broadly. On the supply chain itself, I mean I think there are elements of the supply chain where it could make sense. As an example, we have an Advance store close by here, the office, that gets 8 deliveries a day from the WORLDPAC branch, and yet we're also delivering from the Advance store going to the WORLDPAC branch. So integrating the transportation management systems of those supply chains can help us reduce costs and be more efficient. And there's many other things that Bob's going to look at. So we're very excited about this change. Bob's a terrific leader. He's got -- they've built this online capability out there in WORLDPAC that is really as good as anybody's in the industry.

And then in terms of cannibalization, I think it's a little bit different for a commercial-only business. When they open up a -- because almost 90% of their business is controlled via systems, meaning their customers order online. When they actually open another branch, they actually move those customers that were serviced out of one branch and they move them to another branch. So they actually move -- so cannibalization is actually -- they're actually changing their systems, so we don't view that as a bad thing. What typically happens is when they open up a new branch that was close to where another branch was, they see cannibalization of the original branch because they deliberately move the customers because they can give them better service by servicing them out of the new branch. And then what happens is both branches grow. So the cannibalization, if you look at their total growth and I think that's a better way to view the WORLDPAC business, their total business is growing as they're opening up new branches. And that cannibalization that they see in the original branch, that just grows back, the business just grows back, and it actually grows back strong in both branches."

I joined Advance Auto Parts 4 months ago, and I'm even more energized today than I was when I started. We're conducting a deep dive into our business to fully understand the challenges we've faced over the past few years. I'm finding many areas for significant improvement based on actions and strategies that are well within our control. I have no doubt we will address these challenges. In fact, we're developing a long-term strategy to put this behind us, to accelerate growth and to drive profitability.
We need to always put the customer first. This is essential to drive growth. We must earn and retain the trust of our customers, which can only be achieved through outstanding service every single day, every single time. As you saw from our release, our current performance in the quarter was a disappointing negative 4.1%. These results are certainly not acceptable given our potential. They are in line with the near-term expectations we provided last quarter. This is, in part, because we've been spending our time working on the real changes required to put us in the leadership position we expect. We'll execute better with more accountability in the near term. In parallel, we're working on material and significant change for the long term, specifically, identifying issues and opportunities while creating a sound winning strategy for Advance, which we can execute flawlessly. We know we have work to do. I remain extremely confident in our ability to address the current challenges we face, which largely have been self-inflicted. 
In terms of profitability, our adjusted operating margin rate of 10.8% and adjusted EPS of $1.90 reflect the impact of lower-than-expected gross margin performance in the quarter, higher supply chain expenses and operating deleverage. There were a couple of drivers of sales and profit performance in the quarter. First of all, our customer service metrics were just not where we need them to be. In Q2, we conducted significant primary research with both our commercial customers and DIY consumers. We now know, in excruciating detail, what's important to them. We know where opportunities exist to better serve customers for Advance as well as for our competitors. Of course, consistent product availability is at the very top of the list. It's table stakes in our business. Our performance against the availability metrics that matter to customers were just not where we need them to be and that cost us in Q2. As in Q1, we experienced availability challenges in several key markets. There are clear areas for improvement here and we're addressing them today and we know that they're fixable. At the same time, while inventory was down slightly on a sequential basis over Q1, inventories still grew 7.3% over last year. As indicated on our Q1 call, inventory growing faster than sales without the requisite improvement in availability is inconsistent with our objectives. We've dedicated a team against this challenge and they're focused on ensuring the improved inventory productivity and consistency of product availability while improving working capital and ROIC going forward. 
Secondly, another factor in our P&L flow-through in Q2 was a sizable insurance adjustment. Mike will explain this in a few minutes. Finally, our performance in the quarter was disproportionally impacted by results in the Northeast and Great Lakes regions. In retrospect, we just didn't adequately plan for a transition to daily replenishment in these markets. We moved too far too fast, significantly burdening our DCs with unnecessary complexity over the past few months. And we didn't sufficiently prepare our DC and field leaders for the substantial changes we were asking them to execute. Not only did this materially increase our supply chain costs in the quarter, this initiative negatively impacted our fill accuracy in the Northeast. As a result, the stores that were being serviced by these DCs were actually experiencing much worse availability as a result of the move to daily replenishment. Obviously, increasing costs and complexity with inconsistent availability is just not acceptable. Since my arrival in April, we've been intensely analyzing our supply chain and distribution processes, and we're currently working on near- and long-term changes to improve order and fill accuracy and ultimately, availability to best-in-class levels. What's most important to customers is the reliability and consistency of our service. They have to be able to trust us to have the right part at the right time. Therefore, our primary objective is to provide best-in-class service to our customers by delivering high-quality great value parts accurately, reliably and consistently exactly when our customers need them. That is the goal. DC to store delivered frequency, is not our goal. We've been carefully analyzing our asset base and processes and we're confident we can leverage our assets in a manner that enables us to efficiently deliver best-in-class customer service while lowering costs and inventory. The great news is we're already seeing a positive impact on our performance from the initial steps we've taken, and we absolutely expect to see improvement in customer service metrics and inventory reduction in the second half of the year in these markets. I have no doubt we can do a much better job leveraging our assets in order to provide the best service for our customers while producing the best returns for our shareholders. 
To sum up Q2. We're not where we need to be. I know that and my team knows that. There's a heightened sense of urgency and accountability at Advance and we will drive it throughout the organization. Given where we are, we do not expect to turn our performance around overnight. We simply can't. We will execute better, but we need to make sure we focus on the material and significant step change opportunity in front of us and make certain we execute these changes flawlessly, versus trying to fix aspects of our existing strategy that are flawed in the current state. Our goal at the present time is to build a rock solid foundation for future growth and we won't compromise on this goal to prop up short-term results. Therefore, our annual comp store sales estimate remains unchanged in the range of down 3% to 5% for the year. 
Accelerating growth and transforming our business is an exciting opportunity. The changes necessary to win are well within our control, and there are no structural impediments to our success. While we now know many of the areas where we can improve, we cannot rush. We need to be thoughtful and disciplined as we transform and create a growing platform for the future. 
That said, today, we are taking decisive actions to deliver near-term improvement in 2 key areas: commercial growth; and execution. Allow me to talk first about how we're going to accelerate commercial growth. Our Commercial business accounts for approximately 60% of our business and will be an area of growth for years to come. Getting our structure and people right in commercial is foundational to improve performance and position us for longer-term growth and market leadership. As you saw in today's release, we named Bob Cushing, formerly President of WORLDPAC, to serve in the newly created position of Executive Vice President, Commercial. Bob's going to oversee all of the company's commercial operations including Advance, CARQUEST, Autopart International and, of course, WORLDPAC. 
As I look at the organizational structure of Advance today, it's clear we need a unified leader for the entirety of our Commercial business. As we consider the leadership skills necessary to accelerate growth, we have to start with the customer. Therefore, we need a leader who puts the customer first, always. We need a leader who deeply understands customer service and customer intimacy. And finally, we need a leader with a track record for driving growth, improving profitability and building industry-leading capabilities. Fortunately, Bob Cushing is the perfect person for the role, and he's uniquely qualified to spearhead this effort. Bob is an exceptionally talented industry veteran with over 30 years of experience, has been the driving force behind WORLDPAC's tremendous growth and market-leading position. He has a proven track record of delivering results and he's an industry pioneer, who long ago recognized the role of technology and e-commerce in better serving customers. Last but not least, Bob is competitive. He's going to be relentless on driving outcomes, and he'll expect nothing less than the best as he instills a high-performing culture and ensures we execute and we win in the marketplace. This is a significant first step in a transformative process to leverage all of our assets to create the leading commercial organization in North America which provides the absolute best service to customers. 
Secondly, I'll comment on the importance of improving execution. Two weeks ago, we flattened our organizational structure when we announced our 3 division field leaders as well as others will now report directly to me. These changes will facilitate faster, more efficient decision-making. And I'm confident this change will elevate operating intensity, drive greater accountability and improve execution across the organization. 
To summarize these actions, we're moving thoughtfully and swiftly to improve the trajectory of our business. In addition to driving near-term performance, these changes are important steps in strengthening our foundation for the future. To that end, we're hard at work in constructing a comprehensive 5-year strategic business plan with the goal of delivering industry-leading performance. As we outlined for you last quarter, the focus of the plan is around 3 value drivers: growth, productivity, and people. We're excited with our progress and our potential. With respect to growth, as I indicated earlier, we've conducted a deep dive into the drivers of demand for our business, and we've collected volumes of customer insights that the organization has never had before. We're laser-focused on customer needs as well as future trends to help guide us in how we position the business for tomorrow. The drivers of demand are key inputs for our growth agenda and will inform us on our holistic supply chain and availability strategy. 
In terms of supply chain, we're doing considerable work on improving the consistency of part availability, dedicating disproportionate resources toward addressing this massive opportunity for Advance. The goal is clear: get the right part to the right customer at the right time, accurately, reliably and consistently. We'll be making changes in how we distribute, assort and deliver parts to our customers, and we'll do it faster, more accurately and more consistently than we do today. We're testing multiple solutions to address these opportunities, and we have several pilot programs across the country to assess alternative strategies to improve product assortment, reduce delivery time and to reduce inventory. While it's early, our results from the pilots are extremely encouraging and will drive growth going forward. 
That leads us to our second area of focus, productivity. We're building a clearly defined productivity pipeline, aimed at improving margins and profitability while building new capabilities to fuel our future growth agenda. This includes establishing productivity targets for our DCs, network, fleet, procurement and stores. We're looking across our entire supply chain and we're challenging each discrete cost. We've identified multiple projects which will yield savings in 2017 and beyond. In the second quarter, we also launched zero-based budgeting. I know many of you are familiar with zero-based budgeting and the proven track record this approach has had in other companies and other industries. We plan to move as fast as possible on ZBB, while remaining mindful that we cannot affect service to our customers. In fact, the plan is to drive out unnecessary costs, such that we can invest in better service for our customers. I believe the productivity opportunity in Advance is significant, and it will fuel our growth for years to come. 
Finally, people and culture are a major component of our strategic business plan. We're in the process of developing a comprehensive people strategy to support our business strategy. In Q2, we established HR as a separate function. It was previously combined with our legal team. We subsequently hired a talented and experienced Senior Vice President of HR, Natalie Rothman. Natalie joins us from PepsiCo, following a highly successful career there. Natalie and the team are also hard at work developing our people strategy. Specifically, we're making sure that we have the right talent to succeed, the right culture to attract and retain a diverse and high-performing team and the right capabilities to compete at the highest level to differentiate us and to win with our customers. You'll hear more about growth, productivity and people when we provide an overview of our strategic business plan later this fall. 
With that, allow me to turn it over to Mike."

Total sales for the second quarter decreased 4.8% to $2.26 billion, principally driven by our comp store sales decline of 4.1%, the store closures we executed in 2015 and the effect of our CARQUEST consolidations.",579,"Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. Total sales for the second quarter decreased 4.8% to $2.26 billion, principally driven by our comp store sales decline of 4.1%, the store closures we executed in 2015 and the effect of our CARQUEST consolidations. The declines were partially offset by positive growth at WORLDPAC, our store conversions and new stores opened. Tom also talked about some of our internal challenges on availability and in certain geographies earlier. In our Commercial business, the comp store sales declines were more pronounced in our Northeast and Great Lakes markets. Within DIY, the declines were primarily seen in our undercar, brakes and ride control categories offset by higher wiper blade sales due to the wetter conditions in the Southeast during the early part of the quarter. 
Our gross profit rate decline of a 110 basis points was primarily driven by supply chain expense deleverage due to the comp store sales decline and higher supply chain expenses driven by our move to daily replenishment. Our adjusted SG&A expenses were down nearly $35 million versus our second quarter last year. Despite this, our second quarter adjusted SG&A rate increased 17 basis points year-over-year driven primarily by fixed costs deleverage due to our comp store sales decline. We also experienced approximately $12 million of higher self-insurance costs or 56 basis points, as we cycled, roughly, a $7 million insurance benefit from last year versus higher insurance cost this year. These costs were partially offset by lower incentive costs and our continued focus to reduce expenses. All-in, second quarter adjusted EPS decreased 16.3% compared to last year and adjusted operating income decreased 14.8% to $243.2 million (sic) [ $243.1 million ]. Adjusted operating margin decreased 127 basis points over the same period last year to 10.8%. Additionally, we had a $7.7 million adjustment to our income tax expense related to a GPI income tax audit for time periods prior to our acquisition that inflated our Q2 tax rate. The majority of this adjustment was offset in other income below the operating income as this amount is recoverable under our GPI indemnification agreement. 
Operating cash flow through the second quarter was $192.9 million versus $330.8 million last year primarily driven by an increase in inventory versus last year and lower-than-expected sales. The increase in inventory was principally driven by our CARQUEST consolidations, store closures, new Dallas WORLDPAC DC and lower-than-expected sales. We expect to reduce the inventory growth through the balance of the year and expect total inventory at the end of the year to be up low single-digits versus last year. 
Our adjusted debt to EBITDAR was 2.5x at the end of the quarter and will remain within our maximum stated leverage ratio target of 2.5x. We continue to be focused on improving our business performance while preserving our investment grade ratings. 
While we have not provided an annual EPS outlook, we did, however, want to give you some context to how we are thinking about the back half. Based on our current sales outlook, we expect continued fixed cost deleverage of our SG&A and supply chain costs and are making some investments to improve our service and availability. Additionally, as we reduce our inventory in the back half of the year as part of our ongoing efforts to improve our inventory productivity, we expect to experience gross margin headwinds driven by the expensing of previously capitalized supply chain costs.

We're not giving an EPS annual outlook, but I did give you a little bit of context that would be helpful as to how you're -- how we're thinking about the back half of the year financially. Based on that down 3% to down 5% for the full year, we are going to continue to see SG&A and supply chain deleverage. Our model needs sales, and with an 80% roughly fixed cost model you just deleverage. That'll be the largest driver of our operating margins in the back half. Second of all, we're going to make investments in service and availability that Tom talked about earlier. And then third is, we've got -- as we -- and you could see our inventory in the second quarter was up 7.3%, we are planning on our inventory being up low-single digits by the end of the year. There are some capitalized supply chain costs that will be a headwind as we go into the back half of the year. So those will be the 3 drivers.

We're going to see in the back half some of that movement happen, as we move through the transitional inventory, particularly in our CARQUEST branded stores, first, the consolidations we've done on the closed stores. Obviously, at our AAP branded stores, there's going to be some improvements there. We're making investments in availability, and we've got some new stores, but also we're getting more productive with our inventory, and we're looking at areas that we can get better at in AAP. And then the third one is WORLDPAC. One of the drivers of our 7.3% increase was WORLDPAC, and WORLDPAC's inventory growth was up about 15% and the reason is, is we've got a new Dallas DC for WORLDPAC.

Now I don't think that we're going to get to that particular dimension right out of the gate, but we're going to look at it.

We do see an opportunity to look across and clearly leverage some of the capabilities more broadly. On the supply chain itself, I mean I think there are elements of the supply chain where it could make sense. As an example, we have an Advance store close by here, the office, that gets 8 deliveries a day from the WORLDPAC branch, and yet we're also delivering from the Advance store going to the WORLDPAC branch. So integrating the transportation management systems of those supply chains can help us reduce costs and be more efficient. And there's many other things that Bob's going to look at.

And then in terms of cannibalization, I think it's a little bit different for a commercial-only business. When they open up a -- because almost 90% of their business is controlled via systems, meaning their customers order online. When they actually open another branch, they actually move those customers that were serviced out of one branch and they move them to another branch. So they actually move -- so cannibalization is actually -- they're actually changing their systems, so we don't view that as a bad thing. What typically happens is when they open up a new branch that was close to where another branch was, they see cannibalization of the original branch because they deliberately move the customers because they can give them better service by servicing them out of the new branch. And then what happens is both branches grow. So the cannibalization, if you look at their total growth and I think that's a better way to view the WORLDPAC business, their total business is growing as they're opening up new branches. And that cannibalization that they see in the original branch, that just grows back, the business just grows back, and it actually grows back strong in both branches."

I'd like to welcome all of you to our event, both those of you here in the audience as well as those of you joining us on the webcast. We greatly appreciate your interest on our business and we're very excited to share our progress with you today. 
We'll start by providing a brief recap of the third quarter results, and then we'll transition to an overview of our strategic business plan. We've been developing this over the past several months. With that, let's get right into it.
Our comp store performance in Q3 was down 1%, as our initiatives to improve top line performance began to have an impact. While we delivered sequential improvement versus previous quarters, let me be clear, we will be relentless in our pursuit of positive comp sales.
In terms of profitability, our adjusted operating margin rate of 9.7% and adjusted EPS of $1.73 were impacted by 3 primary drivers, all of which we called out during our Q2 call: first, we made investments in the quarter to better serve our customers; secondly, we took deliberate actions to reduce inventory levels versus Q2, which resulted in cost headwinds. Going forward, we'll continue to bring our inventory levels down without disrupting our customers; and third, we faced higher supply chain operating expenses in the quarter, including our planned transition from 5x to 3x delivery frequency in selected markets.
As for our top line performance, while it's still early, we're encouraged by our sales improvement as the heightened focus on execution translated to improved input metrics and ultimately, sales. We remain relentlessly focused on execution, and we're going to make investments in customer service and availability to align our entire organization around the customer and around gaining market share.
To date, our investments have driven sales performance at a faster rate than expected. On our Q2 call, we called out back-half investments in 3 areas: in availability; in customer service; and in our front-line organizations. All 3 of these investments have been promising. In terms of availability, we have a number of initiatives underway that test different ways of positioning our inventory of assorting parts and of delivery parts to our customers. These tests are being conducted throughout our network. The initiatives all have the same endgame: get the right part in the right place at the right time, consistently, reliably and predictably.
As we work to improve availability, we're working to do so at less cost and with more availability.
We're testing these initiatives in multiple phases, and we're applying some of the learnings to our base business. So far, we like many aspects of what we're seeing, and we plan to roll out these initiatives in 2017. We also see elements of our test that we can leverage in the future, and we'll discuss the progress we're making on availability later when we review our strategic business plan.
In terms of investments in our customers, we're equally encouraged. This include investments in availability, in store labor and in a frontline incentive program. These investments enable our front-line team to compete at the absolute highest level and position them to win with our customers. In particular, the incentive program we launched has been extremely well received by our field team and almost immediately has had a step function impact on reducing turnover in all front-line roles. Our field team is fired up and they're increasing their focus on what matters most to our valued customers.
In summary, we're encouraged by the investments we've made in availability, in our customers and in our front-line team. On a regional basis, we saw comp sales improvement in every region in the country. While performance in the Northeast and Great Lakes still lag our overall business, it improved visitor [ph] actions to improve performance and some of our more challenged distribution centers paid off. Our teams in these regions are excited about the changes as we're giving them the chance to say yes, to our customers more often.
To sum up Q3, we're encouraged by the progress we're making and the momentum that is building behind our efforts. That said, we still have a significant amount of work to do to dramatically change the trajectory of our business. Accordingly, we're maintaining a very disciplined approach to improving customer service as it's absolutely vital that we get this right for the long term.
We're focused on delivering consistent sales and profit improvement over the long term, not just the next quarter. We'll continue to sharpen our focus on execution, improve availability and deliver on the needs of our customers as we execute our strategy.
I'll be back up shortly to provide an update on our strategic plan. But before I do, it's my absolute pleasure to introduce Tom Okray to give a brief third quarter update on our financial and operational highlights. Tom brings more than 25 years of experience in finance, operations and supply chain to AAP. Most recently, he served as VP, Finance, Global Customer Fulfillment at Amazon, where he was the finance lead overseeing the optimization of all key elements of Amazon's global fulfillment network. In addition, Tom spent over 20 years at General Motors in finance and supply chain-related roles. He was most recently responsible for overseeing more than $120 billion in annual expenses, and $8 billion in CapEx as CFO, global product development, purchasing and supply chain. 
Tom is absolutely passionate about winning in the marketplace and he is laser focused on what matters most to our customers. He knows what it takes to win in the digital world, and he's bringing an entirely new dimension to our thinking as we navigate the future. We're thrilled to be joined by Tom, given his unique background and deep operating experience as we write the next chapter of growth for AAP. Tom?"

Before I begin my prepared remarks, I just want to briefly share how thrilled I am to be a part of the AAP team. I've joined the organization at a very exciting time as we refocus the company on our most important priority, the customer. We will work to improve our service levels, our overall execution and without a doubt, our operating and financial performance. I'd also want to thank Mike Norona for assisting with my transition and our third quarter financial close.
Total sales for to third quarter decreased 2% to $2.25 billion, principally driven by our comp store sales decline of 1%, store closures and Carquest consolidations. The declines were partially offset by growth at Worldpac, store conversions and new stores. Our gross profit rate decline of 104 basis points was primarily driven by higher supply chain expenses and headwinds associated with reducing inventory. Our adjusted SG&A rate was essentially flat year-over-year, driven by continued cost reduction initiatives, partially offset by investments in delighting our customers.
All in, our third quarter adjusted operating income came in at $217.6 million; adjusted operating margin decreased 95 basis points over the same period last year to 9.7%; operating cash flow through the third quarter was $409.4 million versus $520.1 million last year, primarily driven by an increase in inventory versus last year and lower sales. While we have not provided an annual EPS outlook, we'd like to give some context on how we're thinking about the balance of the year.
We're encouraged by our sales improvement in Q3. However, it's early and we have a lot more work to do. Additionally, as you may know, our fourth quarter is our lowest volume and most volatile quarter of the fiscal year. We expect continued headwinds in our operating margin rate similar to what we experienced in the third quarter. As we continue to invest in our customers, our inventory and optimize our supply chain network. 
That wraps up our third quarter recap. We're going to transition to discussing elements of our strategic business plan. With that, I'll turn it over to Tom Greco."

This plan has been several months in the making and we couldn't be more excited about our prospects for the future. Our plan is deeply rooted in focused consumer and customer research for both DIY customers and professional customers. Our goal is to dramatically improve performance across the board through a step change in customer service. 
Please understand we'd like to share as much of our plan as we possibly can with you. At the same time, we feel it's in our business interest of all concerned that we're careful on just how much we share about our plan for competitive reasons. Also understand that if you're left wanting for more details, we've spent considerable time analyzing the pros and cons of doing so, and we concluded [ph] that it's not in our or our shareholders' best interest to do so. That said, we've got a very compelling plan that capitalize on the enormous growth opportunity that we have at AAP, and we're excited to share our plan to deliver improved results and shareholder value.
Before we get started, I know this might be the first time we're getting to know each other. There's some new people in new positions at Advance and for some of you, this includes me. Stepping back and with the benefit of my first 6 months in the role along with 30 -- close to 30 years of experience at PepsiCo and Frito-Lay, I'm confident we're in a great position to capitalize on the opportunity ahead. Many of the ingredients for success that I enjoyed at PepsiCo are transferable here: constructing a demand-driven growth agenda that's rooted in customer and consumer insights; transforming the supply chain to build new capabilities and drive productivity; and empowering the frontline organization to drive execution and operating improvement. Without question, I see the application of each of these learnings here at Advance.
In fact, there's more opportunity to drive growth and productivity at AAP than any role that I've ever had. We'll discuss the opportunities that we see going forward throughout the presentation. It's also my pleasure today to introduce Bob Cushing, right there in the middle of the slide. Bob recently assumed the newly created role of Executive Vice President, Professional Sales, where he'll oversee all of the company's professional sales operations including Advance, Carquest, Autopart International and, of course, Worldpac.
Today we're rebranding what was formerly known as our commercial business to professional. Professional is a name that our customers prefer. And as a result, that's the name we're going to use going forward. Bob's perfectly suited to head up this business. He's an exceptionally talented industry veteran with over 30 years of experience in the industry and he's been the driving force behind the tremendous growth and market-leading position that Worldpac enjoys today. Importantly, Bob is very competitive. You're going to see that today. He's going to be relentless in driving outcomes and expect nothing less than the best as he instill the high-performing culture and make sure we execute to win in the marketplace. In addition to Bob, later in the presentation, you'll hear once again from Tom with the discussion on how our strategy translates to an outlook for the future. So let's get started.
I'd like to begin with what we'd like you to take away from today's event. First, we operate in a terrific industry. It's a large and growing, with attractive dynamics across the board. Secondly, AAP has a very compelling market position, including industry-leading assets, tools and capabilities for us to leverage. Third, we have a tremendous opportunity to drive growth and margin expansion but to do so, we need to implement real change. Not just a change in operations but a real change in culture. We have to focus on the customer first and begin our journey for everything we do with how we can provide the best possible service for our customers. And fourth, we're already executing a clear focused agenda to drive change. Fifth, overseeing this effort is an aggressive leadership team that's fully aligned around our plan. In summary, one can only conclude that AAP represents a compelling investment with tremendous opportunity to deliver shareholder value.
So let's start with the fact that we compete in $135 billion industry that's experienced strong growth for several years, and we see no end in sight. Industry forecast predict consistent growth over the next 5 years led by professional. For certain, the industry continues to benefit from an increase in vehicles in operation, an increase in average age of vehicles, an increase in older vehicles and an increase in average miles driven per year. These industry fundamentals will drive strong growth for the industry for years to come.
In addition to industry fundamentals, AAP is well-positioned to gain market share. We have many advantages, including: a company-owned professional business; an extensive North American footprint of fulfillment centers and stores; and the leading distributors of import parts. Clearly, we have the assets to succeed and accelerate growth but to do so, we need to better utilize those assets to our advantage. Without question, AAP has a substantial market share opportunity.
We're also keenly aware of evolving industry trends including e-commerce, technology, electrification, urbanization, ridesharing and autonomous vehicles. As a result, we're excited by the opportunity of today and the opportunities of tomorrow as we construct our strategic growth agenda. With disruption comes opportunity.
Whatever we do, we must delight the customer. Everything we do starts and stops with the customer. In building our plan, we knew we had to develop a deep and visceral understanding of the customer and deliver on their needs. Over the last few months, we conducted the most significant piece of research our company has ever undertaken. We've spent a tremendous amount of time to understand what delights both professional customers and DIY customers. Of course, ultimately we must turn those insights into actions. Our professional customers are looking for high-quality parts at the time we promise them. We understand this opportunity and it's unquestionably achievable for AAP. The DIYer needs vary widely by vehicle history, repair complexity and their level of expertise. This requires a very focused agenda for our Team Members. Armed with these insights, we've developed a strategy and a series of initiatives to delight both professional customers and DIY customers. The initiatives are focused on making sure we have the right part in the right place at the right time and creating a better overall experience for all of our customers.
This leads to the big planks of our agenda. First, building an advantage supply-chain is the cornerstone of our efforts as we improve availability, delivery consistency and speed to delight our customers. Secondly, in professional, we're building a dramatic improvement in the customer experience at every single touch point as we ramp up sales and service capabilities. Next, in DIY, we're planning changes to improve the in-store experience and drive loyalty as well as a reinvention of our online experience. Fourth, our growth agenda will be supported by a robust and ongoing productivity engine that will enable us to expand margins and fuel our growth for years to come. At the center of all this, of course, is our talent and our culture, which will support and facilitate our ability to execute each initiative.
Let's begin with supply chain. A robust and highly functioning supply chain is absolutely foundational to our success. To achieve this, we plan to leverage our existing supply chain assets. The key in constructing the advantage supply chain is to build new capabilities to improve availability, delivery consistency and speed and drive growth while removing unnecessary costs. 
I'm highly confident we can achieve this at AAP. We have a very strong asset base in terms of square footage, inventory and delivery trucks but they are not optimized today. We will optimize our assets to delight our customers. We have been conducting numerous test and learn initiatives over the past few months. In our business, having the right part at the right time is essential. It's table stakes [ph] for competing in the industry. As a matter of fact, a few years ago, the Worldpac team actually trademarked the tagline, the right part at the right time. 
Our test and learn markets are delivering very positive results. This includes a significant increase in in-market parts availability, a significant decrease in order-to-delivery time and overall reduction in inventory and days on hand, all while increasing availability. Our customers are taking notice, and I quote, ""whatever you guys are doing, it's working for me. I get parts quicker, cars spend less time on the list so I get more jobs done."" The bottom line here is that our changes are leading to increased sales, lower cost, lower inventory levels and higher customer satisfaction.
In addition to our test and learn initiatives, we have an opportunity to streamline our supply chain network and systems. Simplification of our supply chain enables us to get the Advance and Carquest supply chain and network fully integrated. This provides 3 primary benefits: first, streamlining our supply chain improves product availability; secondly, it drives significant productivity by reducing stem miles from DC to store; and third, it simplifies our systems and processes by enabling seamless inventory transfer throughout the value chain, which is a huge benefit for our Team Members and independent partners. Therefore, what we formally referred to as our integration plan is now fully embedded in our ongoing strategic business plan. As such, we're no longer going to be discussing progress on integration. We're one company now and everyone is focused on the customer.
Bottom line, there's no longer discussion about integration but more about how do we use our supply chain assets better and rethinking the system to better fulfill customer demand and more efficiently get more parts closer to more customers.
Now turning to our professional growth opportunity. We're ramping up sales and customer service capabilities, big time. And I'd like to invite Bob Cushing to review our exciting plans for professional customers."

In my early observations, I recognize the tremendous opportunities that exist today to accelerate our growth. In my new role, I'll drive improved performance across the enterprise by leveraging my experience and our proven capabilities highly coveted by our customers.
My goal is to completely transform our customers sales and service model, both online and in person on the professional side of our business. I will be highly focused on improving the overall customer experience to dramatically improve our first call and first click capability. 
As I've looked across AAP, I found many assets that are totally under leveraged. So it all starts with attractive brand portfolio. And our customers have spoken, they want high-quality branded parts to service their customers. And our research confirmed that AAP's part assortment consistently delivers against this objective more than any other supplier. While we're pleased with the results, we will continue to work diligently to delight our customers.
Additionally over the past 40 years, we have developed an industry-leading selection of private label products to meet the needs of our professional customer. AAP's private label brand support our multi-brand strategy, which is what's preferred by our professional customer. So when you look, we start with a significant growth opportunity from a solid base of domestic vehicles in operation and importantly, for our customers, we're ahead of the curve on the growing import opportunity. The vehicle import market share has -- is expected to grow dramatically as it has over the past 15 years. This will provide a tremendous growth opportunity for AAP across the entire enterprise.
We have the import expertise with Worldpac and Autopart International. We have delivered this and basically built the leading import program for the past 40 years.
Another asset we can leverage better is our training. Our customers want professional training to help grow and improve the profitability and grow their business. Their technicians need advanced technical training to meet the demands of diagnosing and repairing today's and tomorrow's vehicles. We already have 2 great tools today: we have the CARQUEST Technical Institute; and we have the WORLDPAC Training Institute, which is focused on the import side. Again, the opportunity I just described. Together, the CARQUEST and WORLDPAC Training Institutes provide the professional customer the most comprehensive training curriculum in the industry and it's only, only available at AAP.
In today's digital world, serving professional customers has to start with an industry-leading online experience, and we have a great online assets at Worldpac today. In a research that we conducted, our online experience was rated best-in-class by our customers. This performance was also recognized by Frost & Sullivan Research, which found automotive technicians rank Worldpac as the best program distributor with the comprehensive line of quality products, easy-to-use online system with the speedDIAL, outstanding salespeople, competitive pricing, dependable delivery and consistent product availability. I cannot be more proud of the team for this accomplishment. But as we look forward, the only way we'll leverage this great suite of assets is to put the customer first, always. This has been really important to my entire career, listening to customers, responding to them and providing them what they need: high-quality product assortment; delivery service that's fast and consistent; technology to drive growth needs of doing business; providing our customers with an industry-leading catalog; a sales team dedicated to delighting the customer; and training to enable our customers to grow their business.
So now it is our time to shift into high gear. We will knit together and leverage best practices across all of AAP's professional business going forward. I know there are better ways to integrate our supply chain. I know we can leverage our catalog and technology to create a better online experience and for certain, we will build a more robust sales and customer service culture at AAP. And by the way, we're already doing it. In fact, we just solidified a multiyear agreement with one of the largest customers who was really pleased with the new AAP approach, and I quote the customer, ""We chose Advance professional based upon their overall enterprise value. The combination of product coverage, local availability, technician training, technology as well as competitive pricing made them the right choice both now and into the future. They have a proven track record of great customer service and consistent execution across a large geographic area, which makes them the right strategic partner for the business.""
The entire AAP team could not be more excited about taking our professional sales to the next level, and we know there's a significant market share opportunity for us as we execute our plan, and we will deliver it. At this point, I'll take you back to Tom. Thank you."

So now you see why we're so excited about professional. Now I'm going to talk DIY, and we're a little further along in our journey to accelerate professional than we are in DIY, and while we continue to strengthen the DIY plan, we're already seeing",1261,"Okay. So now you see why we're so excited about professional. Now I'm going to talk DIY, and we're a little further along in our journey to accelerate professional than we are in DIY, and while we continue to strengthen the DIY plan, we're already seeing signs of improvement in our DIY sales as we really get focused on the customer.
Just like inside professional, our DIY success begins with putting the customer first in everything that we do. We have to build trust, confidence and loyalty with DIYers all over the country. We leverage some custom, significant research we conducted with DIY customers, and our plan is to delight them at every touch point. Across the board, we're improving parts availability. We're building engagement platforms that drive traffic. We're ensuring a consistent in-store experience to drive frequency. We're focusing our training on priority segments to build knowledge and capability. And we're revamping our Speed Perks loyalty program. We're also increasing our investment in mobile and digital to seamlessly connect the online and in-store experience, all of which have the common goal of gaining market share.
First, we plan to grow our customer base. We've analyzed our business over the past several years and we have a very clear idea what's been driving our challenges with traffic and sales growth inside of DIY. Some of the factors driving the decisions on how DIYers choose an auto parts retailer include vehicle history, repair complexity and their level of expertise. From this, we've identified priority segments where we're confident we have the right to succeed. Meeting the needs of these customers will require thoughtful planning around labor, training and marketing. We're excited about attracting new customers to AAP with targeted marketing and a wider array of services.
Next, we'll drive frequency with existing customers. Speed Perks is entering its third full year. To date, we haven't been leveraging the scale of this program as well as we should and will going forward. Our plan is to build customer loyalty with Speed Perks. We now have millions of Speed Perks members, which gives us a deeper understanding of their lifetime value. We're learning more and more about how these customers want to be engaged, and we're building momentum around new ways to cultivate a much stronger relationship with these customers by leveraging insights and analytics around our individual needs and behaviors. Just one additional trip per year by each Speed Perks member results in a tremendous growth number for AAP.
Finally, winning in DIY requires us to improve the overall experience for our customers, both in-store and online. Critically important to achieving this goal is to address the basics of the business. We have to raise our standards on execution. This includes ramping up discipline inside the store and rededicating ourselves to a consistent and exceptional customer experience every single time. We also must ensure that we serve our customers when and how they want to be served, which means elevating our online experience. The end result will be a much better experience for DIYers in every interaction they have with AAP in person, over the phone or online, enabling us to build customer trust, confidence and loyalty.
Our customers have been telling us that we're making progress in DIY. In the past few months, we've seen an increase in the number of complementary letters from DIYers all over the country. To read just one, ""your manager and his staff were so nice and so helpful in what was, for me, a very stressful situation. His actions have made me an Advance Auto Parts customer for life.""
In summary, our team is energized to better serve the DIYer. And just like in professional, there's a significant market share opportunity in DIY with improved execution.
Between the transformation of our supply chain, building out new capabilities in professional and improving the overall experience for DIYers, we're very bullish on our ability to sequentially accelerate our top line performance going forward just like we did in Q3 of this year.
Now let's talk productivity. Accelerated productivity will fund our journey. In order to sustain investment in growth, a robust productivity engine is absolutely essential. We've gone up and down every single cost line in the entire enterprise to construct our productivity plan. It spans 6 major categories and will contribute meaningfully to profit growth. The categories we've targeted are: distribute, ship as it ship, run as it pertains to stores, deliver, sell and support. Please note that while we're removing unnecessary costs, we're also driving new capabilities and investing in long-term growth creation.
Our current productivity build delivers $500 million in cost reduction over 5 years. To be clear, this is a gross number. Some of this will be used to fund our growth and transformation initiatives so not all of this will flow directly to the bottom line. You'll see the impact of the reinvestment of our productivity savings in improving operating margin over the period of the plan.
Our productivity agenda includes 3 important areas of focus: first, zero-based budgeting, where we're eliminating waste and standardizing our approach to cost control. Secondly, as I mentioned earlier, we plan to streamline our supply chain to drive both effectiveness and efficiency. Simplifying, optimizing and fully leveraging our existing asset base yields big savings in our plan. Finally, we have initiated a substantial piece of work on material input costs. As part of this, we'll leverage procurement and value engineering to round out the big blanks of our agenda.
Bottom line, we're entering 2017 with a very high level of confidence in our productivity pipeline. In addition, we're very much looking forward to having Tom Okray provide his perspective given his extensive experience in large organizations where productivity and cost management play a central role.
Finally, I'd like to touch on talent, culture and capability. Across the organization, you can expect us to be maniacally focused on growing talent, evolving our culture and building new capabilities. Specifically, we'll grow talent by developing much more robust leadership development programs for our existing leaders. We're also promoting talented leaders who know the parts business full [ph] and have the capability to do more. And importantly, we've done a great deal of work on evolving the culture of the company. This includes building a culture which is obsessively focused on the customer and one with an exceedingly high level of accountability of ownership and drive for results.
Related to this, our leadership team has spent time looking at incentives and ways to empower all of our team members to act like owners. As an example, turnover. We put a tremendous focus on reducing turnover, and I'm pleased to inform you that we were down significantly in Q3 versus previous year in each of the key roles in the field.
Finally, we're defining the new capabilities we need across the entire enterprise. Where we lack the talent internally, we're going outside to find people who have industry-leading capabilities that we can leverage, and we've already hired several people from outside of AAP that are bringing an entirely new dimension to our thinking as we prepare for the future.
In summary, over the next 5 years, our plan delivers sequential top line sales improvement, $500 million in gross productivity; substantial margin expansion; and world-class talent, culture and capabilities, which will future fit AAP for years to come.
Now it's my pleasure to invite Tom back on the stage to give you a high-level view of how our plan translates to an outlook."

The opportunities Tom and Bob discussed to deliver improved results are familiar to me. I'm used to putting the customer first always. And I know we can drive accelerated sales growth and margin expansion included in our plan.
Turning to the financial impact of our plan. For 2017, we will deliver positive sales comp growth and a modest increase in operating margin. By 2021, our plan delivers mid-single-digit comp sales and at least 500 basis points of margin expansion. As Tom previously discussed, we're building a platform to enable sustainable growth and operating leverage. To achieve that goal, we've worked backwards from the customer and balanced our efforts to achieve growth, reduce cost and efficiencies throughout the organization. Importantly, we're also focused on delivering shareholder value. We will deliver strong operating performance, which will generate strong cash flow improvement. Further, we have tremendous focus on working capital. This includes optimizing our inventory in the our payables, which will result in a dramatic improvement in AP ratio. A strong cash flow generation combined with a balanced capital allocation plan enables us to invest in new capabilities such as digital and growth such as new market development. We will apply disciplined rigor around driving strong returns and efficient use of capital as measured by ROIC. We look to return excess cash to shareholders while maintaining our investment-grade rating with a bias towards share repurchases.
Together, we have a tremendous opportunity to leverage the largest asset base in the industry to drive shareholder value. I couldn't be more excited about the future of the company. 
And with that, I'd like to ask Tom and Bob to return to the podium and take some questions. Zaheed, can you lead us there?"

We took some steps to address that through incentives by lifting up the importance of those roles, lifting to the those people. We brought a general management council into place to essentially help us forge our agenda. We're spending a lot of time looking at turnover rates by geography, by district throughout the country. So we made a lot of progress. And I mentioned in the prepared remarks, our turnover is down across the board in each of those 4 roles, dramatically. It was up significantly and now it's down year-on-year.

I mean, obviously, hindsight 2020 and I think mine is as good as anyone else but I'll comment briefly on what I think is different about our plan. First of all, I'll say that our plan is dramatically different than we've seen previous",431,"Okay. Thanks, Brian. I mean, obviously, hindsight 2020 and I think mine is as good as anyone else but I'll comment briefly on what I think is different about our plan. First of all, I'll say that our plan is dramatically different than we've seen previously. I mean, in terms of what I've looked at, I would say there's a couple of big ones. The first one is that we are obsessed with the customer. Everybody on this stage is obsessed with the customer. We are going to drive that deep into the organization. We may have said we were obsessed with the customer in the past but I think there's a lot of evidence that would say that we are not -- we were not obsessed with the customer in the past. And that's probably job 1 is to drive that, as I mentioned earlier, deep into the organization, ensure that it's a filter that we put every single decision that we make through the entire company. Secondly, we really didn't have a cohesive strategy that I could gather over the last several years. That caused us to make significant shifts in direction frequently over time. And when you're shifting a large organization of 75,000 people, it gets very difficult to get any kind of momentum around the agenda. Third, when you have that going on, it really starts to compromise the execution because you're trying different things and different priorities take a different level of energy at any given point in time. I can tell you the number of things that we were measuring was significant. The number of input metrics we were trying to accomplish was a very, very long list, and it did vary quarter in, quarter out. So that, over time, reduces the amount of accountability that people inside the organization have to deliver against those goals and it starts to compromise the overall ability to get things done and to achieve the margin expansion goals that we outlined. So I guess those are the big things that I would observe. Customer service is going to be -- or obsession with the customer really going forward is our agenda. We have a piece of strategy now. We're going to be focused on the operating metrics and execution that were required to deliver against that and we do have to build the culture of the organization to be really focused on not just the customer but to have a very high level of accountability of ownership and drive for result, and that will be different going forward."

We're getting more professional business of the conversions has been much more successful overall, so you'll see us actually accelerating some of the conversions to get more DIY business on that side. As for our goals, again, we're going to focus on the customer. You saw our market share, it's single digits, okay? There's a lot of food on the table for us to grow. We have $10 billion in sales in $135 billion market. We feel very good about our ability to gain market share overall in that time frame. Obviously, we don't ignore our competition.

I mean, we want to make sure -- I mean, when you're talking about something as important as your store labor, which faces customers, it requires a tremendous amount of analytics upfront, rigorous testing, proven methodologies then you roll it out. So what I observed was we weren't really approaching it that way. And so we had to sort of reverse course on some of the things that we did. And early on, it's been very well received by our field organization. You have to listen what our region Vice Presidents, our district managers, our general managers in the stores are telling us. And as I went around, I mean, I tried to spend as much time in the stores as I can, and I do take a lot of notes and I listen to them when they tell me this is not driving my comps, it's -- it gives you the illusion of profitability because you're reducing cost and you're really just getting customers angry and they don't come back to your store. And then it's just a bit of a vicious circle. So we have been very thoughtful about our labor model. I think we've made a lot of progress on better aligning our hours to the demand, both on the DIY side and on the commercial side. And we'll continue to do that. We've got to make sure that we can service the customer with all of the things that they want, whether it's parking lot services or delivery frequency or when they want the part.

I think May, something like that, May or June. I went to a couple of those facilities we have up there. What we did was we tried to impose a bit of a cookie-cutter approach to those distribution centers, and they really weren't engineered to do it. We have more stores than we should have assigned to them at a delivery frequency that was very difficult for them to execute flawlessly. And that's created a very chaotic environment in the distribution center. We weren't able to fill orders properly, there was accuracy issues. Yes, we were delivering 5x to the stores but if you asked the general managers of those stores, they would have said, ""please stop doing this because we were just -- it was a bit of a Lucy show type thing going on. We just had stuff coming in and out, in a doubt, in an out. We weren't getting parts there in the right place, in the right time."" So we essentially unwound that. We went to 3x in those distribution centers. We got into a much better cadence with the stores. We executed our first one in August, okay? Then we went in September, the second one. We've now done all of them. So this transition cost that we incurred in the last couple of -- in the third quarter, and will incur in the fourth quarter by the way as you move to this new system. And we're seeing much better fill rates, like significantly better, much better accuracy and the general managers are much happier and they're selling more. So it just goes back to the customer wants the right parts in the right place at the right time. The customer doesn't say, ""hello, have you got 5x?"" They say, ""have you got the right part?"" And we're able to fulfill that part regardless of how we got it there. That's what they're looking for. So I was in both of those facilities in -- what's this, October. I was there in October. Totally different place. There's not stuff all over the place. We've got clean house, I can see down the aisles, it's kind of important to me in a distribution center. I don't want to see stuff laying on the loading docks. I mean, I get tipping hats to the teams in those DCs because they really worked at it very hard, and as a result of our customers are much happier."

It's a terrific opportunity to really standardize how costs are managed across the organization. And I would consider what we have in there a AAA bond.

It isn't a do better exercise. It's a change the physics exercise. We're not managing those costs the same way anymore. We're asking people to look at the cost in ways that we had to look at before. So those costs, we've got a very clear idea. Tom is running the control tower. We're very clear on where those costs are coming out. They're across the P&L, Michael, so I can't call out specific things. They're really throughout the entire P&L. The supply chain obviously is a big area of opportunity. I mean, we just talked about one here, 5x to 3x. You deliver parts 3 times a week instead of 5 times a week. It costs less. And unless you have a really good effectiveness reason for doing it, which we didn't in that case, when we go from 5x to 3x, we save a lot of money. So we're going to continue to look for those types of opportunities but that -- it's those types of things where as I said earlier the cost is coming out.

I'd like to welcome all of you to our event, both those of you here in the audience as well as those of you joining us on the webcast. We greatly appreciate your interest on our business and we're very excited to share our progress with you today. 
We'll start by providing a brief recap of the third quarter results, and then we'll transition to an overview of our strategic business plan. We've been developing this over the past several months. With that, let's get right into it.
Our comp store performance in Q3 was down 1%, as our initiatives to improve top line performance began to have an impact. While we delivered sequential improvement versus previous quarters, let me be clear, we will be relentless in our pursuit of positive comp sales.
In terms of profitability, our adjusted operating margin rate of 9.7% and adjusted EPS of $1.73 were impacted by 3 primary drivers, all of which we called out during our Q2 call: first, we made investments in the quarter to better serve our customers; secondly, we took deliberate actions to reduce inventory levels versus Q2, which resulted in cost headwinds. Going forward, we'll continue to bring our inventory levels down without disrupting our customers; and third, we faced higher supply chain operating expenses in the quarter, including our planned transition from 5x to 3x delivery frequency in selected markets.
As for our top line performance, while it's still early, we're encouraged by our sales improvement as the heightened focus on execution translated to improved input metrics and ultimately, sales. We remain relentlessly focused on execution, and we're going to make investments in customer service and availability to align our entire organization around the customer and around gaining market share.
To date, our investments have driven sales performance at a faster rate than expected. On our Q2 call, we called out back-half investments in 3 areas: in availability; in customer service; and in our front-line organizations. All 3 of these investments have been promising. In terms of availability, we have a number of initiatives underway that test different ways of positioning our inventory of assorting parts and of delivery parts to our customers. These tests are being conducted throughout our network. The initiatives all have the same endgame: get the right part in the right place at the right time, consistently, reliably and predictably.
As we work to improve availability, we're working to do so at less cost and with more availability.
We're testing these initiatives in multiple phases, and we're applying some of the learnings to our base business. So far, we like many aspects of what we're seeing, and we plan to roll out these initiatives in 2017. We also see elements of our test that we can leverage in the future, and we'll discuss the progress we're making on availability later when we review our strategic business plan.
In terms of investments in our customers, we're equally encouraged. This include investments in availability, in store labor and in a frontline incentive program. These investments enable our front-line team to compete at the absolute highest level and position them to win with our customers. In particular, the incentive program we launched has been extremely well received by our field team and almost immediately has had a step function impact on reducing turnover in all front-line roles. Our field team is fired up and they're increasing their focus on what matters most to our valued customers.
In summary, we're encouraged by the investments we've made in availability, in our customers and in our front-line team. On a regional basis, we saw comp sales improvement in every region in the country. While performance in the Northeast and Great Lakes still lag our overall business, it improved our [ph] actions to improve performance and some of our more challenged distribution centers paid off. Our teams in these regions are excited about the changes as we're giving them the chance to say yes, to our customers more often.
To sum up Q3, we're encouraged by the progress we're making and the momentum that is building behind our efforts. That said, we still have a significant amount of work to do to dramatically change the trajectory of our business. Accordingly, we're maintaining a very disciplined approach to improving customer service as it's absolutely vital that we get this right for the long term.
We're focused on delivering consistent sales and profit improvement over the long term, not just the next quarter. We'll continue to sharpen our focus on execution, improve availability and deliver on the needs of our customers as we execute our strategy.
I'll be back up shortly to provide an update on our strategic plan. But before I do, it's my absolute pleasure to introduce Tom Okray to give a brief third quarter update on our financial and operational highlights. Tom brings more than 25 years of experience in finance, operations and supply chain to AAP. Most recently, he served as VP, Finance, Global Customer Fulfillment at Amazon, where he was the finance lead overseeing the optimization of all key elements of Amazon's global fulfillment network. In addition, Tom spent over 20 years at General Motors in finance and supply chain-related roles. He was most recently responsible for overseeing more than $120 billion in annual expenses, and $8 billion in CapEx as CFO, global product development, purchasing and supply chain. 
Tom is absolutely passionate about winning in the marketplace and he is laser focused on what matters most to our customers. He knows what it takes to win in the digital world, and he's bringing an entirely new dimension to our thinking as we navigate the future. We're thrilled to be joined by Tom, given his unique background and deep operating experience as we write the next chapter of growth for AAP. Tom?"

Before I begin my prepared remarks, I just want to briefly share how thrilled I am to be a part of the AAP team. I've joined the organization at a very exciting time as we refocus the company on our most important priority, the customer. We will work to improve our service levels, our overall execution and without a doubt, our operating and financial performance. I'd also want to thank Mike Norona for assisting with my transition and our third quarter financial close.
Total sales for to third quarter decreased 2% to $2.25 billion, principally driven by our comp store sales decline of 1%, store closures and Carquest consolidations. The declines were partially offset by growth at Worldpac, store conversions and new stores. Our gross profit rate decline of 104 basis points was primarily driven by higher supply chain expenses and headwinds associated with reducing inventory. Our adjusted SG&A rate was essentially flat year-over-year, driven by continued cost reduction initiatives, partially offset by investments in delighting our customers.
All in, our third quarter adjusted operating income came in at $217.6 million; adjusted operating margin decreased 95 basis points over the same period last year to 9.7%; operating cash flow through the third quarter was $409.4 million versus $520.1 million last year, primarily driven by an increase in inventory versus last year and lower sales. While we have not provided an annual EPS outlook, we'd like to give some context on how we're thinking about the balance of the year.
We're encouraged by our sales improvement in Q3. However, it's early and we have a lot more work to do. Additionally, as you may know, our fourth quarter is our lowest volume and most volatile quarter of the fiscal year. We expect continued headwinds in our operating margin rate similar to what we experienced in the third quarter. As we continue to invest in our customers, our inventory and optimize our supply chain network. 
That wraps up our third quarter recap. We're going to transition to discussing elements of our strategic business plan. With that, I'll turn it over to Tom Greco."

This plan has been several months in the making and we couldn't be more excited about our prospects for the future. Our plan is deeply rooted in focused consumer and customer research for both DIY customers and professional customers. Our goal is to dramatically improve performance across the board through a step change in customer service. 
Please understand we'd like to share as much of our plan as we possibly can with you. At the same time, we feel it's in our business interest of all concerned that we're careful on just how much we share about our plan for competitive reasons. Also understand that if you're left wanting for more details, we've spent considerable time analyzing the pros and cons of doing so, and we can conclude that it's not in our or our shareholders' best interest to do so. That said, we've got a very compelling plan that capitalize on the enormous growth opportunity that we have at AAP, and we're excited to share our plan to deliver improved results and shareholder value.
Before we get started, I know this might be the first time we're getting to know each other. There's some new people in new positions at Advance and for some of you, this includes me. Stepping back and with the benefit of my first 6 months in the role along with 30 -- close to 30 years of experience at PepsiCo and Frito-Lay, I'm confident we're in a great position to capitalize on the opportunity ahead. Many of the ingredients for success that I enjoyed at PepsiCo are transferable here: constructing a demand-driven growth agenda that's rooted in customer and consumer insights; transforming the supply chain to build new capabilities and drive productivity; and empowering the frontline organization to drive execution and operating improvement. Without question, I see the application of each of these learnings here at Advance.
In fact, there's more opportunity to drive growth and productivity at AAP than any role that I've ever had. We'll discuss the opportunities that we see going forward throughout the presentation. It's also my pleasure today to introduce Bob Cushing, right there in the middle of the slide. Bob recently assumed the newly created role of Executive Vice President, Professional Sales, where he'll oversee all of the company's professional sales operations including Advance, Carquest, Autopart International and, of course, Worldpac.
Today we're rebranding what was formerly known as our commercial business to professional. Professional is a name that our customers prefer. And as a result, that's the name we're going to use going forward. Bob's perfectly suited to head up this business. He's an exceptionally talented industry veteran with over 30 years of experience in the industry and he's been the driving force behind the tremendous growth and market-leading position that Worldpac enjoys today. Importantly, Bob is very competitive. You're going to see that today. He's going to be relentless in driving outcomes and expect nothing less than the best as he instill the high-performing culture and make sure we execute to win in the marketplace. In addition to Bob, later in the presentation, you'll hear once again from Tom with the discussion on how our strategy translates to an outlook for the future. So let's get started.
I'd like to begin with what we'd like you to take away from today's event. First, we operate in a terrific industry. It's a large and growing, with attractive dynamics across the board. Secondly, AAP has a very compelling market position, including industry-leading assets, tools and capabilities for us to leverage. Third, we have a tremendous opportunity to drive growth and margin expansion but to do so, we need to implement real change. Not just a change in operations but a real change in culture. We have to focus on the customer first and begin our journey for everything we do with how we can provide the best possible service for our customers. And fourth, we're already executing a clear focused agenda to drive change. Fifth, overseeing this effort is an aggressive leadership team that's fully aligned around our plan. In summary, one can only conclude that AAP represents a compelling investment with tremendous opportunity to deliver shareholder value.
So let's start with the fact that we compete in $135 billion industry that's experienced strong growth for several years, and we see no end in sight. Industry forecast predict consistent growth over the next 5 years led by professional. For certain, the industry continues to benefit from an increase in vehicles in operation, an increase in average age of vehicles, an increase in older vehicles and an increase in average miles driven per year. These industry fundamentals will drive strong growth for the industry for years to come.
In addition to industry fundamentals, AAP is well-positioned to gain market share. We have many advantages, including: a company-owned professional business; an extensive North American footprint of fulfillment centers and stores; and the leading distributors of import parts. Clearly, we have the assets to succeed and accelerate growth but to do so, we need to better utilize those assets to our advantage. Without question, AAP has a substantial market share opportunity.
We're also keenly aware of evolving industry trends including e-commerce, technology, electrification, urbanization, ridesharing and autonomous vehicles. As a result, we're excited by the opportunity of today and the opportunities of tomorrow as we construct our strategic growth agenda. With disruption comes opportunity.
Whatever we do, we must delight the customer. Everything we do starts and stops with the customer. In building our plan, we knew we had to develop a deep and visceral understanding of the customer and deliver on their needs. Over the last few months, we conducted the most significant piece of research our company has ever undertaken. We've spent a tremendous amount of time to understand what delights both professional customers and DIY customers. Of course, ultimately we must turn those insights into actions. Our professional customers are looking for high-quality parts at the time we promise them. We understand this opportunity and it's unquestionably achievable for AAP. The DIYer needs vary widely by vehicle history, repair complexity and their level of expertise. This requires a very focused agenda for our Team Members. Armed with these insights, we've developed a strategy and a series of initiatives to delight both professional customers and DIY customers. The initiatives are focused on making sure we have the right part in the right place at the right time and creating a better overall experience for all of our customers.
This leads to the big planks of our agenda. First, building an advantage supply-chain is the cornerstone of our efforts as we improve availability, delivery consistency and speed to delight our customers. Secondly, in professional, we're building a dramatic improvement in the customer experience at every single touch point as we ramp up sales and service capabilities. Next, in DIY, we're planning changes to improve the in-store experience and drive loyalty as well as a reinvention of our online experience. Fourth, our growth agenda will be supported by a robust and ongoing productivity engine that will enable us to expand margins and fuel our growth for years to come. At the center of all this, of course, is our talent and our culture, which will support and facilitate our ability to execute each initiative.
Let's begin with supply chain. A robust and highly functioning supply chain is absolutely foundational to our success. To achieve this, we plan to leverage our existing supply chain assets. The key in constructing the advantage supply chain is to build new capabilities to improve availability, delivery consistency and speed and drive growth while removing unnecessary costs. 
I'm highly confident we can achieve this at AAP. We have a very strong asset base in terms of square footage, inventory and delivery trucks but they are not optimized today. We will optimize our assets to delight our customers. We have been conducting numerous test and learn initiatives over the past few months. In our business, having the right part at the right time is essential. It's table stakes for competing in the industry. As a matter of fact, a few years ago, the Worldpac team actually trademarked the tagline, the right part at the right time. 
Our test and learn markets are delivering very positive results. This includes a significant increase in in-market parts availability, a significant decrease in order-to-delivery time and overall reduction in inventory and days on hand, all while increasing availability. Our customers are taking notice, and I quote, ""whatever you guys are doing, it's working for me. I get parts quicker, cars spend less time on the list so I get more jobs done."" The bottom line here is that our changes are leading to increased sales, lower cost, lower inventory levels and higher customer satisfaction.
In addition to our test and learn initiatives, we have an opportunity to streamline our supply chain network and systems. Simplification of our supply chain enables us to get the Advance and Carquest supply chain and network fully integrated. This provides 3 primary benefits: first, streamlining our supply chain improves product availability; secondly, it drives significant productivity by reducing stem miles from DC to store; and third, it simplifies our systems and processes by enabling seamless inventory transfer throughout the value chain, which is a huge benefit for our Team Members and independent partners. Therefore, what we formally referred to as our integration plan is now fully embedded in our ongoing strategic business plan. As such, we're no longer going to be discussing progress on integration. We're one company now and everyone is focused on the customer.
Bottom line, there's no longer discussion about integration but more about how do we use our supply chain assets better and rethinking the system to better fulfill customer demand and more efficiently get more parts closer to more customers.
Now turning to our professional growth opportunity. We're ramping up sales and customer service capabilities, big time. And I'd like to invite Bob Cushing to review our exciting plans for professional customers."

In my early observations, I recognize the tremendous opportunities that exist today to accelerate our growth. In my new role, I'll drive improved performance across the enterprise by leveraging my experience and our proven capabilities highly coveted by our customers.
My goal is to completely transform our customers sales and service model, both online and in person on the professional side of our business. I will be highly focused on improving the overall customer experience to dramatically improve our first call and first click capability. 
As I've looked across AAP, I found many assets that are totally under leveraged. So it all starts with attractive brand portfolio. And our customers have spoken, they want high-quality branded parts to service their customers. And our research confirmed that AAP's part assortment consistently delivers against this objective more than any other supplier. While we're pleased with the results, we will continue to work diligently to delight our customers.
Additionally over the past 40 years, we have developed an industry-leading selection of private label products to meet the needs of our professional customer. AAP's private label brand support our multi-brand strategy, which is what's preferred by our professional customer. So when you look, we start with a significant growth opportunity from a solid base of domestic vehicles in operation and importantly, for our customers, we're ahead of the curve on the growing import opportunity. The vehicle import market share has -- is expected to grow dramatically as it has over the past 15 years. This will provide a tremendous growth opportunity for AAP across the entire enterprise.
We have the import expertise with Worldpac and Autopart International. We have delivered this and basically built the leading import program for the past 40 years.
Another asset we can leverage better is our training. Our customers want professional training to help grow and improve the profitability and grow their business. Their technicians need advanced technical training to meet the demands of diagnosing and repairing today's and tomorrow's vehicles. We already have 2 great tools today: we have the CARQUEST Technical Institute; and we have the WORLDPAC Training Institute, which is focused on the import side. Again, the opportunity I just described. Together, the CARQUEST and WORLDPAC Training Institutes provide the professional customer the most comprehensive training curriculum in the industry and it's only, only available at AAP.
In today's digital world, serving professional customers has to start with an industry-leading online experience, and we have a great online assets at Worldpac today. In a research that we conducted, our online experience was rated best-in-class by our customers. This performance was also recognized by Frost & Sullivan Research, which found automotive technicians rank Worldpac as the best program distributor with the comprehensive line of quality products, easy-to-use online system with the speedDIAL, outstanding salespeople, competitive pricing, dependable delivery and consistent product availability. I cannot be more proud of the team for this accomplishment. But as we look forward, the only way we'll leverage this great suite of assets is to put the customer first, always. This has been really important to my entire career, listening to customers, responding to them and providing them what they need: high-quality product assortment; delivery service that's fast and consistent; technology to drive growth needs of doing business; providing our customers with an industry-leading catalog; a sales team dedicated to delighting the customer; and training to enable our customers to grow their business.
So now it is our time to shift into high gear. We will knit together and leverage best practices across all of AAP's professional business going forward. I know there are better ways to integrate our supply chain. I know we can leverage our catalog and technology to create a better online experience and for certain, we will build a more robust sales and customer service culture at AAP. And by the way, we're already doing it. In fact, we just solidified a multiyear agreement with one of the largest customers who was really pleased with the new AAP approach, and I quote the customer, ""We chose Advance professional based upon their overall enterprise value. The combination of product coverage, local availability, technician training, technology as well as competitive pricing made them the right choice both now and into the future. They have a proven track record of great customer service and consistent execution across a large geographic area, which makes them the right strategic partner for the business.""
The entire AAP team could not be more excited about taking our professional sales to the next level, and we know there's a significant market share opportunity for us as we execute our plan, and we will deliver it. At this point, I'll take you back to Tom. Thank you."

First, we plan to grow our customer base. We've analyzed our business over the past several years and we have a very clear idea what's been driving our challenges with traffic and sales growth inside of DIY. Some of the factors driving the decisions on how DIYers choose an auto parts retailer include vehicle history, repair complexity and their level of expertise. From this, we've identified priority segments where we're confident we have the right to succeed. Meeting the needs of these customers will require thoughtful planning around labor, training and marketing. We're excited about attracting new customers to AAP with targeted marketing and a wider array of services.
Next, we'll drive frequency with existing customers. Speed Perks is entering its third full year. To date, we haven't been leveraging the scale of this program as well as we should and will going forward. Our plan is to build customer loyalty with Speed Perks. We now have millions of Speed Perks members, which gives us a deeper understanding of their lifetime value. We're learning more and more about how these customers want to be engaged, and we're building momentum around new ways to cultivate a much stronger relationship with these customers by leveraging insights and analytics around our individual needs and behaviors. Just one additional trip per year by each Speed Perks member results in a tremendous growth number for AAP.
Finally, winning in DIY requires us to improve the overall experience for our customers, both in-store and online. Critically important to achieving this goal is to address the basics of the business. We have to raise our standards on execution. This includes ramping up discipline inside the store and rededicating ourselves to a consistent and exceptional customer experience every single time. We also must ensure that we serve our customers when and how they want to be served, which means elevating our online experience. The end result will be a much better experience for DIYers in every interaction they have with AAP in person, over the phone or online, enabling us to build customer trust, confidence and loyalty.
Our customers have been telling us that we're making progress in DIY. In the past few months, we've seen an increase in the number of complementary letters from DIYers all over the country. To read just one, ""your manager and his staff were so nice and so helpful in what was, for me, a very stressful situation. His actions have made me an Advance Auto Parts customer for life.""
In summary, our team is energized to better serve the DIYer. And just like in professional, there's a significant market share opportunity in DIY with improved execution.
Between the transformation of our supply chain, building out new capabilities in professional and improving the overall experience for DIYers, we're very bullish on our ability to sequentially accelerate our top line performance going forward just like we did in Q3 of this year.
Now let's talk productivity. Accelerated productivity will fund our journey. In order to sustain investment in growth, a robust productivity engine is absolutely essential. We've gone up and down every single cost line in the entire enterprise to construct our productivity plan. It spans 6 major categories and will contribute meaningfully to profit growth. The categories we've targeted are: distribute, ship as it ship, run as it pertains to stores, deliver, sell and support. Please note that while we're removing unnecessary costs, we're also driving new capabilities and investing in long-term growth creation.
Our current productivity build delivers $500 million in cost reduction over 5 years. To be clear, this is a gross number. Some of this will be used to fund our growth and transformation initiatives so not all of this will flow directly to the bottom line. You'll see the impact of the reinvestment of our productivity savings in improving operating margin over the period of the plan.
Our productivity agenda includes 3 important areas of focus: first, zero-based budgeting, where we're eliminating waste and standardizing our approach to cost control. Secondly, as I mentioned earlier, we plan to streamline our supply chain to drive both effectiveness and efficiency. Simplifying, optimizing and fully leveraging our existing asset base yields big savings in our plan. Finally, we have initiated a substantial piece of work on material input costs. As part of this, we'll leverage procurement and value engineering to round out the big blanks of our agenda.
Bottom line, we're entering 2017 with a very high level of confidence in our productivity pipeline. In addition, we're very much looking forward to having Tom Okray provide his perspective given his extensive experience in large organizations where productivity and cost management play a central role.
Finally, I'd like to touch on talent, culture and capability. Across the organization, you can expect us to be maniacally focused on growing talent, evolving our culture and building new capabilities. Specifically, we'll grow talent by developing much more robust leadership development programs for our existing leaders. We're also promoting talented leaders who know the parts business full and have the capability to do more. And importantly, we've done a great deal of work on evolving the culture of the company. This includes building a culture which is obsessively focused on the customer and one with an exceedingly high level of accountability of ownership and drive for results.
Related to this, our leadership team has spent time looking at incentives and ways to empower all of our team members to act like owners. As an example, turnover. We put a tremendous focus on reducing turnover, and I'm pleased to inform you that we were down significantly in Q3 versus previous year in each of the key roles in the field.
Finally, we're defining the new capabilities we need across the entire enterprise. Where we lack the talent internally, we're going outside to find people who have industry-leading capabilities that we can leverage, and we've already hired several people from outside of AAP that are bringing an entirely new dimension to our thinking as we prepare for the future.
In summary, over the next 5 years, our plan delivers sequential top line sales improvement, $500 million in gross productivity; substantial margin expansion; and world-class talent, culture and capabilities, which will future fit AAP for years to come.
Now it's my pleasure to invite Tom back on the stage to give you a high-level view of how our plan translates to an outlook."

The opportunities Tom and Bob discussed to deliver improved results are familiar to me. I'm used to putting the customer first always. And I know we can drive accelerated sales growth and margin expansion included in our plan.
Turning to the financial impact of our plan. For 2017, we will deliver positive sales comp growth and a modest increase in operating margin. By 2021, our plan delivers mid-single-digit comp sales and at least 500 basis points of margin expansion. As Tom previously discussed, we're building a platform to enable sustainable growth and operating leverage. To achieve that goal, we've worked backwards from the customer and balanced our efforts to achieve growth, reduce cost and efficiencies throughout the organization. Importantly, we're also focused on delivering shareholder value. We will deliver strong operating performance, which will generate strong cash flow improvement. Further, we have tremendous focus on working capital. This includes optimizing our inventory in the our payables, which will result in a dramatic improvement in AP ratio. A strong cash flow generation combined with a balanced capital allocation plan enables us to invest in new capabilities such as digital and growth such as new market development. We will apply disciplined rigor around driving strong returns and efficient use of capital as measured by ROIC. We look to return excess cash to shareholders while maintaining our investment-grade rating with a bias towards share repurchases.
Together, we have a tremendous opportunity to leverage the largest asset base in the industry to drive shareholder value. I couldn't be more excited about the future of the company. 
And with that, I'd like to ask Tom and Bob to return to the podium and take some questions. Zaheed, can you lead us there?"

We took some steps to address that through incentives by lifting up the importance of those roles, lifting to the those people. We brought a general management council into place to essentially help us forge our agenda. We're spending a lot of time looking at turnover rates by geography, by district throughout the country. So we made a lot of progress. And I mentioned in the prepared remarks, our turnover is down across the board in each of those 4 roles, dramatically. It was up significantly and now it's down year-on-year. And we're going to continue to pay attention to that because we know that if we can get continuity and we can get our people trained and skilled and knowledgeable, and really loving coming into work every day, that's going to make a difference over time.

I mean, obviously, hindsight 2020 and I think mine is as good as anyone else but I'll comment briefly on what I think is different about our plan. First of all, I'll say that I think our plan is dramatically different than we've seen",432,"Okay. Thanks, Brian. I mean, obviously, hindsight 2020 and I think mine is as good as anyone else but I'll comment briefly on what I think is different about our plan. First of all, I'll say that I think our plan is dramatically different than we've seen previously. I mean, in terms of what I've looked at, I would say there's a couple of big ones. The first one is that we are obsessed with the customer. Everybody on this stage is obsessed with the customer. We are going to drive that deep into the organization. We may have said we were obsessed with the customer in the past, but I think there's a lot of evidence that would say that we are not -- we were not obsessed with the customer in the past. And that's probably job one is to drive that, as I mentioned earlier, deep into the organization, ensure that it's a filter that we put every single decision that we make through the entire company. Secondly, we really didn't have a cohesive strategy that I could gather over the last several years. That caused us to make significant shifts in direction frequently over time. And when you're shifting a large organization of 75,000 people, it gets very difficult to get any kind of momentum around the agenda. Third, when you have that going on, it really starts to compromise the execution because you're trying different things and different priorities take a different level of energy at any given point in time. I can tell you the number of things that we were measuring was significant. The number of input metrics we were trying to accomplish was a very, very long list, and it did vary quarter in, quarter out. So that, over time, reduces the amount of accountability that people inside the organization have to deliver against those goals and it starts to compromise the overall ability to get things done and to achieve the margin expansion goals that were outlined. So I think those are the big things that I would observe. Customer service is going to be -- or obsession with the customer really going forward is our agenda. We have a cohesive strategy now. We're going to be focused on the operating metrics and execution that were required to deliver against that, and we do have to build the culture of the organization to be really focused on not just the customer but to have a very high level of accountability of ownership and drive for result, and that will be different going forward."

the conversions, the relocations, the openings, the closings, all of those things, and I'm an insights and analytics person. I want to really go deep on the metrics. What we said we were going to achieve with those goals. What we actually achieved, we look back over the time frame that they were initiated and we weren't comfortable, candidly, with the performance of the consolidations were in that time frame so we dramatically reduced them by about 1/3 based on what we originally piloted -- or sorry, planned at the time of the deal itself. And I feel really good about that decision because we're going to be able to drive market share and we're going to be able to retain employees, we've got some great people that work on the Carquest side of the business on the independent and the corporate side. So that I feel great about. The conversions, I will tell you I was in one last week, that has worked well because you're essentially adding DIY to what was formerly an entirely professional operation. And so we see obviously increased traffic associated with that. We're driving comps sales in that store. We're getting more professional business, so the conversions have been much more successful overall, so you'll see us actually accelerating some of the conversions to get more DIY business on that side. As for our goals, again, we're going to focus on the customer. You saw our market share, it's single digits, okay? There's a lot of food on the table for us to grow. We have $10 billion in sales in $135 billion market. We feel very good about our ability to gain market share overall in that time frame. Obviously, we don't ignore our competition. We look at it market by market but our belief is that staying absolutely laser focused on what's important to the customer is going to ultimately enable us to gain market share."

So again, we feel very good about that and that we're well positioned with the strength of the business that Bob has built with Worldpac in the next 5 years to help us really get after that opportunity. Some of the other things we showed are very much on our mind. None of them are kind of 5-year items. Whether you talk about the electrification, you talk about autonomous vehicles, you talk about some of those larger macro shifts, we don't see them impacting our core business in the next 5 years.

I mean, we want to make sure -- I mean, when you're talking about something as important as your store labor, which faces customers, it requires a tremendous amount of analytics upfront, rigorous testing, proven methodologies then you roll it out. So what I observed was we weren't really approaching it that way. And so we had to sort of reverse course on some of the things that we did. And early on, it's been very well received by our field organization. You have to listen what our region vice presidents, our district managers, our general managers in the stores are telling us. And as I went around, I mean, I tried to spend as much time in the stores as I can, and I do take a lot of notes and I listen to them when they tell me this is not driving my comps, it's -- it gives you the illusion of profitability because you're reducing cost and you're really just getting customers angry and they don't come back to your store. And then it's just a bit of a vicious circle. So we've been very thoughtful about our labor model. I think we've made a lot of progress on better aligning our hours to the demand, both on the DIY side and on the commercial side, and we'll continue to do that. We've got to make sure that we can service the customer with all of the things that they want, whether it's parking lot services or delivery frequency or when they want the part. We've got to have the labor there to fulfill the demand, and we've made pretty significant changes, I would say, in how we're approaching that."

I think May, something like that, May or June, I went to a couple of the facilities we have up there. What we did was we tried to impose a bit of a cookie-cutter approach to those distribution centers, and they really weren't engineered to do it. We had more stores than we should've assigned to them at a delivery frequency that was very difficult for them to execute flawlessly, and that created a very chaotic environment in the distribution center. We weren't able to fill orders properly. There was accuracy issues. Yes, we were delivering 5x to the stores. But if you asked the general managers of those stores, they would have said, ""Please, stop doing this because we were just -- it was a bit of a Lucy Show type thing going on. We just had stuff coming in and out, in and out, and we weren't getting the right part in the right place at the right time."" So we essentially unwound that. We went to 3x in those distribution centers. We got into a much better cadence with the stores. We executed our first one in August, okay? Then we went in September in the second one. We've now done all of them. So there's transition cost that we've incurred in the last couple of -- in the third quarter and will incur in the fourth quarter, by the way, as you move to this new system. And we're seeing much better fill rates, like significantly better, much better accuracy and the general managers are much happier and they're selling more. So it just goes back to the customer wants the right part in the right place at the right time. The customer doesn't say, ""Hello. Have you got 5x?"" They say, ""Have you got the right part?"" And when we're able to fulfill that part regardless of how we got it there, that's what they're looking for. So I was in both of those facilities in, what's this, October. I was in there in October. Totally different place. There's not stuff all over the place. We've got clean house. I can see down the aisles. It's kind of important to me in a distribution center. I don't want to see stuff laying on the loading docks. I mean, I give -- tip my hat to the teams in those DCs because they've really worked at it very hard and as a result, our customers are much happier."

It's a terrific opportunity to really standardize how costs are managed across the organization, and I would consider what we have in there a AAA bond.

It isn't a do better exercise. It's a change the physics exercise. We're not managing those costs the same way anymore. We're asking people to look at the cost in ways that have -- they haven't been looked at before. So those costs, we've got a very clear idea. Tom is running the control tower. We're very clear on where those costs are coming out. They're all -- they're across the P&L, Michael, so I can't call out specific things. They're really throughout the entire P&L. The supply chain obviously is a big area of opportunity. I mean, we just talked about one here: 5x to 3x. You deliver parts 3 times a week instead of 5 times a week. It costs less. And unless you have a really good effectiveness reason for doing it, which we didn't in that case, when we go from 5x to 3x, we save a lot of money. So we're going to continue to look for those types of opportunities, but that -- it's those types of things where, as I said earlier, the cost is coming out.

And so we're seeing, again, a good cross-section of parts there, mostly Asian versus high-end European, which, of course, is a Worldpac. But I would say for the most part, domestic, Asian and certainly some European Volkswagen, some Audi and so forth. But this is a good mix. But importantly, when you go to the market there, we're going to the customer with the answer that we have all of them -- all mix, all models across the entire enterprise and we're bringing that closer to the customer.

I'd like to welcome all of you to our event, both those of you here in the audience as well as those of you joining us on the webcast. We greatly appreciate your interest on our business and we're very excited to share our progress with you today. 
We'll start by providing a brief recap of the third quarter results, and then we'll transition to an overview of our strategic business plan. We've been developing this over the past several months. With that, let's get right into it.
Our comp store performance in Q3 was down 1%, as our initiatives to improve top line performance began to have an impact. While we delivered sequential improvement versus previous quarters, let me be clear, we will be relentless in our pursuit of positive comp sales.
In terms of profitability, our adjusted operating margin rate of 9.7% and adjusted EPS of $1.73 were impacted by 3 primary drivers, all of which we called out during our Q2 call: first, we made investments in the quarter to better serve our customers; secondly, we took deliberate actions to reduce inventory levels versus Q2, which resulted in cost headwinds. Going forward, we'll continue to bring our inventory levels down without disrupting our customers; and third, we faced higher supply chain operating expenses in the quarter, including our planned transition from 5x to 3x delivery frequency in selected markets.
As for our top line performance, while it's still early, we're encouraged by our sales improvement as the heightened focus on execution translated to improved input metrics and ultimately, sales. We remain relentlessly focused on execution, and we're going to make investments in customer service and availability to align our entire organization around the customer and around gaining market share.
To date, our investments have driven sales performance at a faster rate than expected. On our Q2 call, we called out back-half investments in 3 areas: in availability; in customer service; and in our front-line organizations. All 3 of these investments have been promising. In terms of availability, we have a number of initiatives underway that test different ways of positioning our inventory of assorting parts and of delivery parts to our customers. These tests are being conducted throughout our network. The initiatives all have the same endgame: get the right part in the right place at the right time, consistently, reliably and predictably.
As we work to improve availability, we're working to do so at less cost and with more availability.
We're testing these initiatives in multiple phases, and we're applying some of the learnings to our base business. So far, we like many aspects of what we're seeing, and we plan to roll out these initiatives in 2017. We also see elements of our test that we can leverage in the future, and we'll discuss the progress we're making on availability later when we review our strategic business plan.
In terms of investments in our customers, we're equally encouraged. This include investments in availability, in store labor and in a frontline incentive program. These investments enable our front-line team to compete at the absolute highest level and position them to win with our customers. In particular, the incentive program we launched has been extremely well received by our field team and almost immediately has had a step function impact on reducing turnover in all front-line roles. Our field team is fired up and they're increasing their focus on what matters most to our valued customers.
In summary, we're encouraged by the investments we've made in availability, in our customers and in our front-line team. On a regional basis, we saw comp sales improvement in every region in the country. While performance in the Northeast and Great Lakes still lag our overall business, it improved our [ph] actions to improve performance and some of our more challenged distribution centers paid off. Our teams in these regions are excited about the changes as we're giving them the chance to say yes, to our customers more often.
To sum up Q3, we're encouraged by the progress we're making and the momentum that is building behind our efforts. That said, we still have a significant amount of work to do to dramatically change the trajectory of our business. Accordingly, we're maintaining a very disciplined approach to improving customer service as it's absolutely vital that we get this right for the long term.
We're focused on delivering consistent sales and profit improvement over the long term, not just the next quarter. We'll continue to sharpen our focus on execution, improve availability and deliver on the needs of our customers as we execute our strategy.
I'll be back up shortly to provide an update on our strategic plan. But before I do, it's my absolute pleasure to introduce Tom Okray to give a brief third quarter update on our financial and operational highlights. Tom brings more than 25 years of experience in finance, operations and supply chain to AAP. Most recently, he served as VP, Finance, Global Customer Fulfillment at Amazon, where he was the finance lead overseeing the optimization of all key elements of Amazon's global fulfillment network. In addition, Tom spent over 20 years at General Motors in finance and supply chain-related roles. He was most recently responsible for overseeing more than $120 billion in annual expenses, and $8 billion in CapEx as CFO, global product development, purchasing and supply chain. 
Tom is absolutely passionate about winning in the marketplace and he is laser focused on what matters most to our customers. He knows what it takes to win in the digital world, and he's bringing an entirely new dimension to our thinking as we navigate the future. We're thrilled to be joined by Tom, given his unique background and deep operating experience as we write the next chapter of growth for AAP. Tom?"

Before I begin my prepared remarks, I just want to briefly share how thrilled I am to be a part of the AAP team. I've joined the organization at a very exciting time as we refocus the company on our most important priority, the customer. We will work to improve our service levels, our overall execution and without a doubt, our operating and financial performance. I'd also want to thank Mike Norona for assisting with my transition and our third quarter financial close.
Total sales for to third quarter decreased 2% to $2.25 billion, principally driven by our comp store sales decline of 1%, store closures and Carquest consolidations. The declines were partially offset by growth at Worldpac, store conversions and new stores. Our gross profit rate decline of 104 basis points was primarily driven by higher supply chain expenses and headwinds associated with reducing inventory. Our adjusted SG&A rate was essentially flat year-over-year, driven by continued cost reduction initiatives, partially offset by investments in delighting our customers.
All in, our third quarter adjusted operating income came in at $217.6 million; adjusted operating margin decreased 95 basis points over the same period last year to 9.7%; operating cash flow through the third quarter was $409.4 million versus $520.1 million last year, primarily driven by an increase in inventory versus last year and lower sales. While we have not provided an annual EPS outlook, we'd like to give some context on how we're thinking about the balance of the year.
We're encouraged by our sales improvement in Q3. However, it's early and we have a lot more work to do. Additionally, as you may know, our fourth quarter is our lowest volume and most volatile quarter of the fiscal year. We expect continued headwinds in our operating margin rate similar to what we experienced in the third quarter. As we continue to invest in our customers, our inventory and optimize our supply chain network. 
That wraps up our third quarter recap. We're going to transition to discussing elements of our strategic business plan. With that, I'll turn it over to Tom Greco."

This plan has been several months in the making and we couldn't be more excited about our prospects for the future. Our plan is deeply rooted in focused consumer and customer research for both DIY customers and professional customers. Our goal is to dramatically improve performance across the board through a step change in customer service. 
Please understand we'd like to share as much of our plan as we possibly can with you. At the same time, we feel it's in our business interest of all concerned that we're careful on just how much we share about our plan for competitive reasons. Also understand that if you're left wanting for more details, we've spent considerable time analyzing the pros and cons of doing so, and we can conclude that it's not in our or our shareholders' best interest to do so. That said, we've got a very compelling plan that capitalize on the enormous growth opportunity that we have at AAP, and we're excited to share our plan to deliver improved results and shareholder value.
Before we get started, I know this might be the first time we're getting to know each other. There's some new people in new positions at Advance and for some of you, this includes me. Stepping back and with the benefit of my first 6 months in the role along with 30 -- close to 30 years of experience at PepsiCo and Frito-Lay, I'm confident we're in a great position to capitalize on the opportunity ahead. Many of the ingredients for success that I enjoyed at PepsiCo are transferable here: constructing a demand-driven growth agenda that's rooted in customer and consumer insights; transforming the supply chain to build new capabilities and drive productivity; and empowering the frontline organization to drive execution and operating improvement. Without question, I see the application of each of these learnings here at Advance.
In fact, there's more opportunity to drive growth and productivity at AAP than any role that I've ever had. We'll discuss the opportunities that we see going forward throughout the presentation. It's also my pleasure today to introduce Bob Cushing, right there in the middle of the slide. Bob recently assumed the newly created role of Executive Vice President, Professional Sales, where he'll oversee all of the company's professional sales operations including Advance, Carquest, Autopart International and, of course, Worldpac.
Today we're rebranding what was formerly known as our commercial business to professional. Professional is a name that our customers prefer. And as a result, that's the name we're going to use going forward. Bob's perfectly suited to head up this business. He's an exceptionally talented industry veteran with over 30 years of experience in the industry and he's been the driving force behind the tremendous growth and market-leading position that Worldpac enjoys today. Importantly, Bob is very competitive. You're going to see that today. He's going to be relentless in driving outcomes and expect nothing less than the best as he instill the high-performing culture and make sure we execute to win in the marketplace. In addition to Bob, later in the presentation, you'll hear once again from Tom with the discussion on how our strategy translates to an outlook for the future. So let's get started.
I'd like to begin with what we'd like you to take away from today's event. First, we operate in a terrific industry. It's a large and growing, with attractive dynamics across the board. Secondly, AAP has a very compelling market position, including industry-leading assets, tools and capabilities for us to leverage. Third, we have a tremendous opportunity to drive growth and margin expansion but to do so, we need to implement real change. Not just a change in operations but a real change in culture. We have to focus on the customer first and begin our journey for everything we do with how we can provide the best possible service for our customers. And fourth, we're already executing a clear focused agenda to drive change. Fifth, overseeing this effort is an aggressive leadership team that's fully aligned around our plan. In summary, one can only conclude that AAP represents a compelling investment with tremendous opportunity to deliver shareholder value.
So let's start with the fact that we compete in $135 billion industry that's experienced strong growth for several years, and we see no end in sight. Industry forecast predict consistent growth over the next 5 years led by professional. For certain, the industry continues to benefit from an increase in vehicles in operation, an increase in average age of vehicles, an increase in older vehicles and an increase in average miles driven per year. These industry fundamentals will drive strong growth for the industry for years to come.
In addition to industry fundamentals, AAP is well-positioned to gain market share. We have many advantages, including: a company-owned professional business; an extensive North American footprint of fulfillment centers and stores; and the leading distributors of import parts. Clearly, we have the assets to succeed and accelerate growth but to do so, we need to better utilize those assets to our advantage. Without question, AAP has a substantial market share opportunity.
We're also keenly aware of evolving industry trends including e-commerce, technology, electrification, urbanization, ridesharing and autonomous vehicles. As a result, we're excited by the opportunity of today and the opportunities of tomorrow as we construct our strategic growth agenda. With disruption comes opportunity.
Whatever we do, we must delight the customer. Everything we do starts and stops with the customer. In building our plan, we knew we had to develop a deep and visceral understanding of the customer and deliver on their needs. Over the last few months, we conducted the most significant piece of research our company has ever undertaken. We've spent a tremendous amount of time to understand what delights both professional customers and DIY customers. Of course, ultimately we must turn those insights into actions. Our professional customers are looking for high-quality parts at the time we promise them. We understand this opportunity and it's unquestionably achievable for AAP. The DIYer needs vary widely by vehicle history, repair complexity and their level of expertise. This requires a very focused agenda for our Team Members. Armed with these insights, we've developed a strategy and a series of initiatives to delight both professional customers and DIY customers. The initiatives are focused on making sure we have the right part in the right place at the right time and creating a better overall experience for all of our customers.
This leads to the big planks of our agenda. First, building an advantage supply-chain is the cornerstone of our efforts as we improve availability, delivery consistency and speed to delight our customers. Secondly, in professional, we're building a dramatic improvement in the customer experience at every single touch point as we ramp up sales and service capabilities. Next, in DIY, we're planning changes to improve the in-store experience and drive loyalty as well as a reinvention of our online experience. Fourth, our growth agenda will be supported by a robust and ongoing productivity engine that will enable us to expand margins and fuel our growth for years to come. At the center of all this, of course, is our talent and our culture, which will support and facilitate our ability to execute each initiative.
Let's begin with supply chain. A robust and highly functioning supply chain is absolutely foundational to our success. To achieve this, we plan to leverage our existing supply chain assets. The key in constructing the advantage supply chain is to build new capabilities to improve availability, delivery consistency and speed and drive growth while removing unnecessary costs. 
I'm highly confident we can achieve this at AAP. We have a very strong asset base in terms of square footage, inventory and delivery trucks but they are not optimized today. We will optimize our assets to delight our customers. We have been conducting numerous test and learn initiatives over the past few months. In our business, having the right part at the right time is essential. It's table stakes for competing in the industry. As a matter of fact, a few years ago, the Worldpac team actually trademarked the tagline, the right part at the right time. 
Our test and learn markets are delivering very positive results. This includes a significant increase in in-market parts availability, a significant decrease in order-to-delivery time and overall reduction in inventory and days on hand, all while increasing availability. Our customers are taking notice, and I quote, ""whatever you guys are doing, it's working for me. I get parts quicker, cars spend less time on the list so I get more jobs done."" The bottom line here is that our changes are leading to increased sales, lower cost, lower inventory levels and higher customer satisfaction.
In addition to our test and learn initiatives, we have an opportunity to streamline our supply chain network and systems. Simplification of our supply chain enables us to get the Advance and Carquest supply chain and network fully integrated. This provides 3 primary benefits: first, streamlining our supply chain improves product availability; secondly, it drives significant productivity by reducing stem miles from DC to store; and third, it simplifies our systems and processes by enabling seamless inventory transfer throughout the value chain, which is a huge benefit for our Team Members and independent partners. Therefore, what we formally referred to as our integration plan is now fully embedded in our ongoing strategic business plan. As such, we're no longer going to be discussing progress on integration. We're one company now and everyone is focused on the customer.
Bottom line, there's no longer discussion about integration but more about how do we use our supply chain assets better and rethinking the system to better fulfill customer demand and more efficiently get more parts closer to more customers.
Now turning to our professional growth opportunity. We're ramping up sales and customer service capabilities, big time. And I'd like to invite Bob Cushing to review our exciting plans for professional customers."

In my early observations, I recognize the tremendous opportunities that exist today to accelerate our growth. In my new role, I'll drive improved performance across the enterprise by leveraging my experience and our proven capabilities highly coveted by our customers.
My goal is to completely transform our customers sales and service model, both online and in person on the professional side of our business. I will be highly focused on improving the overall customer experience to dramatically improve our first call and first click capability. 
As I've looked across AAP, I found many assets that are totally under leveraged. So it all starts with attractive brand portfolio. And our customers have spoken, they want high-quality branded parts to service their customers. And our research confirmed that AAP's part assortment consistently delivers against this objective more than any other supplier. While we're pleased with the results, we will continue to work diligently to delight our customers.
Additionally over the past 40 years, we have developed an industry-leading selection of private label products to meet the needs of our professional customer. AAP's private label brand support our multi-brand strategy, which is what's preferred by our professional customer. So when you look, we start with a significant growth opportunity from a solid base of domestic vehicles in operation and importantly, for our customers, we're ahead of the curve on the growing import opportunity. The vehicle import market share has -- is expected to grow dramatically as it has over the past 15 years. This will provide a tremendous growth opportunity for AAP across the entire enterprise.
We have the import expertise with Worldpac and Autopart International. We have delivered this and basically built the leading import program for the past 40 years.
Another asset we can leverage better is our training. Our customers want professional training to help grow and improve the profitability and grow their business. Their technicians need advanced technical training to meet the demands of diagnosing and repairing today's and tomorrow's vehicles. We already have 2 great tools today: we have the CARQUEST Technical Institute; and we have the WORLDPAC Training Institute, which is focused on the import side. Again, the opportunity I just described. Together, the CARQUEST and WORLDPAC Training Institutes provide the professional customer the most comprehensive training curriculum in the industry and it's only, only available at AAP.
In today's digital world, serving professional customers has to start with an industry-leading online experience, and we have a great online assets at Worldpac today. In a research that we conducted, our online experience was rated best-in-class by our customers. This performance was also recognized by Frost & Sullivan Research, which found automotive technicians rank Worldpac as the best program distributor with the comprehensive line of quality products, easy-to-use online system with the speedDIAL, outstanding salespeople, competitive pricing, dependable delivery and consistent product availability. I cannot be more proud of the team for this accomplishment. But as we look forward, the only way we'll leverage this great suite of assets is to put the customer first, always. This has been really important to my entire career, listening to customers, responding to them and providing them what they need: high-quality product assortment; delivery service that's fast and consistent; technology to drive growth needs of doing business; providing our customers with an industry-leading catalog; a sales team dedicated to delighting the customer; and training to enable our customers to grow their business.
So now it is our time to shift into high gear. We will knit together and leverage best practices across all of AAP's professional business going forward. I know there are better ways to integrate our supply chain. I know we can leverage our catalog and technology to create a better online experience and for certain, we will build a more robust sales and customer service culture at AAP. And by the way, we're already doing it. In fact, we just solidified a multiyear agreement with one of the largest customers who was really pleased with the new AAP approach, and I quote the customer, ""We chose Advance professional based upon their overall enterprise value. The combination of product coverage, local availability, technician training, technology as well as competitive pricing made them the right choice both now and into the future. They have a proven track record of great customer service and consistent execution across a large geographic area, which makes them the right strategic partner for the business.""
The entire AAP team could not be more excited about taking our professional sales to the next level, and we know there's a significant market share opportunity for us as we execute our plan, and we will deliver it. At this point, I'll take you back to Tom. Thank you."

So now you see why we're so excited about professional. Now I'm going to talk DIY, and we're a little further along in our journey to accelerate professional than we are in DIY, and while we continue to strengthen the DIY plan, we're already seeing",1260,"Okay. So now you see why we're so excited about professional. Now I'm going to talk DIY, and we're a little further along in our journey to accelerate professional than we are in DIY, and while we continue to strengthen the DIY plan, we're already seeing signs of improvement in our DIY sales as we really get focused on the customer.
Just like inside professional, our DIY success begins with putting the customer first in everything that we do. We have to build trust, confidence and loyalty with DIYers all over the country. We leverage some custom, significant research we conducted with DIY customers, and our plan is to delight them at every touch point. Across the board, we're improving parts availability. We're building engagement platforms that drive traffic. We're ensuring a consistent in-store experience to drive frequency. We're focusing our training on priority segments to build knowledge and capability. And we're revamping our Speed Perks loyalty program. We're also increasing our investment in mobile and digital to seamlessly connect the online and in-store experience, all of which have the common goal of gaining market share.
First, we plan to grow our customer base. We've analyzed our business over the past several years and we have a very clear idea what's been driving our challenges with traffic and sales growth inside of DIY. Some of the factors driving the decisions on how DIYers choose an auto parts retailer include vehicle history, repair complexity and their level of expertise. From this, we've identified priority segments where we're confident we have the right to succeed. Meeting the needs of these customers will require thoughtful planning around labor, training and marketing. We're excited about attracting new customers to AAP with targeted marketing and a wider array of services.
Next, we'll drive frequency with existing customers. Speed Perks is entering its third full year. To date, we haven't been leveraging the scale of this program as well as we should and will going forward. Our plan is to build customer loyalty with Speed Perks. We now have millions of Speed Perks members, which gives us a deeper understanding of their lifetime value. We're learning more and more about how these customers want to be engaged, and we're building momentum around new ways to cultivate a much stronger relationship with these customers by leveraging insights and analytics around our individual needs and behaviors. Just one additional trip per year by each Speed Perks member results in a tremendous growth number for AAP.
Finally, winning in DIY requires us to improve the overall experience for our customers, both in-store and online. Critically important to achieving this goal is to address the basics of the business. We have to raise our standards on execution. This includes ramping up discipline inside the store and rededicating ourselves to a consistent and exceptional customer experience every single time. We also must ensure that we serve our customers when and how they want to be served, which means elevating our online experience. The end result will be a much better experience for DIYers in every interaction they have with AAP in person, over the phone or online, enabling us to build customer trust, confidence and loyalty.
Our customers have been telling us that we're making progress in DIY. In the past few months, we've seen an increase in the number of complementary letters from DIYers all over the country. To read just one, ""your manager and his staff were so nice and so helpful in what was, for me, a very stressful situation. His actions have made me an Advance Auto Parts customer for life.""
In summary, our team is energized to better serve the DIYer. And just like in professional, there's a significant market share opportunity in DIY with improved execution.
Between the transformation of our supply chain, building out new capabilities in professional and improving the overall experience for DIYers, we're very bullish on our ability to sequentially accelerate our top line performance going forward just like we did in Q3 of this year.
Now let's talk productivity. Accelerated productivity will fund our journey. In order to sustain investment in growth, a robust productivity engine is absolutely essential. We've gone up and down every single cost line in the entire enterprise to construct our productivity plan. It spans 6 major categories and will contribute meaningfully to profit growth. The categories we've targeted are: distribute, ship as it ship, run as it pertains to stores, deliver, sell and support. Please note that while we're removing unnecessary costs, we're also driving new capabilities and investing in long-term growth creation.
Our current productivity build delivers $500 million in cost reduction over 5 years. To be clear, this is a gross number. Some of this will be used to fund our growth and transformation initiatives so not all of this will flow directly to the bottom line. You'll see the impact of the reinvestment of our productivity savings in improving operating margin over the period of the plan.
Our productivity agenda includes 3 important areas of focus: first, zero-based budgeting, where we're eliminating waste and standardizing our approach to cost control. Secondly, as I mentioned earlier, we plan to streamline our supply chain to drive both effectiveness and efficiency. Simplifying, optimizing and fully leveraging our existing asset base yields big savings in our plan. Finally, we have initiated a substantial piece of work on material input costs. As part of this, we'll leverage procurement and value engineering to round out the big blanks of our agenda.
Bottom line, we're entering 2017 with a very high level of confidence in our productivity pipeline. In addition, we're very much looking forward to having Tom Okray provide his perspective given his extensive experience in large organizations where productivity and cost management play a central role.
Finally, I'd like to touch on talent, culture and capability. Across the organization, you can expect us to be maniacally focused on growing talent, evolving our culture and building new capabilities. Specifically, we'll grow talent by developing much more robust leadership development programs for our existing leaders. We're also promoting talented leaders who know the parts business full and have the capability to do more. And importantly, we've done a great deal of work on evolving the culture of the company. This includes building a culture which is obsessively focused on the customer and one with an exceedingly high level of accountability of ownership and drive for results.
Related to this, our leadership team has spent time looking at incentives and ways to empower all of our team members to act like owners. As an example, turnover. We put a tremendous focus on reducing turnover, and I'm pleased to inform you that we were down significantly in Q3 versus previous year in each of the key roles in the field.
Finally, we're defining the new capabilities we need across the entire enterprise. Where we lack the talent internally, we're going outside to find people who have industry-leading capabilities that we can leverage, and we've already hired several people from outside of AAP that are bringing an entirely new dimension to our thinking as we prepare for the future.
In summary, over the next 5 years, our plan delivers sequential top line sales improvement, $500 million in gross productivity; substantial margin expansion; and world-class talent, culture and capabilities, which will future fit AAP for years to come.
Now it's my pleasure to invite Tom back on the stage to give you a high-level view of how our plan translates to an outlook."

The opportunities Tom and Bob discussed to deliver improved results are familiar to me. I'm used to putting the customer first always. And I know we can drive accelerated sales growth and margin expansion included in our plan.
Turning to the financial impact of our plan. For 2017, we will deliver positive sales comp growth and a modest increase in operating margin. By 2021, our plan delivers mid-single-digit comp sales and at least 500 basis points of margin expansion. As Tom previously discussed, we're building a platform to enable sustainable growth and operating leverage. To achieve that goal, we've worked backwards from the customer and balanced our efforts to achieve growth, reduce cost and efficiencies throughout the organization. Importantly, we're also focused on delivering shareholder value. We will deliver strong operating performance, which will generate strong cash flow improvement. Further, we have tremendous focus on working capital. This includes optimizing our inventory in the our payables, which will result in a dramatic improvement in AP ratio. A strong cash flow generation combined with a balanced capital allocation plan enables us to invest in new capabilities such as digital and growth such as new market development. We will apply disciplined rigor around driving strong returns and efficient use of capital as measured by ROIC. We look to return excess cash to shareholders while maintaining our investment-grade rating with a bias towards share repurchases.
Together, we have a tremendous opportunity to leverage the largest asset base in the industry to drive shareholder value. I couldn't be more excited about the future of the company. 
And with that, I'd like to ask Tom and Bob to return to the podium and take some questions. Zaheed, can you lead us there?"

We took some steps to address that through incentives by lifting up the importance of those roles, lifting to the those people. We brought a general management council into place to essentially help us forge our agenda. We're spending a lot of time looking at turnover rates by geography, by district throughout the country. So we made a lot of progress. And I mentioned in the prepared remarks, our turnover is down across the board in each of those 4 roles, dramatically. It was up significantly and now it's down year-on-year.

I mean, obviously, hindsight 2020 and I think mine is as good as anyone else but I'll comment briefly on what I think is different about our plan. First of all, I'll say that I think our plan is dramatically different than we've seen",432,"Okay. Thanks, Brian. I mean, obviously, hindsight 2020 and I think mine is as good as anyone else but I'll comment briefly on what I think is different about our plan. First of all, I'll say that I think our plan is dramatically different than we've seen previously. I mean, in terms of what I've looked at, I would say there's a couple of big ones. The first one is that we are obsessed with the customer. Everybody on this stage is obsessed with the customer. We are going to drive that deep into the organization. We may have said we were obsessed with the customer in the past, but I think there's a lot of evidence that would say that we are not -- we were not obsessed with the customer in the past. And that's probably job one is to drive that, as I mentioned earlier, deep into the organization, ensure that it's a filter that we put every single decision that we make through the entire company. Secondly, we really didn't have a cohesive strategy that I could gather over the last several years. That caused us to make significant shifts in direction frequently over time. And when you're shifting a large organization of 75,000 people, it gets very difficult to get any kind of momentum around the agenda. Third, when you have that going on, it really starts to compromise the execution because you're trying different things and different priorities take a different level of energy at any given point in time. I can tell you the number of things that we were measuring was significant. The number of input metrics we were trying to accomplish was a very, very long list, and it did vary quarter in, quarter out. So that, over time, reduces the amount of accountability that people inside the organization have to deliver against those goals and it starts to compromise the overall ability to get things done and to achieve the margin expansion goals that were outlined. So I think those are the big things that I would observe. Customer service is going to be -- or obsession with the customer really going forward is our agenda. We have a cohesive strategy now. We're going to be focused on the operating metrics and execution that were required to deliver against that, and we do have to build the culture of the organization to be really focused on not just the customer but to have a very high level of accountability of ownership and drive for result, and that will be different going forward."

the conversions, the relocations, the openings, the closings, all of those things, and I'm an insights and analytics person. I want to really go deep on the metrics. What we said we were going to achieve with those goals. What we actually achieved, we look back over the time frame that they were initiated and we weren't comfortable, candidly, with the performance of the consolidations were in that time frame so we dramatically reduced them by about 1/3 based on what we originally piloted -- or sorry, planned at the time of the deal itself. And I feel really good about that decision because we're going to be able to drive market share and we're going to be able to retain employees, we've got some great people that work on the Carquest side of the business on the independent and the corporate side. So that I feel great about. The conversions, I will tell you I was in one last week, that has worked well because you're essentially adding DIY to what was formerly an entirely professional operation. And so we see obviously increased traffic associated with that. We're driving comps sales in that store. We're getting more professional business, so the conversions have been much more successful overall, so you'll see us actually accelerating some of the conversions to get more DIY business on that side. As for our goals, again, we're going to focus on the customer. You saw our market share, it's single digits, okay? There's a lot of food on the table for us to grow. We have $10 billion in sales in $135 billion market. We feel very good about our ability to gain market share overall in that time frame. Obviously, we don't ignore our competition. We look at it market by market but our belief is that staying absolutely laser focused on what's important to the customer is going to ultimately enable us to gain market share."

If you think, Alan, about the different parts of the business that have come together over time through acquisition, we actually have a pretty impressive footprint. We just have treated them very vertically as opposed to horizontally is what I would say. And you're going to see us look for opportunities to better integrate the entirety of our supply chain assets. DCs, over the road, our store delivery fleet which you know, the stores of the Worldpac branches. We've got a lot of different assets that are out there that have handled things very, very -- in a very siloed fashion, and we see opportunities to better integrate those. And that may mean over time, we're going to be able to leverage those assets in a better way."

So again, we feel very good about that and that we're well positioned with the strength of the business that Bob has built with Worldpac in the next 5 years to help us really get after that opportunity. Some of the other things we showed are very much on our mind. None of them are kind of 5-year items. Whether you talk about the electrification, you talk about autonomous vehicles, you talk about some of those larger macro shifts, we don't see them impacting our core business in the next 5 years.

And I think we may have rushed a little bit in terms of the execution of that, which is an opportunity for us going forward. I mean, we want to make sure -- I mean, when you're talking about something as important as your store labor, which faces customers, it requires a tremendous amount of analytics upfront, rigorous testing, proven methodologies then you roll it out. So what I observed was we weren't really approaching it that way. And so we had to sort of reverse course on some of the things that we did. And early on, it's been very well received by our field organization. You have to listen what our region vice presidents, our district managers, our general managers in the stores are telling us. And as I went around, I mean, I tried to spend as much time in the stores as I can, and I do take a lot of notes and I listen to them when they tell me this is not driving my comps, it's -- it gives you the illusion of profitability because you're reducing cost and you're really just getting customers angry and they don't come back to your store. And then it's just a bit of a vicious circle. So we've been very thoughtful about our labor model. I think we've made a lot of progress on better aligning our hours to the demand, both on the DIY side and on the commercial side, and we'll continue to do that. We've got to make sure that we can service the customer with all of the things that they want, whether it's parking lot services or delivery frequency or when they want the part. We've got to have the labor there to fulfill the demand, and we've made pretty significant changes, I would say, in how we're approaching that."

I think May, something like that, May or June, I went to a couple of the facilities we have up there. What we did was we tried to impose a bit of a cookie-cutter approach to those distribution centers, and they really weren't engineered to do it. We had more stores than we should've assigned to them at a delivery frequency that was very difficult for them to execute flawlessly, and that created a very chaotic environment in the distribution center. We weren't able to fill orders properly. There was accuracy issues. Yes, we were delivering 5x to the stores. But if you asked the general managers of those stores, they would have said, ""Please, stop doing this because we were just -- it was a bit of a Lucy Show type thing going on. We just had stuff coming in and out, in and out, and we weren't getting the right part in the right place at the right time."" So we essentially unwound that. We went to 3x in those distribution centers. We got into a much better cadence with the stores. We executed our first one in August, okay? Then we went in September in the second one. We've now done all of them. So there's transition cost that we've incurred in the last couple of -- in the third quarter and will incur in the fourth quarter, by the way, as you move to this new system. And we're seeing much better fill rates, like significantly better, much better accuracy and the general managers are much happier and they're selling more. So it just goes back to the customer wants the right part in the right place at the right time. The customer doesn't say, ""Hello. Have you got 5x?"" They say, ""Have you got the right part?"" And when we're able to fulfill that part regardless of how we got it there, that's what they're looking for. So I was in both of those facilities in, what's this, October. I was in there in October. Totally different place. There's not stuff all over the place. We've got clean house. I can see down the aisles. It's kind of important to me in a distribution center. I don't want to see stuff laying on the loading docks. I mean, I give -- tip my hat to the teams in those DCs because they've really worked at it very hard and as a result, our customers are much happier."

It's a terrific opportunity to really standardize how costs are managed across the organization, and I would consider what we have in there a AAA bond.

It isn't a do better exercise. It's a change the physics exercise. We're not managing those costs the same way anymore. We're asking people to look at the cost in ways that have -- they haven't been looked at before. So those costs, we've got a very clear idea. Tom is running the control tower. We're very clear on where those costs are coming out. They're all -- they're across the P&L, Michael, so I can't call out specific things. They're really throughout the entire P&L. The supply chain obviously is a big area of opportunity. I mean, we just talked about one here: 5x to 3x. You deliver parts 3 times a week instead of 5 times a week. It costs less. And unless you have a really good effectiveness reason for doing it, which we didn't in that case, when we go from 5x to 3x, we save a lot of money. So we're going to continue to look for those types of opportunities, but that -- it's those types of things where, as I said earlier, the cost is coming out.

And importantly, because many of the stores have access to the Worldpac assortment, we're measuring all of that activity and then basically working with the merchandising team to push those parts closer to the store, so that will get it closer to the customer without having to have that extra touch. And so we're seeing, again, a good cross-section of parts there, mostly Asian versus high-end European, which, of course, is a Worldpac. But I would say for the most part, domestic, Asian and certainly some European Volkswagen, some Audi and so forth. But this is a good mix. But importantly, when you go to the market there, we're going to the customer with the answer that we have all of them -- all mix, all models across the entire enterprise and we're bringing that closer to the customer. So as that develops and evolves, we'll continue to build the inventory to support that activity market by market, capturing all the lookups and on the online, which we do at Worldpac today, and certainly capture all the call-ins as well. So that's going to be dynamic, dynamic inventory. Whatever the calls are out there for the customer development side, we're going to have the part closer to the customer."

I'd like to welcome all of you to our event, both those of you here in the audience as well as those of you joining us on the webcast. We greatly appreciate your interest on our business and we're very excited to share our progress with you today. 
We'll start by providing a brief recap of the third quarter results, and then we'll transition to an overview of our strategic business plan. We've been developing this over the past several months. With that, let's get right into it.
Our comp store performance in Q3 was down 1%, as our initiatives to improve top line performance began to have an impact. While we delivered sequential improvement versus previous quarters, let me be clear, we will be relentless in our pursuit of positive comp sales.
In terms of profitability, our adjusted operating margin rate of 9.7% and adjusted EPS of $1.73 were impacted by 3 primary drivers, all of which we called out during our Q2 call: first, we made investments in the quarter to better serve our customers; secondly, we took deliberate actions to reduce inventory levels versus Q2, which resulted in cost headwinds. Going forward, we'll continue to bring our inventory levels down without disrupting our customers; and third, we faced higher supply chain operating expenses in the quarter, including our planned transition from 5x to 3x delivery frequency in selected markets.
As for our top line performance, while it's still early, we're encouraged by our sales improvement as the heightened focus on execution translated to improved input metrics and ultimately, sales. We remain relentlessly focused on execution, and we're going to make investments in customer service and availability to align our entire organization around the customer and around gaining market share.
To date, our investments have driven sales performance at a faster rate than expected. On our Q2 call, we called out back-half investments in 3 areas: in availability; in customer service; and in our front-line organizations. All 3 of these investments have been promising. In terms of availability, we have a number of initiatives underway that test different ways of positioning our inventory of assorting parts and of delivering parts to our customers. These tests are being conducted throughout our network. The initiatives all have the same endgame: get the right part in the right place at the right time, consistently, reliably and predictably.
As we work to improve availability, we're working to do so at less cost and with more availability.
We're testing these initiatives in multiple phases, and we're applying some of the learnings to our base business. So far, we like many aspects of what we're seeing, and we plan to roll out these initiatives in 2017. We also see elements of our test that we can leverage in the future, and we'll discuss the progress we're making on availability later when we review our strategic business plan.
In terms of investments in our customers, we're equally encouraged. This include investments in availability, in store labor and in a frontline incentive program. These investments enable our front-line team to compete at the absolute highest level and position them to win with our customers. In particular, the incentive program we launched has been extremely well received by our field team and almost immediately has had a step function impact on reducing turnover in all front-line roles. Our field team is fired up and they're increasing their focus on what matters most to our valued customers.
In summary, we're encouraged by the investments we've made in availability, in our customers and in our front-line team. On a regional basis, we saw comp sales improvement in every region in the country. While performance in the Northeast and Great Lakes still lagged our overall business, it improved as our actions to improve performance and some of our more challenged distribution centers paid off. Our teams in these regions are excited about the changes as we're giving them the chance to say yes to our customers more often.
To sum up Q3, we're encouraged by the progress we're making and the momentum that is building behind our efforts. That said, we still have a significant amount of work to do to dramatically change the trajectory of our business. Accordingly, we're maintaining a very disciplined approach to improving customer service as it's absolutely vital that we get this right for the long term.
We're focused on delivering consistent sales and profit improvement over the long term, not just the next quarter. We'll continue to sharpen our focus on execution, improve availability and deliver on the needs of our customers as we execute our strategy.
I'll be back up shortly to provide an update on our strategic plan. But before I do, it's my absolute pleasure to introduce Tom Okray to give a brief third quarter update on our financial and operational highlights. Tom brings more than 25 years of experience in finance, operations and supply chain to AAP. Most recently, he served as VP, Finance, Global Customer Fulfillment at Amazon, where he was the finance lead overseeing the optimization of all key elements of Amazon's global fulfillment network. In addition, Tom spent over 20 years at General Motors in finance and supply chain-related roles. He was most recently responsible for overseeing more than $120 billion in annual expenses, and $8 billion in CapEx as CFO, global product development, purchasing and supply chain. 
Tom is absolutely passionate about winning in the marketplace and he is laser focused on what matters most to our customers. He knows what it takes to win in the digital world, and he's bringing an entirely new dimension to our thinking as we navigate the future. We're thrilled to be joined by Tom, given his unique background and deep operating experience as we write the next chapter of growth for AAP. Tom?"

Before I begin my prepared remarks, I just want to briefly share how thrilled I am to be a part of the AAP team. I've joined the organization at a very exciting time as we refocus the company on our most important priority, the customer. We will work to improve our service levels, our overall execution and without a doubt, our operating and financial performance. I'd also want to thank Mike Norona for assisting with my transition and our third quarter financial close.
Total sales for to third quarter decreased 2% to $2.25 billion, principally driven by our comp store sales decline of 1%, store closures and Carquest consolidations. The declines were partially offset by growth at Worldpac, store conversions and new stores. Our gross profit rate decline of 104 basis points was primarily driven by higher supply chain expenses and headwinds associated with reducing inventory. Our adjusted SG&A rate was essentially flat year-over-year, driven by continued cost reduction initiatives, partially offset by investments in delighting our customer.
All in, our third quarter adjusted operating income came in at $217.6 million; adjusted operating margin decreased 95 basis points over the same period last year to 9.7%; operating cash flow through the third quarter was $409.4 million versus $520.1 million last year, primarily driven by an increase in inventory versus last year and lower sales. While we have not provided an annual EPS outlook, we'd like to give some context on how we're thinking about the balance of the year.
We're encouraged by our sales improvement in Q3. However, it's early and we have a lot of work to do. Additionally, as you may know, our fourth quarter is our lowest volume and most volatile quarter of the fiscal year. We expect continued headwinds in our operating margin rate similar to what we experienced in the third quarter as we continue to invest in our customers, our inventory and optimize our supply chain network. 
That wraps up our third quarter recap. We're going to transition to discussing elements of our strategic business plan. With that, I'll turn it over to Tom Greco."

This plan has been several months in the making and we couldn't be more excited about our prospects for the future. Our plan is deeply rooted in focused consumer and customer research for both DIY customers and professional customers. Our goal is to dramatically improve performance across the board through a step change in customer service. 
Please understand we'd like to share as much of our plan as we possibly can with you. At the same time, we feel it's in our business interest of all concerned that we're careful on just how much we share about our plan for competitive reasons. Also understand that if you're left wanting for more details, we've spent considerable time analyzing the pros and cons of doing so, and we can conclude that it's not in our or our shareholders' best interest to do so. That said, we've got a very compelling plan that capitalize on the enormous growth opportunity that we have at AAP, and we're excited to share our plan to deliver improved results and shareholder value.
Before we get started, I know this might be the first time we're getting to know each other. There's some new people in new positions at Advance and for some of you, this includes me. Stepping back and with the benefit of my first 6 months in the role along with 30 -- close to 30 years of experience at PepsiCo and Frito-Lay, I'm confident we're in a great position to capitalize on the opportunity ahead. Many of the ingredients for success that I enjoyed at PepsiCo are transferable here: constructing a demand-driven growth agenda that's rooted in customer and consumer insights; transforming the supply chain to build new capabilities and drive productivity; and empowering the frontline organization to drive execution and operating improvement. Without question, I see the application of each of these learnings here at Advance.
In fact, there's more opportunity to drive growth and productivity at AAP than any role that I've ever had. We'll discuss the opportunities that we see going forward throughout the presentation. It's also my pleasure today to introduce Bob Cushing, right there in the middle of the slide. Bob recently assumed the newly created role of Executive Vice President, Professional Sales, where he'll oversee all of the company's professional sales operations including Advance, Carquest, Autopart International and, of course, Worldpac.
Today we're rebranding what was formerly known as our commercial business to professional. Professional is a name that our customers prefer. And as a result, that's the name we're going to use going forward. Bob's perfectly suited to head up this business. He's an exceptionally talented industry veteran with over 30 years of experience in the industry and he's been the driving force behind the tremendous growth and market-leading position that Worldpac enjoys today. Importantly, Bob is very competitive. You're going to see that today. He's going to be relentless in driving outcomes and he'll expect nothing less than the best as he instills a high-performing culture and make sure we execute to win in the marketplace. In addition to Bob, later in the presentation, you'll hear once again from Tom with a discussion on how our strategy translates to an outlook for the future. So let's get started.
I'd like to begin with what we'd like you to take away from today's event. First, we operate in a terrific industry. It's a large and growing, with attractive dynamics across the board. Secondly, AAP has a very compelling market position, including industry-leading assets, tools and capabilities for us to leverage. Third, we have a tremendous opportunity to drive growth and margin expansion but to do so, we need to implement real change. Not just a change in operations but a real change in culture. We have to focus on the customer first and begin our journey for everything we do with how we can provide the best possible service for our customers. And fourth, we're already executing a clear focused agenda to drive change. Fifth, overseeing this effort is an aggressive leadership team that's fully aligned around our plan. In summary, one can only conclude that AAP represents a compelling investment with tremendous opportunity to deliver shareholder value.
So let's start with the fact that we compete in a $135 billion industry that's experienced strong growth for several years, and we see no end in sight. Industry forecast predict consistent growth over the next 5 years led by professional. For certain, the industry continues to benefit from an increase in vehicles in operation, an increase in average age of vehicles, an increase in older vehicles and an increase in average miles driven per year. These industry fundamentals will drive strong growth for the industry for years to come.
In addition to industry fundamentals, AAP is well-positioned to gain market share. We have many advantages, including: a company-owned professional business; an extensive North American footprint of fulfillment centers and stores; and the leading distributors of import parts. Clearly, we have the assets to succeed and accelerate growth but to do so, we need to better utilize those assets to our advantage. Without question, AAP has a substantial market share opportunity.
We're also keenly aware of evolving industry trends including e-commerce, technology, electrification, urbanization, ridesharing and autonomous vehicles. As a result, we're excited by the opportunities of today and the opportunities of tomorrow as we construct our strategic growth agenda. With disruption comes opportunity.
Whatever we do, we must delight the customer. Everything we do starts and stops with the customer. In building our plan, we knew we had to develop a deep and visceral understanding of the customer and deliver on their needs. Over the last few months, we've conducted the most significant piece of research our company has ever undertaken. We've spent a tremendous amount of time to understand what delights both professional customers and DIY customers. Of course, ultimately we must turn those insights into actions. Our professional customers are looking for high-quality parts at the time we promise them. We understand this opportunity and it's unquestionably achievable for AAP. The DIYer needs vary widely by vehicle history, repair complexity and their level of expertise. This requires a very focused agenda for our Team Members. Armed with these insights, we've developed a strategy and a series of initiatives to delight both professional customers and DIY customers. The initiatives are focused on making sure we have the right part in the right place at the right time and creating a better overall experience for all of our customers.
This leads to the big planks of our agenda. First, building an advantage supply-chain is the cornerstone of our efforts as we improve availability, delivery consistency and speed to delight our customers. Secondly, in professional, we're building a dramatic improvement in the customer experience at every single touch point as we ramp up sales and service capabilities. Next, in DIY, we're planning changes to improve the in-store experience and drive loyalty as well as a reinvention of our online experience. Fourth, our growth agenda will be supported by a robust and ongoing productivity engine that will enable us to expand margins and fuel our growth for years to come. At the center of all this, of course, is our talent and our culture, which will support and facilitate our ability to execute each initiative.
Let's begin with supply chain. A robust and highly functioning supply chain is absolutely foundational to our success. To achieve this, we plan to leverage our existing supply chain assets. The key in constructing the advantage supply chain is to build new capabilities to improve availability, delivery consistency and speed and drive growth while removing unnecessary costs. 
I'm highly confident we can achieve this at AAP. We have a very strong asset base in terms of square footage, inventory and delivery trucks but they are not optimized today. We will optimize our assets to delight our customers. We have been conducting numerous test and learn initiatives over the past few months. In our business, having the right part at the right time is essential. It's table stakes for competing in the industry. As a matter of fact, a few years ago, the Worldpac team actually trademarked the tagline, ""the right part at the right time.""
Our test and learn markets are delivering very positive results. This includes a significant increase in in-market parts availability, a significant decrease in order-to-delivery time and overall reduction in inventory and days on hand, all while increasing availability. Our customers are taking notice, and I quote, ""whatever you guys are doing, it's working for me. I get parts quicker; cars spend less time on the list so I get more jobs done."" The bottom line here is that our changes are leading to increased sales, lower cost, lower inventory levels and higher customer satisfaction.
In addition to our test and learn initiatives, we have an opportunity to streamline our supply chain network and systems. Simplification of our supply chain enables us to get the Advance and Carquest supply chain and network fully integrated. This provides 3 primary benefits: first, streamlining our supply chain improves product availability; secondly, it drives significant productivity by reducing stem miles from DC to store; and third, it simplifies our systems and processes by enabling seamless inventory transfer throughout the value chain, which is a huge benefit for our Team Members and independent partners. Therefore, what we formally referred to as our integration plan is now fully embedded in our ongoing strategic business plan. As such, we're no longer going to be discussing progress on integration. We're one company now and everyone is focused on the customer.
Bottom line, there's no longer discussion about integration but more about how do we use our supply chain assets better and rethinking the system to better fulfill customer demand and more efficiently get more parts closer to more customers.
Now turning to our professional growth opportunity. We're ramping up sales and customer service capabilities, big time. And I'd like to invite Bob Cushing to review our exciting plans for professional customers."

In my early observations, I recognize the tremendous opportunities that exist today to accelerate our growth. In my new role, I'll drive improved performance across the enterprise by leveraging my experience and our proven capabilities highly coveted by our customers.
My goal is to completely transform our customers sales and service model, both online and in person on the professional side of our business. I will be highly focused on improving the overall customer experience to dramatically improve our first call and first click capability. 
As I've looked across AAP, I found many assets that are totally underleveraged. So it all starts with attractive brand portfolio. And our customers have spoken: They want high-quality branded parts to service their customers. And our research confirmed that AAP's part assortment consistently delivers against this objective more than any other supplier. While we're pleased with the result, we will continue to work diligently to delight our customers.
Additionally over the past 40 years, we have developed an industry-leading selection of private label products to meet the needs of our professional customer. AAP's private label brands support our multi-brand strategy, which is what's preferred by our professional customer. So when you look, we start with a significant growth opportunity from a solid base of domestic vehicles in operation and importantly for our customers, we're ahead of the curve on the growing import opportunity. The vehicle import market share has -- is expected to grow dramatically as it has over the past 15 years. This will provide a tremendous growth opportunity for AAP across the entire enterprise.
We have the import expertise with Worldpac and Autopart International. We have delivered this and basically built the leading import program for the past 40 years.
Another asset we can leverage better is our training. Our customers want professional training to help grow and improve the profitability and grow their business. Their technicians need advanced technical training to meet the demands of diagnosing and repairing today's and tomorrow's vehicles. We already have 2 great tools today: we have the CARQUEST Technical Institute; and we have the WORLDPAC Training Institute, which is focused on the import side. Again, the opportunity I just described. Together, the CARQUEST and WORLDPAC Training Institutes provide the professional customer the most comprehensive training curriculum in the industry and it's only, only available at AAP.
In today's digital world, serving professional customers has to start with an industry-leading online experience, and we have a great online asset at Worldpac today. In the research that we conducted, our online experience was rated best-in-class by our customers. This performance was also recognized by Frost & Sullivan Research, which found automotive technicians rank Worldpac as the best program distributor with a comprehensive line of quality products, easy-to-use online system with the speedDIAL, outstanding salespeople, competitive pricing, dependable delivery and consistent product availability. I cannot be more proud of the team for this accomplishment. But as we look forward, the only way we'll leverage this great suite of assets is to put the customer first, always. This has been really important to me my entire career, listening to customers, responding to them and providing them what they need: high-quality product assortment; delivery service that's fast and consistent; technology to drive growth needs of doing business; providing our customers with an industry-leading catalog; a sales team dedicated to delighting the customer; and training to enable our customers to grow their business.
So now it is our time to shift into high gear. We will knit together and leverage best practices across all of AAP's professional business going forward. I know there are better ways to integrate our supply chain. I know we can leverage our catalog and technology to create a better online experience and for certain, we will build a more robust sales and customer service culture at AAP. And by the way, we're already doing it. In fact, we just solidified a multiyear agreement with one of the largest customers who was really pleased with the new AAP approach, and I quote the customer, ""We chose Advance professional based upon their overall enterprise value. The combination of product coverage, local availability, technician training, technology as well as competitive pricing made them the right choice both now and into the future. They have a proven track record of great customer service and consistent execution across a large geographic area, which makes them the right strategic partner for the business.""
The entire AAP team could not be more excited about taking our professional sales to the next level, and we know there's a significant market share opportunity for us as we execute our plan, and we will deliver it. At this point, I'll take you back to Tom. Thank you."
24333,408094654,1086104,"Advance Auto Parts Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 14, 2016",2016-11-14,"Earnings Calls","Advance Auto Parts, Inc.","Executives","Okay. So now you see why we're so excited about professional. Now I'm going to talk DIY, and we're a little further along in our journey to accelerate professional than we are in DIY, and while we continue to strengthen the DIY plan, we're already seeing",1261,"Okay. So now you see why we're so excited about professional. Now I'm going to talk DIY, and we're a little further along in our journey to accelerate professional than we are in DIY, and while we continue to strengthen the DIY plan, we're already seeing signs of improvement in our DIY sales as we really get focused on the customer.
Just like inside professional, our DIY success begins with putting the customer first in everything that we do. We have to build trust, confidence and loyalty with DIYers all over the country. We leverage some custom, significant research we conducted with DIY customers, and our plan is to delight them at every touch point. Across the board, we're improving parts availability. We're building engagement platforms that drive traffic. We're ensuring a consistent in-store experience to drive frequency. We're focusing our training on priority segments to build knowledge and capability. And we're revamping our Speed Perks loyalty program. We're also increasing our investment in mobile and digital to seamlessly connect the online and in-store experience, all of which have the common goal of gaining market share.
First, we plan to grow our customer base. We've analyzed our business over the past several years and we have a very clear idea what's been driving our challenges with traffic and sales growth inside of DIY. Some of the factors driving the decisions on how DIYers choose an auto parts retailer include vehicle history, repair complexity and their level of expertise. From this, we've identified priority segments where we're confident we have the right to succeed. Meeting the needs of these customers will require thoughtful planning around labor, training and marketing. We're excited about attracting new customers to AAP with targeted marketing and a wider array of services.
Next, we'll drive frequency with existing customers. Speed Perks is entering its third full year. To date, we haven't been leveraging the scale of this program as well as we should and will going forward. Our plan is to build customer loyalty with Speed Perks. We now have millions of Speed Perks members, which gives us a deeper understanding of their lifetime value. We're learning more and more about how these customers want to be engaged, and we're building momentum around new ways to cultivate a much stronger relationship with these customers by leveraging insights and analytics around their individual needs and behaviors. Just one additional trip per year by each Speed Perks member results in a tremendous growth number for AAP.
Finally, winning in DIY requires us to improve the overall experience for our customers, both in-store and online. Critically important to achieving this goal is to address the basics of the business. We have to raise our standards on execution. This includes ramping up discipline inside the store and rededicating ourselves to a consistent and exceptional customer experience every single time. We also must ensure that we serve our customers when and how they want to be served, which means elevating our online experience. The end result will be a much better experience for DIYers in every interaction they have with AAP in person, over the phone or online, enabling us to build customer trust, confidence and loyalty.
Our customers have been telling us that we're making progress in DIY. In the past few months, we've seen an increase in the number of complementary letters from DIYers all over the country. To read just one, ""Your manager and his staff were so nice and so helpful in what was, for me, a very stressful situation. His actions have made me an Advance Auto Parts customer for life.""
In summary, our team is energized to better serve the DIYer. And just like in professional, there's a significant market share opportunity in DIY with improved execution.
Between the transformation of our supply chain, building out new capabilities in professional and improving the overall experience for DIYers, we're very bullish on our ability to sequentially accelerate our top line performance going forward just like we did in Q3 of this year.
Now let's talk productivity. Accelerated productivity will fund our journey. In order to sustain investment in growth, a robust productivity engine is absolutely essential. We've gone up and down every single cost line in the entire enterprise to construct our productivity plan. It spans 6 major categories and will contribute meaningfully to profit growth. The categories we've targeted are: distribute, ship as it -- ship, run as it pertains to stores, deliver, sell and support. Please note that while we're removing unnecessary costs, we're also driving new capabilities and investing in long-term growth creation.
Our current productivity build delivers $500 million in cost reduction over 5 years. To be clear, this is a gross number. Some of this will be used to fund our growth and transformation initiatives so not all of this will flow directly to the bottom line. You'll see the impact of the reinvestment of our productivity savings in improving operating margin over the period of the plan.
Our productivity agenda includes 3 important areas of focus: first, zero-based budgeting, where we're eliminating waste and standardizing our approach to cost control. Secondly, as I mentioned earlier, we plan to streamline our supply chain to drive both effectiveness and efficiency. Simplifying, optimizing and fully leveraging our existing asset base yields big savings in our plan. Finally, we have initiated a substantial piece of work on material input costs. As part of this, we'll leverage procurement and value engineering to round out the big blanks of our agenda.
Bottom line, we're entering 2017 with a very high level of confidence in our productivity pipeline. In addition, we're very much looking forward to having Tom Okray provide his perspective given his extensive experience in large organizations where productivity and cost management play a central role.
Finally, I'd like to touch on talent, culture and capability. Across the organization, you can expect us to be maniacally focused on growing talent, evolving our culture and building new capabilities. Specifically, we'll grow talent by developing much more robust leadership development programs for our existing leaders. We're also promoting talented leaders who know the parts business fold and have the capability to do more. And importantly, we've done a great deal of work on evolving the culture of the company. This includes building a culture which is obsessively focused on the customer and one with an exceedingly high level of accountability of ownership and drive for results.
Related to this, our leadership team has spent time looking at incentives and ways to empower all of our team members to act like owners. As an example, turnover. We put a tremendous focus on reducing turnover, and I'm pleased to inform you that we were down significantly in Q3 versus previous year in each of the key roles in the field.
Finally, we're defining the new capabilities we need across the entire enterprise. Where we lack the talent internally, we're going outside to find people who have industry-leading capabilities that we can leverage, and we've already hired several people from outside of AAP that are bringing an entirely new dimension to our thinking as we prepare for the future.
In summary, over the next 5 years, our plan delivers sequential top line sales improvement, $500 million in gross productivity; substantial margin expansion; and world-class talent, culture and capabilities, which will future fit AAP for years to come.
Now it's my pleasure to invite Tom back on the stage to give you a high-level view of how our plan translates to an outlook."

The opportunities Tom and Bob discussed to deliver improved results are familiar to me. I'm used to putting the customer first always. And I know we can drive accelerated sales growth and margin expansion included in our plan.
Turning to the financial impact of our plan. For 2017, we will deliver positive sales comp growth and a modest increase in operating margin. By 2021, our plan delivers mid-single-digit comp sales and at least 500 basis points of margin expansion. As Tom previously discussed, we're building a platform to enable sustainable growth and operating leverage. To achieve that goal, we've worked backwards from the customer and balanced our efforts to achieve growth, reduce cost and efficiencies throughout the organization. Importantly, we're also focused on delivering shareholder value. We will deliver strong operating performance, which will generate strong cash flow improvement. Further, we have tremendous focus on working capital. This includes optimizing our inventory in our payables, which will result in a dramatic improvement in AP ratio. A strong cash flow generation combined with a balanced capital allocation plan enables us to invest in new capabilities such as digital and growth such as new market development. We will apply disciplined rigor around driving strong returns and efficient use of capital as measured by ROIC. We look to return excess cash to shareholders while maintaining our investment-grade rating with a bias towards share repurchases.
Together, we have a tremendous opportunity to leverage the largest asset base in the industry to drive shareholder value. I couldn't be more excited about the future of the company. 
And with that, I'd like to ask Tom and Bob to return to the podium and take some questions. Zaheed, can you lead us there?"

We took some steps to address that through incentives by lifting up the importance of those roles, lifting to those people. We brought a general management council into place to essentially help us forge our agenda. We're spending a lot of time looking at turnover rates by geography, by district throughout the country. So we made a lot of progress. And I mentioned in the prepared remarks, our turnover is down across the board in each of those 4 roles, dramatically. It was up significantly and now it's down year-on-year. And we're going to continue to pay attention to that because we know that if we can get continuity and we can get our people trained and skilled and knowledgeable, and really loving coming into work every day, that's going to make a difference over time.

I mean, obviously, hindsight is 20/20 and I think mine is as good as anyone else but I'll comment briefly on what I think is different about our plan. First of all, I'll say that I think our plan is dramatically different than we've seen previously. I mean, in terms of what I've looked at, I would say there's a couple of big ones. The first one is that we are obsessed with the customer. Everybody on this stage is obsessed with the customer. We are going to drive that deep into the organization. We may have said we were obsessed with the customer in the past, but I think there's a lot of evidence that would say that we are not -- we were not obsessed with the customer in the past. And that's probably job one is to drive that, as I mentioned earlier, deep into the organization, ensure that it's a filter that we put every single decision that we make through the entire company. Secondly, we really didn't have a cohesive strategy that I could gather over the last several years. That caused us to make significant shifts in direction frequently over time. And when you're shifting a large organization of 75,000 people, it gets very difficult to get any kind of momentum around the agenda. Third, when you have that going on, it really starts to compromise the execution because you're trying different things and different priorities take a different level of energy at any given point in time. I can tell you the number of things that we were measuring was significant. The number of input metrics we were trying to accomplish was a very, very long list, and it did vary quarter in, quarter out. So that, over time, reduces the amount of accountability that people inside the organization have to deliver against those goals and it starts to compromise the overall ability to get things done and to achieve the margin expansion goals that were outlined. So I think those are the big things that I would observe. Customer service is going to be -- or obsession with the customer really going forward is our agenda. We have a cohesive strategy now. We're going to be focused on the operating metrics and execution that are required to deliver against that, and we do have to build the culture of the organization to be really focused on not just the customer but to have a very high level of accountability of ownership and drive for result, and that will be different going forward."

the conversions, the relocations, the openings, the closings, all of those things, and I'm an insights and analytics person. I want to really go deep on the metrics. What we said we were going to achieve with those goals. What we actually achieved, we look back over the time frame that they were initiated and we weren't comfortable, candidly, with what the performance of the consolidations were in that time frame so we dramatically reduced them by about 1/3 based on what we originally piloted -- or sorry, planned at the time of the deal itself. And I feel really good about that decision because we're going to be able to drive market share and we're going to be able to retain employees. We've got some great people that work on the Carquest side of the business on the independent and the corporate side. So that I feel great about. The conversions, I will tell you I was in one last week, that has worked well because you're essentially adding DIY to what was formerly an entirely professional operation. And so we see obviously increased traffic associated with that. We're driving comps sales in that store. We're getting more professional business, so the conversions have been much more successful overall, so you'll see us actually accelerating some of the conversions to get more DIY business on that side. As for our goals, again, we're going to focus on the customer. You saw our market share, it's single digits, okay? There's a lot of food on the table for us to grow. We have $10 billion in sales in $135 billion market. We feel very good about our ability to gain market share overall in that time frame. Obviously, we don't ignore our competition. We look at it market by market but our belief is that staying absolutely laser focused on what's important to the customer is going to ultimately enable us to gain market share."

Bob showed the chart on imports. I mean, we've got a strong domestic base of business with our customers. But if you look 5 years going forward, we expect imports to grow at about 20%. So again, we feel very good about that and that we're well positioned with the strength of the business that Bob has built with Worldpac in the next 5 years to help us really get after that opportunity. Some of the other things we showed are very much on our mind. None of them are kind of 5-year items. Whether you talk about the electrification, you talk about autonomous vehicles, you talk about some of those larger macro shifts, we don't see them impacting our core business in the next 5 years. In the next 10 or 15 years, they become bigger factors. So we're going to definitely pay attention to what's going on there.

I mean, I think, obviously we made some adjustments to our labor model in the latter part of last year. And I think we may have rushed a little bit in terms of the execution of that, which is an opportunity for us going forward. I mean, we want to make sure -- I mean, when you're talking about something as important as your store labor, which faces customers, it requires a tremendous amount of analytics upfront, rigorous testing, proven methodologies, then you roll it out. So what I observed was we weren't really approaching it that way. And so we had to sort of reverse course on some of the things that we did. And early on, it's been very well received by our field organization. You have to listen to what our region vice presidents, our district managers, our general managers in the stores are telling us. And as I went around, I mean, I tried to spend as much time in the stores as I can, and I do take a lot of notes and I listen to them when they tell me this is not driving my comps, it's -- it gives you the illusion of profitability because you're reducing cost and you're really just getting customers angry and they don't come back to your store. And then it's just a bit of a vicious circle.
So we've been very thoughtful about our labor model. I think we've made a lot of progress on better aligning our hours to the demand, both on the DIY side and on the commercial side, and we'll continue to do that. We've got to make sure that we can service the customer with all of the things that they want, whether it's parking lot services or delivery frequency or when they want the part. We've got to have the labor there to fulfill the demand, and we've made pretty significant changes, I would say, in how we're approaching that."

I think May, something like that, May or June, I went to a couple of the facilities we have up there. What we did was we tried to impose a bit of a cookie-cutter approach to those distribution centers, and they really weren't engineered to do it. We had more stores than we should have assigned to them at a delivery frequency that was very difficult for them to execute flawlessly, and that created a very chaotic environment in the distribution center. We weren't able to fill orders properly. There was accuracy issues. Yes, we were delivering 5x to the stores. But if you asked the general managers of those stores, they would have said, ""Please, stop doing this because we were just -- it was a bit of a Lucy Show type thing going on. We just had stuff coming in and out, in and out, and we weren't getting the right part in the right place at the right time."" So we essentially unwound that. We went to 3x in those distribution centers. We got into a much better cadence with the stores. We executed our first one in August, okay? Then we went in September in the second one. We've now done all of them. So there's transition cost that we've incurred in the last couple of -- in the third quarter and will incur in the fourth quarter, by the way, as you move to this new system. And we're seeing much better fill rates, like significantly better, much better accuracy and the general managers are much happier and they're selling more. So it just goes back to the customer wants the right part in the right place at the right time. The customer doesn't say, ""Hello. Have you got 5x?"" They say, ""Have you got the right part?"" And when we're able to fulfill that part regardless of how we got it there, that's what they're looking for. So I was in both of those facilities in, what's this, October. I was in there in October. Totally different place. There's not stuff all over the place. We've got clean house. I can see down the aisles. It's kind of important to me in a distribution center. I don't want to see stuff laying on the loading docks. I mean, I give -- tip my hat to the teams in those DCs because they've really worked at it very hard and as a result, our customers are much happier."

It isn't a do better exercise. It's a change the physics exercise. We're not managing those costs the same way anymore. We're asking people to look at the cost in ways that have -- they haven't been looked at before. So those costs, we've got a very clear idea. Tom is running the control tower. We're very clear on where those costs are coming out. They're all -- they're across the P&L, Michael, so I can't call out specific things. They're really throughout the entire P&L. The supply chain obviously is a big area of opportunity. I mean, we just talked about one here: 5x to 3x. You deliver parts 3 times a week instead of 5 times a week. It costs less. And unless you have a really good effectiveness reason for doing it, which we didn't in that case, when we go from 5x to 3x, we save a lot of money. So we're going to continue to look for those types of opportunities, but that -- it's those types of things where, as I said earlier, the cost is coming out.

So that's going to be dynamic, dynamic inventory. Whatever the calls are out there for the customer development side, we're going to have the part closer to the customer."

I'd like to welcome all of you to our event, both those of you here in the audience as well as those of you joining us on the webcast. We greatly appreciate your interest on our business and we're very excited to share our progress with you today. 
We'll start by providing a brief recap of the third quarter results, and then we'll transition to an overview of our strategic business plan. We've been developing this over the past several months. With that, let's get right into it.
Our comp store performance in Q3 was down 1%, as our initiatives to improve top line performance began to have an impact. While we delivered sequential improvement versus previous quarters, let me be clear, we will be relentless in our pursuit of positive comp sales.
In terms of profitability, our adjusted operating margin rate of 9.7% and adjusted EPS of $1.73 were impacted by 3 primary drivers, all of which we called out during our Q2 call: first, we made investments in the quarter to better serve our customers; secondly, we took deliberate actions to reduce inventory levels versus Q2, which resulted in cost headwinds. Going forward, we'll continue to bring our inventory levels down without disrupting our customers; and third, we faced higher supply chain operating expenses in the quarter, including our planned transition from 5x to 3x delivery frequency in selected markets.
As for our top line performance, while it's still early, we're encouraged by our sales improvement as the heightened focus on execution translated to improved input metrics and ultimately, sales. We remain relentlessly focused on execution, and we're going to make investments in customer service and availability to align our entire organization around the customer and around gaining market share.
To date, our investments have driven sales performance at a faster rate than expected. On our Q2 call, we called out back-half investments in 3 areas: in availability; in customer service; and in our front-line organizations. All 3 of these investments have been promising. In terms of availability, we have a number of initiatives underway that test different ways of positioning our inventory of assorting parts and of delivering parts to our customers. These tests are being conducted throughout our network. The initiatives all have the same endgame: get the right part in the right place at the right time, consistently, reliably and predictably.
As we work to improve availability, we're working to do so at less cost and with more availability.
We're testing these initiatives in multiple phases, and we're applying some of the learnings to our base business. So far, we like many aspects of what we're seeing, and we plan to roll out these initiatives in 2017. We also see elements of our test that we can leverage in the future, and we'll discuss the progress we're making on availability later when we review our strategic business plan.
In terms of investments in our customers, we're equally encouraged. This include investments in availability, in store labor and in a frontline incentive program. These investments enable our front-line team to compete at the absolute highest level and position them to win with our customers. In particular, the incentive program we launched has been extremely well received by our field team and almost immediately has had a step function impact on reducing turnover in all front-line roles. Our field team is fired up and they're increasing their focus on what matters most to our valued customers.
In summary, we're encouraged by the investments we've made in availability, in our customers and in our front-line team. On a regional basis, we saw comp sales improvement in every region in the country. While performance in the Northeast and Great Lakes still lagged our overall business, it improved as our actions to improve performance and some of our more challenged distribution centers paid off. Our teams in these regions are excited about the changes as we're giving them the chance to say yes to our customers more often.
To sum up Q3, we're encouraged by the progress we're making and the momentum that is building behind our efforts. That said, we still have a significant amount of work to do to dramatically change the trajectory of our business. Accordingly, we're maintaining a very disciplined approach to improving customer service as it's absolutely vital that we get this right for the long term.
We're focused on delivering consistent sales and profit improvement over the long term, not just the next quarter. We'll continue to sharpen our focus on execution, improve availability and deliver on the needs of our customers as we execute our strategy.
I'll be back up shortly to provide an update on our strategic plan. But before I do, it's my absolute pleasure to introduce Tom Okray to give a brief third quarter update on our financial and operational highlights. Tom brings more than 25 years of experience in finance, operations and supply chain to AAP. Most recently, he served as VP, Finance, Global Customer Fulfillment at Amazon, where he was the finance lead overseeing the optimization of all key elements of Amazon's global fulfillment network. In addition, Tom spent over 20 years at General Motors in finance and supply chain-related roles. He was most recently responsible for overseeing more than $120 billion in annual expenses, and $8 billion in CapEx as CFO, global product development, purchasing and supply chain. 
Tom is absolutely passionate about winning in the marketplace and he is laser focused on what matters most to our customers. He knows what it takes to win in the digital world, and he's bringing an entirely new dimension to our thinking as we navigate the future. We're thrilled to be joined by Tom, given his unique background and deep operating experience as we write the next chapter of growth for AAP. Tom?"

Before I begin my prepared remarks, I just want to briefly share how thrilled I am to be a part of the AAP team. I've joined the organization at a very exciting time as we refocus the company on our most important priority, the customer. We will work to improve our service levels, our overall execution and without a doubt, our operating and financial performance. I'd also want to thank Mike Norona for assisting with my transition and our third quarter financial close.
Total sales for to third quarter decreased 2% to $2.25 billion, principally driven by our comp store sales decline of 1%, store closures and Carquest consolidations. The declines were partially offset by growth at Worldpac, store conversions and new stores. Our gross profit rate decline of 104 basis points was primarily driven by higher supply chain expenses and headwinds associated with reducing inventory. Our adjusted SG&A rate was essentially flat year-over-year, driven by continued cost reduction initiatives, partially offset by investments in delighting our customer.
All in, our third quarter adjusted operating income came in at $217.6 million; adjusted operating margin decreased 95 basis points over the same period last year to 9.7%; operating cash flow through the third quarter was $409.4 million versus $520.1 million last year, primarily driven by an increase in inventory versus last year and lower sales. While we have not provided an annual EPS outlook, we'd like to give some context on how we're thinking about the balance of the year.
We're encouraged by our sales improvement in Q3. However, it's early and we have a lot of work to do. Additionally, as you may know, our fourth quarter is our lowest volume and most volatile quarter of the fiscal year. We expect continued headwinds in our operating margin rate similar to what we experienced in the third quarter as we continue to invest in our customers, our inventory and optimize our supply chain network. 
That wraps up our third quarter recap. We're going to transition to discussing elements of our strategic business plan. With that, I'll turn it over to Tom Greco."

This plan has been several months in the making and we couldn't be more excited about our prospects for the future. Our plan is deeply rooted in focused consumer and customer research for both DIY customers and professional customers. Our goal is to dramatically improve performance across the board through a step change in customer service. 
Please understand we'd like to share as much of our plan as we possibly can with you. At the same time, we feel it's in our business interest of all concerned that we're careful on just how much we share about our plan for competitive reasons. Also understand that if you're left wanting for more details, we've spent considerable time analyzing the pros and cons of doing so, and we can conclude that it's not in our or our shareholders' best interest to do so. That said, we've got a very compelling plan that capitalize on the enormous growth opportunity that we have at AAP, and we're excited to share our plan to deliver improved results and shareholder value.
Before we get started, I know this might be the first time we're getting to know each other. There's some new people in new positions at Advance and for some of you, this includes me. Stepping back and with the benefit of my first 6 months in the role along with 30 -- close to 30 years of experience at PepsiCo and Frito-Lay, I'm confident we're in a great position to capitalize on the opportunity ahead. Many of the ingredients for success that I enjoyed at PepsiCo are transferable here: constructing a demand-driven growth agenda that's rooted in customer and consumer insights; transforming the supply chain to build new capabilities and drive productivity; and empowering the frontline organization to drive execution and operating improvement. Without question, I see the application of each of these learnings here at Advance.
In fact, there's more opportunity to drive growth and productivity at AAP than any role that I've ever had. We'll discuss the opportunities that we see going forward throughout the presentation. It's also my pleasure today to introduce Bob Cushing, right there in the middle of the slide. Bob recently assumed the newly created role of Executive Vice President, Professional Sales, where he'll oversee all of the company's professional sales operations including Advance, Carquest, Autopart International and, of course, Worldpac.
Today we're rebranding what was formerly known as our commercial business to professional. Professional is a name that our customers prefer. And as a result, that's the name we're going to use going forward. Bob's perfectly suited to head up this business. He's an exceptionally talented industry veteran with over 30 years of experience in the industry and he's been the driving force behind the tremendous growth and market-leading position that Worldpac enjoys today. Importantly, Bob is very competitive. You're going to see that today. He's going to be relentless in driving outcomes and he'll expect nothing less than the best as he instills a high-performing culture and make sure we execute to win in the marketplace. In addition to Bob, later in the presentation, you'll hear once again from Tom with a discussion on how our strategy translates to an outlook for the future. So let's get started.
I'd like to begin with what we'd like you to take away from today's event. First, we operate in a terrific industry. It's a large and growing, with attractive dynamics across the board. Secondly, AAP has a very compelling market position, including industry-leading assets, tools and capabilities for us to leverage. Third, we have a tremendous opportunity to drive growth and margin expansion but to do so, we need to implement real change. Not just a change in operations but a real change in culture. We have to focus on the customer first and begin our journey for everything we do with how we can provide the best possible service for our customers. And fourth, we're already executing a clear focused agenda to drive change. Fifth, overseeing this effort is an aggressive leadership team that's fully aligned around our plan. In summary, one can only conclude that AAP represents a compelling investment with tremendous opportunity to deliver shareholder value.
So let's start with the fact that we compete in a $135 billion industry that's experienced strong growth for several years, and we see no end in sight. Industry forecast predict consistent growth over the next 5 years led by professional. For certain, the industry continues to benefit from an increase in vehicles in operation, an increase in average age of vehicles, an increase in older vehicles and an increase in average miles driven per year. These industry fundamentals will drive strong growth for the industry for years to come.
In addition to industry fundamentals, AAP is well-positioned to gain market share. We have many advantages, including: a company-owned professional business; an extensive North American footprint of fulfillment centers and stores; and the leading distributors of import parts. Clearly, we have the assets to succeed and accelerate growth but to do so, we need to better utilize those assets to our advantage. Without question, AAP has a substantial market share opportunity.
We're also keenly aware of evolving industry trends including e-commerce, technology, electrification, urbanization, ridesharing and autonomous vehicles. As a result, we're excited by the opportunities of today and the opportunities of tomorrow as we construct our strategic growth agenda. With disruption comes opportunity.
Whatever we do, we must delight the customer. Everything we do starts and stops with the customer. In building our plan, we knew we had to develop a deep and visceral understanding of the customer and deliver on their needs. Over the last few months, we've conducted the most significant piece of research our company has ever undertaken. We've spent a tremendous amount of time to understand what delights both professional customers and DIY customers. Of course, ultimately we must turn those insights into actions. Our professional customers are looking for high-quality parts at the time we promise them. We understand this opportunity and it's unquestionably achievable for AAP. The DIYer needs vary widely by vehicle history, repair complexity and their level of expertise. This requires a very focused agenda for our Team Members. Armed with these insights, we've developed a strategy and a series of initiatives to delight both professional customers and DIY customers. The initiatives are focused on making sure we have the right part in the right place at the right time and creating a better overall experience for all of our customers.
This leads to the big planks of our agenda. First, building an advantage supply-chain is the cornerstone of our efforts as we improve availability, delivery consistency and speed to delight our customers. Secondly, in professional, we're building a dramatic improvement in the customer experience at every single touch point as we ramp up sales and service capabilities. Next, in DIY, we're planning changes to improve the in-store experience and drive loyalty as well as a reinvention of our online experience. Fourth, our growth agenda will be supported by a robust and ongoing productivity engine that will enable us to expand margins and fuel our growth for years to come. At the center of all this, of course, is our talent and our culture, which will support and facilitate our ability to execute each initiative.
Let's begin with supply chain. A robust and highly functioning supply chain is absolutely foundational to our success. To achieve this, we plan to leverage our existing supply chain assets. The key in constructing the advantage supply chain is to build new capabilities to improve availability, delivery consistency and speed and drive growth while removing unnecessary costs. 
I'm highly confident we can achieve this at AAP. We have a very strong asset base in terms of square footage, inventory and delivery trucks but they are not optimized today. We will optimize our assets to delight our customers. We have been conducting numerous test and learn initiatives over the past few months. In our business, having the right part at the right time is essential. It's table stakes for competing in the industry. As a matter of fact, a few years ago, the Worldpac team actually trademarked the tagline, ""the right part at the right time.""
Our test and learn markets are delivering very positive results. This includes a significant increase in in-market parts availability, a significant decrease in order-to-delivery time and overall reduction in inventory and days on hand, all while increasing availability. Our customers are taking notice, and I quote, ""whatever you guys are doing, it's working for me. I get parts quicker; cars spend less time on the list so I get more jobs done."" The bottom line here is that our changes are leading to increased sales, lower cost, lower inventory levels and higher customer satisfaction.
In addition to our test and learn initiatives, we have an opportunity to streamline our supply chain network and systems. Simplification of our supply chain enables us to get the Advance and Carquest supply chain and network fully integrated. This provides 3 primary benefits: first, streamlining our supply chain improves product availability; secondly, it drives significant productivity by reducing stem miles from DC to store; and third, it simplifies our systems and processes by enabling seamless inventory transfer throughout the value chain, which is a huge benefit for our Team Members and independent partners. Therefore, what we formally referred to as our integration plan is now fully embedded in our ongoing strategic business plan. As such, we're no longer going to be discussing progress on integration. We're one company now and everyone is focused on the customer.
Bottom line, there's no longer discussion about integration but more about how do we use our supply chain assets better and rethinking the system to better fulfill customer demand and more efficiently get more parts closer to more customers.
Now turning to our professional growth opportunity. We're ramping up sales and customer service capabilities, big time. And I'd like to invite Bob Cushing to review our exciting plans for professional customers."

In my early observations, I recognize the tremendous opportunities that exist today to accelerate our growth. In my new role, I'll drive improved performance across the enterprise by leveraging my experience and our proven capabilities highly coveted by our customers.
My goal is to completely transform our customers sales and service model, both online and in person on the professional side of our business. I will be highly focused on improving the overall customer experience to dramatically improve our first call and first click capability. 
As I've looked across AAP, I found many assets that are totally underleveraged. So it all starts with attractive brand portfolio. And our customers have spoken: They want high-quality branded parts to service their customers. And our research confirmed that AAP's part assortment consistently delivers against this objective more than any other supplier. While we're pleased with the result, we will continue to work diligently to delight our customers.
Additionally over the past 40 years, we have developed an industry-leading selection of private label products to meet the needs of our professional customer. AAP's private label brands support our multi-brand strategy, which is what's preferred by our professional customer. So when you look, we start with a significant growth opportunity from a solid base of domestic vehicles in operation and importantly for our customers, we're ahead of the curve on the growing import opportunity. The vehicle import market share has -- is expected to grow dramatically as it has over the past 15 years. This will provide a tremendous growth opportunity for AAP across the entire enterprise.
We have the import expertise with Worldpac and Autopart International. We have delivered this and basically built the leading import program for the past 40 years.
Another asset we can leverage better is our training. Our customers want professional training to help grow and improve the profitability and grow their business. Their technicians need advanced technical training to meet the demands of diagnosing and repairing today's and tomorrow's vehicles. We already have 2 great tools today: we have the CARQUEST Technical Institute; and we have the WORLDPAC Training Institute, which is focused on the import side. Again, the opportunity I just described. Together, the CARQUEST and WORLDPAC Training Institutes provide the professional customer the most comprehensive training curriculum in the industry and it's only, only available at AAP.
In today's digital world, serving professional customers has to start with an industry-leading online experience, and we have a great online asset at Worldpac today. In the research that we conducted, our online experience was rated best-in-class by our customers. This performance was also recognized by Frost & Sullivan Research, which found automotive technicians rank Worldpac as the best program distributor with a comprehensive line of quality products, easy-to-use online system with the speedDIAL, outstanding salespeople, competitive pricing, dependable delivery and consistent product availability. I cannot be more proud of the team for this accomplishment. But as we look forward, the only way we'll leverage this great suite of assets is to put the customer first, always. This has been really important to me my entire career, listening to customers, responding to them and providing them what they need: high-quality product assortment; delivery service that's fast and consistent; technology to drive growth needs of doing business; providing our customers with an industry-leading catalog; a sales team dedicated to delighting the customer; and training to enable our customers to grow their business.
So now it is our time to shift into high gear. We will knit together and leverage best practices across all of AAP's professional business going forward. I know there are better ways to integrate our supply chain. I know we can leverage our catalog and technology to create a better online experience and for certain, we will build a more robust sales and customer service culture at AAP. And by the way, we're already doing it. In fact, we just solidified a multiyear agreement with one of the largest customers who was really pleased with the new AAP approach, and I quote the customer, ""We chose Advance professional based upon their overall enterprise value. The combination of product coverage, local availability, technician training, technology as well as competitive pricing made them the right choice both now and into the future. They have a proven track record of great customer service and consistent execution across a large geographic area, which makes them the right strategic partner for the business.""
The entire AAP team could not be more excited about taking our professional sales to the next level, and we know there's a significant market share opportunity for us as we execute our plan, and we will deliver it. At this point, I'll take you back to Tom. Thank you."
24333,408094654,1086943,"Advance Auto Parts Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 14, 2016",2016-11-14,"Earnings Calls","Advance Auto Parts, Inc.","Executives","Okay. So now you see why we're so excited about professional. Now I'm going to talk DIY, and we're a little further along in our journey to accelerate professional than we are in DIY, and while we continue to strengthen the DIY plan, we're already seeing",1261,"Okay. So now you see why we're so excited about professional. Now I'm going to talk DIY, and we're a little further along in our journey to accelerate professional than we are in DIY, and while we continue to strengthen the DIY plan, we're already seeing signs of improvement in our DIY sales as we really get focused on the customer.
Just like inside professional, our DIY success begins with putting the customer first in everything that we do. We have to build trust, confidence and loyalty with DIYers all over the country. We leverage some custom, significant research we conducted with DIY customers, and our plan is to delight them at every touch point. Across the board, we're improving parts availability. We're building engagement platforms that drive traffic. We're ensuring a consistent in-store experience to drive frequency. We're focusing our training on priority segments to build knowledge and capability. And we're revamping our Speed Perks loyalty program. We're also increasing our investment in mobile and digital to seamlessly connect the online and in-store experience, all of which have the common goal of gaining market share.
First, we plan to grow our customer base. We've analyzed our business over the past several years and we have a very clear idea what's been driving our challenges with traffic and sales growth inside of DIY. Some of the factors driving the decisions on how DIYers choose an auto parts retailer include vehicle history, repair complexity and their level of expertise. From this, we've identified priority segments where we're confident we have the right to succeed. Meeting the needs of these customers will require thoughtful planning around labor, training and marketing. We're excited about attracting new customers to AAP with targeted marketing and a wider array of services.
Next, we'll drive frequency with existing customers. Speed Perks is entering its third full year. To date, we haven't been leveraging the scale of this program as well as we should and will going forward. Our plan is to build customer loyalty with Speed Perks. We now have millions of Speed Perks members, which gives us a deeper understanding of their lifetime value. We're learning more and more about how these customers want to be engaged, and we're building momentum around new ways to cultivate a much stronger relationship with these customers by leveraging insights and analytics around their individual needs and behaviors. Just one additional trip per year by each Speed Perks member results in a tremendous growth number for AAP.
Finally, winning in DIY requires us to improve the overall experience for our customers, both in-store and online. Critically important to achieving this goal is to address the basics of the business. We have to raise our standards on execution. This includes ramping up discipline inside the store and rededicating ourselves to a consistent and exceptional customer experience every single time. We also must ensure that we serve our customers when and how they want to be served, which means elevating our online experience. The end result will be a much better experience for DIYers in every interaction they have with AAP in person, over the phone or online, enabling us to build customer trust, confidence and loyalty.
Our customers have been telling us that we're making progress in DIY. In the past few months, we've seen an increase in the number of complementary letters from DIYers all over the country. To read just one, ""Your manager and his staff were so nice and so helpful in what was, for me, a very stressful situation. His actions have made me an Advance Auto Parts customer for life.""
In summary, our team is energized to better serve the DIYer. And just like in professional, there's a significant market share opportunity in DIY with improved execution.
Between the transformation of our supply chain, building out new capabilities in professional and improving the overall experience for DIYers, we're very bullish on our ability to sequentially accelerate our top line performance going forward just like we did in Q3 of this year.
Now let's talk productivity. Accelerated productivity will fund our journey. In order to sustain investment in growth, a robust productivity engine is absolutely essential. We've gone up and down every single cost line in the entire enterprise to construct our productivity plan. It spans 6 major categories and will contribute meaningfully to profit growth. The categories we've targeted are: distribute, ship as it -- ship, run as it pertains to stores, deliver, sell and support. Please note that while we're removing unnecessary costs, we're also driving new capabilities and investing in long-term growth creation.
Our current productivity build delivers $500 million in cost reduction over 5 years. To be clear, this is a gross number. Some of this will be used to fund our growth and transformation initiatives so not all of this will flow directly to the bottom line. You'll see the impact of the reinvestment of our productivity savings in improving operating margin over the period of the plan.
Our productivity agenda includes 3 important areas of focus: first, zero-based budgeting, where we're eliminating waste and standardizing our approach to cost control. Secondly, as I mentioned earlier, we plan to streamline our supply chain to drive both effectiveness and efficiency. Simplifying, optimizing and fully leveraging our existing asset base yields big savings in our plan. Finally, we have initiated a substantial piece of work on material input costs. As part of this, we'll leverage procurement and value engineering to round out the big blanks of our agenda.
Bottom line, we're entering 2017 with a very high level of confidence in our productivity pipeline. In addition, we're very much looking forward to having Tom Okray provide his perspective given his extensive experience in large organizations where productivity and cost management play a central role.
Finally, I'd like to touch on talent, culture and capability. Across the organization, you can expect us to be maniacally focused on growing talent, evolving our culture and building new capabilities. Specifically, we'll grow talent by developing much more robust leadership development programs for our existing leaders. We're also promoting talented leaders who know the parts business fold and have the capability to do more. And importantly, we've done a great deal of work on evolving the culture of the company. This includes building a culture which is obsessively focused on the customer and one with an exceedingly high level of accountability of ownership and drive for results.
Related to this, our leadership team has spent time looking at incentives and ways to empower all of our team members to act like owners. As an example, turnover. We put a tremendous focus on reducing turnover, and I'm pleased to inform you that we were down significantly in Q3 versus previous year in each of the key roles in the field.
Finally, we're defining the new capabilities we need across the entire enterprise. Where we lack the talent internally, we're going outside to find people who have industry-leading capabilities that we can leverage, and we've already hired several people from outside of AAP that are bringing an entirely new dimension to our thinking as we prepare for the future.
In summary, over the next 5 years, our plan delivers sequential top line sales improvement, $500 million in gross productivity; substantial margin expansion; and world-class talent, culture and capabilities, which will future fit AAP for years to come.
Now it's my pleasure to invite Tom back on the stage to give you a high-level view of how our plan translates to an outlook."

The opportunities Tom and Bob discussed to deliver improved results are familiar to me. I'm used to putting the customer first always. And I know we can drive accelerated sales growth and margin expansion included in our plan.
Turning to the financial impact of our plan. For 2017, we will deliver positive sales comp growth and a modest increase in operating margin. By 2021, our plan delivers mid-single-digit comp sales and at least 500 basis points of margin expansion. As Tom previously discussed, we're building a platform to enable sustainable growth and operating leverage. To achieve that goal, we've worked backwards from the customer and balanced our efforts to achieve growth, reduce cost and efficiencies throughout the organization. Importantly, we're also focused on delivering shareholder value. We will deliver strong operating performance, which will generate strong cash flow improvement. Further, we have tremendous focus on working capital. This includes optimizing our inventory in our payables, which will result in a dramatic improvement in AP ratio. A strong cash flow generation combined with a balanced capital allocation plan enables us to invest in new capabilities such as digital and growth such as new market development. We will apply disciplined rigor around driving strong returns and efficient use of capital as measured by ROIC. We look to return excess cash to shareholders while maintaining our investment-grade rating with a bias towards share repurchases.
Together, we have a tremendous opportunity to leverage the largest asset base in the industry to drive shareholder value. I couldn't be more excited about the future of the company. 
And with that, I'd like to ask Tom and Bob to return to the podium and take some questions. Zaheed, can you lead us there?"

Six months ago, candidly, we had a very difficult time retaining people. You probably are well aware of the fact that we were losing people to competitors. We took some steps to address that through incentives by lifting up the importance of those roles, lifting to those people. We brought a general management council into place to essentially help us forge our agenda. We're spending a lot of time looking at turnover rates by geography, by district throughout the country. So we made a lot of progress. And I mentioned in the prepared remarks, our turnover is down across the board in each of those 4 roles, dramatically. It was up significantly and now it's down year-on-year. And we're going to continue to pay attention to that because we know that if we can get continuity and we can get our people trained and skilled and knowledgeable, and really loving coming into work every day, that's going to make a difference over time.

We may have said we were obsessed with the customer in the past, but I think there's a lot of evidence that would say that we are not -- we were not obsessed with the customer in the past. And that's probably job one is to drive that, as I mentioned earlier, deep into the organization, ensure that it's a filter that we put every single decision that we make through the entire company. Secondly, we really didn't have a cohesive strategy that I could gather over the last several years. That caused us to make significant shifts in direction frequently over time. And when you're shifting a large organization of 75,000 people, it gets very difficult to get any kind of momentum around the agenda. Third, when you have that going on, it really starts to compromise the execution because you're trying different things and different priorities take a different level of energy at any given point in time. I can tell you the number of things that we were measuring was significant. The number of input metrics we were trying to accomplish was a very, very long list, and it did vary quarter in, quarter out. So that, over time, reduces the amount of accountability that people inside the organization have to deliver against those goals and it starts to compromise the overall ability to get things done and to achieve the margin expansion goals that were outlined. So I think those are the big things that I would observe. Customer service is going to be -- or obsession with the customer really going forward is our agenda. We have a cohesive strategy now. We're going to be focused on the operating metrics and execution that are required to deliver against that, and we do have to build the culture of the organization to be really focused on not just the customer but to have a very high level of accountability of ownership and drive for result, and that will be different going forward."

the conversions, the relocations, the openings, the closings, all of those things, and I'm an insights and analytics person. I want to really go deep on the metrics. What we said we were going to achieve with those goals. What we actually achieved, we look back over the time frame that they were initiated and we weren't comfortable, candidly, with what the performance of the consolidations were in that time frame so we dramatically reduced them by about 1/3 based on what we originally piloted -- or sorry, planned at the time of the deal itself. And I feel really good about that decision because we're going to be able to drive market share and we're going to be able to retain employees. We've got some great people that work on the Carquest side of the business on the independent and the corporate side. So that I feel great about. The conversions, I will tell you I was in one last week, that has worked well because you're essentially adding DIY to what was formerly an entirely professional operation. And so we see obviously increased traffic associated with that. We're driving comps sales in that store. We're getting more professional business, so the conversions have been much more successful overall, so you'll see us actually accelerating some of the conversions to get more DIY business on that side. As for our goals, again, we're going to focus on the customer. You saw our market share, it's single digits, okay? There's a lot of food on the table for us to grow. We have $10 billion in sales in $135 billion market. We feel very good about our ability to gain market share overall in that time frame. Obviously, we don't ignore our competition. We look at it market by market but our belief is that staying absolutely laser focused on what's important to the customer is going to ultimately enable us to gain market share."

And I'm looking forward to touring some stores with Nick to get his opinion on how we're doing which he gives us when he sees us all the time. But it's a fun business. It's a great side of the business. They've got people who want to fix their vehicles and really -- we've got some exciting things we believe we can do to bring that level of focus back to the DIY side of the business next year that I'm not going to speak about here, but we're excited about our plans there."

They're going to take it to one of our hundreds of thousands of customers that are out there that repair vehicles across the nation and we're excited about that because we feel we're very well positioned in that space. Bob showed the chart on imports. I mean, we've got a strong domestic base of business with our customers. But if you look 5 years going forward, we expect imports to grow at about 20%. So again, we feel very good about that and that we're well positioned with the strength of the business that Bob has built with Worldpac in the next 5 years to help us really get after that opportunity. Some of the other things we showed are very much on our mind. None of them are kind of 5-year items. Whether you talk about the electrification, you talk about autonomous vehicles, you talk about some of those larger macro shifts, we don't see them impacting our core business in the next 5 years. In the next 10 or 15 years, they become bigger factors. So we're going to definitely pay attention to what's going on there. And again, as I said in our prepared remarks, we want to be -- with disruption comes opportunity, and we want to be part of that opportunity and look for growth factors that may not exist today on our base business."

I mean, I think, obviously we made some adjustments to our labor model in the latter part of last year. And I think we may have rushed a little bit in terms of the execution of that, which is an opportunity for us going forward. I mean, we want to make sure -- I mean, when you're talking about something as important as your store labor, which faces customers, it requires a tremendous amount of analytics upfront, rigorous testing, proven methodologies, then you roll it out. So what I observed was we weren't really approaching it that way. And so we had to sort of reverse course on some of the things that we did. And early on, it's been very well received by our field organization. You have to listen to what our region vice presidents, our district managers, our general managers in the stores are telling us. And as I went around, I mean, I tried to spend as much time in the stores as I can, and I do take a lot of notes and I listen to them when they tell me this is not driving my comps, it's -- it gives you the illusion of profitability because you're reducing cost and you're really just getting customers angry and they don't come back to your store. And then it's just a bit of a vicious circle.
So we've been very thoughtful about our labor model. I think we've made a lot of progress on better aligning our hours to the demand, both on the DIY side and on the commercial side, and we'll continue to do that. We've got to make sure that we can service the customer with all of the things that they want, whether it's parking lot services or delivery frequency or when they want the part. We've got to have the labor there to fulfill the demand, and we've made pretty significant changes, I would say, in how we're approaching that."

I think May, something like that, May or June, I went to a couple of the facilities we have up there. What we did was we tried to impose a bit of a cookie-cutter approach to those distribution centers, and they really weren't engineered to do it. We had more stores than we should have assigned to them at a delivery frequency that was very difficult for them to execute flawlessly, and that created a very chaotic environment in the distribution center. We weren't able to fill orders properly. There was accuracy issues. Yes, we were delivering 5x to the stores. But if you asked the general managers of those stores, they would have said, ""Please, stop doing this because we were just -- it was a bit of a Lucy Show type thing going on. We just had stuff coming in and out, in and out, and we weren't getting the right part in the right place at the right time."" So we essentially unwound that. We went to 3x in those distribution centers. We got into a much better cadence with the stores. We executed our first one in August, okay? Then we went in September in the second one. We've now done all of them. So there's transition cost that we've incurred in the last couple of -- in the third quarter and will incur in the fourth quarter, by the way, as you move to this new system. And we're seeing much better fill rates, like significantly better, much better accuracy and the general managers are much happier and they're selling more. So it just goes back to the customer wants the right part in the right place at the right time. The customer doesn't say, ""Hello. Have you got 5x?"" They say, ""Have you got the right part?"" And when we're able to fulfill that part regardless of how we got it there, that's what they're looking for. So I was in both of those facilities in, what's this, October. I was in there in October. Totally different place. There's not stuff all over the place. We've got clean house. I can see down the aisles. It's kind of important to me in a distribution center. I don't want to see stuff laying on the loading docks. I mean, I give -- tip my hat to the teams in those DCs because they've really worked at it very hard and as a result, our customers are much happier."

It's really about getting horizontal views of all of the costs that you have across the enterprise as opposed to each cost center manager managing their costs in more of a vertical fashion and us saying, ""Gee, can you do better?"" It isn't a do better exercise. It's a change the physics exercise. We're not managing those costs the same way anymore. We're asking people to look at the cost in ways that have -- they haven't been looked at before. So those costs, we've got a very clear idea. Tom is running the control tower. We're very clear on where those costs are coming out. They're all -- they're across the P&L, Michael, so I can't call out specific things. They're really throughout the entire P&L. The supply chain obviously is a big area of opportunity. I mean, we just talked about one here: 5x to 3x. You deliver parts 3 times a week instead of 5 times a week. It costs less. And unless you have a really good effectiveness reason for doing it, which we didn't in that case, when we go from 5x to 3x, we save a lot of money. So we're going to continue to look for those types of opportunities, but that -- it's those types of things where, as I said earlier, the cost is coming out.
