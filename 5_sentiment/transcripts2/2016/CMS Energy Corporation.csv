Thanks for joining us on our year-end earnings call.
I'll begin the presentation with a review of our last year's results and this year's priorities before turning the call over to Patty for a review our unique customer and investor model. Tom will provide the financial results and outlook, than as usual, close with the Q&A.
2015 earnings per share were $1.89, up 7% from the prior year's actual result. We are raising our 2016 guidance to $1.99 to $2.02 per share. This is an increase of 5% to 7%, reflecting our predictable and consistent 5% to 7% performance year-over-year. Recently, our board approved a 7% dividend increase, raising it to $1.24 per share. This results in a competitive payout ratio of 62%. 
2015 was a record setting year. I'm most proud of our safety result, the best in our company's 130-year history. Our distribution minutes were the best in a decade, and the generation plant performance was the best ever. Customer satisfaction arose to first quartile for both residential, electric and gas customers. Since 2006, the company has achieved breakthrough performance. Safety incidents are down 79%, productivity is up 62%, outage minutes are down 34% and employee engagement is first quartile. I'm confident this performance will continue to drive the results you've been a custom to. These areas will continue to improve and we look to other initiatives to improve service and reduce costs.
Michigan currently has a strong Energy law in the books. The law supports 10% renewable energy, energy efficiency standards, forward-looking test years and a retail open access capped at 10%. As we would expect, the governor's focus on the water issue influent. His attention should be focused on helping the people of Flint, a city that we serve. In the meantime, we expect the energy committees in the House and Senate to continue their work. We expect an updated energy law will be passed by the first half of this year. But keep in mind and this is important, the update to the Energy law is not in our plan. In fact, we have not included any law-related capital investments in our plan.
For 2016, we plan to continue our breakthrough performance. Operationally, we'll continue to make safety a top priority for employees, customers and the communities we serve. Again this year, we are planning cost reductions to our industry-leading performance. We will continue to execute our strategy and deliver the same addictive and financial performance as you have in the past.
Now I would like to welcome and turn the call over to Patty."

We're especially pleased to announced today that we are raising our guidance beginning in 2017, to 6% to 8% from 5% to 7%.

We're especially pleased to announced today that we are raising our guidance beginning in 2017, to 6% to 8% from 5% to 7%. This reflects the increase in capital investment to $17 billion over the next 10 years, from $15.5 billion as announced last week. As most of you know, we've been delivering 7% growth each year for over a decade. While this increase reflects the higher level of capital expending, it demonstrates our comfort in continuing 7% growth in the midpoint of our new range for years ahead.
You might ask, why we're not raising the guidance for 2016. We still have opportunities to reinvest O&M and to strength our liability and a higher level of capital investment does fully kick-in until later this year.
Our confidence in the sustainability of our premier earnings growth rate is reflection of our business model where we self fund a large portion of the capital investment growth for our customers. We do this by reducing our costs and avoiding the need for equity with the dissociated dilution. This model permits us to keep base rate increases at below inflation resulting in sustainable growth.
Both our core and increased level of capital investment are targeted to improve customer service, enhance reliability and among several other things, increase affordability by providing for cost reductions. The $1.5 billion increase in capital investment includes: $800 million in the next 5 years to replace aging infrastructure and improve service reliability. It also includes another $700 million in the following 5 years to provide for the clean energy resources we believe will be needed to meet the Clean Power Plan in the most economical way.
We still have considerable opportunities for even more capital investments. Those opportunities included replacing PPAs when they expire. These opportunities alone represent for additional 2,000 megawatts of capacity, and around another $2 billion of capital investment. We also need to do more with our gas infrastructure and modernization of the grid. And likely, we'll make further capital investment for renewables.  None of this is attributable to the update in the 2008 energy loss. These investments will be required with or without a change to that loss.
In the past, we reminded you that we've been able to reduce our cost for most of our peers cost. Our track record is evident of our ability to be more productive for our customers and our plans for the future continue this. There based on good business decisions could have already been made the permit ongoing legacy cost reductions, productivity gains as the workforce turns over, the shift from cold to gas generation, the introduction of smart meters and the elimination of waste. As we improve customer quality to better work processes, we'll save on overtime cost and temporary workers by simply doing it right the first time.
For example, nearly 1/3 of the time when you're old trucks on a job, something goes wrong. The parts are on the truck or other parties that need to be on site aren't always on time. We're aggressively pursuing these opportunities to improve quality for our customers.
For 2014 and 2015, we reduced our cost by 4%, and by 2018 expect to have reduced our cost by at least 10%. While our model is successful with our cost reductions, it helps equally at sales grow. Our team believes that our sales growth will be about 2% this year and in the future, but we plan conservatively. For the purposes of executing our model, we're assuming growth of 1%.
We put all of this together and end up with the attractive business model for our customers, with their level of service and affordability improves every year, and the same model permits us to do deliver 6% to 8% earnings growth beginning in 2017. It's a reaffirmation of our confidence in our ability to deliver earnings per share and dividend growth at a level that you have come to expect.
Now, I'll turn the call over to Tom."

Let's look at the business for 2015, 2016 and beyond. As you can see here, in 2015, our earnings grew by $0.12 or 20% on a weather-normalized basis.

As you can see here, in 2015, our earnings grew by $0.12 or 20% on a weather-normalized basis. We achieved with these consistent results despite the fact that December was the warmest on record, exceeding by 10% the previous record in 1923. For December, Michigan was 37% warmer than normal.
As we mentioned last week, we offset the mild weather and the couple of year-end storms by achieving a tax settlement in Michigan, putting off some donations to our foundation and other improvements. With a mild weather bills was substantially lower-than-expected, which is helpful to our customers, but it also results in lower uncollectible accounts. So weather was not normal, dragging down profits. Our commitment to manage the work was normal. No excuses from us. We're pleased to have continued great progress for our customers, and once again delivered on 7% growth for our owners.
We achieved all of our financial targets for 2015. These included strong capital investment; healthy balance sheet ratios; dramatic customer pricing decreases; robust operating cash flow growth; top end of guidance EPS growth; and as announced last week, another substantial increase in our dividend.
For 2016, we're pleased to have raised our guidance to reflect 5% to 7% growth on top of high-end 2015 results, which were at the top end of guidance for 2015. We continue to build success upon success, no recess here. While our electric and gas rate cases primarily reflect capital investment, they also permit us to flow through productivity improvements to our customers. This is one of the elements of our model that makes high-end earnings growth sustainable. It's also noteworthy that 3 quarters of the rate change impact already has either been authorized or self implemented. And let's not forget the Ferrari -- excuse me, as Patty would say that Tesla in the garage. After all, the Tesla does 0 to 60 in 2.8 seconds, that's faster than the Ferrari spider.
At DIG, we have long-term energy contracts locked in providing stable results. And with a large portion of capacity available, we continue to have read for upside. Here is our sensitive slide that they provide each quarter to assist with assessing our prospects. There is not a lot of news, there seldom is. You can see that with a reasonable planning assumptions and with robust risk mitigation, the probability of large variances from our plan are minimized. And while we look forward to the 2008 Energy Law update, our plan does not reflect any of the upside associated with this.
Our cash flow and earnings growth are driven by our capital investment program. With our recent announcement increasing capital investment by $1.5 billion to $17 billion over the next 10 years, earnings and cash flow growth will accelerate. Starting in 2017, we're lifting EPS growth guidance to 6% to 8%, bracketing historic growth at 7%. The higher investment kicks in for '17, and we have more O&M reinvestment accomplished yet this year.
We still have opportunities in excess of $3 billion to add to our plan in the future. For the last 12 years, our gross operating cash flow has been growing by more than $100 million each year. Since 2004, it has increased from $353 million a year to $1.9 billion. Over the next 5 years, it should growth about $800 million to $2.7 billion, cash
Our net operating cash flow also grows by $0.5 billion. This reflects capital investment recovery, aggressive working capital management and little help from Uncle Sam. Newborn's depreciation is welcomed, funding part of our increase capital investment and preserving NOLs for future shelter. Amazingly, I have to admit -- amazingly, we may go over 7 years instead of 5, with no need for dilutive equity.
While the benefit of bonus depreciation is about 1/3 of our CapEx lift of $1.5 billion, it's half of the rate base increases for the 2016 to 2020 period. With the left, billing CapEx in behind the Jackson plant purchase, which was accelerated to December 2015 from '16, and our incremental pension contribution rate base rises $1.2 billion, one half of which is funded by bonus depreciation.
This results in an upside to earnings of $0.02 or 1% a year and that starts in 2017.
Here is our new report card, we anticipate another good year of 2016 and an even stronger year in 2017. With no big debts and robust risk mitigation, our model sows our customers and you well. New companies are able to deliver top end earnings growth while substantially improving value and service for customers.
Value for customers is what has made our plan so sustainable. Here is how we do it. Reasonable cost reductions of 2% to 3%, and service of sales growth at 1%, and other tools that avoid dilution worth another 2%, allow us to self fund 5 points to 6 points of earnings per share growth. Customer base rate increases can be at or below the level of inflation. These very same model at cell phones investment for customers also allows us to self fund a large portion of our capital needs. The model has worked for a decade. It's our plan for the next 5 years. And that's making it attractive for investors and customers and consequently, sustainable.
John Patty and I will be visiting Boston and New York next week and we look forward to answering your questions about these plans, so until then, Steve would you please open the lines to take some questions today."

So as we increase the amount, bonus depreciation obviously took a little bit of that way, but it certainly allowed us to continue to grow at even a higher rates than we had before, but also keep our customer rates at or below rate of inflation. And that's something that we finally decided to do. And as Patty mentioned in her presentation, we also have increased operating costs, particularly, in the O&M area, that we're seeing the results that our customers want from service and quality.

The sales were down and residential flat, commercials off a little bit, as you can see there, and industrial is off a little bit. Recall this, we actually can't name the customer here, but we do have a customer who has spent most of the year getting a supply issue taken care of. And so they have actually dampened our sales through the year. They are not a big margin so it's not a big issue. They are starting to turn up already. And so their restoration is just getting back to where they used to be, and I suspect they're going to do better. We're kind of offset the negative with a plus this year, but here's the important part. I would tell you our internal data tells us that we're going to grow more than what we've shown you today. So very visually today 1% and then 4% on the industrial side, our internal data gives us higher numbers. We just don't believe in going out there with something that we can't deliver on. So we put in more conservative numbers. Here's what's going to drive the uptick. I think, by the way, residential and commercial are still be a little uneven, but I just call it flat.
Industrial side is coming around because we're seeing new companies hooking up new facilities, new businesses coming into the state and our existing businesses doing better. So for example, we've got a brick-maker, high-end brick maker, who is going to add 24 megawatts -- building the building and doing the work right now, so that's coming out. We see one of our automotive folks actually putting in new paint facilities and running more extended periods of time, that's another big chunk of megawatts coming in that wasn't there before. We see just a variety of people, particularly, on the food side, housing side, plastic and rubber sector and paper and paper product sector that are all giving us the size information about optics. So we see some good news and we're happy for that. But we'll tell you, 1% growth, we think will be quite good our model."

So we don't see that as a big issue, but I'll tell you again, if you saw the detail of our 5-year plans, you'd see that we had gas prices rising quite a bit.

Thanks for joining us on our year-end earnings call.
I'll begin the presentation with a review of last year's results and this year's priorities before turning the call over to Patti for a review of our unique customer and investor model. Tom will provide the financial results and outlook, then as usual, close with the Q&A.
2015 earnings per share were $1.89, up 7% from the prior year's actual result. We are raising our 2016 guidance to $1.99 to $2.02 per share. This is an increase of 5% to 7%, reflecting our predictable and consistent 5% to 7% performance year-over-year. Recently, our board approved a 7% dividend increase, raising it to $1.24 per share. This results in a competitive payout ratio of 62%. 
2015 was a record setting year. I'm most proud of our safety result, the best in our company's 130-year history. Our distribution minutes were the best in a decade, and the generation plant performance was the best ever. Customer satisfaction rose to first quartile for both residential, electric and gas customers. Since 2006, the company has achieved breakthrough performance. Safety incidents are down 79%, productivity is up 62%, outage minutes are down 34% and employee engagement is first quartile. I'm confident this performance will continue to drive the results you've been accustomed to. These areas will continue to improve, and we look to other initiatives to improve service and reduce costs.
Michigan currently has a strong energy law in the books. The law supports 10% renewable energy, energy efficiency standards, forward-looking test years and a retail open access capped at 10%. As you would expect, the Governor is focus on the water issue in Flint. His attention should be focused on helping the people of Flint, a city that we serve. In the meantime, we expect the energy committees in the House and Senate to continue their work. We expect an updated energy law will be passed by the first half of this year. But keep in mind and this is important, the update to the energy law is not in our plan. In fact, we have not included any law-related capital investments in our plan.
For 2016, we plan to continue our breakthrough performance. Operationally, we will continue to make safety a top priority for our employees, customers and the communities we serve. Again this year, we are planning cost reductions to our industry-leading performance. We will continue to execute our strategy and deliver the same predictable financial performance as we have in the past.
Now I would like to welcome and turn the call over to Patti."

We're especially pleased to announced today, that we are raising our guidance, beginning in 2017 to 6% to 8% from 5% to 7%. This reflects the increase in capital investment to $17 billion over the next 10 years, from $15.5 billion as anno",678,"Thank you, John. We're especially pleased to announced today, that we are raising our guidance, beginning in 2017 to 6% to 8% from 5% to 7%. This reflects the increase in capital investment to $17 billion over the next 10 years, from $15.5 billion as announced last week. As most of you know, we have been delivering 7% growth each year for over a decade. While this increase reflects the higher level of capital spending, it demonstrates our comfort in continuing 7% growth, the midpoint of our new range for years ahead.
You might ask, why we're not raising the guidance for 2016. We still have opportunities to reinvest O&M and to strengthen our reliability and the higher level of capital investment doesn't fully kick-in until later this year.
Our confidence in the sustainability of our premier earnings growth rate is a reflection of our business model, where we self-fund a large portion of the capital investment growth for our customers. We do this by reducing our cost and avoiding the need for block equity with the dissociated dilution. This model permits us to keep base rate increases at or below inflation, resulting in sustainable growth.
Both our core and increased level of capital investment are targeted to improve customer service, enhance reliability and among several other things, increase affordability by providing for cost reductions. The $1.5 billion increase in capital investment includes: $800 million in the next 5 years to replace aging infrastructure and improve service reliability. It also includes another $700 million in the following 5 years to provide for the clean energy resources, we believe, will be needed to meet the Clean Power Plan in the most economical way.
We still have considerable opportunities for even more capital investment. Those opportunities included replacing PPAs when they expire. These opportunities alone represent the need for an additional 2,000 megawatts of capacity and around another $2 billion of capital investment. We also need to do more with our gas infrastructure and modernization of the grid. And likely, we'll need further capital investment for renewables. None of this is attributable to the update in the 2008 energy law. These investments will be required with or without a change to that law.
In the past, we reminded you that we've been able to reduce our costs where most of our peers add cost. Our track record is evidence of our ability to be more productive for our customers and our plans for the future continue this. They are based on good business decisions that have already been made that permit ongoing legacy cost reductions, productivity gains as the workforce turns over, the shift from coal to gas generation, the introduction of smart meters and the elimination of waste. As we improve customer quality to better work processes, we'll save on overtime cost and temporary workers by simply doing it right the first time.
For example, nearly 1/3 of the time when we roll trucks on a job, something goes wrong. The right parts are on the truck or other parties who need to be on site aren't always on time. We're aggressively pursuing these opportunities to improve quality for our customers.
For 2014 and 2015, we reduced our costs by 4%, and by 2018 expect to have reduced our costs by at least 10%. While our model is successful with our cost reductions, it helps equally add sales growth. Our team believes that our sales growth will be about 2% this year and in the future, but we plan conservatively. For the purposes of executing our model, we're assuming growth of 1%.
We put all of this together and end up with the attractive business model for our customers, with their level of service and affordability improves every year and the same model permits us to deliver 6% to 8% earnings growth beginning in 2017. It's a reaffirmation of our confidence in our ability to deliver earnings per share and dividend growth at a level that you have come to expect.
Now, I'll turn the call over to Tom."

As we mentioned last week, we offset the mild weather and a couple of year-end storms by achieving a tax settlement in Michigan, putting off some donations to our foundation and other improvements. With a mild weather bills were substantially lower than expected, which is helpful to our customers, but it also results in lower uncollectible accounts. So weather was not normal, dragging down profits. Our commitment to manage the work was normal. No excuses from us. We're pleased to have continued great progress for our customers, and once again delivered on 7% growth for our owners.
We achieved all of our financial targets for 2015. These included strong capital investment; healthy balance sheet ratios; dramatic customer price decreases; robust operating cash flow growth; top end of guidance EPS growth; and as announced last week, another substantial increase in our dividend.
For 2016, we're pleased to have raised our guidance to reflect 5% to 7% growth on top of high end 2015 results, which were at the top end of guidance for 2015. We continue to build success upon success, no recess here. While our electric and gas rate cases primarily reflect capital investment, they also permit us to flow through productivity improvements to our customers. This is one of the elements of our model that make high-end earnings growth sustainable. It's also noteworthy that 3 quarters of the rate change impact already has either been authorized or self implemented. And let's not forget the Ferrari -- excuse me, as Patti would say the Tesla in the garage. After all, the Tesla does 0 to 60 in 2.8 seconds, that's faster than the Ferrari Spider.
At DIG, we have long-term energy contracts locked in providing stable results. And with a large portion of capacity available, we continue to have room for upside. Here's our sensitivity slide that we provide each quarter to assist with assessing our prospects. There's not a lot of news, there's seldom is. You can see that with reasonable planning assumptions and with robust risk mitigation, the probability of large variances from our plan are minimized. And while we look forward to the 2008 energy law update, our plan does not reflect any of the upside associated with it.
Our cash flow and earnings growth are driven by our capital investment program. With our recent announcement, increasing capital investment by $1.5 billion to $17 billion over the next 10 years, earnings and cash flow growth will accelerate. Starting in 2017, we are lifting EPS growth guidance to 6% to 8%, bracketing historic growth at 7%. The higher investment kicks in for '17, and we have more O&M reinvestment to accomplish yet this year.
We still have opportunities in excess of $3 billion to add to our plan in the future. For the last 12 years, our gross operating cash flow has been growing by more than $100 million each year. Since 2004, it has increased from $353 million a year to $1.9 billion. Over the next 5 years, it should grow about $800 million to $2.7 billion, cash is king. 
Our net operating cash flow also grows by $0.5 billion. This reflects capital investment recovery, aggressive working capital management and honestly, a little help from Uncle Sam. New bonus depreciation is welcomed, funding part of our increased capital investment and preserving NOLs for future shelter. Amazingly, I have to admit -- amazingly, we may go over 7 years instead of 5, with no need for dilutive-block equity.
While the benefit of bonus depreciation is about 1/3 of our CapEx lift of $1.5 billion, it's half of the rate base increases for the 2016 to 2020 period. With the lift, billing CapEx in behind the Jackson plant purchase, which was accelerated to December 2015 from '16, and our incremental pension contribution rate base rises $1.2 billion, one half of which is funded by bonus depreciation.
This results in an upside to earnings of $0.02 or 1% a year and that starts in 2017.
Here is our new report card. We anticipate another good year of 2016 and an even stronger year in 2017. With no big debts and robust risk mitigation, our model serves our customers and you well. New companies are able to deliver top end earnings growth, while substantially improving value and service for customers.
Value for customers is what has made our plan so sustainable. Here is how we do it. Reasonable cost reductions of 2% to 3%, and service of sales growth at 1%, and other tools that avoid dilution worth another 2% allow us to self-fund 5 points to 6 points of earnings per share growth. Customer base rate increases can be at or below the level of inflation. This very same model that self funds investments for our customers also allows us to self-fund a large portion of our capital needs. The model has worked for a decade. It's our plan for the next 5 years. And that's making it attractive for investors and customers and consequently, sustainable.
John, Patti and I will be visiting Boston and New York next week, and we look forward to answering your questions about these plans. So until then, Steve would you please open the lines to take some questions today."

So as we increase the amount, bonus depreciation obviously took a little bit of that way, but it certainly allowed us to continue to grow at even a higher rate than we had before, but also keep our customer rates at or below the rate of inflation. And that's something that we finally decided to do. And as Patti mentioned in her presentation, we also have increased the operating costs, particularly, in the O&M area, that we're seeing the results that our customers want from service and quality.

And you can see that on what we call 11 and 12 of our data, and it comes out with a press release. The sales were down and residentials flat, commercials off a little bit, as you can see there, but industrials off a little bit. Recall this, we actually can't name the customer here, but we do have a customer who has spent most of the year getting a supply issue taken care of. And so they have actually dampened our sales through the year. They're not a big margin, so it's not a big issue. They are starting to turn up already. And so their restoration is just getting back to where they used to be, and I suspect they're going to do better. We'll kind of offset the negative, with a plus this year, but here's the important part. I would tell you -- our internal data tells us that we're going to grow more than what we've shown you today. So where we show you 1% and then 4% on the industrial side, our internal data gives us higher numbers. We just don't believe in going out there with something that we can't deliver on. So we put in more conservative numbers. Here's what's going to drive the uptick. I think, by the way, residential and commercial will still be a little uneven, but I'll just call it flat. The industrial side is coming around because we're seeing new companies hooking up new facilities, new businesses coming into the state and our existing businesses doing better. So for example, we got a brake maker, high-end brake maker, who's going to add 24 megawatts. And I mean, they're building the building and doing the work right now, so that's coming out. We see one of our automotive folks actually putting in new paint facilities and running more extended periods of time. That's another big chunk of megawatts coming in that wasn't there before. We see just a variety of people, particularly, on the food side, housing side, plastic and rubber sector and paper and paper product sector that are all giving us precise information about upticks. So we see some good news and we're happy for that. But we'll tell you, 1% growth, we think will be quite good. It suits our model."

And when they look at where they were, even if we had a substantial rise and they look at where they were just a few years ago, way better situation. They compare gas for whether it's home heating or industrial or electric -- they compare that even with higher prices to alternatives. It is pretty attractive. So we don't see that as a big issue, but I'll tell you again, if you saw the detail of our 5-year plans, you'd see that we had gas prices rising quite a bit.

Thanks for joining us on our year-end earnings call.
I'll begin the presentation with a review of last year's results and this year's priorities before turning the call over to Patti for a review of our unique customer and investor model. Tom will provide the financial results and outlook, then as usual, close with the Q&A.
2015 earnings per share were $1.89, up 7% from the prior year's actual result. We are raising our 2016 guidance to $1.99 to $2.02 per share. This is an increase of 5% to 7%, reflecting our predictable and consistent 5% to 7% performance year-over-year. Recently, our board approved a 7% dividend increase, raising it to $1.24 per share. This results in a competitive payout ratio of 62%. 
2015 was a record setting year. I'm most proud of our safety result, the best in our company's 130-year history. Our distribution minutes were the best in a decade, and the generation plant performance was the best ever. Customer satisfaction rose to first quartile for both residential, electric and gas customers. Since 2006, the company has achieved breakthrough performance. Safety incidents are down 79%, productivity is up 62%, outage minutes are down 34% and employee engagement is first quartile. I'm confident this performance will continue to drive the results you've been accustomed to. These areas will continue to improve, and we look to other initiatives to improve service and reduce costs.
Michigan currently has a strong energy law in the books. The law supports 10% renewable energy, energy efficiency standards, forward-looking test years and a retail open access capped at 10%. As you would expect, the Governor is focus on the water issue in Flint. His attention should be focused on helping the people of Flint, a city that we serve. In the meantime, we expect the energy committees in the House and Senate to continue their work. We expect an updated energy law will be passed by the first half of this year. But keep in mind and this is important, the update to the energy law is not in our plan. In fact, we have not included any law-related capital investments in our plan.
For 2016, we plan to continue our breakthrough performance. Operationally, we will continue to make safety a top priority for our employees, customers and the communities we serve. Again this year, we are planning cost reductions to our industry-leading performance. We will continue to execute our strategy and deliver the same predictable financial performance as we have in the past.
Now I would like to welcome and turn the call over to Patti."
257682,312963738,927352,"CMS Energy Corp., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 04, 2016",2016-02-04,"Earnings Calls","CMS Energy Corporation","Executives","Thank you, John. We're especially pleased to announced today, that we are raising our guidance, beginning in 2017 to 6% to 8% from 5% to 7%. This reflects the increase in capital investment to $17 billion over the next 10 years, from $15.5 billion as anno",678,"Thank you, John. We're especially pleased to announced today, that we are raising our guidance, beginning in 2017 to 6% to 8% from 5% to 7%. This reflects the increase in capital investment to $17 billion over the next 10 years, from $15.5 billion as announced last week. As most of you know, we have been delivering 7% growth each year for over a decade. While this increase reflects the higher level of capital spending, it demonstrates our comfort in continuing 7% growth, the midpoint of our new range for years ahead.
You might ask, why we're not raising the guidance for 2016. We still have opportunities to reinvest O&M and to strengthen our reliability and the higher level of capital investment doesn't fully kick-in until later this year.
Our confidence in the sustainability of our premier earnings growth rate is a reflection of our business model, where we self-fund a large portion of the capital investment growth for our customers. We do this by reducing our cost and avoiding the need for block equity with its associated dilution. This model permits us to keep base rate increases at or below inflation, resulting in sustainable growth.
Both our core and increased level of capital investment are targeted to improve customer service, enhance reliability and among several other things, increase affordability by providing for cost reductions. The $1.5 billion increase in capital investment includes: $800 million in the next 5 years to replace aging infrastructure and improve service reliability. It also includes another $700 million in the following 5 years to provide for the clean energy resources, we believe, will be needed to meet the Clean Power Plan in the most economical way.
We still have considerable opportunities for even more capital investment. Those opportunities included replacing PPAs when they expire. These opportunities alone represent the need for an additional 2,000 megawatts of capacity and around another $2 billion of capital investment. We also need to do more with our gas infrastructure and modernization of the grid. And likely, we'll need further capital investment for renewables. None of this is attributable to the update in the 2008 energy law. These investments will be required with or without a change to that law.
In the past, we reminded you that we've been able to reduce our costs where most of our peers add cost. Our track record is evidence of our ability to be more productive for our customers and our plans for the future continue this. They are based on good business decisions that have already been made that permit ongoing legacy cost reductions, productivity gains as the workforce turns over, the shift from coal to gas generation, the introduction of smart meters and the elimination of waste. As we improve customer quality through better work processes, we'll save on overtime cost and temporary workers by simply doing it right the first time.
For example, nearly 1/3 of the time when we roll trucks on a job, something goes wrong. The right parts aren't on the truck or other parties who need to be on site aren't always on time. We're aggressively pursuing these opportunities to improve quality for our customers.
For 2014 and 2015, we reduced our costs by 4%, and by 2018 expect to have reduced our costs by at least 10%. While our model is successful with our cost reductions, it helps equally as sales grow. Our team believes that our sales growth will be about 2% this year and in the future, but we plan conservatively. For the purposes of executing our model, we're assuming growth of 1%.
We put all of this together and end up with the attractive business model for our customers, with their level of service and affordability improves every year and the same model permits us to deliver 6% to 8% earnings growth beginning in 2017. It's a reaffirmation of our confidence in our ability to deliver earnings per share and dividend growth at a level that you have come to expect.
Now, I'll turn the call over to Tom."

Let's look at the business for 2015, 2016 and beyond. As you can see here, in 2015, our earnings grew by $0.12 or 20% on a weather-normalized basis. We achieved these consistent results despite the fact that December was the warmest on reco",934,"Thanks, Patti. Let's look at the business for 2015, 2016 and beyond. As you can see here, in 2015, our earnings grew by $0.12 or 20% on a weather-normalized basis. We achieved these consistent results despite the fact that December was the warmest on record, exceeding by 10% the previous record in 1923. For December, Michigan was 37% warmer than normal.
As we mentioned last week, we offset the mild weather and a couple of year-end storms by achieving a tax settlement in Michigan, putting off some donations to our foundation and other improvements. With a mild weather bills were substantially lower than expected, which is helpful to our customers, but it also results in lower uncollectible accounts. So weather was not normal, dragging down profits. Our commitment to manage the work was normal. No excuses from us. We're pleased to have continued great progress for our customers, and once again delivered on 7% growth for our owners.
We achieved all of our financial targets for 2015. These included strong capital investment; healthy balance sheet ratios; dramatic customer price decreases; robust operating cash flow growth; top end of guidance EPS growth; and as announced last week, another substantial increase in our dividend.
For 2016, we're pleased to have raised our guidance to reflect 5% to 7% growth on top of high end 2015 results, which were at the top end of guidance for 2015. We continue to build success upon success, no recess here. While our electric and gas rate cases primarily reflect capital investment, they also permit us to flow through productivity improvements to our customers. This is one of the elements of our model that make high-end earnings growth sustainable. It's also noteworthy that 3 quarters of the rate change impact already has either been authorized or self implemented. And let's not forget the Ferrari -- excuse me, as Patti would say the Tesla in the garage. After all, the Tesla does 0 to 60 in 2.8 seconds, that's faster than the Ferrari Spider.
At DIG, we have long-term energy contracts locked in providing stable results. And with a large portion of capacity available, we continue to have room for upside. Here's our sensitivity slide that we provide each quarter to assist with assessing our prospects. There's not a lot of news, there seldom is. You can see that with reasonable planning assumptions and with robust risk mitigation, the probability of large variances from our plan are minimized. And while we look forward to the 2008 energy law update, our plan does not reflect any of the upside associated with it.
Our cash flow and earnings growth are driven by our capital investment program. With our recent announcement, increasing capital investment by $1.5 billion to $17 billion over the next 10 years, earnings and cash flow growth will accelerate. Starting in 2017, we are lifting EPS growth guidance to 6% to 8%, bracketing historic growth at 7%. The higher investment kicks in for '17, and we have more O&M reinvestment to accomplish yet this year.
We still have opportunities in excess of $3 billion to add to our plan in the future. For the last 12 years, our gross operating cash flow has been growing by more than $100 million each year. Since 2004, it has increased from $353 million a year to $1.9 billion. Over the next 5 years, it should grow about $800 million to $2.7 billion, cash is king. 
Our net operating cash flow also grows by $0.5 billion. This reflects capital investment recovery, aggressive working capital management and honestly, a little help from Uncle Sam. New bonus depreciation is welcomed, funding part of our increased capital investment and preserving NOLs for future shelter. Amazingly, I have to admit -- amazingly, we may go over 7 years instead of 5, with no need for dilutive-block equity.
While the benefit of bonus depreciation is about 1/3 of our CapEx lift of $1.5 billion, it's half of the rate base increases for the 2016 to 2020 period. With the lift, billing CapEx in behind the Jackson plant purchase, which was accelerated to December 2015 from '16, and our incremental pension contribution rate base rises $1.2 billion, one half of which is funded by bonus depreciation.
This results in an upside to earnings of $0.02 or 1% a year and that starts in 2017.
Here is our new report card. We anticipate another good year of 2016 and an even stronger year in 2017. With no big debts and robust risk mitigation, our model serves our customers and you well. New companies are able to deliver top end earnings growth, while substantially improving value and service for customers.
Value for customers is what has made our plan so sustainable. Here is how we do it. Reasonable cost reductions of 2% to 3%, conservative sales growth at 1%, and other tools that avoid dilution worth another 2% allow us to self-fund 5 points to 6 points of earnings per share growth. Customer base rate increases can be at or below the level of inflation. This very same model that self funds investments for our customers also allows us to self-fund a large portion of our capital needs. The model has worked for a decade. It's our plan for the next 5 years. And that's making it attractive for investors and customers and consequently, sustainable.
John, Patti and I will be visiting Boston and New York next week, and we look forward to answering your questions about these plans. So until then, Steve would you please open the lines to take some questions today."

And as Patti mentioned in her presentation, we also have increased the operating costs, particularly, in the O&M area, that we're seeing the results that our customers want from service and quality. And that's really what we're going after. So now is the time, and obviously with our performance, we think bracketing it between 6% to 8% is the right approach going forward. Go ahead, Patti."

And you can see that on what we call 11 and 12 of our data, and it comes out with a press release. The sales were down and residentials flat, commercials off a little bit, as you can see there, but industrials off a little bit. Recall this, we actually can't name the customer here, but we do have a customer who has spent most of the year getting a supply issue taken care of. And so they have actually dampened our sales through the year. They're not a big margin, so it's not a big issue. They are starting to turn up already. And so their restoration is just getting back to where they used to be, and I suspect they're going to do better, will kind of offset the negative, with a plus this year, but here's the important part. I would tell you -- our internal data tells us that we're going to grow more than what we've shown you today. So where we show you 1% and then 4% on the industrial side, our internal data gives us higher numbers. We just don't believe in going out there with something that we can't deliver on. So we put in more conservative numbers. Here's what's going to drive the uptick. I think, by the way, residential and commercial will still be a little uneven, but I'll just call it flat. The industrial side is coming around because we're seeing new companies hooking up new facilities, new businesses coming into the state and our existing businesses doing better. So for example, we got a brake maker, high-end brake maker, who's going to add 24 megawatts. And I mean, they're building the building and doing the work right now, so that's coming out. We see one of our automotive folks actually putting in new paint facilities and running more extended periods of time. That's another big chunk of megawatts coming in that wasn't there before. We see just a variety of people, particularly, on the food side, housing side, plastic and rubber sector and paper and paper product sector that are all giving us precise information about upticks. So we see some good news and we're happy for that. But we'll tell you, 1% growth, we think will be quite good. It suits our model."

And when they look at where they were, even if we had a substantial rise and they look at where they were just a few years ago, way better situation. They compare gas for whether it's home heating or industrial or electric -- they compare that even with higher prices to alternatives. It is pretty attractive. So we don't see that as a big issue, but I'll tell you again, if you saw the detail of our 5-year plans, you'd see that we had gas prices rising quite a bit.

Thanks for joining us on our year-end earnings call.
I'll begin the presentation with a review of last year's results and this year's priorities before turning the call over to Patti for a review of our unique customer and investor model. Tom will provide the financial results and outlook, then as usual, close with the Q&A.
2015 earnings per share were $1.89, up 7% from the prior year's actual result. We are raising our 2016 guidance to $1.99 to $2.02 per share. This is an increase of 5% to 7%, reflecting our predictable and consistent 5% to 7% performance year-over-year. Recently, our board approved a 7% dividend increase, raising it to $1.24 per share. This results in a competitive payout ratio of 62%. 
2015 was a record setting year. I'm most proud of our safety result, the best in our company's 130-year history. Our distribution minutes were the best in a decade, and the generation plant performance was the best ever. Customer satisfaction rose to first quartile for both residential, electric and gas customers. Since 2006, the company has achieved breakthrough performance. Safety incidents are down 79%, productivity is up 62%, outage minutes are down 34% and employee engagement is first quartile. I'm confident this performance will continue to drive the results you've been accustomed to. These areas will continue to improve, and we look to other initiatives to improve service and reduce costs.
Michigan currently has a strong energy law in the books. The law supports 10% renewable energy, energy efficiency standards, forward-looking test years and a retail open access capped at 10%. As you would expect, the Governor is focus on the water issue in Flint. His attention should be focused on helping the people of Flint, a city that we serve. In the meantime, we expect the energy committees in the House and Senate to continue their work. We expect an updated energy law will be passed by the first half of this year. But keep in mind and this is important, the update to the energy law is not in our plan. In fact, we have not included any law-related capital investments in our plan.
For 2016, we plan to continue our breakthrough performance. Operationally, we will continue to make safety a top priority for our employees, customers and the communities we serve. Again this year, we are planning cost reductions to our industry-leading performance. We will continue to execute our strategy and deliver the same predictable financial performance as we have in the past.
Now I would like to welcome and turn the call over to Patti."
257682,312963738,927646,"CMS Energy Corp., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 04, 2016",2016-02-04,"Earnings Calls","CMS Energy Corporation","Executives","Thank you, John. We're especially pleased to announce today that we are raising our guidance beginning in 2017 to 6% to 8% from 5% to 7%. This reflects the increase in capital investment to $17 billion over the next 10 years, from $15.5 billion as announc",678,"Thank you, John. We're especially pleased to announce today that we are raising our guidance beginning in 2017 to 6% to 8% from 5% to 7%. This reflects the increase in capital investment to $17 billion over the next 10 years, from $15.5 billion as announced last week. As most of you know, we have been delivering 7% growth each year for over a decade. While this increase reflects the higher level of capital spending, it demonstrates our comfort in continuing 7% growth, the midpoint of our new range for years ahead.
You might ask, why we're not raising the guidance for 2016. We still have opportunities to reinvest O&M and to strengthen our reliability and the higher level of capital investment doesn't fully kick-in until later this year.
Our confidence in the sustainability of our premier earnings growth rate is a reflection of our business model, where we self-fund a large portion of the capital investment growth for our customers. We do this by reducing our cost and avoiding the need for block equity with its associated dilution. This model permits us to keep base rate increases at or below inflation, resulting in sustainable growth.
Both our core and increased level of capital investment are targeted to improve customer service, enhance reliability and among several other things, increase affordability by providing for cost reductions. The $1.5 billion increase in capital investment includes: $800 million in the next 5 years to replace aging infrastructure and improve service reliability. It also includes another $700 million in the following 5 years to provide for the clean energy resources, we believe, will be needed to meet the Clean Power Plan in the most economical way.
We still have considerable opportunities for even more capital investment. Those opportunities included replacing PPAs when they expire. These opportunities alone represent the need for an additional 2,000 megawatts of capacity and around another $2 billion of capital investment. We also need to do more with our gas infrastructure and modernization of the grid. And likely, we'll need further capital investment for renewables. None of this is attributable to the update in the 2008 energy law. These investments will be required with or without a change to that law.
In the past, we reminded you that we've been able to reduce our costs where most of our peers add cost. Our track record is evidence of our ability to be more productive for our customers and our plans for the future continue this. They are based on good business decisions that have already been made that permit ongoing legacy cost reductions, productivity gains as the workforce turns over, the shift from coal to gas generation, the introduction of smart meters and the elimination of waste. As we improve customer quality through better work processes, we'll save on overtime cost and temporary workers by simply doing it right the first time.
For example, nearly 1/3 of the time when we roll trucks on a job, something goes wrong. The right parts aren't on the truck or other parties who need to be on site aren't always on time. We're aggressively pursuing these opportunities to improve quality for our customers.
For 2014 and 2015, we reduced our costs by 4%, and by 2018 expect to have reduced our costs by at least 10%. While our model is successful with our cost reductions, it helps equally as sales grow. Our team believes that our sales growth will be about 2% this year and in the future, but we plan conservatively. For the purposes of executing our model, we're assuming growth of 1%.
We put all of this together and end up with the attractive business model for our customers, with their level of service and affordability improves every year and the same model permits us to deliver 6% to 8% earnings growth beginning in 2017. It's a reaffirmation of our confidence in our ability to deliver earnings per share and dividend growth at a level that you have come to expect.
Now, I'll turn the call over to Tom."

Let's look at the business for 2015, 2016 and beyond. As you can see here, in 2015, our earnings grew by $0.12 or 20% on a weather-normalized basis.

As you can see here, in 2015, our earnings grew by $0.12 or 20% on a weather-normalized basis. We achieved these consistent results despite the fact that December was the warmest on record, exceeding by 10% the previous record in 1923. For December, Michigan was 37% warmer than normal.
As we mentioned last week, we offset the mild weather and a couple of year-end storms by achieving a tax settlement in Michigan, putting off some donations to our foundation and other improvements. With a mild weather bills were substantially lower than expected, which is helpful to our customers, but it also results in lower uncollectible accounts. So weather was not normal, dragging down profits. Our commitment to manage the work was normal. No excuses from us. We're pleased to have continued great progress for our customers, and once again delivered on 7% growth for our owners.
We achieved all of our financial targets for 2015. These included strong capital investment; healthy balance sheet ratios; dramatic customer price decreases; robust operating cash flow growth; top end of guidance EPS growth; and as announced last week, another substantial increase in our dividend.
For 2016, we're pleased to have raised our guidance to reflect 5% to 7% growth on top of high end 2015 results, which were at the top end of guidance for 2015. We continue to build success upon success, no recess here. While our electric and gas rate cases primarily reflect capital investment, they also permit us to flow through productivity improvements to our customers. This is one of the elements of our model that make high-end earnings growth sustainable. It's also noteworthy that 3 quarters of the rate change impact already has either been authorized or self-implemented. And let's not forget the Ferrari -- excuse me, as Patti would say the Tesla in the garage. After all, the Tesla does 0 to 60 in 2.8 seconds, that's faster than the Ferrari Spider.
At DIG, we have long-term energy contracts locked in providing stable results. And with a large portion of capacity available, we continue to have room for upside. Here's our sensitivity slide that we provide each quarter to assist with assessing our prospects. There's not a lot of news, there seldom is. You can see that with reasonable planning assumptions and with robust risk mitigation, the probability of large variances from our plan are minimized. And while we look forward to the 2008 energy law update, our plan does not reflect any of the upside associated with it.
Our cash flow and earnings growth are driven by our capital investment program. With our recent announcement, increasing capital investment by $1.5 billion to $17 billion over the next 10 years, earnings and cash flow growth will accelerate. Starting in 2017, we are lifting EPS growth guidance to 6% to 8%, bracketing historic growth at 7%. The higher investment kicks in for '17, and we have more O&M reinvestment to accomplish yet this year.
We still have opportunities in excess of $3 billion to add to our plan in the future. For the last 12 years, our gross operating cash flow has been growing by more than $100 million each year. Since 2004, it has increased from $353 million a year to $1.9 billion. Over the next 5 years, it should grow about $800 million to $2.7 billion, cash is king. 
Our net operating cash flow also grows by $0.5 billion. This reflects capital investment recovery, aggressive working capital management and honestly, a little help from Uncle Sam. New bonus depreciation is welcomed, funding part of our increased capital investment and preserving NOLs for future shelter. Amazingly, I have to admit -- amazingly, we may go over 7 years instead of 5, with no need for dilutive-block equity.
While the benefit of bonus depreciation is about 1/3 of our CapEx lift of $1.5 billion, it's half of the rate base increases for the 2016 to 2020 period. With the lift, billing CapEx in behind the Jackson plant purchase, which was accelerated to December 2015 from '16, and our incremental pension contribution rate base rises $1.2 billion, one half of which is funded by bonus depreciation.
This results in an upside to earnings of $0.02 or 1% a year and that starts in 2017.
Here is our new report card. We anticipate another good year of 2016 and an even stronger year in 2017. With no big debts and robust risk mitigation, our model serves our customers and you well. New companies are able to deliver top end earnings growth, while substantially improving value and service for customers.
Value for customers is what has made our plan so sustainable. Here is how we do it. Reasonable cost reductions of 2% to 3%, conservative sales growth at 1%, and other tools that avoid dilution worth another 2% allow us to self-fund 5 points to 6 points of earnings per share growth. Customer base rate increases can be at or below the level of inflation. This very same model that self-funds investments for our customers also allows us to self-fund a large portion of our capital needs. The model has worked for a decade. It's our plan for the next 5 years. And that's making it attractive for investors and customers and consequently, sustainable.
John, Patti and I will be visiting Boston and New York next week, and we look forward to answering your questions about these plans. So until then, Steve would you please open the lines to take some questions today."

At the end of the day is -- we can't wait for the lot to be done for us to make investment for our customers. And that was clear as we're moving forward. So as we increase the amount, bonus depreciation obviously took a little bit of that way, but it certainly allowed us to continue to grow at even a higher rate than we had before, but also keep our customer rates at or below the rate of inflation. And that's something that we finally decided to do. And as Patti mentioned in her presentation, we also have increased the operating costs, particularly, in the O&M area, that we're seeing the results that our customers want from service and quality.

So we put in more conservative numbers. Here's what's going to drive the uptick. I think, by the way, residential and commercial will still be a little uneven, but I'll just call it flat. The industrial side is coming around because we're seeing new companies hooking up new facilities, new businesses coming into the state and our existing businesses doing better. So for example, we got a brake maker, high-end brake maker, who's going to add 24 megawatts. And I mean, they're building the building and doing the work right now, so that's coming out. We see one of our automotive folks actually putting in new paint facilities and running more extended periods of time. That's another big chunk of megawatts coming in that wasn't there before. We see just a variety of people, particularly, on the food side, housing side, plastic and rubber sector and paper and paper product sector that are all giving us precise information about upticks. So we see some good news and we're happy for that. But we'll tell you, 1% growth, we think will be quite good. It suits our model."

And even if they did rise, and I admit if you look at it from this moment to the next moment a year from now say they did rise, sure, that's an increase, but people are looking at absolute bills, writing checks. And when they look at where they were, even if we had a substantial rise and they look at where they were just a few years ago, way better situation. They compare gas for whether it's home heating or industrial or electric -- they compare that even with higher prices to alternatives. It is pretty attractive. So we don't see that as a big issue, but I'll tell you again, if you saw the detail of our 5-year plans, you'd see that we had gas prices rising quite a bit. And even inside of that, our model still delivers what we tell you about with being able to keep base rates low, bills low if we can and also grow the business. So for us, we don't see an immediate concern."

Ali, one thing about the gas business just to remind everybody, we've got a substantial gas business here, the fourth largest in the country. We've got the largest utility storage field in the country. So at the end of the day when gas prices rise, we've had over 300 billion cubic feet of stored gas, both base and working gas, that we can draw out which really keeps us competitive in a rising market. It tends to work the other way in a declining market, actually because the gas in the storage fields tends to be a little bit higher priced than the market. So it does give us a competitive advantage, makes us -- allows us to use our transmission system fully but we're buying gas all through the year, which really helps our customers."

Thanks for joining us on our first quarter earnings call. I'll begin the presentation with a review of our first quarter results and operating performance before turning the call over to Patti to discuss our capital investment plan and cost reduction initiatives. Then Tom will provide the financial results and outlook and we'll close with Q&A.
First quarter earnings were $0.59 per share, down $0.14 from a year ago, weather was the primary factor. The mild weather that began last October continued through March, resulting in a second warmest winter on record. On a weather normalized basis, first quarter earnings were up $0.12 or 20% compared to last year. And as you would expect, we have already taken steps to mitigate the unfavorable weather impacts. Patti and Tom will talk more of your plans latter.
But today, we are our full year earnings guidance of $1.99 to $2.2 a share. Earlier this month, we retired 7 coal plans, totaling 950 megawatts, bringing our capacity mix to less than 25% coal. Our regular and routine rate case strategy remains on track. Last week, the commission approved a gas rate case settlement for $40 million, using the previously approved return on equity when required. We filed and electric rate case the 1st of March for $225 million and plan to implement later this year.
We continue to operate with the constructive energy law, the framework allows for fair and timely regulatory treatment. If the law is updated, we see this as being incrementally positive to our customers.
With the recent coal plant closures, we are proud of the fact that we have reduced the most coal capacity of any investor-owned utility. The gas for our Jackson Generating Station and new windfarms have been added to our portfolio, making our capacity mix more sustainable.
Additionally, we continue to offer energy efficiency programs, which reduced demand at 1% annually. This strategy puts us in a good position to meet future carbon reduction requirements, and as I always enjoy saying, the air is cleaner today in Michigan that has ever been in my lifetime.
On a regulatory track record is among the best in the nation. Over the last 5 years, we have filed gas and electric cases to recover capital investments and pass along O&M savings to our customers. This has been the foundation of our sustainable business model for the past decade.
In some years, our O&M reductions fully offset our capital investment needs, and we were able to avoid 3 rate cases. During this time, the ROE has remained unchanged at a competitive 10.3% for gas and electric. The latest gas rate case was the fourth consecutive one that we have settled dating back to 2011.
The current energy law in Michigan is working well, it allows us to execute our business plan, while making needed infrastructure investments and providing energy savings programs to our customers. However, the law still requires that 99.98% of our customers subsidized about 300 large customers. This is simply not fair. We believe that updates the law would be beneficial to our customers by securing reliable capacity and reducing rates. This is an opportunity for our legislatures and we will work with them on constructive updates.
Whether or not the legislators decide to act, we will continue our plan with the current law in place and move to 6% to 8% earnings growth for 2017 and beyond. There are many external factors that can affect our operational and financial results, but we work through everything and work with everyone. We remain focused on delivering the consistent and predictable results that you have come to expect. It has been an honor and privilege for me to lead the team that is delivered results over the past 6 years. I believe the company is better today than it has ever been, both financially and operationally, with a very bright future.
Now let me turn the call over to Patti, who will lead the execution of our model."

As we've said, over the next 10 years, we plan to invest $17 billion and that is a 60% increase over what we invested in the prior years. Each project is that well, in fact, add customer value.
These customer value -- the customer value takes the form of customer service, improved -- reducing costs, enhancing our productivity, enabling cleaner energy, all of these improvements drive customer value. And in fact, many of the investments provide improvements in several of these categories.
For example, our customers benefit with fewer and shorter outages when we make our investments in our electric infrastructure that not only improves the customer experience, but reduces costs. Our customers benefit when they can move into their college, apartment, hookup to Consumers Energy the service online, on their mobile phone, never speak to a customer service rep and because of our smart energy and smart meter investments, we can remotely turn on their power. No truck required.
This not only improve the customer experience end to end, but fundamentally reduces the structural cost to do so. Our smart energy program is a great example, of a major capital investments that have ongoing benefits to customers on both the service and the cost side of the equation.
Other cost savings are driven by proactively investing in replacement of legacy gas service lines, so that we can prevent an unscheduled maintenance expense and customer disruption. Our gas compression upgrades use of fuel technology, allow for a more productive workforce and less unplanned expense. And with our ongoing transition from coal to gas and our increasing renewable energy investments, we demonstrate to our customers everyday that CMS Energy is, in fact, a great steward of our great state.
As you all know, this model has been working for a long time, it's delivered results for more than a decade and the approach continues now and into years to come with our extensive inventory of our self-funded organic capital investment projects, and really importantly, offset by abundant cost reduction opportunities.
And a diverse economy, you can see why it works, especially, with the continuing focus on our cross reductions, which I'll talk a little more about. you Know, we've been a leader in this area and each year we come up with new and innovative ways to deliver both savings to our customers, from investors that means we're able to create CapEx headroom and at the same time, fulfilled our internal commitment to keep those base are increases below inflation.
Cost reductions have been and continue to be an important part of our self-funded model, but we don't cherry pick this when you put all the numbers together. We take the bad with a good we don't adjust for inflation and things are well control and in the past several years our focus has delivered an average of 3% savings, and we have a plan well plan -- a well articulate plan to execute another 6% in savings over the next 2 years. I'll give you a little more detail on that.
In fact, I'm often asked that if he continued performance and this is how I see it. And when we look at a total O&M cost per customer we look great and -- among the best of all utilities, but when I dig deep and look into our distribution numbers, we can see that you still only in the third  So for both electric and gas distribution there is more room. And in fact, when they make up a third of our total O&M expense we know this is more opportunity there.
For example, we will -- when we go to a job site, only 70% of the time to be built a job per plan. That means that the wrong material was probably ordered, maybe too much, maybe too low. The right equipment may not be available and right make up may cause a delay. We can eliminate that ways and reduce expense by improving our first time quality and More broadly, we're embarking on a companywide improvement effort and each day real savings are materializing. This approach to our first time quality is a value creation mechanism that enables for us continued cost, reductions and at the same time, deliver our 6% to 8% EPS growth in 2017 and beyond, and at the same time, improve our customers experience and keep it affordable.
As I look around, I see opportunities toward the whole company. We haven't established track record on which we can build new and innovative ways to serve our customers at a lower structural cost and on both realistic and enthusiast about what the future holds for CMS.
Now let me turn the call over to Tom."
257682,312963777,967989,"CMS Energy Corp., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2016",2016-04-28,"Earnings Calls","CMS Energy Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Patti, and thank you, everybody, for joining us every day on this very busy day. This is my 54th quarterly CMS earnings call, and as usual, no surprises.Our first quarter earnings are down $0.14 reflecting the cold winter last year and mild weat",943,"Thanks, Patti, and thank you, everybody, for joining us every day on this very busy day. This is my 54th quarterly CMS earnings call, and as usual, no surprises.
Our first quarter earnings are down $0.14 reflecting the cold winter last year and mild weather this year. On a weather normalized basis 2016 earnings are up $0.12 or 20%. Weather normalized all operations, the gas utility, electric utility, enterprises interest and other were -- at or favorable to plan in 2015.
You can see the unfavorable comparison of 2016 to 2015 weather on this waterfall chart. Our operations are performing well better than plan, which offsets the weather in the first quarter of 2016. For the 9 months to go, if we experienced just normal weather will be $0.16 ahead of 2015 and that's the run milder conditions existed. Cost reductions are ready underway keep us right on track for 5% to 7% earnings per share growth.
Here is how the earnings per share forecast curve looked last year. We were able to reinvest $38 million into the business for our customers because cost reductions were better than planned and the 2014, '15 winter was cold. Towards the end of the year, the warm winter of 2015, '16 began, but we fully offset it delivering our 13th year of consistent EPS growth at 7%.
This slide adds our forecast of EPS growth for 2016. As mentioned, adverse weather in 2016 has been offset fully. The winter of 2015, '16 was the second warmest ever not even this, however, than our ability to deliver 5% to 7% growth without any customer compromises.
For example, we were able to enhance cost reductions including normal changes that come with mild weather, like lower uncollectible accounts, because customer base actually lowered. In late December, with 2015 cash flow better-than-expected, we made a pension contribution improving profits 2 pennies for 2016.
While the improvement programs similar to the capitalization of pole top hardening work a $0.03 better than planned. We also adopted a new approach for applying the interest rates to determine the interest cost on pension and healthcare obligations, this was worth a nickel.
This new approach was permitted by a favorable SEC interpretation of a proposal by AT&T just last year. The use of this PBO weighted application of interest rates reduces volatility and it improved earnings in 2016. Each year of pension obligation is actually discounted by its yield curve rate as they would have its own pension plan.
In stead of the conventional approach of rating all years by the same average interest rate as shown in orange on the slide, this new approach shown in green reduces the cost of interest in the near and years partly offset by higher costs in far out years. For a defined benefits program like ours, one that we closed about 10 years ago, the advantageous and our volatility has reduced. We're big fans of lower volatility at CMS.
This new approach produced in earnings improvement of the nickel a share in 2016, which helped to offset the abnormal weather. Here's a look at our EPS curves for the last several years. You can see every year is different, but we have always delivered 7% EPS growth by managing the business on behalf of customers and investors. Over the last 3 years, we have reinvested to $38 million in 2 customer improvements, half from favorable weather and half from higher than planned cost savings. Yes, that's worth repeating. We invested in O&M $238 million for our customers and we delivered 7% earnings growth.
Most of you are aware that recent 1 year MISO capacity of for Zone 7. Capacity cost were $2.19 a kilowatt month, which is about 1/4 of the cost of building new capacity. This, however, had little direct impact on our business at the, I'm sorry, the tesla in the garage that Dearborn Industrial Generation facility.
Most of our 2017 contracts are bilateral and were in place before the auction. New contracts completed by March added $15 million to our profitability for 2017 increasing profits to $35 million, a nice lift towards the 6% to 8% growth guidance for 2017.
We still have upside opportunity including 25% of big energy and 50% to 90% of capacity depending on the year, still available for 2018 and beyond. The MISO capacity auction results were close to being $1 or more higher incentivizing bilateral customers to pay a bit more to reduce their risk. This could add $20 million to $40 million of profit in the future.
As you can see on our sensitivity table that we provide each quarter, risk are not large than mitigation to minimize our exposure continues to be robust. Just last month, relating to notches in a parent rating a notch. Moody's put the utility in apparent on a positive outlook. It's nice to see the agencies recognizing our balance sheet and business model strength.
For the year, we're at or above all of our financial targets. From investments to cash flow to customer prices, the dividend and EPS growth, we expect strong performance again this year.
Our business model continues to work well, self funding most of our capital investments for customers, leading the rate increases at our below the level of inflation. This model is focused on decisions that benefit customers and investors. This permits performance that is sustainable continuing our track record of consistent high end results or nearly 15 years, look forward to continuing this track record together, and John it's a pleasure to have done 6 years of this calls for the best CEO in the business."

In the Senate, energy committee yesterday and they were focused on the things we talked about before. The centered at --- had to do with retail open access. 10% cap stays, but the suppliers need to have firm forward capacity in Michigan. And any further new ROA customer would have to pay a capacity charge. So we think that even though it would be nice to get to a fully regulated entity, that seems to be reasonable.
Part of that was the integrated resource plan, which is good for preapproved generating cost or generation of cost. And regulatory, there are some changes there, which is good for I think, everybody, including us. The chamber needs to decide what they want to do with these. At the end, as I said earlier, it's an unfair system in Michigan that we have today where 300 customers of our 1.8 million customers benefit and are 99.98% of our customers pay 3% to 4% more on their cost to subsidize these other customers.
So I think what in the right thing, let's get the Senate built out, get the Senate and try to get as much a somewhat we possibly can. As for the schools are concerned, the same thing, few schools take choice, most of them don't, at the end of the day the pay more. The chamber, few of their customers take choice, most of them don't, they pay more. So I hope both of those organizations will be on the right side of this."

And if we do that means that new supply along with energy efficiency needs to be combined and move forward. Well -- In the most capital intensive industry in the world with the most part of the product in the world it's hard to make investments unless you have certainty and that's with the law I think it's time to provide. And I think that's what Senator is liable to answer to do going. Can I handicapped with is going to get through I know the Senate to confident about that. My opinion is it gets more of a challenge in the house, and that something that you seen before. So I don't really want to handicap it right now, if figured I think it would be an upside, but I do want to emphasize that we are not counting on any law changes to our 10-year plan, not our 5-year plan, but our 10-year plan. And as Patti has taken over, she is growing the business, to 6% to 8%, her and Tom, I think, that's is great. And none of it is depending on the law changes. So if the law changed its good for our customer and there maybe some upside to us, but that really is the intent that we're focused on is that what's fair for our customers, and I think some of the issues many of you be talking in the next 2 minutes in Ohio is a good indication of what should not happen here in Michigan."

So I'd say the $35 million numbers are pretty good for 2017, you know from the chart we showed you, we still have about 25% of our energy and our capacity available, so there is some more uptake that could come from that.
Now with the future. As you look odd further in time and we have anywhere starting in 2018 out through time and your time, 50% to 90% of capacity and still 25% of energy because we got some nice long-term contracts on energy. I don't want to predict how much of the $20 million to $40 million upside will happen except to say because we layered in -- I don't think you should expect the full $40 million, that would be getting to replacement cost. But on the other hand, I'm not so negative as to say it will only grow by another $20 million. So I think what you try to do is give you the zone somewhere in between there that we honestly believe will be achieved depending on the prices and bilateral demand and what we're able to do as a business."

But what we can look at it just occurred that $2.19 per kilowatt a month, if you laid the bits down right along the demand line and you all densities it's all public record. You can see that it stays pretty close in their. So with a modest change of what was happening in the market on the demand side, that could have easily been $3-plus. So what that does to people that are interested in reducing the volatility they come to businesses like the Tesla, whatever we want to call -- they will come there, looking for ways to take out volatility and pay a little higher price than the auctions, 1-year auctions, at least, to protect themselves from an exposure.
So I do see a little upside from that based on that. The bigger picture is it's telling you a little bit about what John talked to. The capacity situation for Zone 7 is just not all that sold. So as changes occurred in demand on the supply side I think that you see a market that could threaten up quite a bit and it's very hard to predict, but a year from now, I just suspect it will be probably be a tighter market on capacity. Now that's just a personal opinion, so I'll leave it that."

Thanks for joining us on our first quarter earnings call. I'll begin the presentation with a review of our first quarter results and operating performance before turning the call over to Patti to discuss our capital investment plan and cost reduction initiatives. Then Tom will provide the financial results and outlook, and we'll close with Q&A.
First quarter earnings were $0.59 per share, down $0.14 from a year ago, weather was the primary factor. The mild weather that began last October continued through March, resulting in a second warmest winter on record. On a weather normalized basis, first quarter earnings were up $0.12 or 20% compared to last year. And as you would expect, we have already taken steps to mitigate the unfavorable weather impacts. Patti and Tom will talk more about our plans later. But today, we are reaffirming our full year earnings guidance of $1.99 to $2.02 a share. 
Earlier this month, we retired 7 coal plants, totaling 950 megawatts, bringing our capacity mix to less than 25% coal. Our regular and routine rate case strategy remains on track. Last week, the commission approved a gas rate case settlement for $40 million, using the previously approved return on equity when required. We filed an electric rate case the 1st of March for $225 million and plan to self-implement later this year. We continue to operate with the constructive energy law, the framework allows for fair and timely regulatory treatment. If the law is updated, we see this as being incrementally positive to our customers.
With the recent coal plant closures, we are proud of the fact that we have reduced the most coal capacity of any investor-owned utility. The gas-fired Jackson Generating Station and new wind farms have been added to our portfolio, making our capacity mix more sustainable. Additionally, we continue to offer energy efficiency programs, which reduced demand at 1% annually. This strategy puts us in a good position to meet future carbon reduction requirements, and as I always enjoy saying, the air is cleaner today in Michigan than it's ever been in my lifetime.
On a regulatory -- our regulatory track record is among the best in the nation. Over the last 5 years, we have filed gas and electric cases to recover capital investments and pass along O&M savings to our customers. This has been the foundation of our sustainable business model for the past decade. In some years, our O&M reductions fully offset our capital investment needs, and we are able -- and we were able to avoid 3 rate cases. During this time, the ROE has remained unchanged at a competitive 10.3% for gas and electric. The latest gas rate case was the fourth consecutive one that we have settled, dating back to 2011.
The current energy law in Michigan is working well, it allows us to execute our business plan while making needed infrastructure investments and providing energy savings programs to our customers. However, the law still requires that 99.98% of our customers subsidize about 300 large customers. This is simply not fair. We believe that updates to the law would be beneficial to our customers by securing reliable capacity and reducing rates. This is an opportunity for our legislators, and we will work with them on constructive updates.  Whether or not the legislators decide to act, we will continue our plan with the current law in place and move to 6% to 8% earnings growth for 2017 and beyond. 
There are many external factors that can affect our operational and financial results, but we work through everything and work with everyone. We remain focused on delivering the consistent and predictable results that you have come to expect. It has been an honor and a privilege for me to lead the team that has delivered these results over the past 6 years. I believe the company is better today than it has ever been, both financially and operationally, with a very bright future.
Now let me turn the call over to Patti, who will lead the execution of our model."

As we've said, over the next 10 years, we plan to invest $17 billion and that is a 60% increase over what we invested in the prior years. Each project is screened to ensure they will, in fact, add customer value. These customer value takes the -- the customer value takes the form of customer service, improved -- reducing costs, enhancing our productivity, enabling cleaner energy. All of these improvements drive customer value, and in fact, many of the investments provide improvements in several of these categories.
For example, our customers benefit with fewer and shorter outages when we make our investments in our electric infrastructure, that not only improves the customer experience, but reduces costs. Our customers benefit when they can move into their college, apartment, hook up to Consumers Energy service online, on their mobile phone, never speak to a customer service rep, and because of our smart energy and smart meter investments, we can remotely turn on their power. No truck role required. This not only improves the customer experience end to end, but fundamentally reduces the structural cost to do so. Our Smart Energy program is a great example of a major capital investment that has ongoing benefits to customers on both the service and the cost side of the equation.
Other cost savings are driven by proactively investing in replacement of legacy gas service lines, so that we can prevent an unscheduled maintenance expense and customer disruption. Our gas compression upgrades and the use of fuel technology allow for a more productive workforce and less unplanned expense. And with our ongoing transition from coal to gas and our increasing renewable energy investments, we demonstrate to our customers every day that CMS Energy is, in fact, a great steward of our Great Lakes state.
Now you all know, this model has been working for a long time. It's delivered results for more than a decade, and the approach continues now and into years to come with our extensive inventory of our self-funded organic capital investment projects, and really importantly, offset by abundant cost reduction opportunities. In a diverse economy, you can see why it works, especially with the continued focus on our cross reductions, which I'll talk a little bit more about. You know, we've been a leader in this area, and each year we come up with new and innovative ways to deliver both savings to our customers. For investors that means we're able to create CapEx headroom and at the same time, fulfill our internal commitment to keep those base rate increases below inflation.
Cost reductions have been and continued to be an important part of our self-funded model, but we don't cherry-pick this when we put all the numbers together. We take the bad with the good. We don't adjust for inflation or things out of our control. And in the past several years, our focus has delivered an average of 3% savings, and we have a plan -- a well plan -- a well-articulated plan to execute another 6% in savings over the next 2 years. I'll give you a little more detail on that. In fact, I'm often asked if we can continue our performance, and this is how I see it. When we look at our total O&M cost per customer, we look great, in fact, we're among the best of all utilities. But when I dig deep and look into our distribution numbers, we can see that we're still only in the third quartile. So for both electric and gas distribution there's more room, and in fact, when they make up 1/3 of our total O&M expense, we know there is more opportunity there.
For example, we will -- when we go to a job site, only 70% of the time do we built that job per plan. That means that the wrong material was probably ordered, maybe too much, maybe too little. The right equipment may not be available and the right crew makeup may cause a delay. We can eliminate that waste and reduce expense by improving our first-time quality and standardization. More broadly, we're embarking on a company-wide improvement effort and each day real savings are materializing. This approach to our first-time quality is a value creation mechanism that enables for us continued cost reductions and at the same time, deliver our 6% to 8% EPS growth in 2017 and beyond and at the same time, improve our customers' experience and keep it affordable. As I look around, I see opportunities throughout the whole company. We haven't established track record on which we can build new and innovative ways to serve our customers at a lower structural cost. And I'm both realistic and enthusiastic about what the future holds for CMS.
Now let me turn the call over to Tom."

This is my 54th quarterly CMS earnings call, and as usual, no surprises. 
Our first quarter earnings are down $0.14, reflecting the cold winter last year and mild weather this year. On a weather-normalized basis, 2016 earnings are up $0.12 or 20%. Weather-normalized all operations, the gas utility, electric utility, enterprises, interest and other were at or all favorable to plan in 2015. 
You can see the unfavorable comparison of 2016 to 2015 weather on this waterfall chart. Our operations are performing well better than plan, which offsets the weather in the first quarter of 2016. For the 9 months to go, if we experience just normal weather will be $0.16, ahead of 2015, that's when milder conditions existed. Cost reductions already underway keep us right on track for 5% to 7% earnings per share growth.
Here is how the earnings per share forecast curve looked last year. We were able to reinvest $38 million into the business for our customers because cost reductions were better than planned and the 2014-'15 winter was cold. Toward the end of the year the warm winter of 2015-'16 began, but we fully offset it delivering our 13th year of consistent EPS growth at 7%.
This slide adds our forecast of EPS growth for 2016. As mentioned, adverse weather in 2016 has been offset fully. The winter of 2015-'16 was the second warmest ever. Not even this, however, dense our ability to deliver 5% to 7% growth without any customer compromises. For example, we were able to enhance cost reductions including normal changes that come with mild weather, like lower uncollectible accounts, because customer bills are actually lower. In late December, with 2015 cash flow better than expected, we made a pension contribution improving profits $0.02 for 2016.  While the improvement program similar to the capitalization of pole top hardening work are $0.03 better than planned. 
We also adopted a new approach for applying the interest rates to determine the interest cost on pension and healthcare obligations. This was worth $5. This new approach was permitted by a favorable SEC interpretation of a proposal by AT&T just last year. The use of this PBO-weighted application of interest rates reduces volatility and it improved earnings in 2016. Each year of pension obligation is actually discounted by its yield curve rate as though it had its own pension plan. Instead of the conventional approach of weighting all years by the same average interest rate, as shown in orange on the slide, this new approach, shown in green, reduces the cost of interest in the near-end years, partly offset by higher cost in far-out years. For a defined benefits program like ours, one that we closed about 10 years ago, the advantageous height in our volatility has reduced. We're big fans of lower volatility at CMS. And this new approach produced an earnings improvement of $5 a share in 2016, which helped to offset the abnormal weather. 
Here's a look at our EPS curves for the last several years. You can see every year is different, but we have always delivered 7% EPS growth by managing the business on behalf of customers and investors. Over the last 3 years, we reinvested $238 million into customer improvements, half from favorable weather and half from higher than planned cost savings. Yes, that's worth repeating. We reinvested in O&M $238 million for our customers, and we delivered 7% earnings growth.
Most of you are aware the recent 1-year MISO capacity auction for Zone 7. Capacity costs were $2.19 a kilowatt-month, which is about 1/4 of the cost of building new capacity. This, however, had little direct impact on our business at the -- I'm sorry, the Tesla in the garage, the Dearborn Industrial Generation facility. Most of our 2017 contracts are bilateral and were in place before the auction. New contracts completed by March added $15 million to our profitability for 2017 increasing big profits to $35 million, a nice lift towards the 6% to 8% growth guidance for 2017. We still have upside opportunity, including 25% of big energy and 50% to 90% of capacity, depending on the year, still available for 2018 and beyond. The MISO capacity auction results were close to being $1 or more higher, incentivizing bilateral customers to pay a bit more to reduce their risk. This could add $20 million to $40 million of profit in the future.
As you can see on our sensitivity table that we provide each quarter, risks are not large and mitigation to minimize our exposure continues to be robust. Just last month, Fitch upgraded the utility rating 2 notches and the parent rating a notch. Moody's put the utility and the parent on a positive outlook. It's nice to see the agencies recognizing our balance sheet and business model strength.
For the year, we're at or above all of our financial targets. From investment to cash flow to customer prices, the dividend and EPS growth, we expect strong performance again this year. 
Our business model continues to work well, self-funding most of our capital investment for customers, leading rate increases at or below the level of inflation. This model is focused on decisions that benefit customers and investors. This permits performance that is sustainable, continuing our track record of consistent high-end results for nearly 15 years. Patti, I look forward to continuing this track record together. And John, it's a pleasure to have done 6 years of these calls with the best CEO in the business."

I think that there's been discussions going on with the schools and the chamber about supporting this bill or the ones from the house. The bills that came out -- everybody know there are bills introduced. I just set the groundwork. The bills were introduced, two of them substitute bills in the Senate, Energy Committee, yesterday, and they were focused on the things we talked about before. Senator Nesbitt had to do with retail open access. 10% cap stays, but the suppliers need to have firm forward capacity in Michigan. And any further new ROA customer would have to pay a capacity charge. So we think that even though it'd be nice to get to a fully regulated entity, that seems to be reasonable. Part of that was the integrated resource plan, which is good for pre-approved generating cost or generational cost, and regulatory, there are some changes there, which is good for, I think, everybody, including us. The chamber needs to decide what they want to do with these. At the end of the day, as I said earlier, it's an unfair system in Michigan that we have today where 300 customers, over 1.8 million customers benefit, and 99.98% of our customers pay 3% to 4% more on their cost to subsidize these other customers. So I think what's Senator Nesbitt is doing is the right thing. Let's get the Senate bill out, get it through the Senate and try to get as much support as we possibly can. As far as the schools are concerned, the same thing. Few schools take choice, most of them don't, at the end of the day, they pay more. The chamber, few of their customers take choice, most of them don't, they pay more. So I hope both of those organizations would be on the right side of this."

The issue is that it's just not fair to our customers, and as we shut down 7 coal plants and there was another plant closed in Michigan, you see the results of the MISO auction that Tom talked about, it's beginning to show that we have may have capacity tightening up. And if we do that means that new supply along with energy efficiency needs to be combined and move forward. Well, in the most capital-intensive industry in the world with the most volatile product in the world, it's hard to make investments unless you have certainty, and that's what the law, I think, is trying to provide. I think that's what Senator Nesbitt's primary view is reliability and certainty going forward. Can a handicap weather is going to get through it or not, I think it will get through the Senate. I'm pretty confident about that. My opinion is it gets more of a challenge in the house, and that's something that we've seen before. So I don't really want to handicap it right now. If we get it, I think it would be an upside. But I do want to emphasize that we are not counting on any law changes to our 10-year plan, not our 5-year plan, but our 10-year plan. And as Patti is taking over, she is growing the business to 6% to 8%, her and Tom, I think, that's great, and none of it is dependent on the law changes. So if the law does change, it's good for our customers and there may be some upside to us, but that really is the intent that we're focused on is that what's fair for our customers. And I think some of the issues that many of you will be talking about in the next few minutes in Ohio is a good indication of what should not happen here in Michigan."

But what we think we've done is taken volatility out of that particular calculation, but you still could have -- I'm going to go to the big side of $0.01, maybe $0.02 up or down, but less than what we've looked at in the past.

If you look at the weather normalized sales, we actually are showing in our reports, which you can look at attached to the release, that residential and commercial are down about 2%. I'll tell you, I actually don't believe that. I don't think we weather-adjusted year-to-year correctly. Last year, the first quarter was very cold, and we said our residential and commercial sales were like 2% up. Now we're comparing to that what was really mild, and we're saying 2% down. What we saw in the second quarter last year was that sort of reversed. It just said, oops, your weather calculations aren't too good. I think we'll probably see that in this year. So I hate to dismiss data, but I just don't believe that fall off in residential and commercial will continue. But I do believe, if you look forward, think of those as kind of flat. We're not seeing great growth there. If the industrial side -- it's interesting. Our industrial side was actually up 5%. And if you take one customer out, we were actually up 9% in the first quarter. So there's a lot of good news in there. The food business was up about 4%, the plastic sector up about 4%, transportation up about 7%, packaging was up about 10%, and here is something that I really like to see. Several of our companies in the building sector were up a lot. Cement side was about 17%. So there is a lot going on where we can see the uplift through industrial, but keep in mind, we are a conservative beast. We're still telling you that for the years we go out, we're looking for about 1% growth overall, but I'll admit the bulk of that will be on the industrial side."

We'll miss the peak, we'll miss the trough. But the layering in strategy should give us some good news. So I'd say the $35 million number is pretty good for 2017. You know from the chart we showed you, we still have about 25% of our energy and our capacity available, so there is some more uptick that could come from that. Now go to the future. As you look out further in time, we have anywhere starting in 2018 out through time, near time, 50% to 90% of capacity and still 25% of energy because we got some nice long-term contracts in place on energy. I don't want to predict how much of the $20 million to $40 million upside will happen except to say because we layer in -- I don't think you should expect the full $40 million, that would be getting to replacement cost. But on the other hand, I'm not so negative as to say it will only grow by another $20 million. So I think what we've tried to do is give you the zone, somewhere in between there, that we honestly believe will be achieved depending on the prices and a bilateral demand and what we're able to do as a business."

So what we're going to see going forward is MISO is going to be changing the seasonal auctions, they're going to be changed into multi-year auctions. And I wouldn't even fathom the guess about what that will really mean. But what we can look at is the data that just occurred, that $2.19 per kilowatt-month. If you laid the bids down right along the demand line, and you all can see this. It's all public record. You can see that it stays pretty close in there. So with a modest change of what was happening in the market on the demand side, that could have easily been $3-plus. So what that does to people that are interested in reducing their volatility, they come to businesses like the Tesla, the Ferrari or DIG, whatever we want to call it, they will come there looking for ways to take out volatility and pay a little higher price than the auctions, those 1-year auctions, at least, to protect themselves from an exposure. So I do see a little upside from that based on that. The bigger picture is, it's telling you a little bit about what John talked to. The capacity situation for Zone 7 is just not all that solid. So as changes occur in demand or in the supply side, I think that you see a market that could tighten up quite a bit, and it's very hard to predict, but a year from now, I just suspect it will probably be a tighter market on capacity. Now that's just a personal opinion, so I'll leave it that."

I'll begin the presentation with a review of our first quarter results and operating performance before turning the call over to Patti to discuss our capital investment plan and cost reduction initiatives. Then Tom will provide the financial results and outlook, and we'll close with Q&A.
First quarter earnings were $0.59 per share, down $0.14 from a year ago, weather was the primary factor. The mild weather that began last October continued through March, resulting in the second warmest winter on record. On a weather normalized basis, first quarter earnings were up $0.12 or 20% compared to last year. And as you would expect, we have already taken steps to mitigate the unfavorable weather impacts. Patti and Tom will talk more about our plans later. But today, we are reaffirming our full year earnings guidance of $1.99 to $2.02 a share. 
Earlier this month, we retired 7 coal plants, totaling 950 megawatts, bringing our capacity mix to less than 25% coal. Our regular and routine rate case strategy remains on track. Last week, the commission approved a gas rate case settlement for $40 million, using the previously approved return on equity when required. We filed an electric rate case the 1st of March for $225 million and plan to self-implement later this year. We continue to operate with the constructive energy law, the framework allows for fair and timely regulatory treatment. If the law is updated, we see this as being incrementally positive to our customers.
With the recent coal plant closures, we are proud of the fact that we have reduced the most coal capacity of any investor-owned utility. The gas-fired Jackson Generating Station and new wind farms have been added to our portfolio, making our capacity mix more sustainable. Additionally, we continue to offer energy efficiency programs, which reduce demand 1% annually. This strategy puts us in a good position to meet future carbon reduction requirements, and as I always enjoy saying, the air is cleaner today in Michigan than it's ever been in my lifetime.
On a regulatory -- our regulatory track record is among the best in the nation. Over the last 5 years, we have filed gas and electric cases to recover capital investments and pass along O&M savings to our customers. This has been the foundation of our sustainable business model for the past decade. In some years, our O&M reductions fully offset our capital investment needs, and we are able -- and we were able to avoid 3 rate cases. During this time, the ROE has remained unchanged at a competitive 10.3% for gas and electric. The latest gas rate case was the fourth consecutive one that we have settled, dating back to 2011.
The current energy law in Michigan is working well. It allows us to execute our business plan while making needed infrastructure investments and providing energy savings programs to our customers. However, the law still requires that 99.98% of our customers subsidize about 300 large customers. This is simply not fair. We believe that updates to the law would be beneficial to our customers by securing reliable capacity and reducing rates. This is an opportunity for our legislators, and we will work with them on constructive updates.  Whether or not the legislators decide to act, we will continue our plan with the current law in place and move to 6% to 8% earnings growth for 2017 and beyond. 
There are many external factors that can affect our operational and financial results, but we work through everything and work with everyone. We remain focused on delivering the consistent and predictable results that you have come to expect. It has been an honor and a privilege for me to lead the team that has delivered these results over the past 6 years. I believe the company is better today than it has ever been, both financially and operationally, with a very bright future.
Now let me turn the call over to Patti, who will lead the execution of our model."

As we've said, over the next 10 years, we plan to invest $17 billion and that is a 60% increase over what we invested in the prior years. Each project is screened to ensure that it will, in fact, add customer value. These customer value takes the -- the customer value takes the form of customer service, improved -- reducing costs, enhancing our productivity, enabling cleaner energy. All of these improvements drive customer value, and in fact, many of the investments provide improvements in several of these categories.
For example, our customers benefit with fewer and shorter outages when we make our investments in our electric infrastructure. That not only improves the customer experience, but reduces costs. Our customers benefit when they can move into their college apartment, hook up to Consumers Energy service online, on their mobile phone, never speak to a customer service rep, and because of our smart energy and smart meter investments, we can remotely turn on their power. No truck role required. This not only improves the customer experience end to end, but fundamentally reduces the structural cost to do so. Our Smart Energy program is a great example of a major capital investment that has ongoing benefits to customers on both the service and the cost side of the equation.
Other cost savings are driven by proactively investing in replacement of legacy gas service lines, so that we can prevent an unscheduled maintenance expense and customer disruption. Our gas compression upgrades and the use of field technology allow for a more productive workforce and less unplanned expense. And with our ongoing transition from coal to gas and our increasing renewable energy investments, we demonstrate to our customers every day that CMS Energy is, in fact, a great steward of our Great Lakes state.
Now you all know this model has been working for a long time. It's delivered results for more than a decade, and the approach continues now and into years to come with our extensive inventory of our self-funded organic capital investment projects, and really importantly, offset by abundant cost reduction opportunities. In a diverse economy, you can see why it works, especially with the continued focus on our cost reductions, which I'll talk a little bit more about. You know we've been a leader in this area, and each year we come up with new and innovative ways to deliver those savings to our customers. For investors that means we're able to create CapEx headroom, and at the same time, fulfill our internal commitment to keep those base rate increases below inflation.
Cost reductions have been and continue to be an important part of our self-funded model, but we don't cherry-pick this when we put all the numbers together. We take the bad with the good. We don't adjust for inflation or things out of our control. And in the past several years, our focus has delivered an average of 3% savings, and we have a plan -- a well plan -- a well-articulated plan to execute another 6% in savings over the next 2 years. I'll give you a little more detail on that. In fact, I'm often asked if we can continue our performance, and this is how I see it. When we look at our total O&M cost per customer, we look great, in fact, we're among the best of all utilities. But when I dig deep and look into our distribution numbers, we can see that we're still only in the third quartile. So for both electric and gas distribution, there's more room, and in fact, when they make up 1/3 of our total O&M expense, we know there is more opportunity there.
For example, we will -- when we go to a job site, only 70% of the time do we build that job per plan. That means that the wrong material was probably ordered, maybe too much, maybe too little. The right equipment may not be available and the right crew makeup may cause a delay. We can eliminate that waste and reduce expense by improving our first-time quality and standardization. More broadly, we're embarking on a company-wide improvement effort and each day real savings are materializing. This approach to our first-time quality is a value creation mechanism that enables for us continued cost reductions, and at the same time, deliver our 6% to 8% EPS growth in 2017 and beyond, and at the same time, improve our customers' experience and keep it affordable. As I look around, I see opportunities throughout the whole company. We have an established track record upon which we can build new and innovative ways to serve our customers at a lower structural cost. And I'm both realistic and enthusiastic about what the future holds for CMS.
Now let me turn the call over to Tom."

This is my 54th quarterly CMS earnings call, and as usual, no surprises.

This is my 54th quarterly CMS earnings call, and as usual, no surprises. 
Our first quarter earnings are down $0.14, reflecting the cold winter last year and mild weather this year. On a weather-normalized basis, 2016 earnings are up $0.12 or 20%. Weather-normalized all operations, the gas utility, electric utility, enterprises, interest and other were at or all favorable to plan and 2015. 
You can see the unfavorable comparison of 2016 to 2015 weather on this waterfall chart. Our operations are performing well better than plan, which offsets the weather in the first quarter of 2016. For the 9 months to go, if we experience just normal weather, we'll be $0.16 ahead of 2015, and that's when milder conditions existed. Cost reductions already underway keep us right on track for 5% to 7% earnings per share growth.
Here is how the earnings per share forecast curve looked last year. We were able to reinvest $38 million into the business for our customers because cost reductions were better than planned and the 2014-'15 winter was cold. Toward the end of the year the warm winter of 2015-'16 began, but we fully offset it delivering our 13th year of consistent EPS growth at 7%.
This slide adds our forecast of EPS growth for 2016. As mentioned, adverse weather in 2016 has been offset fully. The winter of 2015-'16 was the second warmest ever. Not even this, however, dents our ability to deliver 5% to 7% growth without any customer compromises. For example, we were able to enhance cost reductions including normal changes that come with mild weather, like lower uncollectible accounts, because customer bills are actually lower. In late December, with 2015 cash flow better than expected, we made a pension contribution improving profits $0.02 for 2016. Quality improvement programs similar to the capitalization of pole top hardening work are $0.03 better than planned. 
We also adopted a new approach for applying the interest rates to determine the interest cost on pension and healthcare obligations. This was worth $0.05. This new approach was permitted by a favorable SEC interpretation of a proposal by AT&T just last year. The use of this PBO-weighted application of interest rates reduces volatility and it improved earnings in 2016. Each year of pension obligation is actually discounted by its yield curve rate as though it had its own pension plan. Instead of the conventional approach of weighting all years by the same average interest rate, as shown in orange on the slide, this new approach, shown in green, reduces the cost of interest in the near-in years, partly offset by higher cost in far-out years. For a defined benefits program like ours, one that we closed about 10 years ago, the advantage is heightened and our volatility is reduced. We're big fans of lower volatility at CMS. And this new approach produced an earnings improvement of $0.05 a share in 2016, which helped to offset the abnormal weather. 
Here's a look at our EPS curves for the last several years. You can see every year is different, but we have always delivered 7% EPS growth by managing the business on behalf of customers and investors. Over the last 3 years, we reinvested $238 million into customer improvements, half from favorable weather and half from higher than planned cost savings. Yes, that's worth repeating. We reinvested in O&M $238 million for our customers, and we delivered 7% earnings growth.
Most of you are aware the recent 1-year MISO capacity auction for Zone 7. Capacity costs were $2.19 a kilowatt-month, which is about 1/4 of the cost of building new capacity. This, however, had little direct impact on our business at the -- I'm sorry, I mean the Tesla in the garage, the Dearborn Industrial Generation facility. Most of our 2017 contracts are bilateral and were in place before the auction. New contracts completed by March added $15 million to our profitability for 2017, increasing DIG profits to $35 million, a nice lift towards the 6% to 8% growth guidance for 2017. We still have upside opportunity, including 25% of DIG energy and 50% to 90% of capacity, depending on the year, still available for 2018 and beyond. The MISO capacity auction results were close to being $1 or more higher, incentivizing bilateral customers to pay a bit more to reduce their risk. This could add $20 million to $40 million of profit in the future.
As you can see on our sensitivity table that we provide each quarter, risks are not large and mitigation to minimize our exposure continues to be robust. Just last month, Fitch upgraded the utility rating 2 notches and the parent rating a notch. Moody's put the utility and the parent on a positive outlook. It's nice to see the agencies recognizing our balance sheet and business model strength.
For the year, we're at or above all of our financial targets. From investment to cash flow to customer prices, the dividend and EPS growth, we expect strong performance again this year. 
Our business model continues to work well, self-funding most of our capital investment for customers, leaving rate increases at or below the level of inflation. This model is focused on decisions that benefit customers and investors. This permits performance that is sustainable, continuing our track record of consistent high-end results for nearly 15 years. Patti, I look forward to continuing this track record together. And John, it's a pleasure to have done 6 years of these calls with the best CEO in the business."

I think that there's been discussions going on with the schools and the chamber about supporting this bill or the ones from the house. The bills that came out -- just for everybody to know, there are bills introduced. They just set the groundwork. The bills were introduced, 2 of them substitute bills in the Senate Energy Committee yesterday, and they were focused on the things we talked about before. Senator Nofs' bill had to do with retail open access. 10% cap stays, but the suppliers need to have firm forward capacity in Michigan. And any further new ROA customer would have to pay a capacity charge. So we think that even though it'd be nice to get to a fully regulated entity, that seems to be reasonable. Part of that was the integrated resource plan, which is good for pre-approved generating cost or generational cost, and regulatory, there are some changes there, which is good for, I think, everybody, including us. The chamber needs to decide what they want to do with these. At the end of the day, as I said earlier, it's an unfair system in Michigan that we have today where 300 customers of our 1.8 million customers benefit and our 99.98% of our customers pay 3% to 4% more on their cost to subsidize these other customers. So I think what Senator Nofs is doing is the right thing. Let's get the Senate bill out, get it through the Senate and try to get as much support as we possibly can. As far as the schools are concerned, the same thing. Few schools take choice, most of them don't, at the end of the day, they pay more. The chamber, few of their customers take choice, most of them don't, they pay more. So I hope both of those organizations will be on the right side of this."

You raise a great point about those that have it want to continue it, and again, if I was subsidized, I'd want to continue too. So that has been the battle. The issue is that it's just not fair to our customers, and as we shut down 7 coal plants and there was another plant closed in Michigan, you see the results of the MISO auction that Tom talked about, it's beginning to show that we may have capacity tightening up. And if we do that means that new supply, along with energy efficiency, needs to be combined and moved forward. Well, in the most capital-intensive industry in the world with the most volatile product in the world, it's hard to make investments unless you have certainty, and that's what the law, I think, is trying to provide. I think that's what Senator Nofs' primary view is reliability and certainty going forward. Can I handicap whether it's going to get through it or not, I think it will get through the Senate. I'm pretty confident about that. My opinion is it gets more of a challenge in the House, and that's something that we've seen before. So I don't really want to handicap it right now. If we get it, I think it would be an upside. But I do want to emphasize that we are not counting on any law changes to our 10-year plan, not our 5-year plan, but our 10-year plan. And as Patti is taking over, she is growing the business to 6% to 8%, her and Tom, I think, that's great, and none of it is dependent on the law changes. So if the law does change, it's good for our customers and there may be some upside to us, but that really is the intent that we're focused on is that what's fair for our customers. And I think some of the issues that many of you will be talking about in the next few minutes in Ohio is a good indication of what should not happen here in Michigan."

If you look at the weather normalized sales, we actually are showing in our reports, which you can look at attached to the release, that residential and commercial are down about 2%.

Last year, the first quarter was very cold, and we said our residential and commercial sales were like 2% up. Now we're comparing to that where it was really mild, and we're saying 2% down. What we saw in the second quarter last year was that sort of reversed. It just said, oops, your weather calculations aren't too good. I think we'll probably see that in this year. So I hate to dismiss data, but I just don't believe that fall off in residential and commercial will continue. But I do believe, if you look forward, think of those as kind of flat. We're not seeing great growth there. It's the industrial side that's interesting. Our industrial side was actually up 5%. And if you take one customer out, we were actually up 9% in the first quarter. So there's a lot of good news in there. The food business was up about 4%, the plastic sector up about 4%, transportation up about 7%, packaging was up about 10%, and here is something that I really like to see. Several of our companies in the building sector were up a lot. Cement side was about 17%. So there is a lot going on where we can see the uplift through industrial, but keep in mind, we are a conservative beast. We're still telling you that for the years we go out, we're looking for about 1% growth overall, but I will admit the bulk of that will be on the industrial side."

A little bit more good news layered in, a little bit more good news layered in with contracts. We are not trying to grab what we think is a peak or rush to anything. We'll miss the peak, we'll miss the trough. But the layering in strategy should give us some good news. So I'd say the $35 million number is pretty good for 2017. You know from the chart we showed you, we still have about 25% of our energy and our capacity available, so there is some more upticks that could come from that. Now go to the future. As you look out further in time, we have anywhere starting in 2018 out through time, near time, 50% to 90% of capacity and still 25% of energy because we got some nice long-term contracts in place on energy. I don't want to predict how much of the $20 million to $40 million upside will happen except to say because we layer in, I don't think you should expect the full $40 million, that would be getting to replacement cost. But on the other hand, I'm not so negative as to say it will only grow by another $20 million. So I think what we've tried to do is give you the zone, somewhere in between there, that we honestly believe will be achieved depending on the prices and a bilateral demand and what we're able to do as a business."

So what we're going to see going forward is MISO is going to be changing the seasonal auctions, they're going to be changing to multi-year auctions. And I wouldn't even fathom a guess about what that will really mean. But what we can look at is the data that just occurred, that $2.19 per kilowatt-month. If you laid the bids down right along the demand line, and you all can see this. It's all public record. You can see that it stays pretty close in there. So with a modest change of what was happening in the market on the demand side, that could have easily been $3-plus. So what that does to people that are interested in reducing their volatility, they come to businesses like the Tesla, the Ferrari or DIG, whatever we want to call it, they will come there looking for ways to take out volatility and pay a little higher price than the auctions, those 1-year auctions, at least, to protect themselves from an exposure. So I do see a little upside from that based on that. The bigger picture is, it's telling you a little bit about what John talked to. The capacity situation for Zone 7 is just not all that solid. So as changes occur in demand or in the supply side, I think that you see a market that could tighten up quite a bit, and it's very hard to predict, but a year from now, I just suspect it will probably be a tighter market on capacity. Now that's just a personal opinion, so I'll leave it that."

Thanks you for joining us on our second quarter earnings call. I'll begin the presentation with a review of our second quarter results, the progress made on our first half checklists, and I'll share little bit more with you about our Consumers Energy Tom will then provide the financial results and outlook, and will wrap up with Q&A.
Second quarter earnings were $0.45 per share, up $0.20 from a year ago. On a weather normalized basis, earnings were up $0.14 or 52%. We're proud of our results and they were driven primarily by our outstanding operational performance. The cost controls and other good business decisions we put in place earlier in the year had a positive impact for this quarter.
Today, we are reaffirming our full year adjusted earnings guidance range of $1.99 to $2.02 per share. For 2017 and beyond, as we previously announced, we plan to grow adjusted earnings per share at 6% to 8% annually.
Let's go through our first-half check list. We've make good progress achieving our financial and operational objectives. The last 6 months were no different from the last 13 years. Focus on delivering results for our customers and our investors.
Michigan's track record of constructive regulation continues with the appointment of a new Commissioner, and our rate case strategy is on track, and focused on recovering capital investments to routine on regular rate cases. We've been a leader in the transition to be a cleaner environment. In April, we retired 7 baseload coal plants that have been generating power dependably and affordably for over 6 years.
A change like that is not easy, but the way we cared for people and our communities during the transition makes it a very positive step towards a sustainable energy future.
Recently, we launched a new initiative of continuous improvement that we call the Consumers Energy. I'm excited about the customer focus benefits and waste elimination this program will delivered over the next several years.
And then finally, the Michigan legislature broke for summer resets without taking action on the energy bills, although the reforms will be positive for our customers, as we've consistently reiterated, we are not counting on any changes in our long-term financial plan as a result of a new law.
We are pleased with the appointment of Commissioner. Her education and financial experience will be a nice addition to an already strong commission, and we look forward to working with her.
Electric and gas infrastructure investment is needed throughout the state. And by working with Michigan's agency for energy and our  commission to prioritize those investments together, we can assure that the benefits for customers in the states will be realized in a well-planned fashion.
We plan to self implement our electric rate increase of $170 million on September 1, at the current authorized 10.3% return on equity. The staff has required a $92 million revenue increase based on a 10% ROE. Half of the difference between our self implementation amount in the staff position is the ROE in cost of capital adjustment.
On August 1, we plan to file a $90 million gas case. 93% of this case is made of new investments, to strengthen infrastructure and improve system capacity and deliverability. 
As the fourth largest combination utility, the strength of our gas and electric businesses together is a balanced mix that serve the people of Michigan and our investors well. We are very fortunate to be in the desirable position.
Reducing coal dependency as a strategy on which we've been focused for several years. A recent example of this was the shutdown of the Classic 7 coal plants that I mentioned earlier. With the planning years in advance, we were able to keep our promises to employees, local communities and Michigan's beautiful natural resources. Having reduced our coal generation more than any other investor on the utility, we are leaving it better than we found it. As we continue to plan, we'll look for additional ways to reduce our coal dependency and become an even more sustainable energy company.
Another critical step we are taking to assure sustainable performance is the rollout of our Consumers Energy way. For the past couple of months, our executives, directors and managers have all attended intensive training that will help them to identify the most efficient operational standards and ways to eliminate waste. After talking with each and every one of them, I am further convinced that we can continue improving our customer experience and reducing cost for years to come.
The next decade of extraordinary outcomes will be achieved by a strategy of working safely, complete work right the first, at the lowest cost and on schedule. We will continue to improve and deliver results for our customers and our investors.
One area where I see more opportunity to improve specifically, is distribution cost performance, and we have plan to do that. By reducing our total electrical distribution cost, by $30 million, we would be in first cortile, and $70 million we can make it all the way to the top of the list. The Consumers Energy way is the strategy that will help us realize that goal while improving our customers' experience and satisfaction.
The future performance of CMS Energy is bright and sustainable. The Consumers Energy way will allow us to drive continuous improvement to achieve and maintain a high level of operational performance. My coworkers and I will eliminate non value-added activities and replace them with higher-value offerings to our customers and more certain financial results for our investors.
By creating a culture of continuous improvement, every person, every job, everyday and every customer test point can improve. With the track record like ours is to expect more, but we have a plan and strategy to do just that.
Our commitment to extraordinary outcome in all areas of our business, enables our previously announced move to 6% to 8% adjusted earnings growth beginning next year, and that continues year after year after year.
Now let me turn the call over to Tom."
257682,312963799,1015334,"CMS Energy Corp., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2016",2016-07-28,"Earnings Calls","CMS Energy Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Patti.

This is substantially better than our original plan more than offsetting the adverse weather in the first quarter.For the f",1313,"Thanks, Patti. Second quarter results at $0.45 were up $0.20 compared with year ago. And on a weather normalized basis, up $0.14. This is substantially better than our original plan more than offsetting the adverse weather in the first quarter.
For the first half overall, our earnings were $1.04 a share, up $0.10 or 11% from plan. Now as you can see here, while first quarter results were down $0.14 from the same period in 2015, we more than offset that with our performance in the second quarter, which is up $0.20. The weather helped a bit as did the expected impact of approved rates. In addition, we reached a settlement with Michigan Treasury on used taxes a nice $0.03 uplift. As you would expect, we also improved our O&M cost compared with the year ago by $0.09 in the second quarter. This reflects benefit gains, better uncollectible account performance, old plant closures and a variety of other solid operating improvements.
Looking ahead into the second half, if weather is just normal, we'll accomplish a nice uptick of $0.13 compared with 2015. As you may know, we already have a hit start on the third quarter with hot and muggy weather in July. Even with that -- even without that, we would have plenty of room for growing infrastructure investments and we continue to project 5% to 7% earnings per share growth with a solid confidence.
I know most of you are well with the concept of this slide, where we show our projected earnings per share growth for the full year as the year progresses. During the first quarter, mild winter weather and abnormal storms reduced our earnings per share outlook by $0.13, but in the short period of time, we were right back on track with earnings growth in the 5% to 7% range. You can see the improvements that offset abnormal weather in the lower box on this slide. We're ahead of our guidance and as always, we'll put that upside to work for our customers and will deliver consistent, pure-leading EPS growth.
We delivered 7% adjusted EPS growth for almost 15 years. Here is the picture of our track record for just the last 5 of those years. It shows how we consistently offset bad news and put good news to use for our customers, without compromising our predictable earnings growth of 7% each and every year. Over the last 3 years, favorable weather and cost reductions in excess of our plan generated room to invest a quarter of a billion dollars for our customers, half from weather and half from cost productivity, better than planned. That's a big number. We put these savings to work in many, many beneficial ways.
Turning to 2017 and the future, here is our business model, which is pretty simple and maybe just a little unique. We're fortunate to have a lot of capital investment opportunities over the next 10 years, as we catch up on projects we didn't do over the prior 10 years. This investment in reliability, cost improvements, environmental mandates and other areas, grows by about 6% to 8% a year. Perhaps what's unique about our more model is that we self the bulk of the investment increase keeping our customer base rate growth at or below the level of inflation. That discipline provides a real rate reduction for our customers as we make substantial improvements on their behalf.
Over the next 10 years, we'll invest over $17 billion in both our electric and gas businesses, as shown in the circle on the left. 37% of this investment is in our growing gas business, which already is the fourth largest in the nation. What's important is that all of these investments add tremendous value for our customers. Whether it's exceeding compliance requirements for clean energy, enhancing productivity, reducing costs or improving our service. And we have opportunities to increase spending further on infrastructure as well as replacing large PPAs. We can build new capacity cheaper than existing PPA contracts. Opportunities around these items could be in the  $3 billion to $4 billion range.
Part of the secrets as Patti mentioned is being able to reduce our O&M cost to help fund the investment. We prefer annual rate cases because they are simply and manageable. And they provide us with the opportunity to share our cost productions with our customers as we gain recovery for capital investment programs, You can see our plants on the right. We're constantly refining, including sizing ourselves to demand. For example, we're in the middle of voluntary separation program to enhance the pace of savings in a manner that treats our colleagues in a fair and respectful way.
Net of cost increases, our cost productions will be $60 million or about 3% a year over 2016 and 2017. That consistent with our prior performance as shown on the left, where we reduced our O&M cost by almost 3% on average each year since 2016. It's a program we're proud of, and one that we can continue for many years as we take advantage of solid business decisions, and better processes that we describe as the Consumers Energy way.
In addition to our cost performance, our conservative sales growth and our ability to avoid new diluted equity, we still have attractive upsides outside of the futility. As you can see in this slide, continued laying in of the energy and capacity sales could enable us to increase our profitability by $20 million to $40 million. And our durable earned industrial generation operations, we call that DIG.
This is a nice insurance policy for our utility and a catalyst for new growth. And by the way, today we're celebrating 10 years without a safety incident at DIG. Days in excellent operations are the foundation of our success.
Now, hear is our standard profit and cash flow sensitivity slide to help you with your assessment of our future performance. I known there is a lot of concerns around the sector about the impact of low interest rates on pension and benefit obligations. A 50 basis point drop could be worth about $12 million hit to earnings for us. Lower debt costs, however, would offset much of that and should we make a pension contribution of say a $100 million, that would offset the rest and then We do not see a major interest rate concerned for us.
The world changes everyday and our model is built on being prepared to mitigate or take advantages of changes as they occur. The Brexit from the European Union, which I think surprised a lot of us last month, is suer surprised me, is a good example. It created opportunities to issue more debt at even lower interest rates. It also added to uncertainty. One of the reasons that we keep a little thicker liquidity levels than most of our peers. For example, in May, before Brexit, we extended our 5-year revolvers another year. Our liquidity including these revolvers is over 15% of our  market cap, and that's a big thicker than the average of our peers.
And here's our report card. We are right on course to achieve our plans for capital investment, high quality balance sheet, competitive customer prices and robust dividend payout, strong operating cash flow and adjusted earnings per share growth in the 5% to 7% range. We're pleased to have been able to deliver consistent strong earnings growth for 14 years, and we intend to continue this for a long time. Our earnings and dividend growth continue at a consistent typeface every year, no matter what's happening in the economy, the weather, politics, or succession planning.
So thank you for your interest and your support. We're deeply grateful for it, and we're delighted to take your questions. So -- would you be kind enough to open the lines."

I would also say on the VSP, the VSP is a combination of many years of working on productivity improvements. And I would say that our recent launch of the Consumers Energy way is probably too early, and it's likes to attribute to the VSP, but it's always important to right size and match our workload with our work force. And through a voluntary program like this, we've enabled employees to optionally decide to retire early, which then set us up for a great performance next year where we have our workforce and woke load lined up."

A lot of that's ongoing stuff. And Some of that is one-time things, like the used tax. And then you'll see that we show ourselves running up, because we are doing better on our cost productions than we anticipated. So we are on the upside sort of with opportunities to reinvest more. The weather side that you're asking about, which is in addition to that. If you adjust of July for what we know for the months so for, there is $0.03, $0.04 of earnings upset associated with that. But I'm always cautious with those kind of numbers because what's obvious kind of be like $0.03, $0.04 up again or down, we don't know. We just plan on normal weather in our projections. So where can we put that money to work. so many opportunities. We can pull some outage work ahead from next year into this year. That helps next year's results and helps our reliability. So we're looking at that. We can do more on the tree trimming side. That's probably the single biggest thing we can do to improve our  reliability. And so there's a place that we can do more work on and above and beyond what we've been authorized to do by the commission.
There's also more esoteric things, like low-cost financing. If these rates continue to stay low, we can take a hard look and we can make these decisions sooner or later, we can go pretty far back into the year and decide that lets just take on some on low interest debt and pre-fund some of our future debt. And all that does is -- it must cost us a little bit for settling this year, there is the investment part, but it will save more money, create more profits, '17 and sometimes forward years. So I could go on, because there is an awful long list. But those are some of the areas that are very practical and they're on our latest screen, and we're looking at them and we're timing them in a way that we think allows us to do the max performance for our customers, and then not miss the earnings growth."

This is that new process that we put in place toward the beginning of this year. Where it is looking at how you do your expenses when you're discounting the pension costs, and what we're now doing is actually discounting, if you will, at the point of each year as opposed to an average of all the years. And by doing that, that actually gives us a better look at how to reflect on our programs. So like our defined benefit pension program, which closed. New employees are coming into that. So the bulk of our liability is more upfront than it is in the back. So by taking low interest rates in the curve early on, it's cheaper for us. And of course, as you go out in time and the curve rises above the average, it's a little more expensive. But that's a big savings to us. And it should as well as we go into the future years, minimize the amount the volatility we have, when we're looking at discount rates and the pension curve interest rates. And that maybe why when I said earlier, the impact of 50 basis points on our pension plan and -- is only about $12 million. I know, I've heard that's a bigger number for some companies. But it could be because of program is closed. New employees come into a D.C. program. And then on the enhanced capitalization, all that is, that is just where we really should be capitalizing work we're doing instead of putting in an O&M. That allows our customers to get a better deal, they pay for it later. But that's also benefit for us as we do that. Because that's less and expense, and so that our profits are higher, if you will. So we're doing a little more than that. One of the example that you may recall, we've used a few times in our slides is called top maintenance. And that's just where we do a little more complete work, complete where there is -- replacing a whole -- instead of just doing bits and pieces. By doing the whole work, we get to capital is it instead of counting this O&M. Are t those a couple of good examples for you?"

And what we saw there was still good strength on food, manufacturing, automotive, chemicals, a whole -- construction. A whole variety of areas, we're ticking up nicely as we expecting. But metals did not do well. I think that has to do with the competitive pressure coming out of China. And in addition, we have a couple of our bigger businesses -- one on the construction side with insulation impact that the did in acquisition, and their actually relaying out a lot of their production facilities.

Thank you for joining us on our second quarter earnings call. I'll begin the presentation with a review of our second quarter results, the progress made on our first half checklists, and I'll share little bit more with you about our Consumers Energy way. Tom will then provide the financial results and outlook, and will wrap up with Q&A.
Second quarter earnings were $0.45 per share, up $0.20 from a year ago. On a weather normalized basis, earnings were up $0.14 or 52%. We're proud of our results and they were driven primarily by our outstanding operational performance. The cost controls and other good business decisions we put in place earlier in the year had a positive impact for this quarter.
Today, we are reaffirming our full year adjusted earnings guidance range of $1.99 to $2.02 per share. For 2017 and beyond, as we previously announced, we plan to grow adjusted earnings per share at 6% to 8% annually.
Let's go through our first half checklist. We make good progress achieving our financial and operational objectives. The last 6 months were no different than the last 13 years. Focused on delivering results for our customers and our investors.
Michigan's track record of constructive regulation continues with the appointment of a new commissioner, and our rate case strategy is on track, and focused on recovering capital investments to routine on regular rate cases. We've been a leader in the transition to a cleaner environment. In April, we retired 7 baseload coal plants that have been generating power dependably and affordably for over 60 years.
A change like that is not easy, but the way we cared for our people and our communities during the transition makes it a very positive step towards a sustainable energy future.
Recently, we launched a new initiative of continuous improvement that we call the Consumers Energy way. I'm excited about the customer focus benefits and waste elimination this program will deliver over the next several years.
And then finally, the Michigan legislature broke for summer recess without taking action on the energy bills, although the reforms would be positive for our customers, as we have consistently reiterated, we are not counting on any changes in our long-term financial plan as a result of a new law.
We are pleased with the appointment of Commissioner of Rachael Eubanks. Her education and financial experience will be a nice addition to an already strong commission, and we look forward to working with her.
Electric and gas infrastructure investment is needed throughout the state. And by working with Michigan's agency for energy and our commission to prioritize those investments together, we can assure that the benefits for customers and the state will be realized in a well-planned fashion.
We plan to self implement our electric rate increase of $170 million on September 1, at the current authorized 10.3% return on equity. The staff has recommended a $92 million revenue increase based on a 10% ROE. Half of the difference between our self implementation amount in the staff position is the ROE and cost of capital adjustments.
On August 1, we plan to file a $90 million gas case. 93% of this case is made up of new investments, to strengthen infrastructure and improve system capacity and deliverability. 
As the fourth largest combination utility, the strength of our gas and electric businesses together is a balanced mix that serves the people of Michigan and our investors well. We are very fortunate to be in the desirable position.
Reducing coal dependency is a strategy on which we've been focused for several years. A recent example of this was the shutdown of the Classic 7 coal plants that I mentioned earlier. With thoughtful planning years in advance, we were able to keep our promises to employees, local communities and Michigan's beautiful natural resources. Having reduced our coal generation more than any other investor on the utility, we are leaving it better than we found it. As we continue to plan, we'll look for additional ways to reduce our coal dependency and become an even more sustainable energy company.
Another critical step we're taking to assure sustainable performance is the rollout of our Consumers Energy way. For the past couple of months, our executives, directors and managers have all attended intensive training that will help them to identify the most efficient operational standards and ways to eliminate waste. After talking with each and every one of them, I am further convinced that we can continue improving our customer experience and reducing cost for years to come.
The next decade of extraordinary outcomes will be achieved by a strategy of working safely, completing work right the first time, at the lowest cost and on schedule. We will continue to improve and deliver results for our customers and our investors.
One area where I see more opportunity to improve specifically, is distribution cost performance, and we have a plan to do that. By reducing our total electric distribution cost by $30 million, we would be in first quartile, and for $70 million we can make it all the way to the top of the list. The Consumers Energy way is the strategy that will help us realize that goal all the while improving our customers' experience and satisfaction.
The future performance of CMS Energy is bright and sustainable. The Consumers Energy way will allow us to drive continuous improvement to achieve and maintain a high level of operational performance. My coworkers and I will eliminate non value-added activities and replace them with higher-value offerings for customers and more certain financial results for our investors.
By creating a culture of continuous improvement, every person, every job, every day and every customer touch point can improve. With the track record like ours it's hard to expect more, but we have a plan and strategy to do just that.
Our commitment to extraordinary outcomes in all areas of our business enables our previously announced move to 6% to 8% adjusted earnings growth beginning next year, and that continues year after year after year.
Now let me turn the call over to Tom."

The weather helped a bit as did the expected impact of approved rates. In addition, we reached a settlement with the Michigan Treasury on used taxes, a nice $0.03 uplift. As you would expect, we also improved our O&M cost compared with the year ago by $0.09 in the second quarter. This reflects benefit gains, better uncollectible account performance, old plant closures and a variety of other solid operating improvements.
Looking ahead into the second half, if weather is just normal, we'll accomplish a nice uptick of $0.13 compared with 2015. As you may know, we already have a head start on the third quarter with hot and muggy weather in July. Even with that -- even without that, we would have plenty of room for growing infrastructure investments and we continue to project 5% to 7% earnings per share growth with a solid confidence.
I know most of you are well acquainted with the concept of this slide, where we show our projected earnings per share growth for the full year as the year progresses. During the first quarter, mild winter weather and abnormal storms reduced our earnings per share outlook by $0.13, but in the short period of time, we were right back on track with earnings growth in the 5% to 7% range. You can see the improvements that offset abnormal weather in the lower box on this slide. We're ahead of our guidance and as always, we'll put that upside to work for our customers and will deliver consistent, peer-leading EPS growth.
We delivered 7% adjusted EPS growth for almost 15 years. Here is the picture of our track record for just the last 5 of those years. It shows how we consistently offset bad news and put good news to use for our customers, without compromising our predictable earnings growth of 7% each and every year. Over the last 3 years, favorable weather and cost reductions in excess of our plan generated room to invest a $0.25 billion for our customers, half from weather and half from cost productivity, better than planned. That's a big number. We put these savings to work in many, many beneficial ways.
Turning to 2017 and the future, here is our business model, which is pretty simple and maybe just a little unique. We're fortunate to have a lot of capital investment opportunities over the next 10 years, as we catch up on projects we didn't do over the prior 10 years. This investment in reliability, cost improvements, environmental mandates and other areas, grows by about 6% to 8% a year. Perhaps what's unique about our more model is that we sold the bulk of the investment increase keeping our customer base rate growth at or below the level of inflation. That discipline provides a real rate reduction for our customers as we make substantial improvements on their behalf.
Over the next 10 years, we'll invest over $17 billion in both our electric and gas businesses, as shown in the circle on the left. 37% of this investment is in our growing gas business, which already is the fourth largest in the nation. What's important is that all of these investments add tremendous value for our customers. Whether it's exceeding compliance requirements for clean energy, enhancing productivity, reducing costs or improving our service. And we have opportunities to increase spending further on infrastructure as well as replacing large PPAs. We can build new capacity cheaper than existing PPA contracts. Opportunities around these items could be in the $3 billion to $4 billion range.
Part of the secret sauce, as Patti mentioned, is being able to reduce our O&M cost to help fund the investment. We prefer annual rate cases because they are simple and manageable. And they provide us with the opportunity to share our cost reductions with our customers as we gain recovery for capital investment programs. You can see our plants on the right. We're constantly refining, including sizing ourselves to demand. For example, we're in the middle of a voluntary separation program to enhance the pace of savings in a manner that treats our colleagues in a fair and respectful way.
Net of cost increases, our cost reductions will be $60 million or about 3% a year over 2016 and 2017. That's consistent with our prior performance as shown on the left, where we reduced our O&M cost by almost 3% on average each year since 2016. It's a program we're proud of, and one that we can continue for many years as we take advantage of solid business decisions, and better processes that we describe as the Consumers Energy way.
In addition to our cost performance, our conservative sales growth and our ability to avoid new diluted equity, we still have attractive upsides outside of the futility. As you can see in this slide, continued layering in of energy and capacity sales could enable us to increase our profitability by $20 million to $40 million at our Dearborn Industrial Generation operations, we call that DIG.
This is a nice insurance policy for our utility and a catalyst for new growth. And by the way, today we're celebrating 10 years without a safety incident at DIG. Days in excellent operations are the foundation of our success.
Now, here's our standard profit and cash flow sensitivity slide to help you with your assessment of our future performance. I know there is a lot of concerns around the sector about the impact of low interest rates on pension and benefit obligations. A 50 basis-point drop could be worth about $12 million hit to earnings for us. Lower debt costs, however, would offset much of that and should we make a pension contribution of say a $100 million, that would offset the rest and the some. We do not see a major interest rate concern for us.
The world changes everyday and our model is built on being prepared to mitigate or take advantages of changes as they occur. The Brexit from the European Union, which I think surprised a lot of us last month, it sure surprised me, is a good example. It created opportunities to issue more debt at even lower interest rates. It also added to uncertainty. One of the reasons that we keep a little thicker liquidity levels than most of our peers. For example, in May, before Brexit, we extended our 5-year revolvers another year. Our liquidity including these revolvers is over 15% of our  market cap, and that's a bit thicker than the average of our peers.
And here's our report card. We are right on course to achieve our plans for capital investment, high quality balance sheet, competitive customer prices, a robust dividend payout, strong operating cash flow and adjusted earnings per share growth in the 5% to 7% range. We're pleased to have been able to deliver consistent strong earnings growth for 14 years, and we intend to continue this for a long time. Our earnings and dividend growth continue at a consistent high pace every year, no matter what's happening in the economy, the weather, politics, or succession planning.
So thank you for your interest and your support. We're deeply grateful for it, and we'd be delighted to take your questions. So, Tiffany, would you be kind enough to open the lines?"

And every time we do that, it's a cost saving. So we have those cost savings built into this year's plan. And we continue to execute on that plan. I would also say on the VSP, the VSP is a culmination of many years of working on productivity improvements. And I would say that our recent launch of the Consumers Energy way is probably too early in its life to attribute to the VSP, but it's always important to right size and match our workload with our work force. And through a voluntary program like this, we've enabled employees to optionally decide to retire early, which then set us up for a great performance next year where we have our workforce and our workload lined up."

To your point, Jonathan, there's a little box there that shows how we did the recovery. A lot of that's ongoing stuff. And some of that's onetime things, like the used tax. And then you'll see that we show ourselves running up, because we are doing better on our cost reductions than we anticipated. So we are on the upside sort of with opportunities to reinvest more. The weather side that you're asking about, which is in addition to that. If you just took July for what we know for the months so far, there is $0.03, $0.04 of earnings upside associated with that. But I'm always cautious with those kind of numbers because what's August going be like, $0.03, $0.04 up again or down, we don't know. We just plan on normal weather in our projections. So where can we put that money to work. Oh, there's so many opportunities. We can pull some outage work ahead from next year into this year. That helps next year's results and helps our reliability. So we're looking at that. We can do more on the tree trimming side. That's probably the single biggest thing we can do to improve our  reliability. And so there's a place that we can do more work on and above and beyond what we've been authorized to do by the commission.
There's also more esoteric things, like low-cost financing. If these rates continue to stay low, we can take a hard look and we can make these decisions sooner or later, we can go pretty far back into the year and decide that let's just take on some more low interest debt and pre-fund some of our future debt. And all that does is it might cost us a little bit for settling this year, there is the investment part, but it will save more money, create more profits, '17 and sometimes forward years. So I could go on, because there's an awful long list. But those are some of the areas that are very practical and they're on our radar screen, and we're looking at them and we're timing them in a way that we think allows us to do the max performance for our customers, and then not miss the earnings growth."

This is that new process that we put in place toward the beginning of this year. Where it is looking at how you do your expenses when you're discounting the pension costs, and what we're now doing is actually discounting, if you will, at the point of each year as opposed to an average of all the years. And by doing that, that actually gives us a better look at how to reflect on our programs. So like our defined benefit pension program, where it's closed. New employees aren't coming into that. So the bulk of our liability is more upfront than it is in the back. So by taking low interest rates in the curve early on, it's cheaper for us. And of course, as you go out in time and the curve rises above the average, it's a little more expensive. But that's a big savings to us. And it should as well as we go into the future years, minimize the amount of volatility we have, when we're looking at discount rates and the pension curve interest rates. And that maybe why when I said earlier, the impact of 50 basis points on our pension plan and OPEB is only about $12 million. I know, I've heard that's a bigger number for some companies. But it could be because our program is closed. New employees come into a D.C. program. And then on the enhanced capitalization, all that is, that is just where we really should be capitalizing work we're doing instead of putting in an O&M. That allows our customers to get a better deal, they pay for it later. But that's also a benefit for us as we do that. Because that's less O&M expense, and so that our profits are higher, if you will. So we're just doing a little more of that. One of the examples that you may recall, we've used a few times in our slides is called pole top maintenance. And that's just where we do a little more complete work, complete when there is a storm, replacing a whole pole top, cross arms and the like instead of just doing bits and pieces. By doing the whole work, we get to capitalize it instead of counting this O&M. Are those a couple of good examples for you?"

Because we did see -- didn't asked about it, but it tick down on the industrial side. And what we saw there was still good strength on food, manufacturing, automotive, chemicals, a whole -- construction, a whole variety of areas, we're ticking up nicely as we expecting. But metals did not do well. I think that has to do with the competitive pressure coming out of China. And in addition, we had a couple of our bigger businesses, one on the construction side with insulation, in fact, that just did an acquisition and they're actually relaying out a lot of their production facilities. And I wouldn't even mention it except that it was a 1% decline all by itself. So we may have some oddities on the industrial side in our report for this quarter. We'll see how that plays out.

Thank you for joining us on our second quarter earnings call. I'll begin the presentation with a review of our second quarter results, the progress made on our first half checklists, and I'll share a little bit more wit",1026,"Thanks, DV. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on our second quarter earnings call. I'll begin the presentation with a review of our second quarter results, the progress made on our first half checklists, and I'll share a little bit more with you about our Consumers Energy way. Tom will then provide the financial results and outlook, and we'll wrap up with Q&A.
Second quarter earnings were $0.45 per share, up $0.20 from a year ago. On a weather normalized basis, earnings were up $0.14 or 52%. We're proud of our results and they were driven primarily by our outstanding operational performance. The cost controls and other good business decisions we put in place earlier in the year had a positive impact for this quarter.
Today, we are reaffirming our full year adjusted earnings guidance range of $1.99 to $2.02 per share. For 2017 and beyond, as we previously announced, we plan to grow adjusted earnings per share at 6% to 8% annually.
Let's go through our first half checklist. We made good progress achieving our financial and operational objectives. The last 6 months were no different than the last 13 years. Focused on delivering results for our customers and our investors.
Michigan's track record of constructive regulation continues with the appointment of a new commissioner, and our rate case strategy is on track, and focused on recovering capital investments through routine and regular rate cases. We've been a leader in the transition to a cleaner environment. In April, we retired 7 baseload coal plants that have been generating power dependably and affordably for over 60 years.
A change like that is not easy, but the way we cared for our people and our communities during the transition makes it a very positive step towards a sustainable energy future.
Recently, we launched a new initiative of continuous improvement that we call the Consumers Energy way. I'm excited about the customer focused benefits and waste elimination this program will deliver over the next several years.
And then finally, the Michigan legislature broke for the summer recess without taking action on the energy bills, although the reforms would be positive for our customers, as we have consistently reiterated, we are not counting on any changes in our long-term financial plan as a result of a new law.
We are pleased with the appointment of Commissioner Rachael Eubanks. Her education and financial experience will be a nice addition to an already strong commission, and we look forward to working with her.
Electric and gas infrastructure investment is needed throughout the state. And by working with Michigan's agency for energy and our commission to prioritize those investments together, we can assure that the benefits for customers and the state will be realized in a well-planned fashion.
We plan to self-implement our electric rate increase of $170 million on September 1, at the current authorized 10.3% return on equity. The staff has recommended a $92 million revenue increase based on a 10% ROE. Half of the difference between our self implementation amount and the staff position is the ROE and cost of capital adjustments.
On August 1, we plan to file a $90 million gas case. 93% of this case is made up of new investments, to strengthen infrastructure and improve system capacity and deliverability. 
As the fourth largest combination utility, the strength of our gas and electric businesses together is a balanced mix that serves the people of Michigan and our investors well. We are very fortunate to be in the desirable position.
Reducing coal dependency is a strategy on which we've been focused for several years. A recent example of this was the shutdown of the Classic 7 coal plants that I mentioned earlier. With thoughtful planning years in advance, we were able to keep our promises to employees, local communities and Michigan's beautiful natural resources. Having reduced our coal generation more than any other investor-owned utility, we are leaving it better than we found it. As we continue to plan, we'll look for additional ways to reduce our coal dependency and become an even more sustainable energy company.
Another critical step we're taking to assure sustainable performance is the rollout of our Consumers Energy way. For the past couple of months, our executives, directors and managers have all attended intensive training that will help them to identify the most efficient operational standards and ways to eliminate waste. After talking with each and every one of them, I am further convinced that we can continue improving our customer experience and reducing cost for years to come.
The next decade of extraordinary outcomes will be achieved by a strategy of working safely, completing work right the first time, at the lowest cost and on schedule. We will continue to improve and deliver results for our customers and our investors.
One area where I see more opportunity to improve specifically, is distribution cost performance, and we have a plan to do that. By reducing our total electric distribution cost by $30 million, we would be in first quartile, and for $70 million we can make it all the way to the top of the list. The Consumers Energy way is the strategy that will help us realize that goal all the while improving our customers' experience and satisfaction.
The future performance of CMS Energy is bright and sustainable. The Consumers Energy way will allow us to drive continuous improvement to achieve and maintain a high level of operational performance. My coworkers and I will eliminate non value-added activities and replace them with higher-value offerings for customers and more certain financial results for our investors.
By creating a culture of continuous improvement, every person, every job, every day and every customer touch point can improve. With the track record like ours it's hard to expect more, but we have a plan and strategy to do just that.
Our commitment to extraordinary outcomes in all areas of our business enables our previously announced move to 6% to 8% adjusted earnings growth beginning next year, and that continues year after year after year.
Now let me turn the call over to Tom."

Second quarter results at $0.45 were up $0.20 compared with the year ago. And on a weather normalized basis, up $0.14. This is substantially better than our original plan more than offsetting the adverse weather in the first quarter.
For the first half overall, our earnings were $1.04 a share, up $0.10 or 11% from plan. Now as you can see here, while first quarter results were down $0.14 from the same period in 2015, we more than offset that with our performance in the second quarter, which is up $0.20. The weather helped a bit as did the expected impact of approved rates. In addition, we reached a settlement with the Michigan Treasury on use taxes, a nice $0.03 uplift. As you would expect, we also improved our O&M cost compared with the year ago by $0.09 in the second quarter. This reflects benefit gains, better uncollectible account performance, coal plant closures and a variety of other solid operating improvements.
Looking ahead into the second half, if weather is just normal, we'll accomplish a nice uptick of $0.13 compared with 2015. As you may know, we already have a head start on the third quarter with hot and muggy weather in July. Even with that -- even without that, we would have plenty of room for growing infrastructure investments and we continue to project 5% to 7% earnings per share growth with solid confidence.
I know most of you are well acquainted with the concept of this slide, where we show our projected earnings per share growth for the full year as the year progresses. During the first quarter, mild winter weather and abnormal storms reduced our earnings per share outlook by $0.13, but in the short period of time, we were right back on track with earnings growth in the 5% to 7% range. You can see the improvements that offset abnormal weather in the lower box on this slide. We're ahead of our guidance and as always, we'll put that upside to work for our customers and we'll deliver consistent, peer-leading EPS growth.
We delivered 7% adjusted EPS growth for almost 15 years. Here is the picture of our track record for just the last 5 of those years. It shows how we consistently offset bad news and put good news to use for our customers, without compromising our predictable earnings growth of 7% each and every year. Over the last 3 years, favorable weather and cost reductions in excess of our plan generated room to invest a $0.25 billion for our customers, half from weather and half from cost productivity, better than planned. That's a big number. We put these savings to work in many, many beneficial ways.
Turning to 2017 and the future, here is our business model, which is pretty simple and maybe just a little unique. We're fortunate to have a lot of capital investment opportunities over the next 10 years, as we catch up on projects we didn't do over the prior 10 years. This investment in reliability, cost improvements, environmental mandates and other areas, grows by about 6% to 8% a year. Perhaps what's unique about our more model is that we self-fund the bulk of the investment increase keeping our customer base rate growth at or below the level of inflation. That discipline provides a real rate reduction for our customers as we make substantial improvements on their behalf.
Over the next 10 years, we'll invest over $17 billion in both our electric and gas businesses, as shown in the circle on the left. 37% of this investment is in our growing gas business, which already is the fourth largest in the nation. What's important is that all of these investments add tremendous value for our customers. Whether it's exceeding compliance requirements for clean energy, enhancing productivity, reducing costs or improving our service. And we have opportunities to increase spending further on infrastructure as well as replacing large PPAs. We can build new capacity cheaper than existing PPA contracts. Opportunities around these items could be in the $3 billion to $4 billion range.
Part of the secret sauce, as Patti mentioned, is being able to reduce our O&M cost to help fund the investment. We prefer annual rate cases because they are simple and manageable. And they provide us with the opportunity to share our cost reductions with our customers as we gain recovery for capital investment programs. You can see our plans on the right. We're constantly refining, including sizing ourselves to demand. For example, we're in the middle of a voluntary separation program to enhance the pace of savings in a manner that treats our colleagues in a fair and respectful way.
Net of cost increases, our cost reductions will be $60 million or about 3% a year over 2016 and 2017. That's consistent with our prior performance as shown on the left, where we reduced our O&M costs by almost 3% on average each year since 2016. It's a program we're proud of, and one that we can continue for many years as we take advantage of solid business decisions, and better processes that we describe as the Consumers Energy way.
In addition to our cost performance, our conservative view of sales growth and our ability to avoid new diluted equity, we still have attractive upsides outside of the utility. As you can see in this slide, continued layering in of energy and capacity sales could enable us to increase our profitability by $20 million to $40 million at our Dearborn Industrial Generation operations, we call that DIG.
This is a nice insurance policy for our utility and a catalyst for new growth. And by the way, today we're celebrating 10 years without a safety incident at DIG. Days in excellent operations are the foundation of our success.
Now, here's our standard profit and cash flow sensitivity slide to help you with your assessment of our future performance. I know there is a lot of concerns around the sector about the impact of low interest rates on pension and benefit obligations. A 50 basis-point drop could be worth about a $12 million hit to earnings for us. Lower debt costs, however, would offset much of that and should we make a pension contribution of say a $100 million, that would offset the rest and then some. We do not see a major interest rate concern for us.
The world changes every day and our model is built on being prepared to mitigate or take advantages of changes as they occur. The Brexit from the European Union, which I think surprised a lot of us last month, it sure surprised me, is a good example. It created opportunities to issue more debt at even lower interest rates. It also added to uncertainty. One of the reasons that we keep a little thicker liquidity levels than most of our peers. For example, in May, before Brexit, we extended our 5-year revolvers another year. Our liquidity including these revolvers is over 15% of our  market cap, and that's a bit thicker than the average of our peers.
And here's our report card. We are right on course to achieve our plans for capital investment, high-quality balance sheet, competitive customer prices, a robust dividend payout, strong operating cash flow and adjusted earnings per share growth in the 5% to 7% range. We're pleased to have been able to deliver consistent strong earnings growth for 14 years, and we intend to continue this for a long time. Our earnings and dividend growth continue at a consistent high pace every year, no matter what's happening in the economy, the weather, politics, or succession planning.
So thank you for your interest and your support. We're deeply grateful for it, and we'd be delighted to take your questions. So, Tiffany, would you be kind enough to open the lines?"

We feel great about the relative performance to plan, obviously, and that's reflected in our results. But as we look forward to the year -- for the balance of this year, we really are continuing to every day improve our processes and our operations, so that we eliminate the waste of rework, the waste of return visits, et cetera. And every time we do that, it's a cost saving. So we have those cost savings built into this year's plan. And we continue to execute on that plan. I would also say on the VSP, the VSP is a culmination of many years of working on productivity improvements. And I would say that our recent launch of the Consumers Energy way is probably too early in its life to attribute to the VSP, but it's always important to right size and match our workload with our work force. And through a voluntary program like this, we've enabled employees to optionally decide to retire early, which then set us up for a great performance next year where we have our workforce and our workload lined up."

So if you look at that slide that talks about the O&M cost performance, you'll see a line in there called attrition, for an example.

We save a good chunk of money, about $40,000 with each turnover. So that times the 400 gets into $16 million a year, and that's 1.6% of our O&M right there all by itself. That sustains for a good many years, because we still have a large population of older guys like me. So there'll be more people that take advantage of that over time.

To your point, Jonathan, there's a little box there that shows how we did the recovery. A lot of that's ongoing stuff. And some of that's onetime things, like the use tax. And then you'll see that we show ourselves running up, because we are doing better on our cost reductions than we anticipated. So we are on the upside sort of with opportunities to reinvest more. The weather side that you're asking about, which is in addition to that. If you just took July for what we know for the month so far, there is $0.03, $0.04 of earnings upside associated with that. But I'm always cautious with those kind of numbers because what's August going be like, $0.03, $0.04 up again or down, we don't know. We just plan on normal weather in our projections. So where can we put that money to work. Oh, there's so many opportunities. We can pull some outage work ahead from next year into this year. That helps next year's results and helps our reliability. So we're looking at that. We can do more on the tree trimming side. That's probably the single biggest thing we can do to improve our  reliability. And so there's a place that we can do more work on and above and beyond what we've been authorized to do by the commission.
There's also more esoteric things, like low-cost financing. If these rates continue to stay low, we can take a hard look and we can make these decisions sooner or later, we can go pretty far back into the year and decide let's just take on some more low interest debt and pre-fund some of our future debt. And all that does is it might cost us a little bit for settling this year, there is the investment part, but it will save more money, create more profits, '17 and sometimes forward years. So I could go on, because there's an awful long list. But those are some of the areas that are very practical and they're on our radar screen, and we're looking at them and we're timing them in a way that we think allows us to do the max performance for our customers, and then not miss the earnings growth."

This is that new process that we put in place toward the beginning of this year. Where it is looking at how you do your expenses when you're discounting the pension costs, and what we're now doing is actually discounting, if you will, at the point of each year as opposed to an average of all the years. And by doing that, that actually gives us a better look at how to reflect on our programs. So like our defined benefit pension program, where it's closed. New employees aren't coming into that. So the bulk of our liability is more upfront than it is in the back. So by taking low interest rates in the curve early on, it's cheaper for us. And of course, as you go out in time and the curve rises above the average, it's a little more expensive. But that's a big savings to us. And it should as well as we go into the future years, minimize the amount of volatility we have, when we're looking at discount rates and the pension curve interest rates. And that may be why when I said earlier, the impact of 50 basis points on our pension plan and OPEB is only about $12 million. I know, I've heard that's a bigger number for some companies. But it could be because our program is closed. New employees come into a D.C. program. And then on the enhanced capitalization, all that is, that is just where we really should be capitalizing work we're doing instead of putting it in O&M. That allows our customers to get a better deal, they pay for it later. But that's also a benefit for us as we do that. Because that's less O&M expense, and so that our profits are higher, if you will. So we're just doing a little more of that. One of the examples that you may recall, we've used a few times in our slides is called pole top maintenance. And that's just where we do a little more complete work, complete when there is a storm, replacing a whole pole top, cross arms and the like instead of just doing bits and pieces. By doing the whole work, we get to capitalize it instead of count it as O&M. Are those a couple of good examples for you?"

Because we did see -- didn't ask about it, but it tick down on the industrial side. And what we saw there was still good strength on food, manufacturing, automotive, chemicals, a whole -- construction, a whole variety of areas, were ticking up nicely as we expecting. But metals did not do well. I think that has to do with the competitive pressure coming out of China. And in addition, we had a couple of our bigger businesses, one on the construction side with insulation, in fact, that just did an acquisition and they're actually relaying out a lot of their production facilities. And I wouldn't even mention it except that it was a 1% decline all by itself. So we may have some oddities on the industrial side in our report for this quarter. We'll see how that plays out.

Thank you for joining us on our second quarter earnings call. I'll begin the presentation with a review of our second quarter results, the progress made on our first half checklists, and I'll share a little bit more wit",1025,"Thanks, DV. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on our second quarter earnings call. I'll begin the presentation with a review of our second quarter results, the progress made on our first half checklists, and I'll share a little bit more with you about our Consumers Energy way. Tom will then provide the financial results and outlook, and we'll wrap up with Q&A.
Second quarter earnings were $0.45 per share, up $0.20 from a year ago. On a weather normalized basis, earnings were up $0.14 or 52%. We're proud of our results and they were driven primarily by our outstanding operational performance. The cost controls and other good business decisions we put in place earlier in the year had a positive impact for this quarter.
Today, we are reaffirming our full year adjusted earnings guidance range of $1.99 to $2.02 per share. For 2017 and beyond, as we previously announced, we plan to grow adjusted earnings per share at 6% to 8% annually.
Let's go through our first half checklist. We made good progress achieving our financial and operational objectives. The last 6 months were no different than the last 13 years. Focused on delivering results for our customers and our investors.
Michigan's track record of constructive regulation continues with the appointment of a new commissioner, and our rate case strategy is on track, and focused on recovering capital investments through routine and regular rate cases. We've been a leader in the transition to a cleaner environment. In April, we retired 7 baseload coal plants that have been generating power dependably and affordably for over 60 years.
A change like that is not easy, but the way we cared for our people and our communities during the transition makes it a very positive step towards a sustainable energy future.
Recently, we launched a new initiative of continuous improvement that we call the Consumers Energy way. I'm excited about the customer focused benefits and waste elimination this program will deliver over the next several years.
And then finally, the Michigan legislature broke for the summer recess without taking action on the energy bills, although the reforms would be positive for our customers, as we have consistently reiterated, we are not counting on any changes in our long-term financial plan as a result of a new law.
We are pleased with the appointment of Commissioner Rachael Eubanks. Her education and financial experience will be a nice addition to an already strong commission, and we look forward to working with her.
Electric and gas infrastructure investment is needed throughout the state. And by working with Michigan's agency for energy and our commission to prioritize those investments together, we can assure that the benefits for customers and the state will be realized in a well-planned fashion.
We plan to self-implement our electric rate increase of $170 million on September 1, at the current authorized 10.3% return on equity. The staff has recommended a $92 million revenue increase based on a 10% ROE. Half of the difference between our self-implementation amount and the staff position is the ROE and cost of capital adjustments.
On August 1, we plan to file a $90 million gas case. 93% of this case is made up of new investments, to strengthen infrastructure and improve system capacity and deliverability. 
As the fourth largest combination utility, the strength of our gas and electric businesses together is a balanced mix that serves the people of Michigan and our investors well. We are very fortunate to be in the desirable position.
Reducing coal dependency is a strategy on which we've been focused for several years. A recent example of this was the shutdown of the Classic 7 coal plants that I mentioned earlier. With thoughtful planning years in advance, we were able to keep our promises to employees, local communities and Michigan's beautiful natural resources. Having reduced our coal generation more than any other investor-owned utility, we are leaving it better than we found it. As we continue to plan, we'll look for additional ways to reduce our coal dependency and become an even more sustainable energy company.
Another critical step we're taking to assure sustainable performance is the rollout of our Consumers Energy way. For the past couple of months, our executives, directors and managers have all attended intensive training that will help them to identify the most efficient operational standards and ways to eliminate waste. After talking with each and every one of them, I am further convinced that we can continue improving our customer experience and reducing cost for years to come.
The next decade of extraordinary outcomes will be achieved by a strategy of working safely, completing work right the first time, at the lowest cost and on schedule. We will continue to improve and deliver results for our customers and our investors.
One area where I see more opportunity to improve specifically, is distribution cost performance, and we have a plan to do that. By reducing our total electric distribution cost by $30 million, we would be in first quartile, and for $70 million we can make it all the way to the top of the list. The Consumers Energy way is the strategy that will help us realize that goal all the while improving our customers' experience and satisfaction.
The future performance of CMS Energy is bright and sustainable. The Consumers Energy way will allow us to drive continuous improvement to achieve and maintain a high level of operational performance. My coworkers and I will eliminate non value-added activities and replace them with higher-value offerings for customers and more certain financial results for our investors.
By creating a culture of continuous improvement, every person, every job, every day and every customer touch point can improve. With the track record like ours it's hard to expect more, but we have a plan and strategy to do just that.
Our commitment to extraordinary outcomes in all areas of our business enables our previously announced move to 6% to 8% adjusted earnings growth beginning next year, and that continues year after year after year.
Now let me turn the call over to Tom."

Second quarter results at $0.45 were up $0.20 compared with the year ago. And on a weather normalized basis, up $0.14. This is substantially better than our original plan more than offsetting the adverse weather in the first quarter.
For the first half overall, our earnings were $1.04 a share, up $0.10 or 11% from plan. Now as you can see here, while first quarter results were down $0.14 from the same period in 2015, we more than offset that with our performance in the second quarter, which is up $0.20. The weather helped a bit as did the expected impact of approved rates. In addition, we reached a settlement with the Michigan Treasury on use taxes, a nice $0.03 uplift. As you would expect, we also improved our O&M cost compared with the year ago by $0.09 in the second quarter. This reflects benefit gains, better uncollectible account performance, coal plant closures and a variety of other solid operating improvements.
Looking ahead into the second half, if weather is just normal, we'll accomplish a nice uptick of $0.13 compared with 2015. As you may know, we already have a head start on the third quarter with hot and muggy weather in July. Even with that -- even without that, we would have plenty of room for growing infrastructure investments and we continue to project 5% to 7% earnings per share growth with solid confidence.
I know most of you are well acquainted with the concept of this slide, where we show our projected earnings per share growth for the full year as the year progresses. During the first quarter, mild winter weather and abnormal storms reduced our earnings per share outlook by $0.13, but in the short period of time, we were right back on track with earnings growth in the 5% to 7% range. You can see the improvements that offset abnormal weather in the lower box on this slide. We're ahead of our guidance and as always, we'll put that upside to work for our customers and we'll deliver consistent, peer-leading EPS growth.
We delivered 7% adjusted EPS growth for almost 15 years. Here is the picture of our track record for just the last 5 of those years. It shows how we consistently offset bad news and put good news to use for our customers, without compromising our predictable earnings growth of 7% each and every year. Over the last 3 years, favorable weather and cost reductions in excess of our plan generated room to invest a $0.25 billion for our customers, half from weather and half from cost productivity, better than planned. That's a big number. We put these savings to work in many, many beneficial ways.
Turning to 2017 and the future, here is our business model, which is pretty simple and maybe just a little unique. We're fortunate to have a lot of capital investment opportunities over the next 10 years, as we catch up on projects we didn't do over the prior 10 years. This investment in reliability, cost improvements, environmental mandates and other areas, grows by about 6% to 8% a year. Perhaps what's unique about our more model is that we self-fund the bulk of the investment increase keeping our customer base rate growth at or below the level of inflation. That discipline provides a real rate reduction for our customers as we make substantial improvements on their behalf.
Over the next 10 years, we'll invest over $17 billion in both our electric and gas businesses, as shown in the circle on the left. 37% of this investment is in our growing gas business, which already is the fourth largest in the nation. What's important is that all of these investments add tremendous value for our customers. Whether it's exceeding compliance requirements for clean energy, enhancing productivity, reducing costs or improving our service. And we have opportunities to increase spending further on infrastructure as well as replacing large PPAs. We can build new capacity cheaper than existing PPA contracts. Opportunities around these items could be in the $3 billion to $4 billion range.
Part of the secret sauce, as Patti mentioned, is being able to reduce our O&M cost to help fund the investment. We prefer annual rate cases because they are simple and manageable. And they provide us with the opportunity to share our cost reductions with our customers as we gain recovery for capital investment programs. You can see our plans on the right. We're constantly refining, including sizing ourselves to demand. For example, we're in the middle of a voluntary separation program to enhance the pace of savings in a manner that treats our colleagues in a fair and respectful way.
Net of cost increases, our cost reductions will be $60 million or about 3% a year over 2016 and 2017. That's consistent with our prior performance as shown on the left, where we reduced our O&M costs by almost 3% on average each year since 2016. It's a program we're proud of, and one that we can continue for many years as we take advantage of solid business decisions, and better processes that we describe as the Consumers Energy way.
In addition to our cost performance, our conservative view of sales growth and our ability to avoid new diluted equity, we still have attractive upsides outside of the utility. As you can see in this slide, continued layering in of energy and capacity sales could enable us to increase our profitability by $20 million to $40 million at our Dearborn Industrial Generation operations, we call that DIG.
This is a nice insurance policy for our utility and a catalyst for new growth. And by the way, today we're celebrating 10 years without a safety incident at DIG. Days in excellent operations are the foundation of our success.
Now, here's our standard profit and cash flow sensitivity slide to help you with your assessment of our future performance. I know there is a lot of concerns around the sector about the impact of low interest rates on pension and benefit obligations. A 50 basis-point drop could be worth about a $12 million hit to earnings for us. Lower debt costs, however, would offset much of that and should we make a pension contribution of say a $100 million, that would offset the rest and then some. We do not see a major interest rate concern for us.
The world changes every day and our model is built on being prepared to mitigate or take advantages of changes as they occur. The Brexit from the European Union, which I think surprised a lot of us last month, it sure surprised me, is a good example. It created opportunities to issue more debt at even lower interest rates. It also added to uncertainty. One of the reasons that we keep a little thicker liquidity levels than most of our peers. For example, in May, before Brexit, we extended our 5-year revolvers another year. Our liquidity including these revolvers is over 15% of our  market cap, and that's a bit thicker than the average of our peers.
And here's our report card. We are right on course to achieve our plans for capital investment, high-quality balance sheet, competitive customer prices, a robust dividend payout, strong operating cash flow and adjusted earnings per share growth in the 5% to 7% range. We're pleased to have been able to deliver consistent strong earnings growth for 14 years, and we intend to continue this for a long time. Our earnings and dividend growth continue at a consistent high pace every year, no matter what's happening in the economy, the weather, politics, or succession planning.
So thank you for your interest and your support. We're deeply grateful for it, and we'd be delighted to take your questions. So, Tiffany, would you be kind enough to open the lines?"

We feel great about the relative performance to plan, obviously, and that's reflected in our results. But as we look forward to the year -- for the balance of this year, we really are continuing to every day improve our processes and our operations, so that we eliminate the waste of rework, the waste of return visits, et cetera. And every time we do that, it's a cost saving. So we have those cost savings built into this year's plan. And we continue to execute on that plan. I would also say on the VSP, the VSP is a culmination of many years of working on productivity improvements. And I would say that our recent launch of the Consumers Energy way is probably too early in its life to attribute to the VSP, but it's always important to right size and match our workload with our work force. And through a voluntary program like this, we've enabled employees to optionally decide to retire early, which then set us up for a great performance next year where we have our workforce and our workload lined up."

So if you look at that slide that talks about the O&M cost performance, you'll see a line in there called attrition, for an example.

To your point, Jonathan, there's a little box there that shows how we did the recovery. A lot of that's ongoing stuff. And some of that's onetime things, like the use tax. And then you'll see that we show ourselves running up, because we are doing better on our cost reductions than we anticipated. So we are on the upside sort of with opportunities to reinvest more. The weather side that you're asking about, which is in addition to that. If you just took July for what we know for the month so far, there is $0.03, $0.04 of earnings upside associated with that. But I'm always cautious with those kind of numbers because what's August going be like, $0.03, $0.04 up again or down, we don't know. We just plan on normal weather in our projections. So where can we put that money to work. Oh, there's so many opportunities. We can pull some outage work ahead from next year into this year. That helps next year's results and helps our reliability. So we're looking at that. We can do more on the tree trimming side. That's probably the single biggest thing we can do to improve our  reliability. And so there's a place that we can do more work on and above and beyond what we've been authorized to do by the commission.
There's also more esoteric things, like low-cost financing. If these rates continue to stay low, we can take a hard look and we can make these decisions sooner or later, we can go pretty far back into the year and decide let's just take on some more low interest debt and pre-fund some of our future debt. And all that does is it might cost us a little bit for settling this year, there is the investment part, but it will save more money, create more profits, '17 and sometimes forward years. So I could go on, because there's an awful long list. But those are some of the areas that are very practical and they're on our radar screen, and we're looking at them and we're timing them in a way that we think allows us to do the max performance for our customers, and then not miss the earnings growth."

This is that new process that we put in place toward the beginning of this year. Where it is looking at how you do your expenses when you're discounting the pension costs, and what we're now doing is actually discounting, if you will, at the point of each year as opposed to an average of all the years. And by doing that, that actually gives us a better look at how to reflect on our programs. So like our defined benefit pension program, where it's closed. New employees aren't coming into that. So the bulk of our liability is more upfront than it is in the back. So by taking low interest rates in the curve early on, it's cheaper for us. And of course, as you go out in time and the curve rises above the average, it's a little more expensive. But that's a big savings to us. And it should as well as we go into the future years, minimize the amount of volatility we have, when we're looking at discount rates and the pension curve interest rates. And that may be why when I said earlier, the impact of 50 basis points on our pension plan and OPEB is only about $12 million. I know, I've heard that's a bigger number for some companies. But it could be because our program is closed. New employees come into a D.C. program. And then on the enhanced capitalization, all that is, that is just where we really should be capitalizing work we're doing instead of putting it in O&M. That allows our customers to get a better deal, they pay for it later. But that's also a benefit for us as we do that. Because that's less O&M expense, and so that our profits are higher, if you will. So we're just doing a little more of that. One of the examples that you may recall, we've used a few times in our slides is called pole top maintenance. And that's just where we do a little more complete work, complete when there is a storm, replacing a whole pole top, cross arms and the like instead of just doing bits and pieces. By doing the whole work, we get to capitalize it instead of count it as O&M. Are those a couple of good examples for you?"

And I think, we're realistic on that. And then on industrial, we'll tell you we'll be up 2.5-plus-percent. And I think that's pretty realistic too. Because we did see -- didn't ask about it, but it tick down on the industrial side. And what we saw there was still good strength on food, manufacturing, automotive, chemicals, a whole -- construction, a whole variety of areas, were ticking up nicely as we expecting. But metals did not do well. I think that has to do with the competitive pressure coming out of China. And in addition, we had a couple of our bigger businesses, one on the construction side with insulation, in fact, that just did an acquisition and they're actually relaying out a lot of their production facilities. And I wouldn't even mention it except that it was a 1% decline all by itself. So we may have some oddities on the industrial side in our report for this quarter. We'll see how that plays out.

For those of you who have not yet met Sri, he is our new Treasurer and Vice President of IR. Sri has been with CMS for a couple of years, and we are excited to have him in his new role. I will begin the presentation with an update to earnings and describe our simple, but powerful model. Tom will then provide the detailed financial results and outlook, and we will finish with some Q&A. We're happy to report adjusted earnings [ph] for the first 3 quarters are up $0.22, and we've narrowed our guidance to the high end of our forecasted range of $2 to $2.02 for 6% to 7% over last year's performance. As a reminder, we previously announced our long-term adjusted EPS guidance of 6% to 8%, and we're introducing today specific 2017 earnings guidance of $2.13 to $2.17 a share. It was a strong quarter and that sets us up for a strong finish to 2016. The strong finish will be led by our continued implementation of the Consumers Energy way. We're proud of our consistent financial performance. My coworkers are motivated to serve our families, friends and neighbors. There are many times, however, when those same coworkers, in spite of their best efforts, are unable to serve our customers to our desired standards. Many of our processes are [ph] burdened with waste that goes unchecked and the CE way is simply a lean operations model focused squarely on business results, [indiscernible] customer focus standards, implemented by enabled employees, working within well designed and standard processes and a mindset that every day there is an opportunity for continuous improvement.  Completing our work safely with [ph] high quality, low cost and on time will deliver the same consistent results for customers and investors that we've had for over a decade.
As a result of our efforts, I'm more confident than ever in our ability to deliver our simple, but powerful model. We have debts in our organic capital plan. I've yet to attend a meeting where we have trouble identifying opportunities to invest. We have a long shopping list with lots of investments that improve safety, reliability, affordability and our customers' experience. Nothing new here. We will tackle the structural cost with the [ph] smart investment, good business decision-making and continuous process improvement. We plan conservatively for sales growth, and we don't dilute our earnings with black equity. All of this adds up to sustainable model that enables investment, while keeping our rates affordable. Like I said, our shopping list is long, and we're not making any big bets to fill out the plan. We have a large electric distribution system. It's made up of over 70,000 [ph] miles of conductor, 1,200 substations that all need to be upgraded and maintained, and we have a lot of work to do just to modernize our  grid starting with completing our electric smart meter installations in 2017. We continue to increase our gas investments. I like to remind people that we have a great gas business where smart investments have real return for our customers. We still have to say no to projects because we can't spend more than our customers can afford. Our [ph] generation fleet continues to evolve in small bites. Incremental renewables, capacity upgrades, coal to gas conversions, these are all small bets that add real value and cost savings, cleaner energy and reliability for our customers. And future PPA replacements could even potentially allow for additional investment without affecting customers' bills. The ability to pay is always our limiting factor, which is why we're so focused on sustainable and structural cost reduction. It's not easy to be the leader [indiscernible] on cost reductions year over year over year. However, that is our ambition. 
Let me remind you that many of our previous decisions were structural, permanent and have many years of favorable impact. For example, our conversion to define contribution plans have significantly reduced our long-term liabilities. Each year, as my coworkers retire and replaced by a new workforce, we save about 1.6% of the previous year's O&M before we tackle a single work process improvement with the CE way.  We have a lot more gas pedal and waste elimination that results in real cost savings. Those cost savings then allow us to be focused on making our prices competitive, so that we can continue to be part of the Michigan growth story. We are seeing positive momentum, cooperation and success stories related to our customers' growth and economic development in our service territory. We're bullish on Michigan. The more we improve our business model, the more companies and their employees will choose Michigan as a place to locate or grow their businesses. And the stats don't lie. Michigan is growing faster than the U.S. average, and Grand Rapids, the heart of our electric territory, is growing faster than the Michigan average. We feel great about being part of that success today and into the future. And still we plan conservatively for low growth.
As we continue to maximize customer value with a strong investment portfolio to drive waste out of our operations and [ph] let customer affordability be our throttle, we'll continue to deliver high end and quality earnings growth. Our constructive relationships with our state policymakers, legislators and regulators is based on keeping our promise to perform and to care for our customers and communities. And performance is power. When we perform at best-in-class levels, we can earn the trust and admiration and deliver hometown service for our customers. Day in and day out, you and our customers can count on us. Now I'll turn the call over to Tom."

Adjusted to exclude the cost of our voluntary separation program, results were $0.70 or up [ph] $0.17. In either case, this is substantially better than our original plan, even as it reflects meaningful O&M reinvestment, permitted by cost reductions ahead of plan and the warm, muggy summer. And for the first 9 months, overall, our GAAP earnings were $1.70 a share, up $0.19 from last year. Adjusted for the [ph] VSP cost, results were $1.73, up $0.22 or 23% on a weather-normalized basis. As you can see here again, our performance in the first 9 months is $0.22 better than last year. Adverse weather hurt $0.10. We blew away our 5% to 7% [ph] EPA growth target, growing more than 10%, including the mild winter weather. Improvements included benefit savings, lower uncollectible accounts, coal plant closures, [ph] pole top hardening, higher demand, and productivity at DIG, to name just a few of the areas. Looking ahead into the fourth quarter, if weather is just normal, we'll accomplish a nice uptick of $0.13 compared with 2015. And as you know, we already have a head start on the fourth quarter with cost reductions well ahead of plan. We also have an electric rate case underway and [ph] still implemented at $170 million on September 1. We filed a gas rate case last August, which  will support 2017. We've plenty of room for reinvesting O&M for our customers this year, and we raised our 2016 guidance to the high end of our 5% to 7% range. This has become an investor favorite slide, where we share our projected earnings per share growth for the full year. And this is as the year progresses.
During the first quarter, mild winter weather and abnormal storms reduced earnings per share by $0.13, but in a very short period of time, we were right back on track [ph] for our adjusted earnings growth at 5% to 7%. You can see the improvements that offset the abnormal weather with no impact on customers. We're well ahead of our guidance and as always, are putting the upside to work for customers, improving reliability, [ph] moving ahead work from next year as well as prefunding debt maturities, and we will deliver consistent peer-leading earnings per share growth. We beat guidance and delivered 7% adjusted earnings growth for almost 15 years. Here is a picture of that track record. It shows how we consistently offset bad news and put good news to use for our customers without compromising predictable earnings growth of 7% each and every year. Over the last 3 years, favorable weather and cost reductions in excess of our plan generated room to reinvest $0.25 billion for our customers, $0.25 billion. Half of that came from favorable weather and half from cost productivity better than planned. That's a big number. We put these savings to work in many beneficial ways. So far this year, we're 20% ahead of our plan. Our customers and investors really will benefit.
In addition to our cost performance, our conservative view of sales growth and our ability to avoid diluted equity, we still have other attractive upsides. As you can see in this slide, continued layering [ph] in of energy and capacity sales could enable us to increase our profitability by $20 million to $40 million at our Dearborn Industrial Generation operations. Recent capacity sales have exceeded $4 a kilowatt month. This is a nice insurance policy for our utility, if it needs more capacity and a catalyst for new growth. And to help you with your own assessment of our future performance, here is our standard profit and cash flow sensitivity slide. Recall that impacts from many legislative changes are not in our plan. Interest rate shifts, up or down, largely offset [ph] at our company as changes in debt cost offset changes in discount rates on our pension plans. We believe in no big bets and strong risk mitigation. And here is our report card. For 2016, we're right on course to achieve our plans for capital investment, a high-quality balance sheet, competitive customers prices, a robust dividend payout and strong operating cash flow. We're well ahead of our adjusted earnings per share growth in the 5% to 7% range. Therefore, we raised guidance to the high end. We've introduced specific guidance for 2017 at $2.13 to $2.17, up 6% to 8% from this year. Count on another strong year, our 15th in a row, with high-end predictable earnings, cash flow and dividend growth. This is my [ph] 57th CMS quarterly call in a row. Maybe my voice is wearing out and [indiscernible] has been sharing with you the results of a great team delivering consistent industry-leading earnings per share growth for over 14 years. We intend to continue this next year and for a long time. Our earnings and dividend growth continue at a predictable high pace every year, no matter what's happening in the economy, the weather, politics or succession planning. And I think all of you who have met Patti can certainly attest to that. Thank you for your interest and your support. Patti and I will be delighted to take your questions. So, Tracy, would you be kind enough to open the telephone lines? Thank you."

So what Julien is talking to, if you all have the slides handy, it was Slide #12, the slide I called an investor favorite, I know it's mine. And it's got that curve in it with the little blue box in it. That blue box in terms of what are some of the [ph] pull-aheads, what are some of the choices that we have with all this favorable performance from better cost reductions than we'd actually planned, and we had a nice toasty summer here at the end with a nice humidity that we don't always get in lovely Michigan, which helped us a bit. But in that box, you see a few different items. First one is [ph] pull-aheads. Those are traditional things that we do. If we can take work from next year and pull it into this year, it makes the job we have to do next year easier. And so some examples are, there were some small outages that we're able to pull ahead. A little bit of tree trimming are pulled ahead during the course of the year, things that improve reliability, things that help us be a better company for our customers and make our job a little bit easier as we go into 2017. The next item that is listed there is called debt prefunding. I think everybody knows, we're such chickens that we go out and prefund our parent debt at least 2 years in advance to ensure that if there was a nightmare scenario of 2007, 2008 proportions, we wouldn't have any exposure in the capital markets.  Well, this is some of that. This is simply pulling ahead some debt that's going to mature, calling that potentially when [ph] its economic and doing a little more financing for that. It's a little bit of bad news for this year. So it's one of those choices that helps you in the next year and 2. Well, that's a nice one. And then there is a list at the bottom there that talks about operations and quality. There are so many things that we can do to be better for our customers that aren't necessarily in our rate cases and aren't necessarily in our basic plans. But we'll do those. And I'll just give you 1 example. Patti has talked and I have talked a lot about the Consumers Energy way. Well, sometimes it takes a little bit of money to bring in the talent to help you make these changes in your processes to the better ways of doing things. So this gives us a little more resource to do some of that work even sooner than we plan to do, so that we can get ahead of the game that improves on our quality, improves on our delivery, improves on our cost and makes us a healthier better company for you, but importantly, for our customers. And then, the reason I picked the third one last, it's sort of what happens towards the end of the year. We get a choice of how much money can we put into our company foundation and in [ph] low income funds, to help customers, to help the people of Michigan, to help our hometown team, quite candidly. And in some years, we have been strained, but we have a very big storm at the end of the year. And we don't have as many resources to put towards that. But in other years, we have an opportunity to catch up a little bit, put some more money into the foundation, and those are the choices we get to make towards the end of the year. So that gives you a little bit of sense on what the things are in the categories and how they can help you next year ensure that you grow in the 6%, 8% zone, which is an important commitment for us, becomes easier to do or more difficult to do as far as that goes. But in this case, it makes it little bit easier. Julien, I hope that helps. We will go to your next question."

There's a lot of things in flight right now with das the MISO filing and what the implications are. So, I will try and break it down a little bit and then answer completely your question. So first of all, MISO is filing with",306,"So -- great question, Julien. There's a lot of things in flight right now with das the MISO filing and what the implications are. So, I will try and break it down a little bit and then answer completely your question. So first of all, MISO is filing with somewhere around November 1st. There is opportunity for 3-year forward looking option and we think that's an important addition to Michigan for all of MISO but it definitely is important given our hybrid regulatory construct. Therefore, their filing has a provision for what's called the prevailing state compensation mechanism which  the state worked with MISO to establish in order for the state to have an alternative in the event that the forward showing option and our forward-looking capacity shows shortfall. So in the event of a shortfall, typically the auction will go simply to and that would set the price. So to your question on prices, yes, the capacity prices would go up just with the auction. But if Michigan sees a -- look at shortfall, then they can implement the prevailing state compensation mechanism, which requires then the alternative energy suppliers to show that they have owned contracted capacity for the subsequent 3 planning years. And then their customers pay a capacity charge that the MPSC will have the authority to set. And so, obviously, that charge has an impact on the alternative energies customers, but what we think is fair about that, is that if additional capacity is required, then the people who are requiring it are actually paying for it versus our bundled customers. So it protects our full bundled customers because we know that we'll have adequate supply to serve our customers. Now from a DIG perspective, I will let Tom address what the implications for DIG might be of that MISO option."

But they can't get a free ride.  They have got to go secure their capacity. But there is only so many places to go capacity in Zone 7 and nearby zones. So obviously that could help and that fits in with why we set this layering in strategy. We try not to be too greedy, thinking that we stay out of the capacity markets. All of a sudden we can get everything at peak price. We're trying to layering it and just recently we layered in. I mentioned in the text. A little more good news. We did little bit more capacity sales above $4 month. So that's an opportunity that would help. But don't forget, DIG can also be just an excellent backup to our own utility if there is a need for that capacity and that's another reason why we haven't committed all of it so far. Thanks, Julien."

If the alternative energy supplier can't secure additional capacity then it defaults to and the MPSC can direct the utility to build out that capacity and those charges will be assigned to those alternative energy suppliers. So, that is definitely a potential. Now all of this -- the timing of all this, the filing for MISO is November of this year. We think there won't be a final ruling from FERC until 2017 and that implies that it won't be available -- the earliest will be available for you be in the 2018 auction, which is actually for the 2021, '22 planning years. So, there is a lot of time and a lot of things that can change between here and there. But we know why MISO is motivated because they are concerned about the reliability, long-term and transparency of the supply and we agree with their concern. I will reiterate though that our plan and our CapEx forward plans do not require that this MISO provision be in place. We require that the energy law be passed. We really are in a position where our plan is solid with or without either the energy law or the MISO tariff approval."

They have real frustration that it is not transparent whether that power is coming from and the administration and the commission and the utilities have been very clear that we want to make sure that it's transparent, that we have adequate supplier for the whole state. We know we have adequate supply for our customers. We want to make sure that the alternative energy suppliers also have adequate supply one way or another for their customers."

For those of you who have not yet met Sri, he is our new Treasurer and Vice President of IR. Sri has been with CMS for a couple of years, and we are excited to have him in his new role. I will begin the presentation with an update to earnings and describe our simple, but powerful model. Tom will then provide the detailed financial results and outlook, and we will finish with some Q&A. We're happy to report adjusted earnings for the first 3 quarters are up $0.22, and we've narrowed our guidance to the high end of our forecasted range of $2 to $2.02 for 6% to 7% over last year's performance. As a reminder, we previously announced our long-term adjusted EPS guidance of 6% to 8%, and we're introducing today specific 2017 earnings guidance of $2.13 to $2.17 a share. It was a strong quarter and that sets us up for a strong finish to 2016. The strong finish will be led by our continued implementation of the Consumers Energy way. We're proud of our consistent financial performance. My coworkers are motivated to serve our families, friends and neighbors. There are many times, however, when those same coworkers, in spite of their best efforts, are unable to serve our customers to our desired standards. Many of our processes are burdened with waste that goes unchecked and the CE Way is simply a lean operations model focused squarely on business results, do customer focus standards, implemented by enabled employees, working within well designed and standard processes and a mindset that every day, there is an opportunity for continuous improvement. Completing our work safely with high quality, low cost and on time will deliver the same consistent results for customers and investors that we've had for over a decade.
As a result of our efforts, I'm more confident than ever in our ability to deliver our simple, but powerful model. We have debts in our organic capital plan. I've yet to attend a meeting where we have trouble identifying opportunities to invest. We have a long shopping list with lots of investments that improve safety, reliability, affordability and our customers' experience. Nothing new here. We will tackle the structural cost with the smart investment, good business decision-making and continuous process improvement. We plan conservatively for sales growth, and we don't dilute our earnings with black equity. All of this adds up to sustainable model that enables investment, while keeping our rates affordable. Like I said, our shopping list is long, and we're not making any big bets to fill out the plan. We have a large electric distribution system. It's made up of over 70,000 miles of conductor, 1,200 substations that all need to be upgraded and maintained, and we have a lot of work to do just to modernize our grid starting with completing our electric smart meter installations in 2017. We continue to increase our gas investments. I like to remind people that we have a great gas business where smart investments have real return for our customers. We still have to say no to projects because we can't spend more than our customers can afford. Our generation fleet continues to evolve in small bites. Incremental renewables, capacity upgrades, coal to gas conversions, these are all small bets that add real value and cost savings, cleaner energy and reliability for our customers. And future PPA replacements could even potentially allow for additional investment without affecting customers' bills. The ability to pay is always our limiting factor, which is why we're so focused on sustainable and structural cost reduction. It's not easy to be the leader [indiscernible] on cost reductions year over year over year. However, that is our ambition. 
Let me remind you that many of our previous decisions were structural, permanent and have many years of favorable impact. For example, our conversion to define contribution plans have significantly reduced our long-term liabilities. Each year, as my coworkers retire and replaced by a new workforce, we save about 1.6% of the previous year's O&M before we tackle a single work process improvement with the CE Way. We have a lot more gas pedal and waste elimination that results in real cost savings. Those cost savings then allow us to be focused on making our prices competitive, so that we can continue to be part of the Michigan growth story. We are seeing positive momentum, cooperation and success stories related to our customers' growth and economic development in our service territory. We're bullish on Michigan. The more we improve our business model, the more companies and their employees will choose Michigan as a place to locate or grow their businesses. And the stats don't lie. Michigan is growing faster than the U.S. average, and Grand Rapids, the heart of our electric territory, is growing faster than the Michigan average. We feel great about being part of that success today and into the future. And still we plan conservatively for low growth.
As we continue to maximize customer value with a strong investment portfolio to drive waste out of our operations and to let -- customer affordability be our throttle, we'll continue to deliver high end and quality earnings growth. Our constructive relationships with our state policymakers, legislators and regulators is based on keeping our promise to perform and to care for our customers and communities. And performance is power. When we perform at best-in-class levels, we can earn the trust and admiration and deliver hometown service for our customers. Day in and day out, you and our customers can count on us. Now I'll turn the call over to Tom."
257682,312963812,1063290,"CMS Energy Corp., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2016",2016-10-27,"Earnings Calls","CMS Energy Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Patti. Third quarter results at $0.67 were up $0.14 compared with a year ago. Adjusted to exclude the cost of our voluntary separation program, results were $0.70 or up $0.17. In either case, this is substantially better than our original plan, ev",885,"Thanks, Patti. Third quarter results at $0.67 were up $0.14 compared with a year ago. Adjusted to exclude the cost of our voluntary separation program, results were $0.70 or up $0.17. In either case, this is substantially better than our original plan, even as it reflects meaningful O&M reinvestment, permitted by cost reductions ahead of plan and the warm, muggy summer. And for the first 9 months, overall, our GAAP earnings were $1.70 a share, up $0.19 from last year. Adjusted for the VSP cost, results were $1.73, up $0.22 or 23% on a weather-normalized basis. As you can see here again, our performance in the first 9 months is $0.22 better than last year. Adverse weather hurt $0.10. We blew away our 5% to 7% EPS growth target, growing more than 10%, including the mild winter weather. Improvements included benefit savings, lower uncollectible accounts, coal plant closures, pole top hardening, higher demand, and productivity at DIG, to name just a few of the areas. Looking ahead into the fourth quarter, if weather is just normal, we'll accomplish a nice uptick of $0.13 compared with 2015. And as you know, we already have a head start on the fourth quarter with cost reductions well ahead of plan. We also have an electric rate case underway and that was self-implemented at $170 million on September 1. We filed a gas rate case last August, which will support 2017. We've plenty of room for reinvesting O&M for our customers this year, and we raised our 2016 guidance to the high end of our 5% to 7% range. This has become an investor favorite slide, where we share our projected earnings per share growth for the full year. And this is as the year progresses.
During the first quarter, mild winter weather and abnormal storms reduced earnings per share by $0.13, but in a very short period of time, we were right back on track for our adjusted earnings growth at 5% to 7%. You can see the improvements that offset the abnormal weather with no impact on customers. We're well ahead of our guidance and as always, are putting the upside to work for customers, improving reliability, billing ahead work from next year as well as prefunding debt maturities, and we will deliver consistent peer-leading earnings per share growth. We beat guidance and delivered 7% adjusted earnings growth for almost 15 years. Here is a picture of that track record. It shows how we consistently offset bad news and put good news to use for our customers without compromising predictable earnings growth of 7% each and every year. Over the last 3 years, favorable weather and cost reductions in excess of our plan generated room to reinvest $0.25 billion for our customers, $0.25 billion. Half of that came from favorable weather and half from cost productivity better than planned. That's a big number. We put these savings to work in many beneficial ways. So far this year, we're 20% ahead of our plan. Our customers and investors really will benefit.
In addition to our cost performance, our conservative view of sales growth and our ability to avoid diluted equity, we still have other attractive upsides. As you can see in this slide, continued layering in of energy and capacity sales could enable us to increase our profitability by $20 million to $40 million at our Dearborn Industrial Generation operations. Recent capacity sales have exceeded $4 a kilowatt month. This is a nice insurance policy for our utility, if it needs more capacity and a catalyst for new growth. And to help you with your own assessment of our future performance, here is our standard profit and cash flow sensitivity slide. Recall that impacts from many legislative changes are not in our plan. Interest rate shifts, up or down, largely offset at our company as changes in debt cost offset changes in discount rates on our pension plans. We believe in no big bets and strong risk mitigation. And here is our report card. For 2016, we're right on course to achieve our plans for capital investment, a high-quality balance sheet, competitive customers prices, a robust dividend payout and strong operating cash flow. We're well ahead of our adjusted earnings per share growth in the 5% to 7% range. Therefore, we raised guidance to the high end. We've introduced specific guidance for 2017 at $2.13 to $2.17, up 6% to 8% from this year. Count on another strong year, our 15th in a row, with high-end predictable earnings, cash flow and dividend growth. This is my 57th CMS quarterly call in a row. Maybe my voice is wearing out and hence has been sharing with you the results of a great team delivering consistent industry-leading earnings per share growth for over 14 years. We intend to continue this next year and for a long time. Our earnings and dividend growth continue at a predictable high pace every year, no matter what's happening in the economy, the weather, politics or succession planning. And I think all of you who have met Patti can certainly attest to that. Thank you for your interest and your support. Patti and I will be delighted to take your questions. So, Tracy, would you be kind enough to open the telephone lines? Thank you."

And it's got that curve in it with a little blue box in it. That blue box talks in terms of what are some of the pull-aheads, what are some of the choices that we have with all this favorable performance from better cost reductions than we'd actually planned, and we had a nice toasty summer here at the end with a nice humidity that we don't always get in lovely Michigan, which helped us a bit. But in that box, you'll see a few different items. First one's pull-aheads. Those are traditional things that we do. If we can take work from next year and pull it into this year, it makes the job we have to do next year easier. And so some examples are, there were some small outages that we're able to pull ahead. A little bit of tree trimming are pulled ahead during the course of the year, things that improve reliability, things that help us be a better company for our customers and make our job a little bit easier as we go into 2017. The next item that is listed there is called debt prefunding. I think everybody knows, we're such chickens that we go out and prefund our parent debt at least 2 years in advance to ensure that if there was a nightmare scenario of 2007, 2008 proportions, we wouldn't have any exposure in the capital markets. Well, this is some of that. This is simply pulling ahead some debt that's going to mature, calling that potentially when it's economic and doing a little more financing for that. It's a little bit of bad news for this year. So it's one of those choices that helps you in the next year and 2. Well, that's a nice one. And then there is a list at the bottom there that talks about operations and quality. There are so many things that we can do to be better for our customers that aren't necessarily in our rate cases and aren't necessarily in our basic plans. But we'll do those. And I'll just give you 1 example. Patti has talked and I have talked a lot about the Consumers Energy way. Well, sometimes it takes a little bit of money to bring in the talent to help you make these changes in your processes to the better ways of doing things. So this gives us a little more resource to do some of that work even sooner than we plan to do, so that we can get ahead of the game that improves on our quality, improves on our delivery, improves on our cost and makes us a healthier better company for you, but importantly, for our customers. And then, the reason I picked the third one last, it's sort of what happens towards the end of the year. We get a choice of how much money can we put into our company foundation and low-income funds, to help customers, to help the people of Michigan, to help our hometown team, quite candidly. And in some years, we have been strained, but we have a very big storm at the end of the year. And we don't have as many resources to put towards that. But in other years, we have an opportunity to catch up a little bit, put some more money into the foundation, and those are the choices we get to make towards the end of the year. So that gives you a little bit of sense on what the things are in the categories and how they can help you next year ensure that you grow in the 6%, 8% zone, which is an important commitment for us, becomes easier to do or more difficult to do as far as that goes. But in this case, it makes it little bit easier. Julien, I hope that helps. We will go to your next question."

There's a lot of things in flight right now with the MISO filing and what the implications are. So, I will try and break it down a little bit and then answer completely your question. So first of all, MISO is filing with some",310,"So -- great question, Julien. There's a lot of things in flight right now with the MISO filing and what the implications are. So, I will try and break it down a little bit and then answer completely your question. So first of all, MISO is filing with somewhere around November 1. There is opportunity for 3-year forward looking option, and we think that's an important addition to Michigan for all of MISO, but it definitely is important to Michigan given our hybrid regulatory construct. Therefore, their filing has a provision for what's called the prevailing state compensation mechanism which the state worked with MISO to establish in order for the state to have an alternative in the event that, that forward showing option and our forward-looking capacity show shortfall. So in the event of a shortfall, typically the auction will go simply to CON and that would set the price. So to your question on prices, yes, the capacity prices would go up just with the auction. But if Michigan sees a -- look at shortfall, then they can implement the prevailing state compensation mechanism, which requires then the alternative energy suppliers to show that they have owned or contracted capacity for the subsequent 3 planning years. And then their customers pay a capacity charge that the MPSC will have the authority to set. And so, obviously, that charge has an impact on the alternative energy supplier customers, but what we think is fair about that, is that if additional capacity is required, then the people who are requiring it are actually paying for it versus our bundled customers. So it protects our full bundled customers because we know that we'll have adequate supply to serve our customers. Now from a DIG perspective, I will let Tom address what the implications for DIG might be of that MISO auction."

But they can't get a free ride. They have got to go secure their capacity. Well, there is only so many places to go to get capacity in Zone 7 and nearby zones. So obviously that could help and that fits in with why we set this layering in strategy. We try not to be too greedy, thinking that we stay out of the capacity markets, all of a sudden, we can get everything at some peak price. We're trying to layer it in and just recently we layered in, I mentioned in the text. A little more good news. We did little bit more capacity sales above $4 a kilowatt month. So that's an opportunity that could help. But don't forget, DIG can also be just an excellent backup to our own utility, if there is a need for that capacity, and that's another reason why we haven't committed all of it so far. Thanks, Julien."

If the alternative energy supplier can't secure additional capacity, then it defaults to and the MPSC can direct the utility to build out that capacity and those charges will be assigned to those alternative energy suppliers. So, that is definitely a potential. Now all of this -- the timing of all of this, the filing for MISO is November of this year. We think there won't be a final ruling from FERC until 2017 and that implies then that it won't be available. The earliest it will be available would be in the 2018 auction, which is actually for the 2021, '22 planning years. So there is a lot of time and a lot of things that can change between here and there. But we know why MISO is motivated because they are concerned about reliability, long-term and transparency of the supply, and we agree with their concern. I will reiterate though that our plan and our CapEx forward plans do not require that this MISO provision be in place. We don't require that the energy law be passed. We really are in a position where our plan is solid with or without either the energy law or the MISO tariff approval."

We're doing a lot of obviously capacity planning to make sure that we have adequate supply for all of our customers for all the years to come, and it's an exciting time because we have a lot of smaller bet options that can provide for very diverse portfolio for serving our customers and that frees up then investment room in our energy -- electric distribution system and our gas business where we have significant investment requirements.

For those of you who have not yet met Sri, he is our new Treasurer and Vice President of IR. Sri has been with CMS for a couple of years, and we are excited to have him in his new role. I will begin the presentation with an update to earnings and describe our simple, but powerful model. Tom will then provide the detailed financial results and outlook, and we will finish with some Q&A. We are happy to report adjusted earnings for the first 3 quarters are up $0.22, and we've narrowed our guidance to the high end of our forecasted range of $2 to $2.02 for 6% to 7% over last year's performance. As a reminder, we previously announced our long-term adjusted EPS guidance of 6% to 8%, and we are introducing today specific 2017 earnings guidance of $2.13 to $2.17 a share. It was a strong quarter and that sets us up for a strong finish to 2016. That strong finish will be led by our continued implementation of the Consumers Energy way. We're proud of our consistent financial performance. My coworkers are motivated to serve our families, friends and neighbors. There are many times, however, when those same coworkers, in spite of their best efforts, are unable to serve our customers to our desired standards. Many of our processes are burdened with waste that goes unchecked and the CE Way is simply a lean operations model focused squarely on business results, through customer focus standards, implemented by enabled employees, working within well designed and standard processes and a mindset that every day, there is an opportunity for continuous improvement. Completing our work safely with high quality, low cost and on time will deliver the same consistent results for customers and investors that we've had for over a decade.
As a result of our efforts, I'm more confident than ever in our ability to deliver our simple, but powerful model. We have debts in our organic capital plan. I've yet to attend a meeting where we have trouble identifying opportunities to invest. We have a long shopping list with lots of investments that improve safety, reliability, affordability and our customers' experience. Nothing new here. We will tackle the structural costs with these smart investments, good business decision-making and continuous process improvement. We plan conservatively for sales growth, and we don't dilute our earnings with black equity. All of this adds up to a sustainable model that enables investment, while keeping our rates affordable. Like I said, our shopping list is long, and we are not making any big bets to fill out the plan. We have a large electric distribution system. It's made up of over 70,000 miles of conductor, 1,200 substations that all need to be upgraded and maintained, and we have a lot of work to do just to modernize our grid starting with completing our electric smart meter installations in 2017. We continue to increase our gas investments. I like to remind people that we have a great gas business where smart investments have real return for our customers. We still have to say no to projects because we can't spend more than our customers can afford. Our generation fleet continues to evolve in small bites. Incremental renewables, capacity upgrades, coal to gas conversions, these are all small bets that add real value and cost savings, cleaner energy and reliability for our customers. And future PPA replacements could even potentially allow for additional investment without affecting customers' bills. The ability to pay is always our limiting factor, which is why we are so focused on sustainable and structural cost reduction. It's not easy to be the leader of the pack on cost reductions year over year over year. However, that is our ambition. 
Let me remind you that many of our previous decisions were structural, permanent and have many years of favorable impact. For example, our conversion to define contribution plans that significantly reduced our long-term liabilities. Each year, as my coworkers retire and replace by a new workforce, we save about 1.6% of the previous year's O&M before we tackle a single work process improvement with the CE Way. We have a lot more gas pedal and waste elimination that results in real cost savings. Those cost savings then allow us to be focused on making our prices competitive, so that we can continue to be part of the Michigan growth story. We are seeing positive momentum, cooperation and success stories related to our customers' growth and economic development in our service territory. We are bullish on Michigan. The more we improve our business model, the more companies and their employees will choose Michigan as a place to locate or grow their businesses. And the stats don't lie. Michigan is growing faster than the U.S. average, and Grand Rapids, the heart of our electric territory, is growing faster than the Michigan average. We feel great about being part of that success today and into the future. And still we plan conservatively for low growth.
As we continue to maximize customer value with a strong investment portfolio to drive waste out of our operations and to let -- customer affordability be our throttle, we will continue to deliver high end and quality earnings growth. Our constructive relationships with our state policymakers, legislators and regulators is based on keeping our promise to perform and to care for our customers and communities. And performance is power. When we perform at best-in-class levels, we can earn the trust and admiration and deliver hometown service for our customers. Day in and day out, you and our customers can count on us. Now I'll turn the call over to Tom."

Third quarter results at $0.67 were up $0.14 compared with a year ago. Adjusted to exclude the cost of our voluntary separation program, results were $0.70 or up $0.17.

Adjusted to exclude the cost of our voluntary separation program, results were $0.70 or up $0.17. In either case, this is substantially better than our original plan, even as it reflects meaningful O&M reinvestment, permitted by cost reductions ahead of plan and the warm, muggy summer. And for the first 9 months, overall, our GAAP earnings were $1.70 a share, up $0.19 from last year. Adjusted for the VSP cost, results were $1.73, up $0.22 or 23% on a weather-normalized basis. As you can see here again, our performance in the first 9 months is $0.22 better than last year. Adverse weather hurt $0.10. We blew away our 5% to 7% EPS growth target, growing more than 10%, including the mild winter weather. Improvements included benefit savings, lower uncollectible accounts, coal plant closures, pole top hardening, higher demand, and productivity at DIG, to name just a few of the areas. Looking ahead into the fourth quarter, if weather is just normal, we'll accomplish a nice uptick of $0.13 compared with 2015. And as you know, we already have a head start on the fourth quarter with cost reductions well ahead of plan. We also have an electric rate case underway and that was self-implemented at $170 million on September 1. We filed a gas rate case last August, which will support 2017. We have plenty of room for reinvesting O&M for our customers this year, and we raised our 2016 guidance to the high end of our 5% to 7% range. This has become an investor favorite slide, where we show our projected earnings per share growth for the full year. And this is as the year progresses.
During the first quarter, mild winter weather and abnormal storms reduced earnings per share by $0.13, but in a very short period of time, we were right back on track for our adjusted earnings growth at 5% to 7%. You can see the improvements that offset the abnormal weather with no impact on customers. We are well ahead of our guidance and as always, are putting the upside to work for customers, improving reliability, billing ahead work from next year as well as prefunding debt maturities, and we will deliver consistent peer-leading earnings per share growth. We beat guidance and delivered 7% adjusted earnings growth for almost 15 years. Here is a picture of that track record. It shows how we consistently offset bad news and put good news to use for our customers without compromising predictable earnings growth of 7% each and every year. Over the last 3 years, favorable weather and cost reductions in excess of our plan generated room to reinvest $0.25 billion for our customers, $0.25 billion. Half of that came from favorable weather and half from cost productivity better than planned. That's a big number. We put these savings to work in many beneficial ways. So far this year, we are 20% ahead of our plan. Our customers and investors really will benefit.
In addition to our cost performance, our conservative view of sales growth and our ability to avoid diluted equity, we still have other attractive upsides. As you can see in this slide, continued layering in of energy and capacity sales could enable us to increase our profitability by $20 million to $40 million at our Dearborn Industrial Generation operations. Recent capacity sales have exceeded $4 a kilowatt month. This is a nice insurance policy for our utility, if it needs more capacity and a catalyst for new growth. And to help you with your own assessment of our future performance, here is our standard profit and cash flow sensitivity slide. Recall that impacts from many legislative changes are not in our plan. Interest rate shifts, up or down, largely offset at our company as changes in debt cost offset changes in discount rates on our pension plans. We believe in no big bets and strong risk mitigation. And here is our report card. For 2016, we are right on course to achieve our plans for capital investment, a high-quality balance sheet, competitive customers prices, a robust dividend payout and strong operating cash flow. We are well ahead of our adjusted earnings per share growth in the 5% to 7% range. Therefore, we raised guidance to the high end. We've introduced specific guidance for 2017 at $2.13 to $2.17, up 6% to 8% from this year. Count on another strong year, our 15th in a row, with high-end predictable earnings, cash flow and dividend growth. This is my 57th CMS quarterly call in a row. Maybe my voice is wearing out and hence has been sharing with you the results of a great team delivering consistent industry-leading earnings per share growth for over 14 years. We intend to continue this next year and for a long time. Our earnings and dividend growth continue at a predictable high pace every year, no matter what's happening in the economy, the weather, politics or succession planning. And I think all of you who have met Patti can certainly attest to that. Thank you for your interest and your support. Patti and I will be delighted to take your questions. So, Tracy, would you be kind enough to open the telephone lines? Thank you."

So what Julien is talking to, if you all have the slides handy, it was Slide #12, the slide I called an investor favorite, I know it's mine. And it's got that curve in it with a little blue box in it. That blue box talks in terms of what are some of the pull-aheads, what are some of the choices that we have with all this favorable performance from better cost reductions than we'd actually planned, and we had a nice toasty summer here at the end with a nice humidity that we don't always get in lovely Michigan, which helped us a bit. So in that box, you'll see a few different items. First one's pull-aheads. Those are traditional things that we do. If we can take work from next year and pull it into this year, it makes the job we have to do next year easier. And so some examples are, there were some small outages that we're able to pull ahead. A little bit of tree trimming got pulled ahead during the course of the year, things that improve reliability, things that help us be a better company for our customers and make our job a little bit easier as we go into 2017. The next item that is listed there is called debt prefunding. I think everybody knows, we're such chickens that we go out and prefund our parent debt at least 2 years in advance to ensure that if there was a nightmare scenario of 2007, 2008 proportions, we wouldn't have any exposure in the capital markets. Well, this is some of that. This is simply pulling ahead some debt that's going to mature, calling that potentially when it's economic and doing a little more financing for that. It's a little bit of bad news for this year. So it's one of those choices that helps you in the next year and 2. Well, that's a nice one. And then there is a list at the bottom there that talks about operations and quality. There are so many things that we can do to be better for our customers that aren't necessarily in our rate cases and they aren't necessarily in our basic plans. But we will do those. And I'll just give you 1 example. Patti has talked and I have talked a lot about the Consumers Energy way. Well, sometimes it takes a little bit of money to bring in the talent to help you make these changes in your processes to the better ways of doing things. So this gives us a little more resource to do some of that work even sooner than we plan to do, so that we can get ahead of the game that improves on our quality, improves on our delivery, improves on our cost and makes us a healthier, better company for you, but importantly, for our customers. And then, the reason I picked the third one last, it's sort of what happens towards the end of the year. We get a choice of how much money can we put into our company foundation and low-income funds, to help customers, to help the people of Michigan, to help our hometown team, quite candidly. And in some years, you know we have been strained, or we have a very big storm at the end of the year. And maybe we don't have as many resources to put towards that. But in other years, we have an opportunity to catch up a little bit, and put some more money into the foundation, and those are the choices we get to make towards the end of the year. So that gives you a little bit of sense on what the things are in the categories and how they can help you next year ensure that you grow in the 6%, 8% zone, which is an important commitment for us, becomes easier to do or more difficult to do as far as that goes. But in this case, it makes it a little bit easier. Julien, I hope that helps. We will go to your next question."

There's a lot of things in flight right now with the MISO filing and what the implications are. So, I will try and break it down a little bit and then answer completely your question. So first of all, MISO is filing with -- f",313,"So -- great question, Julien. There's a lot of things in flight right now with the MISO filing and what the implications are. So, I will try and break it down a little bit and then answer completely your question. So first of all, MISO is filing with -- for somewhere around November 1. This opportunity for a 3-year forward looking option, and we think that's an important addition to Michigan for all of MISO, but it definitely is important to Michigan given our hybrid regulatory construct. Therefore, their filing has a provision for what's called the prevailing state compensation mechanism which the state worked with MISO to establish in order for the state to have an alternative in the event that, that forward showing option and our forward-looking capacity shows shortfall. So in the event of a shortfall, typically the auction will go simply to CON and that would set the price. So to your question on prices, yes, the capacity prices would go up just with the auction. But if Michigan sees a -- look at shortfall, then they can implement the prevailing state compensation mechanism, which requires then the alternative energy suppliers to show that they have owned or contracted capacity for the subsequent 3 planning years. And then their customers pay a capacity charge that the MPSC will have the authority to set. And so, obviously, that charge has an impact on the alternative energy supplier customers, but what we think is fair about that, is that if additional capacity is required, then the people who are requiring it are actually paying for it versus our bundled customers. So it protects our full bundled customers because we know that we will have adequate supply to serve our customers. Now from a DIG perspective, I will let Tom address what the implications for DIG might be of that MISO auction."

But they can't get a free ride. They have got to go secure their capacity. Well, there is only so many places to go to get capacity in Zone 7 and nearby zones. So obviously that could help and that fits in with why we set this layering in strategy. We try not to be too greedy, thinking that if we stay out of the capacity markets, all of a sudden, we can get everything at some peak price. We're trying to layer it in and just recently we layered in, I mentioned in the text. A little more good news. We did little bit more capacity sales above $4 a kilowatt month. So that's an opportunity that could help. But don't forget, DIG can also be just an excellent backup to our own utility, if there is a need for that capacity, and that's another reason why we haven't committed all of it so far. Thanks, Julien."

If the alternative energy supplier can't secure additional capacity, then it defaults to and the MPSC can direct the utility to build out that capacity and those charges will be assigned to those alternative energy suppliers. So, that is definitely a potential. Now all of this -- the timing of all of this, the filing for MISO is November of this year. We think there won't be a final ruling from FERC until 2017 and that implies then that it won't be available. The earliest it will be available would be in the 2018 auction, which is actually for the 2021, '22 planning years. So there is a lot of time and a lot of things that can change between here and there. But we know why MISO is motivated because they are concerned about reliability, long-term and transparency of the supply, and we agree with their concern. I will reiterate though that our plan and our CapEx forward plans do not require that this MISO provision be in place. We don't require that the energy law be passed. We really are in a position where our plan is solid with or without either the energy law or the MISO tariff approval."

And we set as a goal on our base rates to try to keep that growth at or below the rate of inflation. So pick your number, everyone has a different real inflation number, but let's just say, it's 2%.

Arlan Meekhof, the senator -- the senate leader -- majority senate leader, and Mike Nofs, the energy chair out of the senate, are working hard towards a vote, postelection. With the proper momentum and a good vote count, they will take that vote and potentially move it then into the house.

We're doing a lot of obviously capacity planning to make sure that we have adequate supply for all of our customers for all the years to come, and it's an exciting time because we have a lot of smaller bet options that can provide for a very diverse portfolio for serving our customers and that frees up then investment room in our energy -- electric distribution system and our gas business where we have significant investment requirements.

For those of you who have not yet met Sri, he is our new Treasurer and Vice President of IR. Sri has been with CMS for a couple of years, and we are excited to have him in his new role. I will begin the presentation with an update to earnings and describe our simple, but powerful model. Tom will then provide the detailed financial results and outlook, and we will finish with some Q&A. We are happy to report adjusted earnings for the first 3 quarters are up $0.22, and we've narrowed our guidance to the high end of our forecasted range of $2 to $2.02 for 6% to 7% over last year's performance. As a reminder, we previously announced our long-term adjusted EPS guidance of 6% to 8%, and we are introducing today specific 2017 earnings guidance of $2.13 to $2.17 a share. It was a strong quarter and that sets us up for a strong finish to 2016. That strong finish will be led by our continued implementation of the Consumers Energy way. We're proud of our consistent financial performance. My coworkers are motivated to serve our families, friends and neighbors. There are many times, however, when those same coworkers, in spite of their best efforts, are unable to serve our customers to our desired standards. Many of our processes are burdened with waste that goes unchecked and the CE Way is simply a lean operations model focused squarely on business results, through customer focus standards, implemented by enabled employees, working within well designed and standard processes and a mindset that every day, there is an opportunity for continuous improvement. Completing our work safely with high quality, low cost and on time will deliver the same consistent results for customers and investors that we've had for over a decade.
As a result of our efforts, I'm more confident than ever in our ability to deliver our simple, but powerful model. We have debts in our organic capital plan. I've yet to attend a meeting where we have trouble identifying opportunities to invest. We have a long shopping list with lots of investments that improve safety, reliability, affordability and our customers' experience. Nothing new here. We will tackle the structural costs with these smart investments, good business decision-making and continuous process improvement. We plan conservatively for sales growth, and we don't dilute our earnings with black equity. All of this adds up to a sustainable model that enables investment, while keeping our rates affordable. Like I said, our shopping list is long, and we are not making any big bets to fill out the plan. We have a large electric distribution system. It's made up of over 70,000 miles of conductor, 1,200 substations that all need to be upgraded and maintained, and we have a lot of work to do just to modernize our grid starting with completing our electric smart meter installations in 2017. We continue to increase our gas investments. I like to remind people that we have a great gas business where smart investments have real return for our customers. We still have to say no to projects because we can't spend more than our customers can afford. Our generation fleet continues to evolve in small bites. Incremental renewables, capacity upgrades, coal to gas conversions, these are all small bets that add real value and cost savings, cleaner energy and reliability for our customers. And future PPA replacements could even potentially allow for additional investment without affecting customers' bills. The ability to pay is always our limiting factor, which is why we are so focused on sustainable and structural cost reduction. It's not easy to be the leader of the pack on cost reductions year over year over year. However, that is our ambition. 
Let me remind you that many of our previous decisions were structural, permanent and have many years of favorable impact. For example, our conversion to define contribution plans that significantly reduced our long-term liabilities. Each year, as my coworkers retire and replace by a new workforce, we save about 1.6% of the previous year's O&M before we tackle a single work process improvement with the CE Way. We have a lot more gas pedal and waste elimination that results in real cost savings. Those cost savings then allow us to be focused on making our prices competitive, so that we can continue to be part of the Michigan growth story. We are seeing positive momentum, cooperation and success stories related to our customers' growth and economic development in our service territory. We are bullish on Michigan. The more we improve our business model, the more companies and their employees will choose Michigan as a place to locate or grow their businesses. And the stats don't lie. Michigan is growing faster than the U.S. average, and Grand Rapids, the heart of our electric territory, is growing faster than the Michigan average. We feel great about being part of that success today and into the future. And still we plan conservatively for low growth.
As we continue to maximize customer value with a strong investment portfolio to drive waste out of our operations and to let -- customer affordability be our throttle, we will continue to deliver high end and quality earnings growth. Our constructive relationships with our state policymakers, legislators and regulators is based on keeping our promise to perform and to care for our customers and communities. And performance is power. When we perform at best-in-class levels, we can earn the trust and admiration and deliver hometown service for our customers. Day in and day out, you and our customers can count on us. Now I'll turn the call over to Tom."
257682,312963812,1064583,"CMS Energy Corp., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2016",2016-10-27,"Earnings Calls","CMS Energy Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Patti.

Adjusted to exclude the cost of our voluntary separation program, results were $0.70 or up $0.17. In either case, this is substantially better than our original plan, even as it reflects meaningful O&M reinvestment, permitted by cost reductions ahead of plan and the warm, muggy summer. And for the first 9 months, overall, our GAAP earnings were $1.70 a share, up $0.19 from last year. Adjusted for the VSP cost, results were $1.73, up $0.22 or 23% on a weather-normalized basis. As you can see here again, our performance in the first 9 months is $0.22 better than last year. Adverse weather hurt $0.10. We blew away our 5% to 7% EPS growth target, growing more than 10%, including the mild winter weather. Improvements included benefit savings, lower uncollectible accounts, coal plant closures, pole top hardening, higher demand, and productivity at DIG, to name just a few of the areas. Looking ahead into the fourth quarter, if weather is just normal, we'll accomplish a nice uptick of $0.13 compared with 2015. And as you know, we already have a head start on the fourth quarter with cost reductions well ahead of plan. We also have an electric rate case underway and that was self-implemented at $170 million on September 1. We filed a gas rate case last August, which will support 2017. We have plenty of room for reinvesting O&M for our customers this year, and we raised our 2016 guidance to the high end of our 5% to 7% range. This has become an investor favorite slide, where we show our projected earnings per share growth for the full year. And this is as the year progresses.
During the first quarter, mild winter weather and abnormal storms reduced earnings per share by $0.13, but in a very short period of time, we were right back on track for our adjusted earnings growth at 5% to 7%. You can see the improvements that offset the abnormal weather with no impact on customers. We are well ahead of our guidance and as always, are putting the upside to work for customers, improving reliability, billing ahead work from next year as well as prefunding debt maturities, and we will deliver consistent peer-leading earnings per share growth. We beat guidance and delivered 7% adjusted earnings growth for almost 15 years. Here is a picture of that track record. It shows how we consistently offset bad news and put good news to use for our customers without compromising predictable earnings growth of 7% each and every year. Over the last 3 years, favorable weather and cost reductions in excess of our plan generated room to reinvest $0.25 billion for our customers, $0.25 billion. Half of that came from favorable weather and half from cost productivity better than planned. That's a big number. We put these savings to work in many beneficial ways. So far this year, we are 20% ahead of our plan. Our customers and investors really will benefit.
In addition to our cost performance, our conservative view of sales growth and our ability to avoid diluted equity, we still have other attractive upsides. As you can see in this slide, continued layering in of energy and capacity sales could enable us to increase our profitability by $20 million to $40 million at our Dearborn Industrial Generation operations. Recent capacity sales have exceeded $4 a kilowatt month. This is a nice insurance policy for our utility, if it needs more capacity and a catalyst for new growth. And to help you with your own assessment of our future performance, here is our standard profit and cash flow sensitivity slide. Recall that impacts from many legislative changes are not in our plan. Interest rate shifts, up or down, largely offset at our company as changes in debt cost offset changes in discount rates on our pension plans. We believe in no big bets and strong risk mitigation. And here is our report card. For 2016, we are right on course to achieve our plans for capital investment, a high-quality balance sheet, competitive customers prices, a robust dividend payout and strong operating cash flow. We are well ahead of our adjusted earnings per share growth in the 5% to 7% range. Therefore, we raised guidance to the high end. We've introduced specific guidance for 2017 at $2.13 to $2.17, up 6% to 8% from this year. Count on another strong year, our 15th in a row, with high-end predictable earnings, cash flow and dividend growth. This is my 57th CMS quarterly call in a row. Maybe my voice is wearing out and hence has been sharing with you the results of a great team delivering consistent industry-leading earnings per share growth for over 14 years. We intend to continue this next year and for a long time. Our earnings and dividend growth continue at a predictable high pace every year, no matter what's happening in the economy, the weather, politics or succession planning. And I think all of you who have met Patti can certainly attest to that. Thank you for your interest and your support. Patti and I will be delighted to take your questions. So, Tracy, would you be kind enough to open the telephone lines? Thank you."

So what Julien is talking to, if you all have the slides handy, it was Slide #12, the slide I called an investor favorite, I know it's mine.

So what Julien is talking to, if you all have the slides handy, it was Slide #12, the slide I called an investor favorite, I know it's mine. And it's got that curve in it with a little blue box in it. That blue box talks in terms of what are some of the pull-aheads, what are some of the choices that we have with all this favorable performance from better cost reductions than we'd actually planned, and we had a nice toasty summer here at the end with a nice humidity that we don't always get in lovely Michigan, which helped us a bit. So in that box, you'll see a few different items. First one's pull-aheads. Those are traditional things that we do. If we can take work from next year and pull it into this year, it makes the job we have to do next year easier. And so some examples are, there were some small outages that we're able to pull ahead. A little bit of tree trimming got pulled ahead during the course of the year, things that improve reliability, things that help us be a better company for our customers and make our job a little bit easier as we go into 2017. The next item that is listed there is called debt prefunding. I think everybody knows, we're such chickens that we go out and prefund our parent debt at least 2 years in advance to ensure that if there was a nightmare scenario of 2007, 2008 proportions, we wouldn't have any exposure in the capital markets. Well, this is some of that. This is simply pulling ahead some debt that's going to mature, calling that potentially when it's economic and doing a little more financing for that. It's a little bit of bad news for this year. So it's one of those choices that helps you in the next year and 2. Well, that's a nice one. And then there is a list at the bottom there that talks about operations and quality. There are so many things that we can do to be better for our customers that aren't necessarily in our rate cases and they aren't necessarily in our basic plans. But we will do those. And I'll just give you 1 example. Patti has talked and I have talked a lot about the Consumers Energy way. Well, sometimes it takes a little bit of money to bring in the talent to help you make these changes in your processes to the better ways of doing things. So this gives us a little more resource to do some of that work even sooner than we plan to do, so that we can get ahead of the game that improves on our quality, improves on our delivery, improves on our cost and makes us a healthier, better company for you, but importantly, for our customers. And then, the reason I picked the third one last, it's sort of what happens towards the end of the year. We get a choice of how much money can we put into our company foundation and low-income funds, to help customers, to help the people of Michigan, to help our hometown team, quite candidly. And in some years, you know we have been strained, or we have a very big storm at the end of the year. And maybe we don't have as many resources to put towards that. But in other years, we have an opportunity to catch up a little bit, and put some more money into the foundation, and those are the choices we get to make towards the end of the year. So that gives you a little bit of sense on what the things are in the categories and how they can help you next year ensure that you grow in the 6%, 8% zone, which is an important commitment for us, becomes easier to do or more difficult to do as far as that goes. But in this case, it makes it a little bit easier. Julien, I hope that helps. We will go to your next question."

So, I will try and break it down a little bit and then answer completely your question. So first of all, MISO is filing with -- for somewhere around November 1. This opportunity for a 3-year forward looking option, and we think that's an important addition to Michigan for all of MISO, but it definitely is important to Michigan given our hybrid regulatory construct. Therefore, their filing has a provision for what's called the prevailing state compensation mechanism which the state worked with MISO to establish in order for the state to have an alternative in the event that, that forward showing option and our forward-looking capacity shows shortfall. So in the event of a shortfall, typically the auction will go simply to CON and that would set the price. So to your question on prices, yes, the capacity prices would go up just with the auction. But if Michigan sees a -- look at shortfall, then they can implement the prevailing state compensation mechanism, which requires then the alternative energy suppliers to show that they have owned or contracted capacity for the subsequent 3 planning years. And then their customers pay a capacity charge that the MPSC will have the authority to set. And so, obviously, that charge has an impact on the alternative energy supplier customers, but what we think is fair about that, is that if additional capacity is required, then the people who are requiring it are actually paying for it versus our bundled customers. So it protects our full bundled customers because we know that we will have adequate supply to serve our customers. Now from a DIG perspective, I will let Tom address what the implications for DIG might be of that MISO auction."

But they can't get a free ride. They have got to go secure their capacity. Well, there is only so many places to go to get capacity in Zone 7 and nearby zones. So obviously that could help and that fits in with why we set this layering in strategy. We try not to be too greedy, thinking that if we stay out of the capacity markets, all of a sudden, we can get everything at some peak price. We're trying to layer it in and just recently we layered in, I mentioned in the text. A little more good news. We did little bit more capacity sales above $4 a kilowatt month. So that's an opportunity that could help. But don't forget, DIG can also be just an excellent backup to our own utility, if there is a need for that capacity, and that's another reason why we haven't committed all of it so far. Thanks, Julien."

If the alternative energy supplier can't secure additional capacity, then it defaults to and the MPSC can direct the utility to build out that capacity and those charges will be assigned to those alternative energy suppliers. So, that is definitely a potential. Now all of this -- the timing of all of this, the filing for MISO is November of this year. We think there won't be a final ruling from FERC until 2017 and that implies then that it won't be available. The earliest it will be available would be in the 2018 auction, which is actually for the 2021, '22 planning years. So there is a lot of time and a lot of things that can change between here and there. But we know why MISO is motivated because they are concerned about reliability, long-term and transparency of the supply, and we agree with their concern. I will reiterate though that our plan and our CapEx forward plans do not require that this MISO provision be in place. We don't require that the energy law be passed. We really are in a position where our plan is solid with or without either the energy law or the MISO tariff approval."

But the lag is just from the period that there is to the next rate case. So we'll share that with them. And we set as a goal on our base rates to try to keep that growth at or below the rate of inflation. So pick your number, everyone has a different real inflation number, but let's just say, it's 2%.

Arlan Meekhof, the senator -- the senate leader -- majority senate leader, and Mike Nofs, the energy chair out of the senate, are working hard towards a vote, postelection. With the proper momentum and a good vote count, they will take that vote and potentially move it then into the house.

We have alternative options and when PPAs do come off and there are -- we have a couple -- we have many PPAs, and as they retire and we decide whether we're going to renegotiate those PPAs or replace them, we do have options to bring in, to do more bilaterals with other energy suppliers or to build new capacity incremental renewables, more demand response and energy efficiency. We're doing a lot of obviously capacity planning to make sure that we have adequate supply for all of our customers for all the years to come, and it's an exciting time because we have a lot of smaller bet options that can provide for a very diverse portfolio for serving our customers and that frees up then investment room in our energy -- electric distribution system and our gas business where we have significant investment requirements. So we really have a good balanced approach right now."

Zone 2 in the MISO zone to Sault Ste. Marie -- between Sault Ste. Marie and Ontario. And then looking at connecting the UP and the lower Peninsula through an existing transmission project in Gaylord or starting a large gas plant constructed up north, somewhere up in the UP. So it's a variety of studies and they are all pointing to one situation that's trying to be correct and that's the resource adequacy issues because of our regulatory construct in Michigan, there is this loophole up in the UP, they has caused a major cost shift up there and so they are trying to figure out a way to better serve the people of the upper peninsula. We participate to the extent that we're energy experts and the governor relies on us for our input and insights, but the study that they've requested from MISO really will help frame up the situation, I would say, and when it's complete, we'll certainly obviously take a look and see what the options are."
