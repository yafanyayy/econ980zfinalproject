With me today is Anne Lloyd, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. To facilitate the discussion, we've made available during this webcast and on our website supplemental financial information, which we believe will be helpful. As detail specifically on Slide 2, please remember that today's teleconference may include forward-looking statements as defined by securities laws in connection with future events or future operating and financial performance. Like other businesses, we're subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially. Except as legally required, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements whether resulting from new information, future developments or otherwise. We refer you to the legal disclaimers contained in our fourth quarter and full year earnings release and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which are available on both our own and the SEC websites. Also as a reminder, any margin references in our discussion are based on net sales and exclude freight and delivery revenue. These, and other non-GAAP measures are also explained in our supplemental financial information as well as on our website and in our SEC filings. 
Upon leveraging the full year of [indiscernible] TXI operations with our heritage business, 2015 enters the books as a record year. Specifically, we achieved record safety results, record net sales and profitability, expanded consolidated gross profit margin, exceeded incremental margin targets for the consolidated heritage business, exceeded acquisition synergies targets in both dollars and time line, invested capital in our business, completed several bolt-on acquisitions and returned nearly $630 million [ph] to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. These impressive results we achieved with both tailwinds and headwinds. 
The tailwinds. 2015 construction markets experienced continued growth in private activity led by housing as well as the emergence of enhanced public sector activity as best revealed by a 7% [ph] increase in highway construction. Nonetheless, we had a very significant headwind as 2015 saw unprecedented amounts of precipitation in our core states of Texas, North Carolina, Iowa, Georgia and Colorado, disproportionately impacting second and fourth quarter performance. By some estimates, and indeed our own calculation and internal plans, multiple sustained extraordinary weather events combined with the downturn in energy sector shale development likely cost us up to $200 million in sales for the year, masking the underlying strength of general construction. That underlying strength is revealed in the solid growth we see across our business with the market acceleration of the construction recovery in key Southeastern markets, fueled by steady employment growth, continued private sector activity and expanded Department of Transportation programs. We thus entered 2016 with what we believe are very favorable market and operating tailwinds, building upon our teams record 2015 results. This past results and future opportunities are tied to our strict and steadfast attention to cost discipline, further underscoring the positive result of years of improving our operating efficiency. We're also specifically very proud of our 2015 record safety performance, a core foundational pillar of our company. We concluded 2015 with incident rates better than what had been 2014's then record results. Notably, we continue to see dramatic improvement in the safety numbers of the former TXI operations, further underscoring our successful operational and cultural integration. Safety is first at Martin Marietta. In December, we completed construction of our state-of-the-art Medina Rock and rail quarry near San Antonio, Texas. Shipments from Medina now are expected to replace rail shipments from our Beckmann Quarry, as a transition from a distance rail and truck-serve quarrying to wholly focusing on the local San Antonio marketplace. The Medina job was on time and on budget. The construction of $160 million facility spanned 3 years is the largest and most complex capital project in the company's history and is now the largest quarry on the Union Pacific Railroad's fast network. Medina began operation in January 2016, and we expect to ship nearly 6 million tons of aggregates this year. 
As highlighted in today's press release, we continue to execute against our strategic objective of securing and solidifying [indiscernible] in Colorado Springs. These 2 bolt-on transactions complement our position in Metro Denver and Northern Colorado, a position we originally acquired in 2011 with our river for the Rockies asset exchange, and provide attractive in leading positions along the Front Range of the Rocky Mountains, home to over 80% of Colorado's population. Following these recent transactions, we've added an estimated 1 billion tons of aggregates reserves. Strategically, 4 years ago we've had no Front Range position whatsoever. Today, we are marketplace leader with nearly 100 years of high-quality construction aggregates in a region with near- and long-term favorable employment and demographic conditions. 
Turning to the fourth quarter performance. We established quarterly records for net sales and profitability driven by strong pricing, disciplined execution of our strategic plan and steady growth in construction activity. Importantly, all segments in the aggregates business delivered
[Audio Gap]
grew with a 630 basis point improvement, largely resulting from strong pricing and realized TXI synergies. As shown on Slide 7, through the end of 2015, we've realized approximately $100 million of our $120 million synergy target, reflected in both the acquired business and heritage West Group performance. We are on track to fully realize our $120 million synergy target by the end of this year. 
On a more granular basis, our 2015 record results were driven by strong pricing across our aggregates, aggregates-related and Cement businesses, shown on Slide 8. Notably, the heritage aggregates product line delivered an increase of more than 7% in average selling price, while heritage ready-mixed concrete prices increased nearly 10%. The acquired businesses, aggregates, ready-mixed concrete and cement, saw a price increases of 13%, nearly 11% and 10%, respectively, in line with our stated objectives. For the year, heritage aggregates product line volume increased 2% and total aggregates product line volume increased 7%. This is again despite record or near record occurring precipitation in 5 of our largest states. 
The Southeast and the Mid-America Groupies led volume growth on the strength of recovery in Georgia, Florida and the Carolinas. The West Group, which was most affected by the adverse weather conditions, reported an increase in aggregates volume of 1.2%, excluding TXI-related divestitures, which affect comparability with the prior year. Aggregates volume growth for the year was notable in North Texas, but was somewhat offset by declines in directional energy aggregate shipments in South Texas. 
Volumes grew across all product lines with the exception of asphalt, where our Texas divestiture in the fourth quarter affected year-over-year comparability. Of note, asphalt margins expanded to 28% or just over 1,000 basis points, clearly reflecting improved profitability in our core Colorado asphalt business. Consolidated gross profit margin was 22% and expanded by 260 basis points for the year, led by margin expansion in all construction materials related segments. Gross profit for the heritage aggregates business increased $130 million over the prior year, with margins expanding 480 basis points to 23.8% [ph] of net sales the incremental gross margin for the heritage aggregates business exceeded targeted objectives for both the fourth quarter and full year 2015. The incremental gross margin of 82% for the full year 2015 was led by growth in both the West Group and the Southeast Group, which achieved incremental gross margin of 100
[Audio Gap]
the acquired businesses gross profit margin also expanded 300 basis points in 2015, led by acquired aggregates product line gross profit margin of nearly 27%, up from 4.6% for the comparable prior year period, reflecting synergy realization and underlying strength in both volume and pricing. Due to the September 2015 sale of our California Cement business, quarterly results for the Cement segments are not comparable to the prior year period. And in fact, comparability will be affected throughout 2016. Quarterly details for the Cement business can be found on Slide 9 for elimination of the California results. However, for the remaining Cement business has benefited from Martin Marietta's significant pricing improvement in 2015. 
Average selling prices increased 10%, aided partly by the expiration of legacy TXI Cement contracts at below-market pricing and the divestiture of the California business. For the year, the business generated $368 million in net sales and delivered a 28% gross profit margin, a 310 basis point improvement over the prior year. 
EBITDA for the business was $101 million, a $30 million increase. 
The Magnesia Specialties business was negatively affected by a slowdown in the steel industry in 2015. Steel capacity utilization was down from approximately 78% in 2014 to 71% in 2015. Full year net sales were $228 million, a decline of $9 million or 4% compared to the prior year. The Magnesia Specialty's team diligently managed the cost profile of the business during the year and despite steel capacity utilization declines delivered an impressive 35% gross profit margin. 
On a consolidated basis, 2015 delivered record net sales of $3.3 billion, an increase of $589 million or 22%; record gross profit of $722 million, an increase of $199 million or 38%, record net earnings of $289 million, an increase of 86% and record adjusted EBITDA of $766.7 million, an increase of 30%. The significant improvement in net earnings coupled with the absence of TXI-related costs, further increase in operating cash flow in 2015 to $573 million compared with $382 million in 2014. Operating cash flow per share of $8.55 improved 8% [ph] when compared to adjusted 2014, which excludes the cash impact of TXI-related expenses. 
We invested $318 million of capital during the year, including $78 million related to the new Medina Rock quarry. For the year, we returned nearly $630 million to our shareholders through the combination of repurchasing 3.3 million shares of our common stock, together with our dividend. As a reminder, we have board authorization to repurchase up to 20 million shares. Finally, our ratio of consolidated net debt to consolidated EBITDA for the trailing 12 months ended December 2015 was 1.9x, in compliance with our leverage covenant and below our target leverage of 2x. 
In summary, 2015 was a remarkable year for Martin Marietta. And despite being tempered by extraordinary weather that cloaked our true earnings potential, our team is poised for an even stronger 2016. We are confident we have the foundation in place for improved growth, profitability and performance. 
We will now look to the future and discuss our 2016 outlook, which we highlight on Slides 11 through 13. Initially, you'll notice an improvement in our expected growth as compared to our very early thoughts provided in third quarter 2015. Our 2016 outlook now reflects growing underlying demand and strong pricing across our entire geographic footprint. National employment growth, a stimulus for construction activity, remained robust in 2015, surpassing the prerecession peak by nearly 5 million jobs. These job gains, in addition to contractor backlogs, which resulting from [indiscernible] 2015 rainfall, should fuel growth and further recovery of the U.S. construction industry in 2016 and beyond. Public sector growth is expected to drive mid-single-digit volume increases in our infrastructure business, which accounted for 41% of our aggregates demand in 2015. The growth reflects continued state-level funding initiatives that are positively impacting several of our key states, including Texas, North Carolina, Iowa, Georgia and Florida. For example, in Texas, nearly $10 billion through Department of Transportation lettings are planned, up from $6.1 billion in 2015. Dallas-Fort Worth alone is the beneficiary of 4 major design build projects aimed at mitigating areas congestion and improving traffic flow. There's also significant and continuing infrastructure work in and around Houston. Additional evidence of state-level infrastructure investment tailwinds is revealed by recent project scheduling changes announced by the North Carolina Department of Transportation or NCDOT. Specifically, after the passage last year of various new state funding initiatives, NCDOT announced an accelerated schedule for 90 [ph] Highway projects. This example is consistent with our [indiscernible] expectations around state construction project backlog. 
In addition to state-level initiatives, we now have the 5-year, $305 billion Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act or FAST Act. Enacted in December 2015 to provide states with the required funding certainty for the first time in nearly a decade to commit to a backlog of longer-term projects needed to improve and expand America's transportation network. We believe the FAST Act, along with state-level funding initiatives, will drive large, multiyear, aggregate-intensive construction projects. Further, it's also likely we will see meaningful projects in rural areas that had been infrastructure-starved during the last decade and will now be better able to develop new avenues for growth and commerce. 
Shipments to nonresidential construction projects, 32% of our 2015 demand, is expected to increase in both the heavy, industrial and light commercial sectors, leading to an increase in aggregates volume in the high single digits. The light nonresidential construction sector is primarily opposite retail, with demand generally tied to employment growth and residential activity. Notably, the Dodge momentum index is near its highest level since 2009, signaling continued growth. Further, core Martin Marietta's states account for 5 of the top 10 and 9 of the top 20 in state-level employment growth, including Florida, Texas, Georgia, North Carolina, Ohio, Indiana, South Carolina, Virginia and Colorado. All positive catalysts for construction activity. The heavy nonresidential construction sector is primarily industrial building as well as energy and energy-related activity. We are currently supplying several large energy-related industrial and infrastructure projects along the Gulf Coast and expect our project backlog to grow, thus largely offsetting the decline in direct shale exploration activity. We believe that direct shale activity will reach a maintenance level in the fourth quarter of 2015 and should sustain at that level throughout 2016. Of course, results for the first and second quarters of last year reflected higher than maintenance level consumption and are expected to affect our comparability to the first half 2016 results. The residential end-use market accounted for 17% of aggregate shipments in 2015 and increased 20% as compared to 2014. We expect a double-digit volume increase again in 2016, reflecting the continued steady recovery of residential investment as a result of positive employment gains, historically low mortgage rates, significant [indiscernible] absorption and higher multifamily rental rates. New housing permit activity was up 12% in 2015, indicating future gains in housing construction. Importantly, Texas, Florida, Colorado, Georgia and North Carolina each ranked in the top 10 states for housing starts. 
Finally, to conclude our discussion of 2015 end-use markets, the ChemRock rail market represented the remaining 10% of aggregates volume is expected to remain relatively flat to modestly down in 2016. 
We'll now focus on Texas, where we continue to be encouraged by the resilience of the broader marketplace. In short, we anticipate increasing overall demand driven by solid population and employment growth. Construction activity in our larger volume markets principally being the vibrant corridor of Dallas, San Antonio, Austin is expected to grow throughout 2016 and beyond led by multiyear infrastructure activity, a strong residential marketplace and solid nonresidential construction. South Texas, of course, has seen a decline in shale oilfield activity, thus reducing our direct shipments by
[Audio Gap]
In late 2016 or early 2017, we'll open a new aggregates facility on Martin Marietta-owned property at the Hunter Cement plant northeast of San Antonio. This undertaking will allow us to transition from our leased and nearly depleted new Brownfields quarry only 10 miles away to a permanent location with over 400 million tons of quality aggregate materials providing improved access to local markets. The Hunter aggregates quarry will be an additional synergy from the TXI acquisition that will benefit our company in 2017 and beyond. 
Our expectations for 2016 volume levels in Houston have moderated from 2015 [ph] levels where we saw an 11% increase in aggregate shipments. We now expect aggregate volume in that marketplace to be broadly flat with any potential upside being spurred by large infrastructure projects and any downside being driven by a sharper deterioration in the used in Houston economy. That said, it's important to remember that our principal Texas markets are located in North and Central Texas and not materially impacted by Houston market conditions. The Portland Cement Association or PCA forecast modest demand growth in Texas in 2016 followed by stronger growth in 2017. We currently expect 2016 cement volume to increase 8% to 11%. We previously announced a cement price increase to $12 per ton effective April 1, 2016. Based on the expected flow of shipments, we'll likely realize a year-over-year average selling price increase of approximately 9%. Both volume and price growth forecasts exclude the 2015 results of the divested California Cement business. Profitability is forecast to increase by an estimated $30 million in 2016. 
On a consolidated basis, 2016 is expected to deliver record-setting results, including net sales ranging from $3.5 billion to $3.7 billion expanded gross profit and expanded EBITDA. As we've consistently stated, our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. They are investing in aggregates-led acquisitions, organic capital investment to ensure safe, environmentally-sound and highly-efficient operations and returning cash to shareholders in the form of a sustainable, meaningful dividend and share repurchases under our existing authority. 
To conclude, we're optimistic and excited about 2016. We entered the year with an enhanced foundation for further growth and outlook for improved business conditions across the vast majority of our markets, led by solid private sector construction activity and a newly reinvigorated public sector. Our team remains focused on the careful execution of our strategic plan, wholly committed to our core foundation of pillars and dedicated to delivering increased shareholder value.

And to be specific, that was an additional $700 million over 2 years. The other thing that North Carolina has it's spending that we'll see voted on later on the year is a $2 billion building bond proposal as well. So I think to answer your question very specifically, when our legislature came out with the additional $700 million, we did see the state implementation plan move forward 90 projects in -- up into the year. So we do anticipate seeing that. So yes, we're seeing activity that we believe will take aggregates volume later in the year. And clearly, we're effectively doubling the Georgia budget, adding that additional $900 million to it. We will clearly see amped-up activity in Georgia. Remember, we were going to be benefited, too, by the [indiscernible] planning that was put in principally in South Georgia a couple of years ago. So now what we will see, I believe, is greater activity across the State of Georgia. But you're seeing the activity that we were seeing in South Georgia, increased activity in North Georgia, principally around Atlanta. And we know we'll see more activity in North Carolina as well. I think it's worth noting, Iowa did put in a $0.10 a gallon gas tax increase last year. Nebraska did as well. We're going to see the benefits of Prop 1 [ph] money in Texas, and we're seeing near-record lettings in Florida this year. So we're seeing new money in a number of states, and we think we see more money coming in a number of states, including states like Indiana, where Governor basically said he'd like to see another $1 billion worth of infrastructure in that state. And we've got 12 different states right now seriously considering gas tax increases in addition to what Georgia and Iowa have passed. So that gives you a little bit of a feel of across the patch, Kathryn."

I think what we're seeing is increased contract backlogs across our entire footprint. We have also seen the awarding of several large energy-related industrial contracts, particularly in -- along the Gulf Coast. I think what we're seeing in the fourth quarter, when it wasn't raining, the fourth quarter looked very powerful. I'll give you a sense of -- I've been in Texas 3 times over the last 1.5 months, and I was there for part of the holidays. And I'm talking to contractors in that marketplace, literally the weaker Christmas was dry, they were saying they were having really record days even at that time of year, which I'll tell you is unusual, but it gives me a sense of what's out there. And the other point I think goes back to the very beginning of the conversation that we had, and that's just simply more accelerated infrastructure activity in our key states. So we're looking at those $10.1 billion worth of activity, potentially in Texas, more in North Carolina, more in Iowa and more in Colorado. And remember what we said about Colorado. The primary thing that was keeping us from doing more in Colorado is we needed more business in Colorado. And now what we've been able to effectively do is extend our march down the Front Range into the southern part of that as well. So I think all of those together has put us in a position that we feel considerably good about the way 2016 is shaping up. I think as we go back to the second part of your question, that is relative to Cement, I think several things are going to happen. One, Cement was badly effected last year by the rain. I mean it's hard to run a cement business which is a 24/7, 365 business, if you need to take it down more than you would wish. And keep in mind, our aim was to be a price leader in that state. And our view was we would rather take those cones down rather than keep them going and do something that we felt that was going to be foolish relative to the selling price in that marketplace. In large part, we believe we can have greater efficiencies in Cement this year, but we also think we're going to see better pricing in Cement this year. We saw a little bit of share movement in our business since Cement. And the fact is, we were willing to see that share movement move because that was really driven by 2 distinct players in the marketplace. Holcim had brought on a cone again that they had idled for a while at Midlothian, and they were coming back into the marketplace. And our goes, as we discussed, was bringing in some material in South Texas. We believe as we go into the year that everybody is likely to be relatively full. We believe we're going to be efficient. We believe we're going to be successful on our price increases. And we think by the time we put all of that in place, we're looking at very nice improvement in the Cement business. And by the way, we're looking for a very nice improvement in the ready-mix business as well. I think those are your principal drivers in Texas."

I don't know how much of that is going to fit in the early part of '16, but I think you might see some of that actually coming through the back end of '16, which would be earlier than you would typically see. But I think equally, when you come back and consider the significant state initiatives. And again, we saw initiatives coming out of North Carolina late in the year. We're seeing a big Texas number. We're seeing that gas tax increase pull through in ways that we're excited about in Iowa. Again, another record year -- letting year coming up in Florida. I think all of that helps from the infrastructure side, in particular. I think if we go to nonres, I mean here's what -- here's a statistic that's striking to me. Think of it in these terms. Shale volumes were down 1.1 million tons in the quarter, as you heard me say in the telecom. But net South Texas shipments actually increased, and they increased by large infrastructure and large manufacturing projects. And part of what we're seeing in -- on the nonres side is an awfully nice surge in non-building. So I encourage you go and take a look at what's going on in other non-building. Again, power plants, gas, communications. Those types are really very aggregate-intensive [indiscernible] Non-building, looking at the trailing 12 months to November, was up 19%. And a lot of that activity is concentrated in the Gulf. So again, if we're coming back and seeing what we feel like are really, really attractive DOT projects and awfully nonres projects. That helps. The other piece of it, candidly, we saw a lot of projects awarded in the fourth quarter. And one of the things that I'd like to see is at certain levels, is probably frustrating to our division presidents, but we have signed delegations from here to know exactly what they're bidding on. It's not that we don't trust what they're doing. We just like to see the sheer level of that activity, and we saw a lot of that activity in Q4."

I mean that's really your show on what was going on on the heavy side. I mean to give you sense of -- the walk-through quarters, in Q1, to shale, we sold about 1.2 million tons. In Q2, to shale, we sold about 1 million. In Q3, to shale, about 830,000. And in Q4, to shale, about 521,000. Remember, in my prepared comments, I said I thought we were getting to maintenance levels. We view that 500,000 tons a quarter. That's a maintenance level. And that goes back in part to the comment that I think I was sharing with Adam before when I've said, ""Look, we saw shale volumes down 1.1 million tons in the quarter, but South Texas shipments actually up."" So if you go to the one part of the country that would've felt more acutely, the downturn in shale, than anybody else, and you brush it away, and you say ""But their goings were up."" That gives you a good sense of what's happening on that lighter side of it, Todd, and then back to that non-building piece of it as well.

And the other thing that's important is you're seeing a number of TIFIA projects. Let's not forget that while TIFIA is smaller in this new Highway bill, TIFIA isn't going away. If we're simply taking a look at what's going on in Colorado relative to, I think, it was Highway -- Interstate 70 and Interstate 4 70, those are 2 significant TIFIA projects that I think are like $1.7 billion to $2 billion.

That's a reduction of 2 percentage points. To put math to it, it's about 325,000 tons, just to be really granular. And again, I think we've got a good sense of where that breakpoint is between share and price. And our sense has been price has been more important. And I think you can tell, given what we've done relative to the business, that it's certainly shown that. I mean one important thing to remember, though, is weather needs to stabilize. And as it stabilizes, part of what I think is going to happen is the imports, in particular, that were coming at the South Texas that is bringing in would suddenly start to be utilized for their own self-supply.

That's what we've done with nearly 1 billion tons in that marketplace. Here's an important note for us to consider, because we haven't had a recent talk about this in the past, but actually November, voters in Colorado Springs actually put in a sales and used tax increase of 0.62% to fund road repair and maintenance in that part of the state. We believe that's going to generate about $250 million over 5 years just in Southern Colorado. So when we come back with what we feel like will be about net sales of that business of that $90 million this year, EBITDA margins have probably 17% to 20%, which is below where we would like to see it. It's actually better than the business that we bought in the Rocky Mountains when we acquired it, and we brought it up. With that very capable team that we have in Denver, I don't have any doubt that we will see those percentages move up nicely and move up, I think, in trajectory in a much more quick time frame than they did for us originally in Denver, which, by the way, I don't think anyone ever complained about.

Are we seeing that and can I go to specific markets and call it out as instances where I'm concerned about it? Not really at all. I think the other practical matter is twofold. One, people are having a hard time getting drivers in the marketplace, just finding them. And the number two, actually paying for them on the wages that they're looking for. So I think you've got an industry issue relative to aggregates that I think makes taking cheaper diesel and hauling stone farther a bit of an anathema.

They're just going to be easier in North. And I agree with you as well. We are going to have some of our own contracts that we need to work through.

One, we're looking at where the American Iron and Steel Institute is right now relative to their forecast. They're basically seeing steel at a 70% utilization rate. And if you recall going back over time, that's been the point where we said is really important for this business. So if we're 70% or more, the business is going to do quite well. The other input that's important to remember is we are going to end up having decent amount of usage of natural gas in that business. If we look at what net gas did last year for the year, it's 28% lower. Even if we look at the quarter, it was about 26% lower. So again, if we're going into the year, and the Steel Institute is right at 70%, that's hitting a magic number. If the input on gas is going to continue to be low, that's helpful. To the extent that the business comes under pressure, the thing that I would tell you, too, is there's no team that we have in this company that's better at managing costs and managing their cost profile than our Magnesia Specialties business. So when I go back to our Q4 and look at a 35% margin, even if that business came under some degree of duress. And again, I'm not thinking that it will. But even if it did, I think you're looking at a business that's still going to have a margin in the low 30s. And from where I'm sitting, if we've got a low 30 margin, I'll take it every day."

Q1 is either made or broken the last 2 weeks of March in most instances. Because you've got to have relatively warm weather to put down hot mix in most markets. The other thing to remember, and we try to outline it pretty clearly in the telecon, we aren't going to have that shale headwind, at least in the Southwest throughout the first half of the year, but I think that clearly goes away once we're through the first half. That said -- and here's a good way to think of it. If you want to look at the midpoint of our guidance, what you're really saying is you're going to aggregate volume at the midpoint at about 166 million tons. I mean that's my quick math. If we want to stay there was whether deferral of, call it, 3.5 million, 4 million tons, and then you've got the shale maintenance level that could take it down another 1.5 million tons. I mean it rain in that first half, and then the other component that we're managing through, and we'll manage through it, it'll be just fine, it's a transition from New Braunfels to Hunter. And anytime you do a ship like that, it's never going to be a perfect handoff. There's going to be a little bit of shuffling that goes on because you're going from one large quarry to another large quarry. So as I look at that and start tallying it all up, yes, I could see 2016 ag volume at that 7% end of our range and 167 million tons. And could you see some of that go in Q1? You could, but you do have that shale play that I would just encourage you to be mindful of during the first half of the year. So if you think about it, Trey, last year Q1 was pretty good quarter. Q2 was a rainy mess. Q3 was relatively normal weather. And I think the performance we saw in Q3 was what you'd expect. And then Q4, we went back to building the ark. So the fact is if we end up with a good Q1 in normal weather, I think we'd be very, very pleased with that. And given what would be just the optical headwind on that portion of shale. Does that help?"

So the fact is we'll see what we feel like is a good bit of that going in this year as well. I think just better costs, better efficiency. I mean here's some interesting anecdote for you, Trey. I mean, at some point late in the fourth quarter, we actually got a call here in the corporate office. And we got a call from this poor guy who's trying to build a hotel and get concrete poured because he's opening the doors the next week, and he couldn't get concrete poured. And here's why he couldn't get concrete poured. Because the 4 other times we had been ready to deliver concrete to the site, he couldn't take it because the site was so wet.

Can you talk about how aggregates price increases for January 1 this year compared to last year and maybe how you expect the pricing cadence to play out? If I'm not mistaken, you had a bigger January 1 increase last year than typical seasonality would suggest that those you had lower midyear prices throughout the year?  Well, what I would tell you is we've gone to the market pretty consistently with what we feel like the pricing needs to be. And obviously, pricing anywhere in the low end from $0.50 a ton to the middle range of about $1 a ton to some places, $1.50 a ton or more in some instances, I think one of the best examples that I can give you, if you go back to when we did our acquisition of TXI, part of what we said was, TXI's pricing was roughly 60% of our corporate average, and we said we thought it probably take about 3 years to get that closer to our corporate average, mindful that our corporate average continues to move up during that same period of time. Right now, TXI is about 75% of our corporate average. So again, from a rhythm and cadence perspective, that's certainly what we're seeing. Would I expect this to come back and talk about midyear price increases again this year? The short answer is I would, if we're seeing the types of volume increases and the more infrastructure-type work, honestly, I think you can find yourself in a position toward the latter part of '16, certainly in '17, that in some markets you could be short on some products. That was exactly what happened last year, principally because of flooding in North Texas with respect to sand, in particular. So again, I think the rhythm of it will be, you'll see most prices and effective January 1, in some places, you're going to see some pricing that won't go into effect until March or April. The long and short answer is that doesn't so much matter because there's not a lot of volume going on in Q1 anyway. And we will come back at some point later in the year and talk to you more about midyear price increases that I think customer should expect those conversations."

This year, in Texas, we're probably looking -- trying to remember exactly, but we're looking at for the -- kind of give me one second on the additions this year. You know what, I have to come back and probably talk to you about that off-line."

We're looking Q3 at about $2 million, and Q4 is always the heavy quarter. That's going to be right at almost $11 million, $10.9 million. And now have found what I looking for. I apologize for that delay. Relative to capital, what we have said we would do is we would add some additions to cost of capital in 2015 and at about 200,000 additional tons at Hunter and about 50,000 additional tons at Midlothian. And then what we spelled out an Analyst Day and beyond is that we thought we would come back in '16, and these are in our capital plans, by the way, and add an additional 140,000 tons at Hunter. Again, that's in San Antonio, which brings you -- if we're looking 2017 through the additional tonnage that we're looking to add, it would put us at capacity in Texas of 4.75 million tons. So there's your build."

So a lot of drivers were, frankly, engaged in what was called in the shale fields of the time. So what's happening now, as you've got more drivers available, but here's the other piece of it that's important and we went through this very carefully last October when we we're going through our planning cycle. Our 2 ready-mix businesses are in Colorado and Texas. And what we're hearing from both of those groups is, ""If we could get more trucks, then we would have the ability to come back and safely serve the market in the most efficient way that we could. And the short answer is, at this point, we think we're able to, one, put more trucks in in a thoughtful way. Number two, put drivers in those trucks; and three, be in a position both in the Rocky Mountains as well as in the Metroplex, and I think that's been to be the primary marketplace that delivery can be tight at times. So I do you think, from a capital perspective, with where we need to be. And I do think from a labor perspective, it's going to feel, in our world, much better in 2016 than we did in 2015, in large part if you just look at the rhythm and cadence of what has happened in those shale fields. Remember what we were talk about some of the earlier conversations about what it looked like last year Q1 in the shale fields and what it looks like this year. I think we'll really be able to meet that demand."

A few years ago, we had an asphalt business in Arkansas, which we no longer have. So that was sold about 1.5 years ago.

We did with asphalt in San Antonio exactly what we did with Cement in California. Somebody else was a better owner. It was not core to us in that marketplace. So we sold it. From a tonnage perspective, you're probably looking somewhere, let's call it, 700,000 tons a year. And so the single biggest piece of our asphalt business is in Denver. And to Denver, it is very much a core part of our business there. And the asphalt business does very well in Denver. And so we do see it as core in that marketplace because that's the way that market place is built up and down the Front Range. So people tend to be in aggregates.

Number one, and it's going to be highly efficient operation to get material to that part of the state for a long time. The other thing that it does, Craig, this is important. If you ever fly into San Antonio, you're going to fly right over our Beckmann Quarry. Beckmann, for several times over the last decade, has been the largest-producing quarry in the United States, and it's almost situated in Metro San Antonio. And here's something I think most people don't appreciate. San Antonio is actually is the second-largest city in Texas. Houston's largest. San Antonio is #2. San Antonio is larger than Dallas, and our aim was to make sure we were utilizing Beckmann Quarry, which is really a diamond, in the most efficient way for that quarry and to make sure we've got the quarry there for another 20-plus years. And we also were in a position to make sure that we could feed South Texas in the most efficient fashion and thus the move to Medina. So that's probably a little bit more than you were looking for, Craig. But again, the strength in the operations around it are important. What I can tell you is that plant opened on the day that we expect that plan to open. Railcars are going out of there on the day that we expected them to go.

With me today is Anne Lloyd, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. 
To facilitate today's discussion, we've made available during this webcast and on our website supplemental financial information, which we believe will be helpful. As detailed specifically on Slide 2, please remember that today's teleconference may include forward-looking statements as defined by securities laws in connection with future events or future operating and financial performance. Like other businesses, we're subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially. Except as legally required, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether resulting from new information, future developments or otherwise. We refer you to the legal disclaimers contained in our fourth quarter and full year earnings release and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which are available on both our own and the SEC websites. Also as a reminder, any margin references in our discussion are based on net sales and exclude freight and delivery revenue. These and other non-GAAP measures are also explained in our supplemental financial information, as well as on our website and in our SEC filings. 
Upon leveraging a full year of acquired TXI operations with our heritage business, 2015 enters the books as a record year. Specifically, we achieved record safety results, record net sales and profitability, expanded consolidated gross profit margin, exceeded incremental margin targets for the consolidated heritage business, exceeded acquisition synergy targets in both dollars and timeline, invested capital in our business, completed several bolt-on acquisitions and returned nearly $630 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. These impressive results we achieved with both tailwinds and headwinds. 
The tailwinds. 2015 construction markets experienced continued growth in private activity, led by housing as well as the emergence of enhanced public sector activity as best revealed by a 7% [ph] increase in highway construction. 
Nonetheless, we had a very significant headwind, as 2015 saw unprecedented amounts of precipitation in our core states of Texas, North Carolina, Iowa, Georgia and Colorado, disproportionately impacting second and fourth quarter performance. By some estimates and indeed our own calculation and internal plans, multiple sustained extraordinary weather events, combined with the downturn in energy sector shale development, likely cost us up to $200 million in sales for the year, masking the underlying strength of general construction. 
That underlying strength is revealed in the solid growth we see across our business with a marked acceleration of the construction recovery in key Southeastern markets, fueled by steady employment growth, continued private sector activity and expanded Department of Transportation programs. 
We thus enter 2016 with what we believe are very favorable market and operating tailwinds, building upon our team's record 2015 results. These past results and future opportunities are tied to our strict and steadfast attention to cost discipline, further underscoring the positive result of years of improving our operating efficiency. 
We're also specifically very proud of our 2015 record safety performance, a core foundational pillar of our company. We concluded 2015 with incident rates better than what had been 2014's then record results. Notably, we continue to see dramatic improvement in the safety numbers of the former TXI operations, further underscoring our successful operational and cultural integration. Safety is first at Martin Marietta. 
In December, we completed construction of our state-of-the-art Medina rock and rail quarry near San Antonio, Texas. Shipments from Medina are expected to replace rail shipments from our Beckmann Quarry as it transitions from a distance rail and truck-served quarry to wholly focusing on the local San Antonio marketplace. The Medina job was on time and on budget. The construction of this $160 million facility spanned 3 years, is the largest and most complex capital project in the company's history and is now the largest quarry on the Union Pacific Railroad's vast network. Medina began operation in January 2016, and we expect to ship nearly 6 million tons of aggregates this year. 
As highlighted in today's press release, we continue to execute against our strategic objective of securing and solidifying leading market 
[Audio Gap] 
near Colorado Springs. These 2 bolt-on transactions complement our position in Metro Denver and Northern Colorado, a position we originally acquired in 2011 with our river for the Rockies asset exchange, and provide attractive in leading positions along the Front Range of the Rocky Mountains, home to over 80% of Colorado's population. Following these recent transactions, we've added an estimated 1 billion tons of aggregates reserves. 
Strategically, 4 years ago, we had no Front Range position whatsoever. Today, we're marketplace leader, with nearly 100 years of high-quality construction aggregates in a region with near- and long-term favorable employment and demographic conditions. 
Turning to the fourth quarter performance. We established quarterly records for net sales and profitability, driven by strong pricing, disciplined execution of our strategic plan and steady growth in construction activity. Importantly, all segments in the aggregates business delivered

grew with a 630 basis point improvement, largely resulting from strong pricing and realized TXI synergies. As shown on Slide 7, through the end of 2015, we've realized approximately $100 million of our $120 million synergy target, reflected in both the acquired business and heritage West Group performance. We are on track to fully realize our $120 million synergy target by the end of this year. 
On a more granular basis, our 2015 record results were driven by strong pricing across our aggregates, aggregates-related and Cement businesses, as shown on Slide 8. Notably, the heritage aggregates product line delivered an increase of more than 7% in average selling price, while heritage ready-mix concrete prices increased nearly 10%. The acquired businesses, aggregates, ready-mix concrete and cement, saw a price increases of 13%, nearly 11% and 10%, respectively, in line with our stated objectives. For the year, heritage aggregates product line volume increased 2% and total aggregates product line volume increased 7%. This is again despite record or near-record occurring precipitation in 5 of our largest states. 
The Southeast and the Mid-America Groups led volume growth on the strength of recovery in Georgia, Florida and the Carolinas. The West Group, which was most affected by the adverse weather conditions, reported an increase in aggregates volume of 1.2%, excluding TXI-related divestitures, which affect comparability with the prior year. Aggregates volume growth for the year was notable in North Texas, but was somewhat offset by declines in direct shale energy aggregate shipments in South Texas. 
Volumes grew across all product lines with the exception of asphalt, where our Texas divestiture in the fourth quarter affected year-over-year comparability. Of note, asphalt margins expanded to 28% or just over 1,000 basis points, clearly reflecting improved profitability in our core Colorado asphalt business. 
Consolidated gross profit margin was 22% and expanded by 260 basis points for the year, led by margin expansion in all construction materials related segments. Gross profit for the heritage aggregates business increased $130 million over the prior year, with margins expanding 480 basis points to 23.8% of net sales. Incremental gross margin for the heritage aggregates business exceeded targeted objectives for both the fourth quarter and full year 2015. The incremental gross margin of 82% for the full year 2015 was led by growth in both the West Group and the Southeast Group, which achieved incremental gross margin of 100

The acquired businesses gross profit margin also expanded 300 basis points in 2015, led by acquired aggregates product line gross profit margin of nearly 27%, up from 4.6% for the comparable prior year period, reflecting synergy realization and underlying strength in both volume and pricing. 
Due to the September 2015 sale of our California Cement business, quarterly results for the Cement segments are not comparable to the prior year period. And in fact, comparability will be affected throughout 2016. Quarterly details for the Cement business can be found on Slide 9 for elimination of the California results. 
However, for the remaining Cement business has benefited from Martin Marietta's significant pricing improvement in 2015. Average selling prices increased 10%, aided partly by the expiration of legacy TXI Cement contracts at below-market pricing and the divestiture of the California business. For the year, the business generated $368 million in net sales and delivered a 28% gross profit margin, a 310 basis point improvement over the prior year. EBITDA for the business was $101 million, a $30 million increase. 
The Magnesia Specialties business was negatively affected by a slowdown in the steel industry in 2015. Steel capacity utilization was down from approximately 78% in 2014 to 71% in 2015. Full year net sales were $228 million, a decline of $9 million or 4% compared to the prior year. The Magnesia Specialty's team diligently managed the cost profile of the business during the year, and despite steel capacity utilization declines, delivered an impressive 35% gross profit margin. 
On a consolidated basis, 2015 delivered record net sales of $3.3 billion, an increase of $589 million or 22%; record gross profit of $722 million, an increase of $199 million or 38%; record net earnings of $289 million, an increase of 86%; and record adjusted EBITDA of $766.7 million, an increase of 30%. 
The significant improvement in net earnings, coupled with the absence of TXI-related costs, drove increase in operating cash flow in 2015 to $573 million compared with $382 million in 2014. Operating cash flow per share of $8.55 improved 8% when compared to adjusted 2014, which excludes the cash impact of TXI-related expenses. 
We invested $318 million of capital during the year, including $78 million related to the new Medina rock and rail quarry. For the year, we returned nearly $630 million to our shareholders through the combination of repurchasing 3.3 million shares of our common stock, together with our dividend. As a reminder, we have board authorization to repurchase up to 20 million shares. Finally, our ratio of consolidated net debt to consolidated EBITDA for the trailing 12 months ended December 2015 was 1.9x, in compliance with our leverage covenant and below our targeted leverage of 2x. 
In summary, 2015 was a remarkable year for Martin Marietta. And despite being tempered by extraordinary weather that cloaked our true earnings potential, our team is poised for an even stronger 2016. We are confident we have the foundation in place for improved growth, profitability and performance. 
We will now look to the future and discuss our 2016 outlook, which we highlight on Slides 11 through 13. Initially, you'll notice an improvement in our expected growth as compared to our very early thoughts provided in the third quarter 2015. Our 2016 outlook now reflects growing underlying demand and strong pricing across our entire geographic footprint. National employment growth, a stimulus for construction activity, remained robust throughout 2015, surpassing the prerecession peak by nearly 5 million jobs. These job gains, in addition to contractor backlogs, which is resulting from historic 2015 rainfall, should fuel growth and further recovery of the U.S. construction industry in 2016 and beyond. 
Public sector growth is expected to drive mid-single-digit volume increases in our infrastructure business, which accounted for 41% of our aggregates demand in 2015. The growth reflects continued state-level funding initiatives that are positively impacting several of our key states, including Texas, North Carolina, Iowa, Georgia and Florida. 
For example, in Texas, nearly $10 billion of Department of Transportation lettings are planned, up from $6.1 billion in 2015. Dallas-Fort Worth alone is the beneficiary of 4 major design-build projects aimed at mitigating that area's congestion and improving traffic flow. There's also significant and continuing infrastructure work in and around Houston. 
Additional evidence of state-level infrastructure investment tailwinds is revealed by recent project scheduling changes announced by the North Carolina Department of Transportation, or NCDOT. Specifically, after the passage last year of various new state funding initiatives, NCDOT announced an accelerated schedule for 90 highway projects. This example is consistent with our articulated expectations around state construction project backlogs. 
In addition to state-level initiatives, we now have the 5-year, $305 billion Fixing America's Surface Transportation, or FAST Act, enacted in December 2015 to provide states with the required funding certainty for the first time in nearly a decade to commit to a backlog of longer-term projects needed to improve and expand America's transportation network. We believe the FAST Act, along with state-level funding initiatives, will drive large, multiyear, aggregate-intensive construction projects. Further, it's also likely we will see meaningful projects in rural areas that had been infrastructure-starved during the last decade and will now be better able to develop new avenues for growth and commerce. 
Shipments to nonresidential construction projects, 32% of our 2015 demand, is expected to increase in both the heavy, industrial and light commercial sectors, leading to an increase in aggregates volume in the high single digits. The light nonresidential construction sector is primarily office and retail, with demand generally tied to employment growth and residential activity. Notably, the Dodge momentum index is near its highest level since 2009, signaling continued growth. 
Further, core Martin Marietta's states account for 5 of the top 10 and 9 of the top 20 in state-level employment growth, including Florida, Texas, Georgia, North Carolina, Ohio, Indiana, South Carolina, Virginia and Colorado. All positive catalysts for construction activity. 
The heavy nonresidential construction sector is primarily industrial building as well as energy and energy-related activity. We are currently supplying several large energy-related industrial and infrastructure projects along the Gulf Coast and expect our project backlog to grow, thus largely offsetting the declines in direct shale exploration activity. We believe direct shale activity reached a maintenance level in the fourth quarter of 2015 and should sustain at that level throughout 2016. Of course, results for the first and second quarters of last year reflected higher than maintenance level consumption and are expected to affect comparability to the first half 2016 results. 
The residential end-use market accounted for 17% of aggregate shipments in 2015 and increased 20% as compared to 2014. We expect a double-digit volume increase again in 2016, reflecting the continued steady recovery of residential investment as a result of positive employment gains, historically low mortgage rates, significant lot absorption and higher multifamily rental rates. New housing permit activity was up 12% in 2015, indicating further future gains in housing construction. Importantly, Texas, Florida, Colorado, Georgia and North Carolina each ranked in the top 10 states for housing starts. 
Finally, to conclude our discussion of 2015 end-use markets, the ChemRock/Rail market represented the remaining 10% of aggregates volume and is expected to remain relatively flat to modestly down in 2016. 
We'll now focus on Texas, where we continue to be encouraged by the resilience of the broader marketplace. In short, we anticipate increasing overall demand driven by solid population and employment growth. Construction activity in our larger-volume markets, principally being the vibrant corridor of Dallas, San Antonio, Austin is expected to grow throughout 2016 and beyond, led by multiyear infrastructure activity, a strong residential marketplace and solid nonresidential construction. 
South Texas, of course, has seen a decline in shale oilfield activity, thus reducing our direct shipments by

In late 2016 or early 2017, we'll open a new aggregates facility on Martin Marietta-owned property at the Hunter Cement plant northeast of San Antonio. This undertaking will allow us to transition from our leased and nearly depleted New Braunfels quarry only 10 miles away to a permanent location with over 400 million tons of quality aggregate materials, providing improved access to local markets. The Hunter aggregates quarry will be an additional synergy from the TXI acquisition that will benefit our company in 2017 and beyond. 
Our expectations for 2016 volume levels in Houston have moderated from 2015 levels, where we saw an 11% increase in aggregate shipments. We now expect aggregate volume in that marketplace to be broadly flat, with any potential upside being spurred by large infrastructure projects, and any downside being driven by a sharper deterioration in the Houston economy. That said, it's important to remember that our principal Texas markets are located in North and Central Texas and not materially impacted by Houston market conditions. 
The Portland Cement Association, or PCA, forecast modest demand growth in Texas in 2016 followed by stronger growth in 2017. We currently expect 2016 cement volume to increase 8% to 11%. We have previously announced a cement price increase to $12 per ton effective April 1, 2016. Based on the expected flow of shipments, we'll likely realize a year-over-year average selling price increase of approximately 9%. Both volume and price growth forecasts exclude the 2015 results of the divested California cement business. Profitability is forecast to increase by an estimated $30 million in 2016. 
On a consolidated basis, 2016 is expected to deliver record-setting results, including net sales ranging from $3.5 billion to $3.7 billion, expanded gross profit and expanded EBITDA. 
As we've consistently stated, our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. They are: Investing in aggregates-led acquisitions; organic capital investment to ensure safe, environmentally sound and highly efficient operations; and returning cash to shareholders in the form of a sustainable, meaningful dividend; and share repurchases under our existing authority. 
To conclude, we're optimistic and excited about 2016. We entered the year with an enhanced foundation for further growth, an outlook for improved business conditions across the vast majority of our markets, led by solid private sector construction activity and a newly reinvigorated public sector. Our team remains focused on the careful execution of our strategic plan, wholly committed to our core foundation of pillars and dedicated to delivering increased shareholder value.

And to be specific, that was an additional $700 million over 2 years. The other thing that North Carolina has that's pending that we'll see voted on later in the year is a $2 billion building bond proposal as well. So I think to answer your question very specifically, when our legislature came out with the additional $700 million, we did see the state implementation plan move forward 90 projects in -- up into the year. So we do anticipate seeing that. So yes, we're seeing activity that we believe will take aggregates volume later in the year. And clearly, with effectively doubling the Georgia budget, adding that additional $900 million to it, we will clearly see amped-up activity in Georgia. Remember, we were going to be benefited, too, by the T-SPLOST planning that was put in principally in South Georgia a couple of years ago. So now what we will see, I believe, is greater activity across the State of Georgia. But you're seeing the activity that we were seeing in South Georgia, increased activity in North Georgia, principally around Atlanta. And we know we'll see more activity in North Carolina as well. I think it's worth noting, Iowa did put in a $0.10 a gallon gas tax increase last year. Nebraska did as well. We're going to see the benefits of Prop 1 money in Texas. And we're seeing near-record lettings in Florida this year. So we're seeing new money in a number of states, and we think we see more money coming in a number of states, including states like Indiana, where Governor Pence has basically said he'd like to see another $1 billion put to infrastructure in that state. And we've got 12 different states right now seriously considering gas tax increases in addition to what Georgia and Iowa have passed. So that gives you a little bit of a feel of across the patch, Kathryn."

I think what we're seeing is increased contractor backlogs across our entire footprint. We have also seen the awarding of several large energy-related industrial contracts, particularly in -- along the Gulf Coast. I think what we were seeing in the fourth quarter, when it wasn't raining, the fourth quarter looked very powerful. I'll give you a sense of -- I've been in Texas 3 times over the last 1.5 months and I was down there for part of the holidays. And when I'm talking to contractors in that marketplace, literally the week of Christmas, when it was dry, they were saying they were having really record days even at that time of year, which I'll tell you is unusual, but it gives me a sense of what's out there. And the other point I think goes back to the very beginning of the conversation that we had, and that's just simply more accelerated infrastructure activity in our key states. So we're looking at those $10.1 billion worth of activity potentially in Texas, more in North Carolina, more in Iowa and more in Colorado. And remember what we said about Colorado. The primary thing that was keeping us from doing more in Colorado is we needed more business in Colorado. And now what we've been able to effectively do is extend our march down the Front Range into the southern part of that as well. So I think all of those together has put us in a position that we feel considerably good about the way 2016 is shaping up. I think as we go back to the second part of your question, that is relative to Cement, I think several things are going to happen. One, Cement was badly affected last year by the rain. I mean, it's hard to run a cement business, which is a 24/7, 365 business, if you need to take it down more than you would wish. And keep in mind, our aim was to be a price leader in that state. And our view was we would rather take those kilns down rather than keep the kiln going and do something that we felt like was going to be foolish relative to the selling price in that marketplace. In large part, we believe we're going to have greater efficiencies in Cement this year, but we also think we're going to see better pricing in Cement this year. You saw a little bit of share movement in our business in Cement. And the fact is, we were willing to see that share movement move because that was really driven by 2 distinct players in the marketplace. Holcim had brought on a kiln, again, that they had idled for a while at Midlothian and they were coming back into the marketplace. And Argos, as we discussed, was bringing in some material into South Texas. We believe as we go into the year that everybody is likely to be relatively full. We believe we're going to be efficient. We believe we're going to be successful on our price increases. And we think by the time we put all of that in place, we're looking at very nice improvement in the Cement business. And by the way, we're looking for a very nice improvement in the ready-mix business as well. I think those are your principal drivers in Texas."

But I think equally, when you come back and consider the significant state initiatives. And again, we saw initiatives coming out of North Carolina late in the year. We're seeing a big Texas number. We're seeing that gas tax increase pull through in ways that we're excited about in Iowa. Again, another record -- near-record letting year coming up in Florida. I think all of that helps on the infrastructure side, in particular. I think if we go to nonres, I mean, here's what -- here's a statistic that's striking to me. Think of it in these terms. Shale volumes were down 1.1 million tons in the quarter, as you heard me say in the telecon, but net South Texas shipments actually increased, and they increased by large infrastructure and large manufacturing projects. And part of what we're seeing in -- on the nonres side is an awfully nice surge in non-building. So I encourage you go and take a look at what's going on in other non-building. Again, power plants, gas, communications, those types are really very aggregate-intensive jobs. Non-building, looking at the trailing 12 months through November, was up 19%. And a lot of that activity is concentrated in the Gulf. So again, if we're coming back and seeing what we feel like are really, really attractive DOT projects and awfully nice nonres projects, that helps. The other piece of it, candidly, we saw a lot of projects awarded in the fourth quarter. And one of the things that I'd like to see is at certain levels, it's probably frustrating to our division presidents, but we have signed delegations from here to know exactly what they're bidding on. It's not that we don't trust what they're doing, we just like to see the sheer level of that activity. And we saw a lot of that activity in Q4."

In Q2, to shale, we sold about 1 million. In Q3, to shale, about 830,000. And in Q4, to shale, about 521,000. Remember, in my prepared comments, I said I thought we were getting to maintenance levels. We view that 500,000 tons a quarter as a maintenance level. And that goes back in part to the comment that I think I was sharing with Adam before when I said, ""Look, we saw shale volumes down 1.1 million tons in the quarter, but South Texas shipments actually up."" So if you go to the one part of the country that would have felt more acutely the downturn in shale than anybody else, and you brush it away, and you say, ""But their volumes were up,"" that gives you a good sense of what's happening on that lighter side of it, Todd, and then back to that non-building piece of it as well. So the resilience that we're seeing there across our marketplace is pretty comforting to us right now. And we're liking what we're seeing. Does that help?"

And frankly, there was some stone deferral, not to the same degree that we did in -- that we saw in Texas, but we certainly saw some in the Carolinas. We mentioned the fact that we've got a quarry outside Columbia that had several billion gallons of water in it.

And as it stabilizes, I think part of what's going to happen is the imports, in particular, that were coming into South Texas that Argos is bringing in will suddenly start to be utilized for their own self-supply. And I think the heavy rain in that state last year and their inability to utilize it wholly for self-supply and going into marketplace differently was part of what we were seeing relative to the volumes and to the share loss, if that helps, Ted."

Here's an important note for us to consider because we haven't had a recent talk to you about this in the past, but actually in November, voters in Colorado Springs actually put in a sales and use tax increase of 0.62% to fund road repair and maintenance in that part of the state. We believe that's going to generate about $250 million over 5 years just in Southern Colorado. So when we come back with what we feel like will be about net sales of that business of about $90 million this year, EBITDA margins at probably 17% to 20%, which is below where we would like to see it, it's actually better than the business that we bought in the Rocky Mountains when we acquired it. And we brought it up. With that very capable team that we have in Denver, I don't have any doubt that we will see those percentages move up nicely and move up, I think, in trajectory in a much more quick time frame than they did for us originally in Denver, which, by the way, I don't think anyone ever complained about.

Are we seeing that and can I go to specific markets and call it out as instances where I'm concerned about it? Not really at all. I think the other practical matter is twofold. One, people are having a hard time getting drivers in the marketplace, just finding them. And then number two, actually paying for them on the wages that they're looking for. So I think you've got an industry issue relative to aggregates that I think makes taking cheaper diesel and hauling stone farther a bit of an anathema.

One, if we're looking at where the American Iron and Steel Institute is right now relative to their forecast, they're basically seeing steel at a 70% utilization rate. And if you recall going back over time, that's been the point that we said was really an important for this business. So if we're 70% or more, the business is going to do quite well. The other input that's important to remember is we are going to end up having a decent amount of usage of natural gas in that business. If we look at what net gas did last year for the year, it's 28% lower. Even if we look for the quarter, it was about 26% lower. So again, if we're going into the year and the Steel Institute is right at 70%, that's hitting a magic number. If the input on gas is going to continue to be low, that's helpful. To the extent that, that business comes under pressure, the thing that I will tell you, too, is there's no team that we have in this company that's better at managing costs and managing their cost profile than our Magnesia Specialties business. So when I go back to our Q4 and look at a 35% margin, even if that business came under some degree of duress. And again, I'm not thinking that it will. But even if it did, I think you're looking at a business that's still going to have a margin in the low 30s. And from where I'm sitting, if we've got a low 30 margin, I'll take it every day."

Q1 is either made or broken the last 2 weeks of March in most instances. Because you've got to have relatively warm weather to put down hot mix in most markets. The other thing to remember, and we tried to outline it pretty clearly in the telecon, we are going to have that shale headwind, at least in the Southwest, throughout the first half of the year. But I think that clearly goes away once we're through with the first half. That said -- and here's a good way to think of it. If you want to look at the midpoint of our guidance, what you're really saying is you're going to have aggregate volume at the midpoint at about 166 million tons. I mean, that's my quick math. If we want to say there was whether deferral of, call it, 3.5 million, 4 million tons, and then you've got the shale maintenance level that could take it down another 1.5 million tons, I mean, it rain in that first half. And then the other component that we're managing through, and we'll manage through it, it'll be just fine, it's that transition from New Braunfels to Hunter. And any time you do a shift like that, it's never going to be a perfect handoff. There's going to be a little bit of shuffling that goes on because you're going from one large quarry to another large quarry. So as I look at that and start tallying it all up, yes, I could see 2016 ag volume at that 7% end of our range, in 167 million tons. And could you see some of that go in Q1? You could, but you do have that shale play that I would just encourage you to be mindful of during the first half of the year. So if you think about it, Trey, last year Q1 was pretty good quarter. Q2 was a rainy mess. Q3 was relatively normal weather. And I think the performance we saw in Q3 was what you'd expect. And then Q4, we went back to building the ark. So the fact is if we end up with a good Q1 and normal weather, I think we'd be very, very pleased with that, given what would be just the optical headwind on that portion of shale. Does that help?"

I think the other piece of it is, part of what we're seeing on some contracts now that are coming in, in that South Texas area, we talked about those large projects, like Cheniere and others. So the fact is we'll see what we feel like is a good bit of that going this year as well. I think just better cost, better efficiency. I mean, here's an interesting anecdote for you, Trey. I mean, at some point late in the fourth quarter, we actually got a call here in the corporate office. And we got a call from this poor guy who's trying to build a hotel and get concrete poured because he's opening the doors the next week and he couldn't get concrete poured. And here's why he couldn't get concrete poured, because the 4 other times we had been ready to deliver concrete to the site, he couldn't take it because the site was so wet. That's the type of backlog and back-build that we see in that business.

I think we're seeing more approaches, and we're having more approaches than -- to others than we've seen in a while. I would expect that to persist. And I think the notion of private companies seeing, hey, I've got a 5-year highway bill, it looks more aggregate-intensive. This is probably not a bad place for us to ask somebody to jump off on a modeling tour. In their minds, it's probably not a bad place to be. I mean, part of what I liked about the deals that we've just done is we were able to do those within EBITDA multiple ranges that make a lot of sense for our business. I mean, we're picking up hard rock reserves at the end of the day for what we feel like could be tonnage prices, at times, for sand and gravel-type reserves. You shouldn't expect us to be looking at M&A in marketplaces that really are outside of where we are, unless we have the ability to go into a new marketplace either as a leader or with what we feel like is a clear, executable plan to be a leader. And what I would always draw you back to is what we did in Colorado in 2011. We went into that market with a swap that we did with Lafarge, with the other transaction that we did literally back-to-back and put ourselves overnight in a leadership position and really have extended that march with this latest transaction. But going into an attractive market and being a onesie-twosie in it and really not having a good way to become a leader in that marketplace is -- it is not consistent with our strategy.

And obviously, in pricing anywhere on the low end, from $0.50 a ton to the middle range of about $1 a ton to some places, $1.50 a ton or more in some instances, I think one of the best examples that I can give you, if you go back to when we did our acquisition of TXI, part of what we said was TXI's pricing was roughly 60% of our corporate average, and we said we thought it'd probably take about 3 years to get that closer to our corporate average, mindful that our corporate average continues to move up during that same period of time. Right now, TXI is about 75% of our corporate average. So again, from a rhythm and cadence perspective, that's certainly what we're seeing. Would I expect us to come back and talk about midyear price increases again this year? The short answer is I would. If we're seeing the types of volume increases and the more infrastructure-type work, honestly, I think you could find yourself in a position toward the latter part of '16, certainly in '17, that in some markets, you could be short on some products. That was exactly what happened last year, principally because of flooding in North Texas with respect to sand, in particular. So again, I think the rhythm of it will be you'll see most prices into effect in January 1, in some places, you're going to see some pricing that won't go into effect until March or April. The long and short answer is that doesn't so much matter because there's not a lot of volume going on in Q1 anyway. And we will come back at some point later in the year and talk to you more about midyear price increases, but I think customers should expect those conversations."

And I guess with all the rainy weather, it really kind of wasn't much of an issue. But was curious if you had any insight into how that situation has developed. Has it improved, do you sense? Because I assume that part of the 3.5 million, 4 million catch-up or deferment in 1Q would sort of presume that you're going to be able to see some of those labor constraints not return or intensify. So if you could just talk a little bit about what you're seeing there on the labor side."

I mean, if you go back, particularly in Texas, and then look at what is going on in that marketplace, a lot of it would tie back into what we talked about earlier, and that is simply what's going on with drivers, or what's not going on with drivers.",319,"Sure. I mean, if you go back, particularly in Texas, and then look at what is going on in that marketplace, a lot of it would tie back into what we talked about earlier, and that is simply what's going on with drivers, or what's not going on with drivers. So a lot of drivers were, frankly, engaged in what was going on in the shale fields at the time. So what's happening now is you've got more drivers who are available. But here's the other piece of it that's important, and we went through this very carefully last October when we were going to our planning cycle. Our 2 ready-mix businesses are in Colorado and Texas. And what we were hearing from both of those groups is, ""If we could get more trucks, then we would have the ability to come back and safely serve the market in the most efficient way that we could. And the short answer is, at this point, we think we're able to: One, put more trucks in, in a thoughtful way; number two, put drivers in those trucks; and three, be in a position both in the Rocky Mountains as well as in the Metroplex, and I think that's going to be the primary marketplace that delivery can be tight at times. So I do think from a capital perspective, we're where we need to be. And I do think from a labor perspective, it's going to feel, in our world, much better in 2016 than it did in 2015, in large part if you just look at the rhythm and cadence of what has happened in those shale fields. Remember what we were talking about in some of the earlier conversations about what it looked like last year, Q1 in the shale fields, and what it looks like this year. And I think we'll really be able to meet that demand."

So if we look at Texas more specifically, to your question, Texas ranked #4 in housing permit activity. Dallas-Fort Worth, which is our single largest market in Texas, is ranking second in housing permits. And to us, that continues to indicate good future strength in that market. There other thing that's remarkable to look at, if you look at residential units in 2015 in Dallas, what I'm seeing is data that reveals there's about 43,000 unit starts. If you look at Houston-Sugar Land, there's around 51,000 starts. You put those 2 together, that's almost 10% of the total starts in the United States.

A few years ago, we had an asphalt business in Arkansas, which we no longer have. So that was sold about 1.5 years ago. Number two, what we did sell was basically an FOB asphalt business that was in San Antonio. Here's the quick answer in that. We weren't the best owner of it. We did with asphalt in San Antonio exactly what we did with Cement in California. Somebody else was a better owner. It was not core to us in that marketplace. So we sold it. From a tonnage perspective, you're probably looking somewhere, let's call it, 700,000 tons a year. And so the single biggest piece of our asphalt business is in Denver. And to Denver, it is very much a core part of our business there. And the asphalt business does very well in Denver. And so we do see it as core in that marketplace because that's the way that marketplace is built up and down the Front Range. So people tend to be in aggregates, they tend to be in ready-mix, and they tend to be in hot mix. So we don't see a changing in that part of the world.

The primary issue that you've got there is that's going to be an area of the state that's going to be starved for DOT specification stone. So number one, it's going to be highly efficient operation to get material to that part of the state for a long time. The other thing that it does, Craig, and this is important. If you ever fly into San Antonio, you're going to fly right over our Beckmann Quarry. Beckmann, for several times over the last decade, has been the largest-producing quarry in the United States, and it's almost situated in Metro San Antonio. And here's something I think most people don't appreciate. San Antonio is actually is the second-largest city in Texas. Houston's largest, San Antonio is #2. San Antonio is larger than Dallas, and our aim was to make sure we were utilizing Beckmann Quarry, which is really a diamond, in the most efficient way for that quarry, and to make sure we've got that quarry there for another 20-plus years. And we also were in a position to make sure that we could feed South Texas in the most efficient fashion, and thus the move to Medina. So that's probably a little bit more than you were looking for, Craig. But again, the strategy and the operations around it are important. What I can tell you is that plant opened on the day that we expected that plant to open. Railcars are going out of there on the day that we expected them to go.

Upon leveraging a full year of acquired TXI operations with our heritage business, 2015 enters the books as a record year. Specifically, we achieved record safety results, record net sales and profitability, expanded consolidated gross profit margin, exceeded incremental margin targets for the consolidated heritage business, exceeded acquisition synergy targets in both dollars and timeline, invested capital in our business, completed several bolt-on acquisitions and returned nearly $630 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. These impressive results were achieved with both tailwinds and headwinds. 
The tailwinds: 2015 construction markets experienced continued growth in private activity, led by housing as well as the emergence of enhanced public sector activity, as best revealed by a 7% [ph] increase in highway construction. 
Nonetheless, we had a very significant headwind, as 2015 saw unprecedented amounts of precipitation in our core states of Texas, North Carolina, Iowa, Georgia and Colorado, disproportionately impacting second and fourth quarter performance. By some estimates and indeed our own calculation and internal plans, multiple sustained extraordinary weather events, combined with the downturn in energy sector shale development, likely cost us up to $200 million in sales for the year, masking the underlying strength of general construction. 
That underlying strength is revealed in the solid growth we see across our business with a marked acceleration of the construction recovery in key Southeastern markets, fueled by steady employment growth, continued private sector activity and expanded Department of Transportation programs. 
We thus entered 2016 with what we believe are very favorable market and operating tailwinds, building upon our team's record 2015 results. These past results and future opportunities are tied to our strict and steadfast attention to cost discipline, further underscoring the positive result of years of improving our operating efficiency. 
We're also specifically very proud of our 2015 record safety performance, a core foundational pillar of our company. We concluded 2015 with incident rates better than what had been 2014's then record results. Notably, we continue to see dramatic improvement in the safety numbers of the former TXI operations, further underscoring our successful operational and cultural integration. Safety is first at Martin Marietta. 
In December, we completed construction of our state-of-the-art Medina Rock & Rail Quarry near San Antonio, Texas. Shipments from Medina are expected to replace rail shipments from our Beckmann Quarry as it transitions from a distance rail and truck-served quarry to wholly focusing on the local San Antonio marketplace. The Medina job was on time and on budget. The construction of this $160 million facility spanned 3 years, is the largest and most complex capital project in the company's history and is now the largest quarry on the Union Pacific Railroad's vast network. Medina began operation in January 2016, and we expect to ship nearly 6 million tons of aggregates this year. 
As highlighted in today's press release, we continue to execute against our strategic objective of securing and solidifying leading market 
[Audio Gap] 
near Colorado Springs. These 2 bolt-on transactions complement our position in metro Denver and Northern Colorado, a position we originally acquired in 2011 with our River for the Rockies asset exchange, and provide attractive and leading positions along the Front Range of the Rocky Mountains, home to over 80% of Colorado's population. Following these recent transactions, we've added an estimated 1 billion tons of aggregate reserves. 
Strategically, 4 years ago we had no Front Range position whatsoever. Today, we're a marketplace leader, with nearly 100 years of high-quality construction aggregates in a region with near- and long-term favorable employment and demographic conditions. 
Turning to the fourth quarter performance. We established quarterly records for net sales and profitability, driven by strong pricing, disciplined execution of our strategic plan and steady growth in construction activity. Importantly, all segments in the aggregates business delivered
[Audio Gap]
was led by the West Group, with a 630 basis point improvement, largely resulting from strong pricing and realized TXI synergies. As shown on Slide 7, through the end of 2015 we've realized approximately $100 million of our $120 million synergy target, reflected in both the acquired business and Heritage West Group performance. We are on track to fully realize our $120 million synergy target by the end of this year. 
On a more granular basis, our 2015 record results were driven by strong pricing across our aggregates, aggregates-related and cement businesses, as shown on Slide 8. Notably, the heritage aggregates product line delivered an increase of more than 7% in average selling price, while heritage ready-mix concrete prices increased nearly 10%. The acquired businesses, aggregates, ready-mix concrete and cement, saw price increases of 13%, nearly 11% and 10%, respectively, in line with our stated objectives. For the year, heritage aggregates product line volume increased 2% and total aggregates product line volume increased 7%. This is again despite record or near-record recurring precipitation in 5 of our largest states. 
The Southeast and the Mid-America Groups led volume growth on the strength of recovery in Georgia, Florida and the Carolinas. The West Group, which was most affected by the adverse weather conditions, reported an increase in aggregates volume of 1.2%, excluding TXI-related divestitures, which affect comparability with the prior year. Aggregates volume growth for the year was notable in North Texas but was somewhat offset by declines in direct shale energy aggregate shipments in South Texas. 
Volumes grew across all product lines with the exception of asphalt, where our Texas divestiture in the fourth quarter affected year-over-year comparability. Of note, asphalt margins expanded to 28% or just over 1,000 basis points, clearly reflecting improved profitability in our core Colorado asphalt business. 
Consolidated gross profit margin was 22% and expanded by 260 basis points for the year, led by margin expansion in all construction materials related segments. Gross profit for the heritage aggregates business increased $130 million over the prior year, with margins expanding 480 basis points to 23.8% of net sales. Incremental gross margin for the heritage aggregates business exceeded targeted objectives for both the fourth quarter and full year 2015. The incremental gross margin of 82% for the full year 2015 was led by growth in both the West Group and the Southeast Group, which achieved incremental gross margin of 100
[Audio Gap]
weather headwinds. 
The acquired businesses gross profit margin also expanded 300 basis points in 2015, led by acquired aggregates product line gross profit margin of nearly 27%, up from 4.6% for the comparable prior year period, reflecting synergy realization and underlying strength in both volume and pricing. 
Due to the September 2015 sale of our California cement business, quarterly results for the cement segments are not comparable to the prior year period. And in fact, comparability will be affected throughout 2016. Quarterly details for the cement business can be found on Slide 9 for elimination of the California results. 
However, the remaining cement business has benefited from Martin Marietta's significant pricing improvement in 2015. Average selling prices increased 10%, aided partly by the expiration of legacy TXI cement contracts at below-market pricing and the divestiture of the California business. For the year, the business generated $368 million in net sales and delivered a 28% gross profit margin, a 310 basis point improvement over the prior year. EBITDA for the business was $101 million, a $30 million increase. 
The Magnesia Specialties business was negatively affected by a slowdown in the steel industry in 2015. Steel capacity utilization was down from approximately 78% in 2014 to 71% in 2015. Full year net sales were $228 million, a decline of $9 million or 4% compared to the prior year. The Magnesia Specialties team diligently managed the cost profile of the business during the year and, despite steel capacity utilization declines, delivered an impressive 35% gross profit margin. 
On a consolidated basis, 2015 delivered record net sales of $3.3 billion, an increase of $589 million or 22%; record gross profit of $722 million, an increase of $199 million or 38%; record net earnings of $289 million, an increase of 86%; and record adjusted EBITDA of $766.7 million, an increase of 30%. 
The significant improvement in net earnings, coupled with the absence of TXI-related costs, drove an increase in operating cash flow in 2015 to $573 million compared with $382 million in 2014. Operating cash flow per share of $8.55 improved 8% when compared to adjusted 2014, which excludes the cash impact of TXI-related expenses. 
We invested $318 million of capital during the year, including $78 [ph] million related to the new Medina Rock & Rail Quarry. For the year, we returned nearly $630 million to our shareholders through the combination of repurchasing 3.3 million shares of our common stock, together with our dividend. As a reminder, we have board authorization to repurchase up to 20 million shares. 
Finally, our ratio of consolidated net debt to consolidated EBITDA for the trailing 12 months ended December 2015 was 1.9x, in compliance with our leverage covenant and below our targeted leverage of 2x. 
In summary, 2015 was a remarkable year for Martin Marietta. And despite being tempered by extraordinary weather that cloaked our true earnings potential, our team is poised for an even stronger 2016. We are confident we have the foundation in place for improved growth, profitability and performance. 
We will now look to the future and discuss our 2016 outlook, which we highlight on Slides 11 through 13. Initially, you'll notice an improvement in our expected growth as compared to our very early thoughts provided in the third quarter of 2015. Our 2016 outlook now reflects growing underlying demand and strong pricing across our entire geographic footprint. National employment growth, a stimulus for construction activity, remained robust throughout 2015, surpassing the prerecession peak by nearly 5 million jobs. These job gains, in addition to contractor backlogs, which is resulting from historic 2015 rainfall, should fuel growth and further recovery of the U.S. construction industry in 2016 and beyond. 
Public sector growth is expected to drive mid-single-digit volume increases in our infrastructure business, which accounted for 41% of our aggregates demand in 2015. The growth reflects continued state-level funding initiatives that are positively impacting several of our key states, including Texas, North Carolina, Iowa, Georgia and Florida. 
For example, in Texas nearly $10 billion of Department of Transportation lettings are planned, up from $6.1 billion in 2015. Dallas-Fort Worth alone is the beneficiary of 4 major design-build projects aimed at mitigating that area's congestion and improving traffic flow. There's also significant and continuing infrastructure work in and around Houston. 
Additional evidence of state-level infrastructure investment tailwinds is revealed by recent project scheduling changes announced by the North Carolina Department of Transportation, or NCDOT. Specifically, after the passage last year of various new state funding initiatives, NCDOT announced an accelerated schedule for 90 highway projects. This example is consistent with our articulated expectations around state construction project backlogs. 
In addition to state-level initiatives, we now have the 5-year, $305 billion Fixing America's Surface Transportation, or FAST Act, enacted in December 2015 to provide states with the required funding certainty for the first time in nearly a decade to commit to a backlog of longer-term projects needed to improve and expand America's transportation network. We believe the FAST Act, along with state-level funding initiatives, will drive large, multiyear, aggregate-intensive construction projects. Further, it's also likely we will see meaningful projects in rural areas that had been infrastructure-starved during the last decade and will now be better able to develop new avenues for growth and commerce. 
Shipments to nonresidential construction projects, 32% of our 2015 demand, is expected to increase in both the heavy, industrial and light commercial sectors, leading to an increase in aggregates volume in the high single digits. The light nonresidential construction sector is primarily office and retail, with demand generally tied to employment growth and residential activity. Notably, the Dodge momentum index is near its highest level since 2009, signaling continued growth. 
Further, core Martin Marietta states account for 5 of the top 10 and 9 of the top 20 in state-level employment growth, including Florida, Texas, Georgia, North Carolina, Ohio, Indiana, South Carolina, Virginia and Colorado, all positive catalysts for construction activity. 
The heavy nonresidential construction sector is primarily industrial building as well as energy and energy-related activity. We are currently supplying several large energy-related industrial and infrastructure projects along the Gulf Coast and expect our project backlog to grow, thus largely offsetting the declines in direct shale exploration activity. We believe direct shale activity reached a maintenance level in the fourth quarter of 2015 and should sustain at that level throughout 2016. Of course, results for the first and second quarters of last year reflected higher than maintenance level consumption and are expected to affect comparability to the first half 2016 results. 
The residential end-use market accounted for 17% of aggregate shipments in 2015 and increased 20% as compared to 2014. We expect a double-digit volume increase again in 2016, reflecting the continued steady recovery of residential investment as a result of positive employment gains, historically low mortgage rates, significant lot absorption and higher multifamily rental rates. New housing permit activity was up 12% in 2015, indicating further future gains in housing construction. Importantly, Texas, Florida, Colorado, Georgia and North Carolina each ranked in the top 10 states for housing starts. 
Finally, to conclude our discussion of 2015 end-use markets, the ChemRock/Rail market represented the remaining 10% of aggregates volume and is expected to remain relatively flat to modestly down in 2016. 
We'll now focus on Texas, where we continue to be encouraged by the resilience of the broader marketplace. In short, we anticipate increasing overall demand driven by solid population and employment growth. Construction activity in our larger-volume markets, principally being the vibrant corridor of Dallas, San Antonio, Austin, is expected to grow throughout 2016 and beyond, led by multiyear infrastructure activity, a strong residential marketplace and solid nonresidential construction. 
South Texas, of course, has seen a decline in shale oilfield activity, thus reducing our direct shipments by

road repair work.
In late 2016 or early 2017, we'll open a new aggregates facility on Martin Marietta-owned property at the Hunter cement plant northeast of San Antonio. This undertaking will allow us to transition from our leased and nearly depleted New Braunfels Quarry only 10 miles away to a permanent location with over 400 million tons of quality aggregate materials providing improved access to local markets. The Hunter aggregates quarry will be an additional synergy from the TXI acquisition that will benefit our company in 2017 and beyond. 
Our expectations for 2016 volume levels in Houston have moderated from 2015 levels, where we saw an 11% increase in aggregate shipments. We now expect aggregate volume in that marketplace to be broadly flat, with any potential upside being spurred by large infrastructure projects and any downside being driven by a sharper deterioration in the Houston economy. 
That said, it's important to remember that our principal Texas markets are located in North and Central Texas and not materially impacted by Houston market conditions. 
The Portland Cement Association, or PCA, forecasts modest demand growth in Texas in 2016 followed by stronger growth in 2017. We currently expect 2016 cement volume to increase 8% to 11%. We have previously announced a cement price increase to $12 per ton effective April 1, 2016. Based on the expected flow of shipments, we'll likely realize a year-over-year average selling price increase of approximately 9%. Both volume and price growth forecasts exclude the 2015 results of the divested California cement business. Profitability is forecast to increase by an estimated $30 million in 2016. 
On a consolidated basis, 2016 is expected to deliver record-setting results, including net sales ranging from $3.5 billion to $3.7 billion, expanded gross profit and expanded EBITDA. 
As we've consistently stated, our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. They are: Investing in aggregates-led acquisitions; organic capital investment to ensure safe, environmentally sound and highly efficient operations; returning cash to shareholders in the form of a sustainable, meaningful dividend; and share repurchases under our existing authority. 
To conclude, we're optimistic and excited about 2016. We entered the year with an enhanced foundation for further growth, an outlook for improved business conditions across the vast majority of our markets, led by solid private sector construction activity and a newly reinvigorated public sector. Our team remains focused on the careful execution of our strategic plan, wholly committed to our core foundational pillars and dedicated to delivering increased shareholder value.

And to be specific, that was an additional $700 million over 2 years. The other thing that North Carolina has that's pending that we'll see voted on later in the year is a $2 billion building bond proposal as well. 
So I think to answer your question very specifically, when our legislature came out with the additional $700 million, we did see the state implementation plan move forward 90 projects in -- up into the year. So we do anticipate seeing that. So yes, we're seeing activity that we believe will take aggregates volume later in the year. 
And clearly, with effectively doubling the Georgia budget, adding that additional $900 million to it, we will clearly see amped-up activity in Georgia. Remember, we were going to be benefited, too, by the T-SPLOST planning that was put in principally in South Georgia a couple years ago. So now what we will see, I believe, is greater activity across the State of Georgia, buttressing the activity that we were seeing in South Georgia; increased activity in North Georgia, principally around Atlanta; and we know we'll see more activity in North Carolina as well. 
I think it's worth noting, Iowa did put in a $0.10 a gallon gas tax increase last year. Nebraska did as well. We're going to see the benefits of Prop 1 money in Texas. And we're seeing near-record lettings in Florida this year. So we're seeing new money in a number of states, and we think we see more money coming in a number of states, including states like Indiana, where Governor Pence has basically said he'd like to see another $1 billion put to infrastructure in that state. And we've got 12 different states right now seriously considering gas tax increases in addition to what Georgia and Iowa have passed. So that gives you a little bit of a feel across the patch, Kathryn."

And I think you and I have both have the sense that the more that we're building new lanes, the more that we're building new highways or new roads, and the more these rural parts of the state are looking to add capacity and open up new lanes and corridors for business, that's awfully powerful to our business and I think very, very much aggregate-intensive.

I think what we're seeing is increased contractor backlogs across our entire footprint. We have also seen the awarding of several large energy-related industrial contracts, particularly in -- along the Gulf Coast. I think what we were seeing in the fourth quarter, when it wasn't raining, the fourth quarter looked very powerful. I'll give you a sense of -- I've been in Texas 3 times over the last 1.5 months and I was down there for part of the holidays. And when I'm talking to contractors in that marketplace, literally the week of Christmas, when it was dry, they were saying they were having really record days even at that time of year, which I'll tell you is unusual, but it gives me a sense of what's out there. 
And the other point I think goes back to the very beginning of the conversation that we had, and that's just simply more accelerated infrastructure activity in our key states. So we're looking at those $10.1 billion worth of activity potentially in Texas, more in North Carolina, more in Iowa and more in Colorado. 
And remember what we said about Colorado. The primary thing that was keeping us from doing more in Colorado is we needed more business in Colorado. And now what we've been able to effectively do is extend our march down the Front Range into the southern part of that as well. So I think all of those together has put us in a position that we feel considerably good about the way 2016 is shaping up. 
I think, as we go back to the second part of your question, that is, relative to cement, I think several things are going to happen. One, cement was badly affected last year by the rain. I mean, it's hard to run a cement business, which is a 24/7, 365 business, if you need to take it down more than you would wish. And keep in mind, our aim is to be a price leader in that state. And our view was we would rather take those kilns down rather than keep the kiln going and do something that we felt like was going to be foolish relative to the selling price in that marketplace. 
In large part we believe we're going to have greater efficiencies in cement this year, but we also think we're going to see better pricing in cement this year. You saw a little bit of share movement in our business in cement. And the fact is, we were willing to see that share movement move because that was really driven by 2 distinct players in the marketplace. Holcim had brought on a kiln, again, that they had idled for a while at Midlothian and they were coming back into the marketplace. And Argos, as we discussed, was bringing in some material into South Texas. 
We believe as we go into the year that everybody is likely to be relatively full. We believe we're going to be efficient. We believe we're going to be successful on our price increases. And we think by the time we put all of that in place we're looking at very nice improvement in the cement business. And by the way, we're looking for a very nice improvement in the ready-mix business as well. I think those are your principal drivers in Texas."

And to answer your question specifically, I think we're going to see the Eastern United States, on a percentage basis, growing in ways that we haven't seen over the last several years. That's certainly the indications that we're getting on activity in Georgia and in Florida and in South Carolina and in North Carolina. And I think the quick answer is, Adam, if we see those areas of the country growing the way that we believe that they will, I'll just say this much: the incremental margins will be a nice story again."

I don't know how much of that is going to fit in the early part of '16, but I think you might see some of that actually coming through the back end of '16, which would be earlier than you would typically see. But I think equally, when you come back and consider the significant state initiatives. And again, we saw initiatives coming out of North Carolina late in the year. We're seeing a big Texas number. We're seeing that gas tax increase pull through in ways that we're excited about in Iowa. Again, another record -- near-record letting year coming up in Florida. I think all of that helps on the infrastructure side of it in particular. 
I think if we go to nonres, I mean, here's what -- here's a statistic that's striking to me. Think of it in these terms. Shale volumes were down 1.1 million tons in the quarter, as you heard me say in the telecon, but net South Texas shipments actually increased, and they increased by large infrastructure and large manufacturing projects. And part of what we're seeing in -- on the nonres side is an awfully nice surge in non-building. So I would encourage you to go and take a look at what's going on in other non-building. Again, power plants, gas, communications, those types are really very aggregate-intensive jobs. 
Nonbuilding, looking at the trailing 12 months through November, was up 19%. And a lot of that activity is concentrated in the Gulf. So again, if we're coming back and seeing what we feel like are really, really attractive DOT projects and awfully nice nonres projects, that helps. 
The other piece of it, candidly, we saw a lot of projects awarded in the fourth quarter. And one of the things that I'd like to see is, at certain levels it's probably frustrating to our division presidents, but we have to sign delegations from here to know exactly what they're bidding on. It's not that we don't trust what they're doing; we just like to see the sheer level of that activity. And we saw a lot of that activity in Q4."

I mean, that's really your show on what was going on, on the heavy side. I mean, to give you sense of it, to walk through the quarters, in Q1 to shale we sold about 1.2 million tons. In Q2 to shale we sold about 1 million. In Q3 to shale, about 830,000. And in Q4 to shale, about 521,000. 
Remember in my prepared comments I said I thought we were getting to maintenance levels? We view that 500,000 tons a quarter as a maintenance level. And that goes back in part to the comment that I think I was sharing with Adam before when I said, ""Look, we saw shale volumes down 1.1 million tons in the quarter but South Texas shipments actually up."" 
So if you go to the one part of the country that would have felt more acutely the downturn in shale than anybody else and you brush it away and you say, ""But their volumes were up,"" that gives you a good sense of what's happening on that lighter side of it, Todd and then back to that nonbuilding piece of it as well.

So there was a lot of stone sales, principally in North Texas, that got deferred. There was ag lime that was deferred in Iowa. And frankly, there was some stone deferral, not to the same degree that we did in -- that we saw in Texas, but we certainly saw some in the Carolinas. We mentioned the fact that we've got a quarry outside Columbia that had several billion gallons of water in it. 
The other piece of our business, though, that was pretty profoundly affected by the rain was ready-mix concrete. And obviously Denver was somewhat affected by it. Texas was profoundly affected by it. And the fact

And then North Carolina was putting that extra $700 million over a couple of years to it. 
You're going to continue to have the gas tax hitting what's going on in Iowa. And the other thing that's important is you're seeing a number of TIFIA projects. Let's not forget that, while TIFIA is smaller in this newest highway bill, TIFIA isn't going away. And if we're simply taking a look at what's going on in Colorado relative to -- I think it was Highway -- Interstate 70 and Interstate 470, those are 2 significant TIFIA projects that I think are like $1.7 billion to $2 billion.

The fact is, Ted, we really believe that the pricing in that marketplace is more important than the share that we have given in some respect there. 
The other thing that I've said to people before, we are very good cement operators in that marketplace. And if we need to compete in a way to make sure that we're protecting share, we're certainly willing to do that. But at this point today, I think we own about a 20.5% market share. That's a reduction of 2 percentage points. To put math to it, it's about 325,000 tons, just to be really granular. And again, I think we've got a good sense of where that break point is between share and price. And our sense has been price has been more important. And I think you can tell, given what we've done relative to the business, that it's certainly shown that. 
I mean, one important thing to remember, though, is weather needs to stabilize. And as it stabilizes, I think part of what's going to happen is the imports, in particular that were coming into South Texas that Argos is bringing in, will suddenly start to be utilized for their own self-supply. And I think the heavy rain in that state last year and their inability to utilize it wholly for self-supply and going into the marketplace differently was part of what we were seeing relative to the volumes and to the share loss, if that helps, Ted."

We wanted to make sure we had leading positions in attractive regions. That's what we've done. We wanted to make sure that we were getting generational types of deposits in those areas. That's what we've done, with nearly 1 billion tons in that marketplace. 
Here's an important note for us to consider, because we haven't had a recent talk to you about this in the past, but actually in November voters in Colorado Springs actually put in a sales and use tax increase of 0.62% to fund road repair and maintenance in that part of the state. We believe that's going to generate about $250 million over 5 years just in Southern Colorado. 
So when we come back with what we feel like will be about net sales of that business of about $90 million this year, EBITDA margins at probably 17% to 20%, which is below where we would like to see it, it's actually better than the business that we bought in the Rocky Mountains when we acquired it and we brought it up. With that very capable team that we have in Denver, I don't have any doubt that we will see those percentages move up nicely and move up I think in trajectory in a much more quick time frame than they did for us originally in Denver, which, by the way, I don't think anyone ever complained about.

I think the other thing that I would say is, one of the earlier comments I made was, we see the Eastern United States recovering now at a faster rate than we've seen for a while. Eastern quarries are higher-priced quarries. 
So I guess what I would say is this, to answer your question very specifically, James. I don't have any concerns about being able to at least make sure we get our pricing. If I worry about things, if I've got a worrying list from 1 to 100, I put pricing clearly at 101. So I've got a lot of confidence around that. And again, depending on what some of the geographic mix looks like, I'll leave it to your observations on whether there could be upside in that.

So I think with cheaper diesel, could it happen? I suppose math could say it could happen. Are we seeing that and can I go to specific markets and call it out as instances where I'm concerned about it? Not really at all. 
I think the other practical matter is twofold. One, people are having a hard time getting drivers in the marketplace, just finding them, and then number two, actually paying for them on the wages that they're looking for. So I think you've got an industry issue relative to aggregates that I think makes taking cheaper diesel and hauling stone farther a bit of an anathema. And then I think you've also got a driver situation that makes it even more of a challenge. So to date, not an issue, and really would not anticipate it being an issue this year."

One, if we're looking at where the American Iron and Steel Institute is right now relative to their forecast, they're basically seeing steel at a 70% utilization rate. And if you recall, going back over time, that's been the point that we said was really an important one for this business. So if we're at 70% or more, the business is going to do quite well. 
The other input that's important to remember is we are going to end up having a decent amount of usage of natural gas in that business. If we look at what nat gas did last year for the year, it was 28% lower. Even if we look for the quarter, it was about 26% lower. So again, if we're going into the year and the Steel Institute is right at 70%, that's hitting a magic number. If the input on gas is going to continue to be low, that's helpful. 
To the extent that, that business comes under pressure, the thing that I will tell you, too, is there's no team that we have in this company that's better at managing costs and managing their cost profile than our Magnesia Specialties business. So when I go back to a Q4 and look at a 35% margin, even if that business came under some degree of duress, and again, I'm not thinking that it will, but even if it did, I think you're looking at a business that's still going to have a margin in the low 30s. And from where I'm sitting, if we've got a low 30 margin, I'll take it every day."

Q1 is either made or broken in the last 2 weeks of March in most instances. Because you've got to have relatively warm weather to put down hot mix in most markets. 
The other thing to remember, and we tried to outline it pretty clearly in the telecon, we are going to have that shale headwind, at least in the Southwest, throughout the first half of the year. But I think that clearly goes away once we're through with the first half. 
That said -- and here's a good way to think of it. If you want to look at the midpoint of our guidance, what you're really saying is you're going to have aggregate volume at the midpoint at about 166 million tons. I mean, that's my quick math. If we want to say there was weather deferral of, call it, 3.5 million, 4 million tons, then you've got the shale maintenance level that could take it down another 1.5 million tons. I mean, it rained in that first half. And then the other component that we're managing through, and we'll manage through it, it'll be just fine, it's that transition from New Braunfels to Hunter. And any time you do a shift like that, it's never going to be a perfect handoff. There's going to be a little bit of shuffling that goes on because you're going from one large quarry to another large quarry. 
So as I look at that and start tallying it all up, yes, I could see 2016 ag volume at that 7% end of our range, 167 million tons. And could you see some of that go in Q1? You could, but you do have that shale play that I would just encourage you to be mindful of during the first half of the year. 
So if you think about it, Trey, last year Q1 was a pretty good quarter. Q2 was a rainy mess. Q3 was relatively normal weather. And I think the performance we saw in Q3 was what you'd expect. And then Q4 we went back to building the Ark. 
So the fact is, if we end up with a good Q1 and normal weather, I think we'd be very, very pleased with that, given what would be just the optical headwind on that portion of shale. Does that help?"

I think the other piece of it is, part of what we're seeing on some contracts now that are coming in, in that South Texas area, we talked about those large projects, like Cheniere and others. So the fact is we'll see what we feel like is a good bit of that going this year as well. 
I think just better cost, better efficiency. I mean, here's an interesting anecdote for you, Trey. I mean, at some point late in the fourth quarter we actually got a call here in the corporate office. And we got a call from this poor guy who's trying to build a hotel and get concrete poured because he's opening the doors the next week and he couldn't get concrete poured. And here's why he couldn't get concrete poured, because the 4 other times we had been ready to deliver concrete to the site he couldn't take it because the site was so wet. 
That's the type of backlog and back-build that we see in that business. So that type of carryover, much better efficiency, new contracts going and what we think will be continued price leadership in that market gives us the type of confidence we have in ready-mix."

I mean, part of what I liked about the deals that we've just done is we were able to do those within EBITDA multiple ranges that make a lot of sense for our business. I mean, we're picking up hard rock reserves at the end of the day for what we feel like could be tonnage prices at times for sand and gravel type reserves. 
You shouldn't expect us to be looking at M&A in marketplaces that really are outside of where we are unless we have the ability to go into a new marketplace either as a leader or with what we feel like is a clear, executable plan to be a leader. 
And what I would always draw you back to is what we did in Colorado in 2011. We went into that market with the swap that we did with Lafarge and the other transaction that we did literally back-to-back and put ourselves overnight in a leadership position and really have extended that march with this latest transaction. 
But going into an attractive market and being a onesie-twosie in it and really not having a good way to become a leader in that marketplace is  not consistent with our strategy.

And I've seen pricing anywhere on the low end from $0.50 a ton to the middle range of about $1 a ton to some places $1.50 a ton, or more in some instances. 
I think one of the best examples that I can give you, if you go back to when we did our acquisition of TXI, part of what we said was TXI's pricing was roughly 60% of our corporate average, and we said we thought it'd probably take about 3 years to get that closer to our corporate average, mindful that our corporate average continues to move up during that same period of time. Right now TXI is about 75% of our corporate average. So again, from a rhythm and cadence perspective, that's certainly what we're seeing. 
Would I expect us to come back and talk about midyear price increases again this year? The short answer is I would. If we're seeing the types of volume increases and the more infrastructure-type work, honestly, I think you could find yourself in a position toward the latter part of '16, certainly in '17, that in some markets you could be short on some products. 
That was exactly what happened last year, principally because of flooding in North Texas, with respect to sand in particular. So again, I think the rhythm of it will be you'll see most prices in effect January 1. In some places you're going to see some pricing that won't go into effect until March or April. 
The long and short answer is that doesn't so much matter because there's not a lot of volume going on in Q1 anyway. And we will come back at some point later in the year and talk to you more about midyear price increases. But I think customers should expect those conversations."

And I think that's going to be the primary marketplace that delivery can be tight at times. 
So I do think from a capital perspective we're where we need to be. And I do think from a labor perspective it's going to feel, in our world, much better in 2016 than it did in 2015, in large part if you just look at the rhythm and the cadence of what has happened in those shale fields. Remember what we were talking about in some of the earlier conversations about what it looked like last year Q1 in the shale fields and what it looks like this year. And I think we'll certainly be able to meet that demand."

I think most people know -- this is getting farther out -- are looking for starts to be up another 10%, even as we go into '17. So if we look at Texas more specifically, to your question, Texas ranked #4 in housing permit activity. Dallas-Fort Worth, which is our single largest market in Texas, is ranking second in housing permits. And to us, that continues to indicate good future strength in that market. 
The other thing that's remarkable to look at, if you look at residential units in 2015 in Dallas, what I'm seeing is data that reveals there's about 43,000 unit starts. If you look at Houston-Sugar Land, there's around 51,000 starts. You put those 2 together, that's almost 10% of the total starts in the United States.

A few years ago we had an asphalt business in Arkansas, which we no longer have. So that was sold about 1.5 years ago. Number two, what we did sell was basically an FOB asphalt business that was in San Antonio. Here's the quick answer on that. We weren't the best owner of it. We did with asphalt in San Antonio exactly what we did with cement in California. Somebody else was a better owner. It was not core to us in that marketplace. So we sold it. From a tonnage perspective, you're probably looking somewhere, let's call it 700,000 tons a year. 
And so the single biggest piece of our asphalt business is in Denver. And to Denver, it is very much a core part of our business there. And the asphalt business does very well in Denver. And so we do see it as core in that marketplace because that's the way that marketplace is built up and down the Front Range. So people tend to be in aggregates, they tend to be in ready-mix, and they tend to be in hot mix. So we don't see a changing in that part of the world.

The primary issue that you've got there is that's going to be an area of the state that's going to be starved for DOT specification stone. So number one, it's going to be a highly efficient operation to get material to that part of the state for a long time. 
The other thing that it does, Craig, and this is important. If you ever fly into San Antonio, you're going to fly right over our Beckmann Quarry. Beckmann, for several times over the last decade, has been the largest-producing quarry in the United States, and it's almost situated in metro San Antonio. And here's something I think most people don't appreciate. San Antonio is actually the second-largest city in Texas. Houston's largest. San Antonio is #2. San Antonio is larger than Dallas. And our aim was to make sure we were utilizing Beckmann Quarry, which is really a diamond, in the most efficient way for that quarry and to make sure we've got that quarry there for another 20-plus years. 
And we also were in a position to make sure that we could feed South Texas in the most efficient fashion, and thus the move to Medina. So that's probably a little bit more than you were looking for, Craig. But again, the strategy and the operations around it are important. What I can tell you is that plant opened on the day that we expected that plant to open. Railcars are going out of there on the day that we expected them to go.

These and other non-GAAP measures are also explained in our supplemental financial information, as well as on our website and in our SEC filings. 
Upon leveraging a full year of acquired TXI operations with our heritage business, 2015 enters the books as a record year. Specifically, we achieved record safety results, record net sales and profitability, expanded consolidated gross profit margin, exceeded incremental margin targets for the consolidated heritage business, exceeded acquisition synergy targets in both dollars and timeline, invested capital in our business, completed several bolt-on acquisitions and returned nearly $630 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. These impressive results were achieved with both tailwinds and headwinds. 
The tailwinds: 2015 construction markets experienced continued growth in private activity, led by housing as well as the emergence of enhanced public sector activity, as best revealed by a 7% [ph] increase in highway construction. 
Nonetheless, we had a very significant headwind, as 2015 saw unprecedented amounts of precipitation in our core states of Texas, North Carolina, Iowa, Georgia and Colorado, disproportionately impacting second and fourth quarter performance. By some estimates and indeed our own calculation and internal plans, multiple sustained extraordinary weather events, combined with the downturn in energy sector shale development, likely cost us up to $200 million in sales for the year, masking the underlying strength of general construction. 
That underlying strength is revealed in the solid growth we see across our business with a marked acceleration of the construction recovery in key Southeastern markets, fueled by steady employment growth, continued private sector activity and expanded Department of Transportation programs. 
We thus entered 2016 with what we believe are very favorable market and operating tailwinds, building upon our team's record 2015 results. These past results and future opportunities are tied to our strict and steadfast attention to cost discipline, further underscoring the positive result of years of improving our operating efficiency. 
We're also specifically very proud of our 2015 record safety performance, a core foundational pillar of our company. We concluded 2015 with incident rates better than what had been 2014's then record results. Notably, we continue to see dramatic improvement in the safety numbers of the former TXI operations, further underscoring our successful operational and cultural integration. Safety is first at Martin Marietta. 
In December, we completed construction of our state-of-the-art Medina Rock & Rail Quarry near San Antonio, Texas. Shipments from Medina are expected to replace rail shipments from our Beckmann Quarry as it transitions from a distance rail and truck-served quarry to wholly focusing on the local San Antonio marketplace. The Medina job was on time and on budget. The construction of this $160 million facility spanned 3 years, is the largest and most complex capital project in the company's history and is now the largest quarry on the Union Pacific Railroad's vast network. Medina began operation in January 2016, and we expect to ship nearly 6 million tons of aggregates this year. 
As highlighted in today's press release, we continue to execute against our strategic objective of securing and solidifying leading market 
[Audio Gap] 
near Colorado Springs. These 2 bolt-on transactions complement our position in metro Denver and Northern Colorado, a position we originally acquired in 2011 with our River for the Rockies asset exchange, and provide attractive and leading positions along the Front Range of the Rocky Mountains, home to over 80% of Colorado's population. Following these recent transactions, we've added an estimated 1 billion tons of aggregate reserves. 
Strategically, 4 years ago we had no Front Range position whatsoever. Today, we're a marketplace leader, with nearly 100 years of high-quality construction aggregates in a region with near- and long-term favorable employment and demographic conditions. 
Turning to the fourth quarter performance. We established quarterly records for net sales and profitability, driven by strong pricing, disciplined execution of our strategic plan and steady growth in construction activity. Importantly, all segments in the aggregates business delivered
[Audio Gap]
was led by the West Group, with a 630 basis point improvement, largely resulting from strong pricing and realized TXI synergies. As shown on Slide 7, through the end of 2015 we've realized approximately $100 million of our $120 million synergy target, reflected in both the acquired business and Heritage West Group performance. We are on track to fully realize our $120 million synergy target by the end of this year. 
On a more granular basis, our 2015 record results were driven by strong pricing across our aggregates, aggregates-related and cement businesses, as shown on Slide 8. Notably, the heritage aggregates product line delivered an increase of more than 7% in average selling price, while heritage ready-mix concrete prices increased nearly 10%. The acquired businesses, aggregates, ready-mix concrete and cement, saw price increases of 13%, nearly 11% and 10%, respectively, in line with our stated objectives. For the year, heritage aggregates product line volume increased 2% and total aggregates product line volume increased 7%. This is again despite record or near-record recurring precipitation in 5 of our largest states. 
The Southeast and the Mid-America Groups led volume growth on the strength of recovery in Georgia, Florida and the Carolinas. The West Group, which was most affected by the adverse weather conditions, reported an increase in aggregates volume of 1.2%, excluding TXI-related divestitures, which affect comparability with the prior year. Aggregates volume growth for the year was notable in North Texas but was somewhat offset by declines in direct shale energy aggregate shipments in South Texas. 
Volumes grew across all product lines with the exception of asphalt, where our Texas divestiture in the fourth quarter affected year-over-year comparability. Of note, asphalt margins expanded to 28% or just over 1,000 basis points, clearly reflecting improved profitability in our core Colorado asphalt business. 
Consolidated gross profit margin was 22% and expanded by 260 basis points for the year, led by margin expansion in all construction materials related segments. Gross profit for the heritage aggregates business increased $130 million over the prior year, with margins expanding 480 basis points to 23.8% of net sales. Incremental gross margin for the heritage aggregates business exceeded targeted objectives for both the fourth quarter and full year 2015. The incremental gross margin of 82% for the full year 2015 was led by growth in both the West Group and the Southeast Group, which achieved incremental gross margin of 100
[Audio Gap]
weather headwinds. 
The acquired businesses gross profit margin also expanded 300 basis points in 2015, led by acquired aggregates product line gross profit margin of nearly 27%, up from 4.6% for the comparable prior year period, reflecting synergy realization and underlying strength in both volume and pricing. 
Due to the September 2015 sale of our California cement business, quarterly results for the cement segments are not comparable to the prior year period. And in fact, comparability will be affected throughout 2016. Quarterly details for the cement business can be found on Slide 9 for elimination of the California results. 
However, the remaining cement business has benefited from Martin Marietta's significant pricing improvement in 2015. Average selling prices increased 10%, aided partly by the expiration of legacy TXI cement contracts at below-market pricing and the divestiture of the California business. For the year, the business generated $368 million in net sales and delivered a 28% gross profit margin, a 310 basis point improvement over the prior year. EBITDA for the business was $101 million, a $30 million increase. 
The Magnesia Specialties business was negatively affected by a slowdown in the steel industry in 2015. Steel capacity utilization was down from approximately 78% in 2014 to 71% in 2015. Full year net sales were $228 million, a decline of $9 million or 4% compared to the prior year. The Magnesia Specialties team diligently managed the cost profile of the business during the year and, despite steel capacity utilization declines, delivered an impressive 35% gross profit margin. 
On a consolidated basis, 2015 delivered record net sales of $3.3 billion, an increase of $589 million or 22%; record gross profit of $722 million, an increase of $199 million or 38%; record net earnings of $289 million, an increase of 86%; and record adjusted EBITDA of $766.7 million, an increase of 30%. 
The significant improvement in net earnings, coupled with the absence of TXI-related costs, drove an increase in operating cash flow in 2015 to $573 million compared with $382 million in 2014. Operating cash flow per share of $8.55 improved 8% when compared to adjusted 2014, which excludes the cash impact of TXI-related expenses. 
We invested $318 million of capital during the year, including $78 [ph] million related to the new Medina Rock & Rail Quarry. For the year, we returned nearly $630 million to our shareholders through the combination of repurchasing 3.3 million shares of our common stock, together with our dividend. As a reminder, we have board authorization to repurchase up to 20 million shares. 
Finally, our ratio of consolidated net debt to consolidated EBITDA for the trailing 12 months ended December 2015 was 1.9x, in compliance with our leverage covenant and below our targeted leverage of 2x. 
In summary, 2015 was a remarkable year for Martin Marietta. And despite being tempered by extraordinary weather that cloaked our true earnings potential, our team is poised for an even stronger 2016. We are confident we have the foundation in place for improved growth, profitability and performance. 
We will now look to the future and discuss our 2016 outlook, which we highlight on Slides 11 through 13. Initially, you'll notice an improvement in our expected growth as compared to our very early thoughts provided in the third quarter of 2015. Our 2016 outlook now reflects growing underlying demand and strong pricing across our entire geographic footprint. National employment growth, a stimulus for construction activity, remained robust throughout 2015, surpassing the prerecession peak by nearly 5 million jobs. These job gains, in addition to contractor backlogs, which is resulting from historic 2015 rainfall, should fuel growth and further recovery of the U.S. construction industry in 2016 and beyond. 
Public sector growth is expected to drive mid-single-digit volume increases in our infrastructure business, which accounted for 41% of our aggregates demand in 2015. The growth reflects continued state-level funding initiatives that are positively impacting several of our key states, including Texas, North Carolina, Iowa, Georgia and Florida. 
For example, in Texas nearly $10 billion of Department of Transportation lettings are planned, up from $6.1 billion in 2015. Dallas-Fort Worth alone is the beneficiary of 4 major design-build projects aimed at mitigating that area's congestion and improving traffic flow. There's also significant and continuing infrastructure work in and around Houston. 
Additional evidence of state-level infrastructure investment tailwinds is revealed by recent project scheduling changes announced by the North Carolina Department of Transportation, or NCDOT. Specifically, after the passage last year of various new state funding initiatives, NCDOT announced an accelerated schedule for 90 highway projects. This example is consistent with our articulated expectations around state construction project backlogs. 
In addition to state-level initiatives, we now have the 5-year, $305 billion Fixing America's Surface Transportation, or FAST Act, enacted in December 2015 to provide states with the required funding certainty for the first time in nearly a decade to commit to a backlog of longer-term projects needed to improve and expand America's transportation network. We believe the FAST Act, along with state-level funding initiatives, will drive large, multiyear, aggregate-intensive construction projects. Further, it's also likely we will see meaningful projects in rural areas that had been infrastructure-starved during the last decade and will now be better able to develop new avenues for growth and commerce. 
Shipments to nonresidential construction projects, 32% of our 2015 demand, is expected to increase in both the heavy, industrial and light commercial sectors, leading to an increase in aggregates volume in the high single digits. The light nonresidential construction sector is primarily office and retail, with demand generally tied to employment growth and residential activity. Notably, the Dodge momentum index is near its highest level since 2009, signaling continued growth. 
Further, core Martin Marietta states account for 5 of the top 10 and 9 of the top 20 in state-level employment growth, including Florida, Texas, Georgia, North Carolina, Ohio, Indiana, South Carolina, Virginia and Colorado, all positive catalysts for construction activity. 
The heavy nonresidential construction sector is primarily industrial building as well as energy and energy-related activity. We are currently supplying several large energy-related industrial and infrastructure projects along the Gulf Coast and expect our project backlog to grow, thus largely offsetting the declines in direct shale exploration activity. We believe direct shale activity reached a maintenance level in the fourth quarter of 2015 and should sustain at that level throughout 2016. Of course, results for the first and second quarters of last year reflected higher than maintenance level consumption and are expected to affect comparability to the first half 2016 results. 
The residential end-use market accounted for 17% of aggregate shipments in 2015 and increased 20% as compared to 2014. We expect a double-digit volume increase again in 2016, reflecting the continued steady recovery of residential investment as a result of positive employment gains, historically low mortgage rates, significant lot absorption and higher multifamily rental rates. New housing permit activity was up 12% in 2015, indicating further future gains in housing construction. Importantly, Texas, Florida, Colorado, Georgia and North Carolina each ranked in the top 10 states for housing starts. 
Finally, to conclude our discussion of 2015 end-use markets, the ChemRock/Rail market represented the remaining 10% of aggregates volume and is expected to remain relatively flat to modestly down in 2016. 
We'll now focus on Texas, where we continue to be encouraged by the resilience of the broader marketplace. In short, we anticipate increasing overall demand driven by solid population and employment growth. Construction activity in our larger-volume markets, principally being the vibrant corridor of Dallas, San Antonio, Austin, is expected to grow throughout 2016 and beyond, led by multiyear infrastructure activity, a strong residential marketplace and solid nonresidential construction. 
South Texas, of course, has seen a decline in shale oilfield activity, thus reducing our direct shipments by

road repair work.
In late 2016 or early 2017, we'll open a new aggregates facility on Martin Marietta-owned property at the Hunter cement plant northeast of San Antonio. This undertaking will allow us to transition from our leased and nearly depleted New Braunfels Quarry only 10 miles away to a permanent location with over 400 million tons of quality aggregate materials providing improved access to local markets. The Hunter aggregates quarry will be an additional synergy from the TXI acquisition that will benefit our company in 2017 and beyond. 
Our expectations for 2016 volume levels in Houston have moderated from 2015 levels, where we saw an 11% increase in aggregate shipments. We now expect aggregate volume in that marketplace to be broadly flat, with any potential upside being spurred by large infrastructure projects and any downside being driven by a sharper deterioration in the Houston economy. 
That said, it's important to remember that our principal Texas markets are located in North and Central Texas and not materially impacted by Houston market conditions. 
The Portland Cement Association, or PCA, forecasts modest demand growth in Texas in 2016 followed by stronger growth in 2017. We currently expect 2016 cement volume to increase 8% to 11%. We have previously announced a cement price increase to $12 per ton effective April 1, 2016. Based on the expected flow of shipments, we'll likely realize a year-over-year average selling price increase of approximately 9%. Both volume and price growth forecasts exclude the 2015 results of the divested California cement business. Profitability is forecast to increase by an estimated $30 million in 2016. 
On a consolidated basis, 2016 is expected to deliver record-setting results, including net sales ranging from $3.5 billion to $3.7 billion, expanded gross profit and expanded EBITDA. 
As we've consistently stated, our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. They are: Investing in aggregates-led acquisitions; organic capital investment to ensure safe, environmentally sound and highly efficient operations; returning cash to shareholders in the form of a sustainable, meaningful dividend; and share repurchases under our existing authority. 
To conclude, we're optimistic and excited about 2016. We entered the year with an enhanced foundation for further growth, an outlook for improved business conditions across the vast majority of our markets, led by solid private sector construction activity and a newly reinvigorated public sector. Our team remains focused on the careful execution of our strategic plan, wholly committed to our core foundational pillars and dedicated to delivering increased shareholder value.

And to be specific, that was an additional $700 million over 2 years. The other thing that North Carolina has that's pending that we'll see voted on later in the year is a $2 billion building bond proposal as well. 
So I think to answer your question very specifically, when our legislature came out with the additional $700 million, we did see the state implementation plan move forward 90 projects in -- up into the year. So we do anticipate seeing that. So yes, we're seeing activity that we believe will take aggregates volume later in the year. 
And clearly, with effectively doubling the Georgia budget, adding that additional $900 million to it, we will clearly see amped-up activity in Georgia. Remember, we were going to be benefited, too, by the T-SPLOST planning that was put in principally in South Georgia a couple years ago. So now what we will see, I believe, is greater activity across the State of Georgia, buttressing the activity that we were seeing in South Georgia; increased activity in North Georgia, principally around Atlanta; and we know we'll see more activity in North Carolina as well. 
I think it's worth noting, Iowa did put in a $0.10 a gallon gas tax increase last year. Nebraska did as well. We're going to see the benefits of Prop 1 money in Texas. And we're seeing near-record lettings in Florida this year. So we're seeing new money in a number of states, and we think we see more money coming in a number of states, including states like Indiana, where Governor Pence has basically said he'd like to see another $1 billion put to infrastructure in that state. And we've got 12 different states right now seriously considering gas tax increases in addition to what Georgia and Iowa have passed. So that gives you a little bit of a feel across the patch, Kathryn."

And I think you and I have both have the sense that the more that we're building new lanes, the more that we're building new highways or new roads, and the more these rural parts of the state are looking to add capacity and open up new lanes and corridors for business, that's awfully powerful to our business and I think very, very much aggregate-intensive.

I think what we're seeing is increased contractor backlogs across our entire footprint. We have also seen the awarding of several large energy-related industrial contracts, particularly in -- along the Gulf Coast. I think what we were seeing in the fourth quarter, when it wasn't raining, the fourth quarter looked very powerful. I'll give you a sense of -- I've been in Texas 3 times over the last 1.5 months and I was down there for part of the holidays. And when I'm talking to contractors in that marketplace, literally the week of Christmas, when it was dry, they were saying they were having really record days even at that time of year, which I'll tell you is unusual, but it gives me a sense of what's out there. 
And the other point I think goes back to the very beginning of the conversation that we had, and that's just simply more accelerated infrastructure activity in our key states. So we're looking at those $10.1 billion worth of activity potentially in Texas, more in North Carolina, more in Iowa and more in Colorado. 
And remember what we said about Colorado. The primary thing that was keeping us from doing more in Colorado is we needed more business in Colorado. And now what we've been able to effectively do is extend our march down the Front Range into the southern part of that as well. So I think all of those together has put us in a position that we feel considerably good about the way 2016 is shaping up. 
I think, as we go back to the second part of your question, that is, relative to cement, I think several things are going to happen. One, cement was badly affected last year by the rain. I mean, it's hard to run a cement business, which is a 24/7, 365 business, if you need to take it down more than you would wish. And keep in mind, our aim is to be a price leader in that state. And our view was we would rather take those kilns down rather than keep the kiln going and do something that we felt like was going to be foolish relative to the selling price in that marketplace. 
In large part we believe we're going to have greater efficiencies in cement this year, but we also think we're going to see better pricing in cement this year. You saw a little bit of share movement in our business in cement. And the fact is, we were willing to see that share movement move because that was really driven by 2 distinct players in the marketplace. Holcim had brought on a kiln, again, that they had idled for a while at Midlothian and they were coming back into the marketplace. And Argos, as we discussed, was bringing in some material into South Texas. 
We believe as we go into the year that everybody is likely to be relatively full. We believe we're going to be efficient. We believe we're going to be successful on our price increases. And we think by the time we put all of that in place we're looking at very nice improvement in the cement business. And by the way, we're looking for a very nice improvement in the ready-mix business as well. I think those are your principal drivers in Texas."

And if you go back to really what some of those numbers looked like that were most impressive, that's what you were seeing. 
And to answer your question specifically, I think we're going to see the Eastern United States, on a percentage basis, growing in ways that we haven't seen over the last several years. That's certainly the indications that we're getting on activity in Georgia and in Florida and in South Carolina and in North Carolina. And I think the quick answer is, Adam, if we see those areas of the country growing the way that we believe that they will, I'll just say this much: the incremental margins will be a nice story again."

I don't know how much of that is going to fit in the early part of '16, but I think you might see some of that actually coming through the back end of '16, which would be earlier than you would typically see. But I think equally, when you come back and consider the significant state initiatives. And again, we saw initiatives coming out of North Carolina late in the year. We're seeing a big Texas number. We're seeing that gas tax increase pull through in ways that we're excited about in Iowa. Again, another record -- near-record letting year coming up in Florida. I think all of that helps on the infrastructure side of it in particular. 
I think if we go to nonres, I mean, here's what -- here's a statistic that's striking to me. Think of it in these terms. Shale volumes were down 1.1 million tons in the quarter, as you heard me say in the telecon, but net South Texas shipments actually increased, and they increased by large infrastructure and large manufacturing projects. And part of what we're seeing in -- on the nonres side is an awfully nice surge in non-building. So I would encourage you to go and take a look at what's going on in other non-building. Again, power plants, gas, communications, those types are really very aggregate-intensive jobs. 
Nonbuilding, looking at the trailing 12 months through November, was up 19%. And a lot of that activity is concentrated in the Gulf. So again, if we're coming back and seeing what we feel like are really, really attractive DOT projects and awfully nice nonres projects, that helps. 
The other piece of it, candidly, we saw a lot of projects awarded in the fourth quarter. And one of the things that I'd like to see is, at certain levels it's probably frustrating to our division presidents, but we have to sign delegations from here to know exactly what they're bidding on. It's not that we don't trust what they're doing; we just like to see the sheer level of that activity. And we saw a lot of that activity in Q4."

I mean, that's really your show on what was going on, on the heavy side. I mean, to give you sense of it, to walk through the quarters, in Q1 to shale we sold about 1.2 million tons. In Q2 to shale we sold about 1 million. In Q3 to shale, about 830,000. And in Q4 to shale, about 521,000. 
Remember in my prepared comments I said I thought we were getting to maintenance levels? We view that 500,000 tons a quarter as a maintenance level. And that goes back in part to the comment that I think I was sharing with Adam before when I said, ""Look, we saw shale volumes down 1.1 million tons in the quarter but South Texas shipments actually up."" 
So if you go to the one part of the country that would have felt more acutely the downturn in shale than anybody else and you brush it away and you say, ""But their volumes were up,"" that gives you a good sense of what's happening on that lighter side of it, Todd and then back to that nonbuilding piece of it as well.

I think -- let's just say for the year it's probably somewhere around 3.5 million to 4 million tons. I think the vast majority of that obviously being in Texas. I mean, there are places in the Midwest, for example. Q4 was wet. And we've always discussed the fact that agricultural lime can go if it's really cold but doesn't go if it's really wet. So there was a lot of stone sales, principally in North Texas, that got deferred. There was ag lime that was deferred in Iowa. And frankly, there was some stone deferral, not to the same degree that we did in -- that we saw in Texas, but we certainly saw some in the Carolinas. We mentioned the fact that we've got a quarry outside Columbia that had several billion gallons of water in it. 
The other piece of our business, though, that was pretty profoundly affected by the rain was ready-mix concrete. And obviously Denver was somewhat affected by it. Texas was profoundly affected by it. And the fact

you're looking at $75 million extra that could come out of ready-mix if we had those margins in Texas like we have in Denver now. We're not looking for that

And then North Carolina was putting that extra $700 million over a couple of years to it. 
You're going to continue to have the gas tax hitting what's going on in Iowa. And the other thing that's important is you're seeing a number of TIFIA projects. Let's not forget that, while TIFIA is smaller in this newest highway bill, TIFIA isn't going away. And if we're simply taking a look at what's going on in Colorado relative to -- I think it was Highway -- Interstate 70 and Interstate 470, those are 2 significant TIFIA projects that I think are like $1.7 billion to $2 billion.

The fact is, Ted, we really believe that the pricing in that marketplace is more important than the share that we have given in some respect there. 
The other thing that I've said to people before, we are very good cement operators in that marketplace. And if we need to compete in a way to make sure that we're protecting share, we're certainly willing to do that. But at this point today, I think we own about a 20.5% market share. That's a reduction of 2 percentage points. To put math to it, it's about 325,000 tons, just to be really granular. And again, I think we've got a good sense of where that break point is between share and price. And our sense has been price has been more important. And I think you can tell, given what we've done relative to the business, that it's certainly shown that. 
I mean, one important thing to remember, though, is weather needs to stabilize. And as it stabilizes, I think part of what's going to happen is the imports, in particular that were coming into South Texas that Argos is bringing in, will suddenly start to be utilized for their own self-supply. And I think the heavy rain in that state last year and their inability to utilize it wholly for self-supply and going into the marketplace differently was part of what we were seeing relative to the volumes and to the share loss, if that helps, Ted."

Again, what we picked up there, Ted, and what we're very careful that we're trying to do, it goes back to what we set out in our SOAR process, our strategic planning. We wanted to make sure we had leading positions in attractive regions. That's what we've done. We wanted to make sure that we were getting generational types of deposits in those areas. That's what we've done, with nearly 1 billion tons in that marketplace. 
Here's an important note for us to consider, because we haven't had a recent talk to you about this in the past, but actually in November voters in Colorado Springs actually put in a sales and use tax increase of 0.62% to fund road repair and maintenance in that part of the state. We believe that's going to generate about $250 million over 5 years just in Southern Colorado. 
So when we come back with what we feel like will be about net sales of that business of about $90 million this year, EBITDA margins at probably 17% to 20%, which is below where we would like to see it, it's actually better than the business that we bought in the Rocky Mountains when we acquired it and we brought it up. With that very capable team that we have in Denver, I don't have any doubt that we will see those percentages move up nicely and move up I think in trajectory in a much more quick time frame than they did for us originally in Denver, which, by the way, I don't think anyone ever complained about.

I think the other thing that I would say is, one of the earlier comments I made was, we see the Eastern United States recovering now at a faster rate than we've seen for a while. Eastern quarries are higher-priced quarries. 
So I guess what I would say is this, to answer your question very specifically, James. I don't have any concerns about being able to at least make sure we get our pricing. If I worry about things, if I've got a worrying list from 1 to 100, I put pricing clearly at 101. So I've got a lot of confidence around that. And again, depending on what some of the geographic mix looks like, I'll leave it to your observations on whether there could be upside in that.

So I think with cheaper diesel, could it happen? I suppose math could say it could happen. Are we seeing that and can I go to specific markets and call it out as instances where I'm concerned about it? Not really at all. 
I think the other practical matter is twofold. One, people are having a hard time getting drivers in the marketplace, just finding them, and then number two, actually paying for them on the wages that they're looking for. So I think you've got an industry issue relative to aggregates that I think makes taking cheaper diesel and hauling stone farther a bit of an anathema. And then I think you've also got a driver situation that makes it even more of a challenge. So to date, not an issue, and really would not anticipate it being an issue this year."

And if you recall, going back over time, that's been the point that we said was really an important one for this business. So if we're at 70% or more, the business is going to do quite well. 
The other input that's important to remember is we are going to end up having a decent amount of usage of natural gas in that business. If we look at what nat gas did last year for the year, it was 28% lower. Even if we look for the quarter, it was about 26% lower. So again, if we're going into the year and the Steel Institute is right at 70%, that's hitting a magic number. If the input on gas is going to continue to be low, that's helpful. 
To the extent that, that business comes under pressure, the thing that I will tell you, too, is there's no team that we have in this company that's better at managing costs and managing their cost profile than our Magnesia Specialties business. So when I go back to a Q4 and look at a 35% margin, even if that business came under some degree of duress, and again, I'm not thinking that it will, but even if it did, I think you're looking at a business that's still going to have a margin in the low 30s.

Q1 is either made or broken in the last 2 weeks of March in most instances. Because you've got to have relatively warm weather to put down hot mix in most markets. 
The other thing to remember, and we tried to outline it pretty clearly in the telecon, we are going to have that shale headwind, at least in the Southwest, throughout the first half of the year. But I think that clearly goes away once we're through with the first half. 
That said -- and here's a good way to think of it. If you want to look at the midpoint of our guidance, what you're really saying is you're going to have aggregate volume at the midpoint at about 166 million tons. I mean, that's my quick math. If we want to say there was weather deferral of, call it, 3.5 million, 4 million tons, then you've got the shale maintenance level that could take it down another 1.5 million tons. I mean, it rained in that first half. And then the other component that we're managing through, and we'll manage through it, it'll be just fine, it's that transition from New Braunfels to Hunter. And any time you do a shift like that, it's never going to be a perfect handoff. There's going to be a little bit of shuffling that goes on because you're going from one large quarry to another large quarry. 
So as I look at that and start tallying it all up, yes, I could see 2016 ag volume at that 7% end of our range, 167 million tons. And could you see some of that go in Q1? You could, but you do have that shale play that I would just encourage you to be mindful of during the first half of the year. 
So if you think about it, Trey, last year Q1 was a pretty good quarter. Q2 was a rainy mess. Q3 was relatively normal weather. And I think the performance we saw in Q3 was what you'd expect. And then Q4 we went back to building the Ark. 
So the fact is, if we end up with a good Q1 and normal weather, I think we'd be very, very pleased with that, given what would be just the optical headwind on that portion of shale. Does that help?"

I think the other piece of it is, part of what we're seeing on some contracts now that are coming in, in that South Texas area, we talked about those large projects, like Cheniere and others. So the fact is we'll see what we feel like is a good bit of that going this year as well. 
I think just better cost, better efficiency. I mean, here's an interesting anecdote for you, Trey. I mean, at some point late in the fourth quarter we actually got a call here in the corporate office. And we got a call from this poor guy who's trying to build a hotel and get concrete poured because he's opening the doors the next week and he couldn't get concrete poured. And here's why he couldn't get concrete poured, because the 4 other times we had been ready to deliver concrete to the site he couldn't take it because the site was so wet. 
That's the type of backlog and back-build that we see in that business. So that type of carryover, much better efficiency, new contracts going and what we think will be continued price leadership in that market gives us the type of confidence we have in ready-mix."

I mean, part of what I liked about the deals that we've just done is we were able to do those within EBITDA multiple ranges that make a lot of sense for our business. I mean, we're picking up hard rock reserves at the end of the day for what we feel like could be tonnage prices at times for sand and gravel type reserves. 
You shouldn't expect us to be looking at M&A in marketplaces that really are outside of where we are unless we have the ability to go into a new marketplace either as a leader or with what we feel like is a clear, executable plan to be a leader. 
And what I would always draw you back to is what we did in Colorado in 2011. We went into that market with the swap that we did with Lafarge and the other transaction that we did literally back-to-back and put ourselves overnight in a leadership position and really have extended that march with this latest transaction. 
But going into an attractive market and being a onesie-twosie in it and really not having a good way to become a leader in that marketplace is not consistent with our strategy. So I wanted to articulate that to you because, as you watch for us to grow, those really should be the boundaries to it."

And I've seen pricing anywhere on the low end from $0.50 a ton to the middle range of about $1 a ton to some places $1.50 a ton, or more in some instances. 
I think one of the best examples that I can give you, if you go back to when we did our acquisition of TXI, part of what we said was TXI's pricing was roughly 60% of our corporate average, and we said we thought it'd probably take about 3 years to get that closer to our corporate average, mindful that our corporate average continues to move up during that same period of time. Right now TXI is about 75% of our corporate average. So again, from a rhythm and cadence perspective, that's certainly what we're seeing. 
Would I expect us to come back and talk about midyear price increases again this year? The short answer is I would. If we're seeing the types of volume increases and the more infrastructure-type work, honestly, I think you could find yourself in a position toward the latter part of '16, certainly in '17, that in some markets you could be short on some products. 
That was exactly what happened last year, principally because of flooding in North Texas, with respect to sand in particular. So again, I think the rhythm of it will be you'll see most prices in effect January 1. In some places you're going to see some pricing that won't go into effect until March or April. 
The long and short answer is that doesn't so much matter because there's not a lot of volume going on in Q1 anyway. And we will come back at some point later in the year and talk to you more about midyear price increases. But I think customers should expect those conversations."

I mean, if you go back particularly in Texas and then look at what was going on in that marketplace, a lot of it tied back into what we talked about earlier, and that is simply what's going on with drivers, or what's not going on with drivers. So a lot of drivers were, frankly, engaged in what was going on in the shale fields at the time. So what's happening now is you've got more drivers who are available. 
But here's the other piece of it that's important. And we went through this very carefully last October when we were going through our planning cycle. Our 2 ready-mix businesses are in Colorado and Texas. And what we were hearing from both of those groups is, ""If we could get more trucks, then we would have the ability to come back and safely serve the market in the most efficient way that we could. 
And the short answer is, at this point we think we're able to, one, put more trucks in, in a thoughtful way; number two, put drivers in those trucks; and three, be in a position both in the Rocky Mountains as well as in the Metroplex. And I think that's going to be the primary marketplace that delivery can be tight at times. 
So I do think from a capital perspective we're where we need to be. And I do think from a labor perspective it's going to feel, in our world, much better in 2016 than it did in 2015, in large part if you just look at the rhythm and the cadence of what has happened in those shale fields.

Dallas-Fort Worth, which is our single largest market in Texas, is ranking second in housing permits. And to us, that continues to indicate good future strength in that market. 
The other thing that's remarkable to look at, if you look at residential units in 2015 in Dallas, what I'm seeing is data that reveals there's about 43,000 unit starts. If you look at Houston-Sugar Land, there's around 51,000 starts. You put those 2 together, that's almost 10% of the total starts in the United States. And we're not seeing any slowdown in North Texas at all right now. And the fact is, housing inventory in Houston is still at about 4 months. So..."

A few years ago we had an asphalt business in Arkansas, which we no longer have. So that was sold about 1.5 years ago. Number two, what we did sell was basically an FOB asphalt business that was in San Antonio. Here's the quick answer on that. We weren't the best owner of it. We did with asphalt in San Antonio exactly what we did with cement in California. Somebody else was a better owner. It was not core to us in that marketplace. So we sold it. From a tonnage perspective, you're probably looking somewhere, let's call it 700,000 tons a year. 
And so the single biggest piece of our asphalt business is in Denver. And to Denver, it is very much a core part of our business there. And the asphalt business does very well in Denver. And so we do see it as core in that marketplace because that's the way that marketplace is built up and down the Front Range. So people tend to be in aggregates, they tend to be in ready-mix, and they tend to be in hot mix. So we don't see a changing in that part of the world. And as we sit here today, Mike, that's the only place that we have asphalt left."

It's going to be going principally into Houston and South Texas. The primary issue that you've got there is that's going to be an area of the state that's going to be starved for DOT specification stone. So number one, it's going to be a highly efficient operation to get material to that part of the state for a long time. 
The other thing that it does, Craig, and this is important. If you ever fly into San Antonio, you're going to fly right over our Beckmann Quarry. Beckmann, for several times over the last decade, has been the largest-producing quarry in the United States, and it's almost situated in metro San Antonio. And here's something I think most people don't appreciate. San Antonio is actually the second-largest city in Texas. Houston's largest. San Antonio is #2. San Antonio is larger than Dallas. And our aim was to make sure we were utilizing Beckmann Quarry, which is really a diamond, in the most efficient way for that quarry and to make sure we've got that quarry there for another 20-plus years. 
And we also were in a position to make sure that we could feed South Texas in the most efficient fashion, and thus the move to Medina. So that's probably a little bit more than you were looking for, Craig. But again, the strategy and the operations around it are important. What I can tell you is that plant opened on the day that we expected that plant to open. Railcars are going out of there on the day that we expected them to go. As you recall, we've got several hundred car unit facilities not just in Houston but throughout South Texas, and that's where that material is going."

With me today is Anne Lloyd, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. 
To facilitate today's discussion, we've made available during this webcast and our website supplemental financial information which we believe will be helpful. As detailed specifically on Slide 2, please remember that today's teleconference may include forward-looking statements as defined by securities laws in connection with future events or future operating or financial performance. Like other businesses, we're subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially. Except as legally required, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether resulting from new information, future developments or otherwise. We refer you to the legal disclaimers contained in our first quarter earnings release and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which are available on both our own and the SEC websites. 
Also, as a reminder, any margin references on our discussion are based on net sales and exclude freight and delivery revenues. These and other non-GAAP measures are explained in our supplemental financial information on our website and in our SEC filings. 
As detailed in the release we distributed, Martin Marietta delivered record first quarter results reflecting strong operational performance as we began to reap the benefits of a more favorable broad-based construction-centric phase of recovery in some geographic areas and expansion in others. Our impressive first quarter numbers included record net sales, record net earnings, consolidated gross margin expansion of 790 basis points and an increase in earnings per share of nearly 9x the $0.07 reported last quarter. On a consolidated basis, our operations achieved a nearly 70% incremental gross margin. Another notable highlight is our nearly 20% gross margin, mirroring the level attained in the first quarter of 2006, a time when the overall economy was near an all-time highs and annual housing starts in the United States were nearly 2 million units. To deliver similar performance in 2016, with an economy only in the early stages of construction recovery in many of our key markets, is indicative of the strength and benefit of our geographic positioning and strategic planning. 
Against that backdrop, the aggregates product line delivered robust volume and pricing growth of 13% and 8%, respectively. The Mid-America Group led with a 28% increase in aggregates product lines shipments. This performance was driven by the commencement of several large, principally state-funded highway projects across the Carolinas, together with increased residential and nonresidential construction activity. The West Group reported a 5% increase in shipments and an 11% increase in average selling price. Of particular note to the quarter, North Texas aggregates product line shipments and volume and pricing increased 28% and 12%, respectively. The Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex is the fastest-growing area in Texas and one of the top nationally for both employment growth and residential construction. Additionally, the Texas Department of Transportation has announced construction plans in excess of $8 billion per annum over the next several years. This program, which, together with the funding provided by the North Texas and Harris County Tollway Authorities, should lead to further growth in customer backlogs. Our attractive leading Texas market positions will allow us to capitalize on these opportunities for the balance of the year and indeed for years to come. 
In addition to volume growth in the quarter, we benefited from a stronger pricing environment. Simply put, aggregate pricing is up broadly across the company's business. 
The ready-mixed concrete product line enjoyed strong demand and much improved operating conditions in Texas. This twofold combination drove a 31% increase in shipments and a nearly 12% increase in average selling price. The result, a 46% increase in net sales and an 810 basis point improvement in gross margin. Texas-based ready-mix concrete operations are expected to contribute significantly to full year profitability following a profoundly weather-impacted 2015 that effectively masked the potential of this TXI-acquired business. The stated aim and expectation is for profit margins in the Texas ready-mixed concrete business to rival that of our Colorado-based business. We see these early 2016 results as a good start for the fulfillment of that goal. 
As a result of the September 2015 sale of our California Cement business, comparability of results for the Cement segment will be affected throughout the year. The 2015 impact of the California Cement operations is detailed on Slide 5. Our remaining cement business, which is entirely in Texas, benefited from considerably better weather, but importantly, strong demand, which is forecasted by the Portland Cement Association to continue for the next several years. For the quarter, the business generated nearly $70 million of net sales and $33 million of gross profit. This translated to a 47% gross margin, which increased over 1,000 basis points as compared to the prior year period. EBITDA for the Cement business was $37.8 million, a 37.5% increase from the prior year quarter. 
Lastly, the Magnesia Specialties business delivered record first quarter net sales of $59.5 million. The Magnesia Specialties team continues to diligently manage the cost profile of the business. And despite U.S. steel capacity utilization being nearly 2.5% lower than the prior year quarter, our business delivered gross margin expansion of 430 basis points to a first quarter record 38.6% gross profit margin. 
Looking at our entire business, given the strong first quarter performance and increasingly positive outlooks for the Southeast, most of Texas and our downstream businesses, we have raised our full year EBITDA guidance. We now anticipate a range of $1 billion to $1,050,000,000 of EBITDA with increased profitability and margin expansion expected across nearly every business line. The broad-based acceleration in construction recovery is visible in all 3 primary end-use markets. Again, first quarter growth was driven by large projects in the Mid-America and Southeast Groups with a 25% and 11% increase, respectively, in infrastructure shipments. Notably, important cities in the Carolinas are enjoying the benefits of this trend. Places like Charlotte are benefiting from the new I-77 HOT lanes P3 project and ongoing work to the Charlotte Douglas International Airport. Also, Charleston, South Carolina has significant port growth as well as strong attended infrastructure development. Similarly, in the southeast, the long anticipated I-4 activity in Florida contributed to positive quarter-over-quarter change. Overall, aggregates product line shipments to the infrastructure end-use market accounted for approximately 39% of our shipments and increased 13% [ph] over the prior year quarter. We are encouraged by solid growth across this end-use market resulting from state-level funding initiatives passed just last year. With the acceleration of projects in North Carolina, Georgia and Iowa, combined with another year of robust Texas Department of Transportation program lettings, we expect continued meaningful demand growth. 
The nonresidential end-use market comprised of 2 components, light construction and heavy construction, accounted for 33% of quarterly aggregate shipments and increased 14% [ph] as compared with the prior-year quarter. The light component is primarily office and retail, with demand generally tied to employment growth and residential demand. Consistent with the drivers, light nonresidential aggregates volumes increased 20%, led by nearly 26% growth in the Mid-America Group, following several years of modest recovery in this area of our business, strong employment growth and residential activity in North Carolina is driving increased nonresidential construction investment. The heavy nonresidential construction component is primarily industrial building as well as energy and energy-related activity. These shipments represented 24% of quarterly aggregates product line volumes and increased 12% compared with the first quarter of 2015. The residential market accounted for 18% of quarterly aggregates product line shipments and reported a 20% increase compared with the prior-year quarter. Strength in housing activity is evident across United States, as housing permits, starts and completions are each up more than 10% for the trailing 12 months ended March 2016. Although U.S. housing activity remains well below historic averages, the re-acceleration of growth in our key states, particularly in the Southeast portion of the country, is expected to drive increased aggregates demand throughout the year. The ChemRock/Rail market accounted for the remaining 10% of aggregates product line volumes and increased slightly. 
Consolidated gross profit margin was nearly 20% and expanded by the previously mentioned 790 basis points over the prior year first quarter, reflecting margin expansion in all reportable segments. Robust demand and much improved weather conditions drove significant growth for the ready-mixed concrete and Cement businesses, which increased gross profit margins by 810 basis points and over 1,000 basis points, respectively. 
To summarize the growth in our consolidated results, first quarter 2016 delivered record net sales of $734 million, an increase of $102 million or 16%; gross profit of $145 million, an increase of $70 million or 95%; record earnings from operations of $84 million, an increase of 228%; and EBITDA of $153 million, an increase of 67%. Net earnings growth drove a 91% increase in operating cash flow in the first quarter to $67 million compared with $35 million in the prior year quarter. 
During the quarter, we repurchased an additional 1 million shares of our common stock in line with our stated capital allocation strategy. And together with our dividend, we returned from $176 million to our shareholders. We have authorization to repurchase up to 20 million shares of our stock. Since the initial share repurchase authorization in February 2015, through the end of the first quarter 2016, we purchased 4.3 million shares, returning nearly $670 million to shareholders. As a result, 15.7 million shares remain under the current authorization. 
Finally, our ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated EBITDA for the trailing 12 months ended March 2016 was 2.1x, in compliance with our leverage covenant and in line with our targeted leverage of 2x. 
As we also noted in today's earnings release, we have upwardly revised our 2016 guidance for aggregates volume and EBITDA. Our improved outlook reflects additional strength in underlying demand and increased margin expansion from our original projections. We're confident that continued positive employment growth in our key markets, strong contractor backlogs and normal weather patterns would drive more than $1 billion of EBITDA in 2016, a new milestone for Martin Marietta. You will also note that we increased our expectations for public sector growth from mid-single digits to mid- to high single digit volume growth in 2016. The growth reflects continued state and/or municipal-level funding initiatives that are positively impacting several of our key states, including Texas, North Carolina, Colorado, Iowa, Georgia and Florida. 
To conclude, we are very pleased with our first quarter performance and improved expectations for the balance of the year. We're positioned to deliver record results as we continue to recognize the considerable benefits of our unwavering focus on our leading positions in economically diverse, high-growth markets. We remain committed to the diligent execution of our strategic plan, steadfast to our core foundational pillars and dedicated to delivering increased shareholder value.

I think as we look at Q1 and we look at the rest of the year, I think the primary thing that I would say to you is it's Q1. So clearly, we're not going to look at Q1 and let that necessarily dictate the way the entire rest of the year looks. To answer your question very directly relative to what we saw as pull-forward is recall when we ended the year last year, we thought we had probably 3.5 million to 4 million tons of aggregates that we felt like had some form of deferral because of the remarkably wet weather that we experienced in 2015. Our best estimate is we saw about 1 million tons pull forward in Q1. Our guess is we're looking forward is that's probably not a bad number for you to think about relative to Q2 and Q3, with the number then getting marginally smaller as we go into Q4. So again, from a timing perspective, based on what we see on infrastructure, we just feel like this is the first quarter. Again, trying to address the other piece of your question, what did we see pull forward, try to address very specifically what we saw in the quarter and what we anticipate in the quarters moving forward."

North Carolina has put forward a bunch of bid that could add up to $1.1 billion -- $1 billion through the biennium. And what we saw -- actually, North Carolina did that last fall, was the acceleration of about 90 projects in North Carolina. Some of those were going out as far as 2025 and even beyond. So we're seeing that type of pull-forward, not just here in our home state. We're seeing that to a degree in Georgia as well. Governor forward with a series of projects that he would like to see accelerated. So I think we'll see some of that this year. If you recall, last year, we have seen the gas price -- the gas tax go up in Iowa. It was going to add about 30% of what that state DOT could do. We've also seen some near-term initiatives in Nebraska that will clearly be more profoundly felt next year. We've also seen good activity, not just at the state level in Colorado, but we've also seen it at the municipal level in Colorado. Colorado Springs has put some very specific plans in place that will help drive volumes. We feel like in southern Colorado, to a degree, even this year. So Kathryn, what I would say, our state and local initiatives helping in some places now? Yes. Will that continue? I think to even more profound as we go into next year, I think the answer to that is yes as well. Remember, to the extent that we get a benefit from the FAST Act, that's going to be principally be a 2017 and after event. We will likely feel some of that in some discrete markets this year, but we will likely feel more state impact in those markets and then probably the 1, 2 impact of that beginning more in earnest in 2017."

One, volume always helps, and more volume in the East always helps, too. So if we come and take a look at really what it happened, we're just looking at margin guidance in the Eastern United States, in particular, we're seeing volumes obviously moving in a better direction in North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia, that's an awfully nice help. And the fact is if you look at incrementals for the business, we were right on target or ahead of target, if you look at the numbers that we put forward. But interestingly, if you take a look at Mid-America, that group had margin improvement to 46% versus 37% in first quarter of last year. But here's the trick there, Kathryn. The Mid-Atlantic Division was almost 70%, Mideast was 42% and the Midwest really this time of year doesn't make any money because they're caught up in winter. So again, as we're looking at the type of improvement that we think we can see, where that's going to come from is going to matter. The other piece of it that matters is we were able to operate remarkably more efficiently in Texas simply because it was dry. So if you pull together 2 different things: One, more normalized or friendly weather, which helps; and then a certain degree of geographic mix, that helps as well. The simple fact is, Kathryn, we could do something this quarter we haven't been able to do in a while. We had a dry track to run on and we just the reins down and let the horse go. And when you do that, those are the types of results that we think we can see."

As a reminder, the hedge wraps up at the end of this year. But if we also look ahead, I can give you a good sense of what gallons look like last year. We did 9.9 gallons -- 9.9 million Q1 this year versus 9.2 million Q1 last year. In Q2 last year, we did a little bit more than 11 million gallons. In Q3, it was almost 12 million gallons. In Q4, it was a little bit over 10.1 million for a total of almost 42.5 million gallons. So that will give you a sense of it. The other thing that I would say is if we're looking back to Q1 last year, diesel is at $2.04 versus $1.84 this year.

If we're looking at what the cost of nat gas was, that was down about 32% per quarter. So nat gas was giving that a tailwind. But even while steel was down 2.5% versus where it was last quarter, it was still at that 70% number that Anne referenced in the last conversation that we were just having with Kathryn. And candidly, 70 isn't an overheated number. I mean we built that business with our very capable team, recognizing that 70 was probably a pretty safe number to have out there. And look, are we awfully proud of staying margins at 38% when you have steel at 70%? I think those are tremendous numbers, and I think that team really should take about.

We're going to have a remarkably better year in our Southeast division, and we're going to have remarkably better year in our Mid-Atlantic Division. And candidly, it's possible to have a record year in our Mideast division. So if you're thinking about those different divisions, which ones of those are pure aggregates and the sheer number of those that are now transitioning to the Eastern half of the United States, I think that type of activity both from an infrastructure perspective and frankly other perspectives, combined with higher efficiencies really drives that delta that you're seeing in profitability."

If you go back to the conversation we had in February, I think, in large part, the first quarter, I think the term we used are shaking out. Shaking out about the we thought it would. I think we said we've got -- it would be an easier or better pricing environment in North Texas, that it was going to be in South Texas. I think that's been entirely true. The Comptroller said very helpful for in inputting out a lot of different numbers that marketplace can see. That 21% market share or in that ZIP Code is not a place that we think is a bad place for our business to be. I've also referenced the fact that we, I believe, can be a remarkably efficient producer of cement in that marketplace as well. I think one reason that you saw a modest pullback perhaps in the pricing is we've seen relatively good activity on volumes that you saw. And what we've also done is we've had some wholesale sales, particularly in that North Texas market to other producers that are in that marketplace. And the wholesale prices clearly go at a different number. So if I'm looking at probably about 40,000 tons that we sold in the quarter that were wholesale tons and then take a look at really what were some product mix issues, simply -- really selling more customers picking a product, FOB, the plant, and I would say that was more driven in South Texas than it was driven in North Texas, and then back to -- as we discussed in February, there are some competitive dynamics there that we're sensitive do. I think when you tally those together, it brings you to the point that you see in the full results. I believe is we have the weather in Texas that I think we're going to have, I think we're likely to have a very active year in Texas. I'd like the way I'm seeing our ready-mix business run right there I'm seeing other ready-mix business is run in Texas right now. The fact is, it's pretty conceivable that you can have cement shortages in Texas as we get to the main part of the year. And I'll let you draw your own conclusions on what that may mean relative to cement pricing going forward. Again, as we're looking at this business from an efficiency perspective, on pricing and really running it for profitability, I'm very comfortable with where that is. The other thing that's interesting to me, Garik, is to see what's going on with cement pricing in other parts of the United States as well. So if I'm looking in places like Colorado, or the Carolinas or otherwise, I'm seeing cement prices in those markets that are at times $25 or more a ton of where we sit in Texas right now, which gives me a sense we've got some nice runway ahead of us on this. But keep in mind, as we take a look at where we sit on pricing in cement in Texas today, we're 20% up in South Texas from where the prices were when we combined with TXI, and we're 30% up in North Texas of where prices were. I'm trying to give some context. I'd apologize for the length of my response, but I think the context is important."

We've got almost half of those where it's up at least $1 a ton and several districts where we're up $2 a ton. So we're seeing nice price movement in really important markets. The only markets where we're not seeing remarkable price movement, it's fascinating to me, we got some freight adjustments that we had to deal with some and we simply have some mix issues in others. So I'm looking quarry by quarry, product by product. I'm seeing good price increases in all those. But I would say, too, Jerry, is we're in a marketplace where volumes continue to go up. So pricing, as you know, having botched the scope of the cycle behaved exceptionally well even in a down market. From when I'm sitting right now, Jerry, I think trying to measure it going forward at F.W. Dodge is a good indicator. Dodge right now is looking at 3 good years ahead of us right now. We probably would've said the same thing last year, and that was before we ended up with the 5-year Highway Bill. So as we're sitting here, Jerry, I think the rhythm and cadence of price increases this year won't be dramatically different than they were last year, for example. I think they've been very strong so far. I think you're going to have a geographic mix that's going to give a tailwind to the way pricing is looking. But I also think that what we said for the last couple of years is entirely true, and that is the Western United States, on a percentage basis, has more pricing power ahead of it than does the East simply because the East is a more mature market, prices are higher, so your percentages up won't be as great. But again, as North Carolina continues to recover, as Georgia continues to recover, as Florida continues to recover and as places like Dallas-Fort Worth, as I've referenced in my comments, have the type of volume growth and pricing growth that they're experiencing, the pricing story we think will continue to be a very good one, not just for a matter of quarters.

And what we have spoken of the time, Jerry, is we thought it would probably take about 3 years for that to build to something that felt more like a corporate average. I think that's still not a bad place for us to be as we look at it. The other thing that I would tell you is really, starting last year, that we saw aggregate pricing in Colorado start to move on percentages that were really better than what you are seeing across the corporate average. Now do I think Colorado is going to be there from a time perspective at the same time as Texas is? No, I don't. It's likely to move a little bit more slowly than Texas. But I still think probably over a 5-year period. Basically, over what we look at as our strategic planning period. Colorado should be closing in on it. Texas very much should be there.

And when we come back and take a look at the full year, my guess is going to be somewhere in the teens overall from a volume perspective. Keep in mind, what we move by rail in the United States all by itself, ignoring everything else that's shipped by truck or otherwise, is the top 10 aggregates producer in the United States.

So I'll put it this way, James. May is an important month. It always has been. The 2 months in the aggregates business that tend to be disproportionately important are May and October. May, because this is the first time across the geographic footprint that you have every bit of your business usually really hitting on it's all cylinders and October because that's the last month that, a, is usually dry and a lot of contractors feel like by the time they get to Thanksgiving, in many respects, they'll be packing up their equipment for the year.

We're also seeing good nonres in Dallas, in Denver, in Orlando, in college station in Texas as well. So the nonres that we're seeing looks pretty good. I think one data point that's probably worth noting is 6 of the Martin Marietta states ranked in the top 10 for growth in nonres starts. And 2 of those states include Florida and Colorado. I think a lot of it, Adam, really comes back to this notion that we discussed I think a lot over the last couple of years because we were hoping that it would come to fruition the way that it has where you are matters. And as we're looking at the states in which we have leading positions, and keep in mind, those leading positions today, 1 or 2, are on 85% versus 65% of our markets 5 years ago. We've tried to position ourselves in states that have near-term and long-term growth and that tend to have multiple economic drivers in them as well. So again, I don't think the nonres story is dramatically different.

And if we continue to see permits, starts and completions on housing, all of those double digits, and we also continue to see single-family housing ramp up, that's going to be more aggregate-intensive and we're going to see the nonres, both light and heavy, I think continue to follow that in a very constructive manner."

But I would say is, you're going to see states continue to let more long-term aggregate-intensive projects over the next several years than they have over the last several years. And I do think the FAST Act will give states who have not been coming up with very specific state initiatives a lot more runway than they've had for a while. I think the real blessing we're going to have, though, if you really pause and reflect on the key states for us, that will have both. I mean think of it in these terms. Colorado is going to have both. Separate and distinct from what's going on in Colorado Springs. Iowa has both. Nebraska has both. Texas has both. Remember, the extra funding that comes into Texas just from Prop 7, by the time we get to September 2017, is more money than the increase on a per annum basis than you see even the FAST Act. So the FAST Act is nice because it does put dollars there. But the primary component of the FAST Act is going to be helpful is time. So what's going to happen, You're going to take extra state dollars and combine that with extra time from the Fed. It's going to be the confluence of those 2 factors that will be more profound, particularly beginning in '17 and then in the out years."

And then secondly, I don't think we talked much about the asphalt business. I mean could you remind me what sort of made you divest that impact of that volume number? And secondly, your old firm is commenting yesterday that it's going to be much more difficult business this year because the escalator clauses are going to kick in or the adjustment clauses, which would impact -- which would mean the lower -- price would seep through and therefore there will be less pricing power. Does that impact you at all?"

That's not a problem. What I would say is this, when you look at Q1, don't ever take Q1 in a vacuum as really a good litmus test on exactly what's going on in pricing. Going back to a conversation that we had a few minutes ago, the Midwest is not cranking during Q1. The Middle East is not cranking into Q1. So what you're seeing in Q1 is a lot of North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida, all of which in the Eastern U.S. are pretty high-priced markets. And then you're obviously seeing pricing in Texas, particularly North Texas, move at very nice percentages. So what I would tell you is you're going to continue to see good robust pricing. But it's going to happen in Mideast, which is principally Indiana and Ohio, and the Midwest, which is principally Iowa and Minnesota and Nebraska come in. Those tend to be more corporate average-y on pricing. So again, I think we feel very comfortable with the percentages that we put out there. To your question an asphalt. The way I would think of it, if we look at asphalt, we did about 2.1 million tons of asphalt last year in the Rocky Mountain division. As we look at it now, that's the only asphalt that we have left. So we did sell, frankly, a pretty modest asphalt position that we had around the San Antonio marketplace. So the fact that we don't have that business anymore is not going to be a dramatic driver or not on what we're seeing relative to our business. With respect to the liquid asphalt or bitumen and where it is, Mike, my guess is that story is going to change a lot back to what I've said before, depending on where you are in the marketplace. The circumstance up and down the Front Range in Colorado. And when I speak to the front Range, I'm really talking about the I-25 corridor that's where 80% of the people who live in Colorado reside. That market is very, very busy right now on public. It's very, very busy on private res and nonres. And in large parts, you've got a good asphalt market, particularly on subdivision side and on the infrastructure side. And a lot of the work in Colorado, particularly 1 year, 1.5 years ago was having to be lead couple times, more times because they weren't having enough bidders were available. That's going to be a tight market relative to aggregate. It's going to be a tight market relative to contractors who are able to do much of that work. And again, thank as we're looking at our asphalt business that is principally a Colorado asphalt business, we feel pretty good about it. Now relative to your question on how it do in the first quarter, it really didn't do much in the first quarter. We don't expect it to do much in the first quarter. Again, because they're in the Rocky Mountains. If we're looking at what asphalt sales were for us both internally and externally in the first quarter, it was 134,000 tons versus 147,000 tons in the prior year. And the 147,000 tons the prior year had the Texas business in it as well."

So again, looking at volume up 21% [ph] of pricing, up 12%, you can see what's happened with gross profit. Again, I think this is really more of a story that candidly we're not that surprised by. We think we've got a very good position in ready-mix both Texas and in Colorado. I'm particularly pleased to see what we're doing in Texas, though, the relative to the EBITDA. Part of what we've said before, we would like to see those margins in Texas approach what we see in margins in Colorado. So if you're looking at EBITDA-ish this year in the Southwest of $38 million, if we're able to do in the Southwest on margins what we've been doing ourselves doing in Colorado, that can translate at the right day in the right hour to about $75 million in gross margins.

With me today is Anne Lloyd, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.
To facilitate today's discussion, we've made available during this webcast and our website supplemental financial information which we believe will be helpful. As detailed specifically on Slide 2, please remember that today's teleconference may include forward-looking statements as defined by securities laws in connection with future events or future operating or financial performance. Like other businesses, we're subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially. Except as legally required, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether resulting from new information, future developments or otherwise. We refer you to the legal disclaimers contained in our first quarter earnings release and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which are available on both our own and the SEC websites.
Also, as a reminder, any margin references on our discussion are based on net sales and exclude freight and delivery revenues. These and other non-GAAP measures are explained in our supplemental financial information on our website and in our SEC filings. 
As detailed in the release we distributed, Martin Marietta delivered record first quarter results reflecting strong operational performance as we began to reap the benefits of a more favorable, broad-based construction-centric phase of recovery in some geographic areas and expansion in others. Our impressive first quarter numbers included record net sales, record net earnings, consolidated gross margin expansion of 790 basis points and an increase in earnings per share of nearly 9x the $0.07 reported last quarter. 
On a consolidated basis, our operations achieved a nearly 70% incremental gross margin. Another notable highlight is our nearly 20% gross margin, mirroring the level attained in the first quarter of 2006, a time when the overall economy was near an all-time highs and annual housing starts in the United States were nearly 2 million units. To deliver similar performance in 2016, with an economy only in the early stages of construction recovery in many of our key markets, is indicative of the strength and benefit of our geographic positioning and strategic planning.
Against that backdrop, the Aggregates product line delivered robust volume and pricing growth of 13% and 8% respectively. The Mid-America Group led with a 28% increase in aggregates product line shipments. This performance was driven by the commencement of several large, principally state-funded highway projects across the Carolinas, together with increased residential and nonresidential construction activity. The West Group reported a 5% increase in shipments and an 11% increase in average selling price. Of particular note for the quarter, North Texas aggregates product line shipments and volume and pricing increased 28% and 12% respectively. The Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex is the fastest growing area in Texas, and one of the top nationally for both employment growth and residential construction. Additionally, the Texas Department of Transportation has announced construction plans in excess of $8 billion per annum over the next several years. This program, which, together with the funding provided by the North Texas and Harris County Tollway Authorities, should lead to further growth in customer backlogs. Our attractive leading Texas market positions will allow us to capitalize on these opportunities for the balance of the year and indeed for years to come.  In addition to volume growth in the quarter, we benefited from a stronger pricing environment. Simply put, aggregate pricing is up broadly across the company's business.
The ready-mixed concrete product line enjoyed strong demand and much improved operating conditions in Texas. This twofold combination drove a 31% increase in shipments and a nearly 12% increase in average selling price. The result, a 46% increase in net sales and an 810 basis point improvement in gross margin. Texas-based ready-mixed concrete operations are expected to contribute significantly to full year profitability following a profoundly weather-impacted 2015 that effectively masked the potential of this TXI-acquired business. The stated aim and expectation is for profit margins in the Texas ready-mixed concrete business to rival that of our Colorado-based business. We see these early 2016 results as a good start for the fulfillment of that goal.
As a result of the September 2015 sale of our California Cement business, comparability of results for the Cement segment will be affected throughout the year. The 2015 impact of the California Cement operations is detailed on Slide 5. Our remaining cement business, which is entirely in Texas, benefited from considerably better weather, but importantly, strong demand, which is forecasted by the Portland Cement Association to continue for the next several years. For the quarter, the business generated nearly $70 million of net sales and $33 million of gross profit. This translated to a 47% gross margin, which increased over 1,000 basis points as compared to the prior year period. EBITDA for the Cement business was $37.8 million, a 37.5% increase from the prior year quarter. 
Lastly, the Magnesia Specialties business delivered record first quarter net sales of $59.5 million. The Magnesia Specialties team continues to diligently manage the cost profile of the business. And despite U.S. steel capacity utilization being nearly 2.5% lower than the prior year quarter, our business delivered gross margin expansion of 430 basis points to a first quarter record 38.6% gross profit margin.
Looking at our entire business, given the strong first quarter performance and increasingly positive outlooks for the Southeast, most of Texas and our downstream businesses, we have raised our full year EBITDA guidance. We now anticipate a range of $1 billion to $1,050,000,000 of EBITDA with increased profitability and margin expansion expected across nearly every business line. 
The broad-based acceleration in construction recovery is visible in all 3 primary end-use markets. Again, first quarter growth was driven by large projects in the Mid-America and Southeast Groups with a 25% and a 11% increase, respectively, in infrastructure shipments. Notably, important cities in the Carolinas are enjoying the benefits of this trend. Places like Charlotte are benefiting from the new I-77 HOT lanes P3 project and ongoing work at the Charlotte Douglas International Airport. Also, Charleston, South Carolina has significant port growth as well as strong attended infrastructure development. 
Similarly, in the southeast, the long anticipated I-4 activity in Florida contributed to the positive quarter-over-quarter change. Overall, aggregates product line shipments to the infrastructure end-use market accounted for approximately 39% of our shipments and increased 13% over the prior year quarter. We are encouraged by solid growth across this end-use market resulting from state-level funding initiatives passed just last year. With the acceleration of projects in North Carolina, Georgia and Iowa, combined with another year of robust Texas Department of Transportation program lettings, we expect continued meaningful demand growth.
The nonresidential end-use market comprised of 2 components, light construction and heavy construction, accounted for 33% of quarterly aggregate shipments and increased 14% as compared with the prior year quarter. The light component is primarily office and retail, with demand generally tied to employment growth and residential demand. Consistent with the drivers, light nonresidential aggregates volumes increased 20%, led by nearly 26% growth in the Mid-America Group, following several years of modest recovery in this area of our business, strong employment growth and residential activity in North Carolina is driving increased nonresidential construction investment. The heavy nonresidential construction component is primarily industrial building as well as energy and energy-related activity. These shipments represented 24% of quarterly aggregates product line volumes and increased 12% compared with the first quarter of 2015. 
The residential market accounted for 18% of quarterly aggregates product line shipments and reported a 20% increase compared with the prior year quarter. Strength in housing activity is evident across the United States, as housing permits, starts and completions are each up more than 10% for the trailing 12 months ended March 2016. Although U.S. housing activity remains well below historic averages, the re-acceleration of growth in our key states, particularly in the Southeastern portion of the country, is expected to drive increased aggregates demand throughout the year. The ChemRock/Rail market accounted for the remaining 10% of aggregates product line volumes and increased slightly. 
Consolidated gross profit margin was nearly 20% and expanded by the previously mentioned 790 basis points over the prior year first quarter, reflecting margin expansion in all reportable segments. Robust demand and much improved weather conditions drove significant growth for the ready-mixed concrete and Cement businesses, which increased gross profit margins by 810 basis points and over 1,000 basis points respectively. 
To summarize the growth in our consolidated results, first quarter 2016 delivered record net sales of $734 million, an increase of $102 million or 16%; gross profit of $145 million, an increase of $70 million or 95%; record earnings from operations of $84 million, an increase of 228%; and EBITDA of $153 million, an increase of 67%. Net earnings growth drove a 91% increase in operating cash flow in the first quarter to $67 million compared with $35 million in the prior year quarter.
During the quarter, we repurchased an additional 1 million shares of our common stock in line with our stated capital allocation strategy. And together with our dividend, we returned $176 million to our shareholders. We have authorization to repurchase up to 20 million shares of our stock. Since the initial share repurchase authorization in February 2015, through the end of the first quarter 2016, we repurchased 4.3 million shares, returning nearly $670 million to shareholders. As a result, 15.7 million shares remain under the current authorization.
Finally, our ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated EBITDA for the trailing 12 months ended March 2016 was 2.1x, in compliance with our leverage covenant and in line with our targeted leverage of 2x.
As we also noted in today's earnings release, we have upwardly revised our 2016 guidance for aggregates volume and EBITDA. Our improved outlook reflects additional strength in underlying demand, and increased margin expansion from our original projections. We're confident that continued positive employment growth in our key markets, strong contractor backlogs and normal weather patterns would drive more than $1 billion of EBITDA in 2016, a new milestone for Martin Marietta. You will also note that we increased our expectations for public sector growth from mid-single digits to mid- to high single digit volume growth in 2016. The growth reflects continued state and/or municipal-level funding initiatives that are positively impacting several of our key states, including Texas, North Carolina, Colorado, Iowa, Georgia and Florida.
To conclude, we are very pleased with our first quarter performance and improved expectations for the balance of the year. We're positioned to deliver record results as we continue to recognize the considerable benefits of our unwavering focus on our leading positions in economically diverse, high-growth markets. We remain committed to the diligent execution of our strategic plan, steadfast to our core foundational pillars and dedicated to delivering increased shareholder value.

So really, we're not going to look at Q1 and let that necessarily dictate the way the entire rest of the year looks. To answer your question very directly relative to what we saw as pull-forward as you recall when we ended the year last year, we thought we had probably 3.5 million to 4 million tons of aggregates that we felt like had some form of deferral because of the remarkably wet weather that we've experienced in 2015. Our best estimate is we saw about 1 million ton pull forward in Q1. Our guess is we're looking forward is that's probably not a bad number for you to think about relative to Q2 and Q3, with the number then getting marginally smaller as we go into Q4. So again, from a timing perspective, based on what we see on infrastructure, we just feel like this is the first quarter.

North Carolina has put forward a bunch of bid, it could add up to $1.1 billion -- $1 billion through the biennium. And what we saw -- actually, North Carolina did that last fall, was the acceleration of about 90 projects in North Carolina. Some of those were going out as far as 2025 and even beyond. So we're seeing that type of pull-forward, not just here in our home state. We're seeing that to a degree in Georgia as well. Governor, Deal, came forward with a series of projects that he would like to see accelerated. So I think we will see some of that this year. If you recall, last year, we had seen the gas price -- the gas tax go up in Iowa. It was going to add about 30% to what that state DOT could do. We've also seen some near-term initiatives in Nebraska that will clearly be more profoundly felt next year. We've also seen good activity, not just at the state level in Colorado, but we've also seen it at the municipal level in Colorado. Colorado Springs has put some very specific plans in place that will help drive volumes. We feel like in southern Colorado, to a degree, even this year. So Kathryn, what I would say, our state and local initiatives helping in some places now? Yes. Will that continue? I think to be even more profound as we go into next year, I think the answer to that is, yes as well. Remember, to the extent that we get a benefit from the FAST Act, that's going to principally be a 2017 and after event. We will likely feel some of that in some discrete markets this year, but we will likely feel more state impact in those markets and then probably the 1, 2 impact of that beginning, more in earnest in 2017."

So if we come and take a look at really what it happened if we're just looking at margin guidance in the Eastern United States, in particular, if we're seeing volumes obviously moving in a better direction in North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia, that's an awfully nice help. And the fact is if you look at incrementals for the business, we were right on target or ahead of target, if you look at the numbers that we put forward. But interestingly, if you take a look at Mid-America, that group had margin improvement to 46% versus 37% in the first quarter of last year. But here's the trick there, Kathryn. The Mid-Atlantic Division was almost 70%, Mideast was 42% and the Midwest really this time of year doesn't make any money because they're caught up in winter. So again, as we're looking at the type of improvement that we think we can see, where that's going to come from is going to matter. The other piece of it that matters is we were able to operate remarkably more efficiently in Texas simply because it was dry. So if you pull together 2 different things: One, more normalized or friendly weather, which helps; and then a certain degree of geographic mix, that helps as well. The simple fact is, Kathryn, we could do something this quarter we haven't been able to do in a while. We had a dry track to run on and we just put the reins down and let the horse go. And when you do that, those are the types of results that we think we can see."

So really, if we look at it and think of it in our numbers, the hedge actually gave us about a $4.5 million headwind as we're going through the quarter. As a reminder, the hedge wraps up at the end of this year. But if we also look ahead, I can give you a good sense of what the gallons looked like last year. We did 9.9 gallons -- 9.9 million Q1 this year versus 9.2 million Q1 last year. In Q2 last year, we did a little bit more than 11 million gallons. In Q3, it was almost 12 million gallons. In Q4, it was a little bit over 10.1 million for a total of almost 42.5 million gallons. So that will give you a sense of it. The other thing that I would say is if we're looking back to Q1 last year, diesel is at $2.04 versus $1.84 this year.

If you got steel utilization at 70% or better, and if you got natural gas prices that are well behaved, those 2 things will help that business pretty considerably. If we're looking at what the cost of nat gas was, that was down about 32% for the quarter. So nat gas was giving that a tailwind. But even while steel was down 2.5% versus where it was last quarter, it was still at that 70% number that Anne referenced in the last conversation that we were just having with Kathryn. And candidly, 70% isn't an overheated number. I mean, we built that business with our very capable team, recognizing that 70 was probably a pretty safe number to have out there. And look, are we awfully proud of staying margins at 38% when you got steel at 70%? I think those are tremendous numbers, and I think that team really should take about. So while we're pleased with those results, I would say very pleased. Have we changed anything structurally? The answer is no. We really built it to make sure that those levels would operate very well with where we wanted to take the business."

And keep in mind, what you haven't really seen in any significant material way yet is what we feel like is going to be a pretty busy year in Indianapolis in our Mideast business, and is likely to be a very busy year in our Midwest business as well. Garik, as I sit here and really just think about our aggregates business and take a measure of it, what I would say to you is, it wouldn't surprise me at the end of the year to have a record year in the Rocky Mountain division. It wouldn't surprise me to have a record year in our Midwest division. I think we're going to have a record year in our Southwest division. We're going to have a remarkably better year in our Southeast division, and we're going to have remarkably better year in our Mid-Atlantic division. And candidly, it's possible to have a record year in our Mideast division. So if you're thinking about those different divisions, which ones of those are pure aggregates and the sheer number of those that are now transitioning to the Eastern half of the United States, I think that type of activity, both from an infrastructure perspective and frankly other perspectives, combined with higher efficiencies, really drives that delta that you're seeing in profitability."

If we go back to the conversation that we had in February, I think, in large part, the first quarter, I think the term we used was shaking out. It's probably shaking out about the way that we thought that it would. I think, we said we've got -- it would be an easier or better pricing environment in North Texas, that it was going to be in South Texas. I think that's been entirely true. The Comptroller is very helpful in putting out the different numbers that marketplace can see. That 21% market share or in that ZIP Code is not a place that we think is a bad place for our business to be. I've also referenced the fact that we, I believe, can be a remarkably efficient producer of cement in that marketplace as well. I think one reason that you saw a modest pullback perhaps in the pricing is, we've seen relatively good activity on volumes that you saw. And what we've also done is we've had some wholesale sales, particularly in that North Texas market to other producers that are in that marketplace. And the wholesale prices clearly go at a different number. So if I'm looking at probably about 40,000 tons that we sold in the quarter that were wholesale tons, and then take a look at really what were some product mix issues, simply -- really selling more customers picking a product, FOB, the plant, and I would say that was more driven in South Texas than it was driven in North Texas, and then back to -- as we discussed in February, there are some competitive dynamics there that we're sensitive to. I think when you tally those together, it brings you to the point that you see in the full results. What I believe is if we have the weather in Texas that I think we're going to have, I think we're likely to have a very active year in Texas. I like the way I'm seeing our ready-mixed business run, right there. I'd like to what I'm seeing other ready-mixed businesses run in Texas right now. I think the fact is, it's pretty conceivable that you could have cement shortages in Texas as we get to the main part of the year. And I'll let you draw your own conclusions on what that may mean relative to cement pricing going forward. Again, as we're looking in this business from an efficiency perspective, on pricing and really running it for profitability, I'm very comfortable with where that is. The other thing that's interesting to me, Garik, is to see what's going on with cement pricing in other parts of the United States as well. So if I'm looking in places like Colorado, or the Carolinas or otherwise, I'm seeing cement prices in those markets that are at times $25 or more a ton of where we sit in Texas right now, which gives me a sense we've got some nice runway ahead of us on this. But keep in mind, as we take a look at where we sit on pricing in cement in Texas today, we're 20% up in South Texas from where the prices were when we combined with TXI, and we're 30% up in North Texas of where prices were. So I have tried to give you some context. I apologize for the length of my response, but I think the context is important."

As I look at aggregates pricing, here's what I would say. We've got 17 out of 20 districts where it's just remarkably positive. We've got almost half of those where it's up at least $1 a ton and several districts where we're up $2 a ton. So we're see",392,"Yes. As I look at aggregates pricing, here's what I would say. We've got 17 out of 20 districts where it's just remarkably positive. We've got almost half of those where it's up at least $1 a ton and several districts where we're up $2 a ton. So we're seeing nice price movement in really important markets. The only markets where we're not seeing remarkable price movement, it's fascinating to me, we got some freight adjustments that we had to do in some, and we simply have some mix issues in others. So I am looking quarry by quarry, product by product. I'm seeing good price increases in all of those. But I would say, too, Jerry, is we're in a marketplace where volumes continue to go up. So pricing, as you know, having botched the scope of the cycle behaved exceptionally well even in a down market. From where I'm sitting right now, Jerry, I think trying to measure it going forward if F.W. Dodge is a good indicator. Dodge right now is looking at 3 good years ahead of us right now. We probably would have said the same thing last year, and that was before we ended up with the 5-year Highway Bill. So as we're sitting here, Jerry, I think the rhythm and cadence of price increases this year won't be dramatically different than they were last year, for example. I think they've been very strong so far. I think you're going to have a geographic mix that's going to give a tailwind to the way pricing is looking. But I also think that what we said for the last couple of years is entirely true, and that is the Western United States, on a percentage basis, has more pricing power ahead of it than does the East simply because the East is a more mature market, prices are higher so your percentage is up, won't be as great. But again as North Carolina continues to recover, as Georgia continues to recover, as Florida continues to recover and as places like Dallas-Fort Worth, as I referenced in my opening comments, have the type of volume growth and pricing growth that they're experiencing, the pricing story we think will continue to be a very good one, not just for a matter of quarters, probably for a matter of years."

The other thing that I would tell you is really, with starting last year, that we saw aggregate pricing in Colorado start to move on percentages that were really better than what you we're seeing across the corporate average.

But we're seeing good, nice, nonres in portions of South Carolina. In fact, I call it out South Carolina specifically on some infrastructure in our prepared remarks. But we're seeing good nonres in that market. We're also seeing good nonres in Dallas, in Denver, in Orlando, in College Station in Texas as well. So the nonres that we're seeing looks pretty good. I think one data point that's probably worth knowing is 6 of the Martin Marietta states rank in the top 10 for growth in nonres starts. And 2 of those states include Florida and Colorado. I think a lot of it, Adam, really comes back to this notion that we discussed, I think a lot over the last couple of years because we were hoping that it would come to fruition the way that it has where you are matters. And as we're looking at the states in which we have leading positions, and keep in mind, those leading positions today, 1 or 2, are in 85% versus 65% of our markets 5 years ago. We've tried to position ourselves in states that have near-term and long-term growth and they tend to have multiple economic drivers in them as well. So again, I don't think the nonres story is dramatically different. But we are seeing some of those very large projects, for example, in South Texas firm up and we're sticking those backlogs even more capably in our pocket right now."

I mean, what I would tell you is, with our teams, both in Martin Marietta as well as our customer base, probably feel as optimistic right now as I have seen people feel in about 10 years. And I think a lot of that's driven by the fact that the Eastern United States lag the West not by a matter of months, but really by a matter of years in coming back with some degree of nonres projects in particular. And keep in mind, a lot of times we said those projects will follow varying degrees of housing recovery with a 9- to 18-month lag. And if we continue to see permits, starts and completions on housing, all in those double digits, and we also continue to see single-family housing ramp up, that's going to be more aggregate-intensive and we're going to see the nonres, both light and heavy, I think continue to follow that in a very constructive manner."

And I do think the FAST Act will give states who have not been coming up with very specific state initiatives, a lot more runway than they've had for a while. I think the real blessing we're going to have, though, if you really pause and reflect on the key states for us, that will have both. I mean think of it in these terms. Colorado is going to have both. Separate and distinct from what's going on in Colorado Springs. Iowa has both. Nebraska has both. Texas has both. Remember, the extra funding that comes into Texas is just from Prop 7, by the time we get to September 2017, is more money than the increase on a per annum basis than you see even the FAST Act. So the FAST Act is nice because it does put dollars there. But the primary component of the FAST Act is going to be helpful is time. So what's going to happen, you're going to take extra state dollars and combine that with extra time from the Fed. It's going to be the confluence of those 2 factors that will be more profound, particularly beginning in '17 and then in the out years."

And then secondly, I don't see we talked much about the asphalt business. I mean, could you remind me what sort of made your divestment that impacted that volume number? And secondly, your old firm is commenting yesterday, it is going to be much more difficult business this year because the escalator clauses were going to kick in or the adjustment clauses, which would impact -- which would mean that the lower bitumen price would seep through and therefore there will be less pricing power. Does that impact you at all?"

That's not a problem. What I would say is this, when you look at Q1, don't ever take Q1 in a vacuum as really a good litmus test on exactly what's going on in pricing. Going back to the conversation that we had a few minutes ago, the Midwest is not cranking during Q1. The Middle East is not cranking into Q1. So what you're seeing in Q1 is a lot of North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida, all of which in the Eastern U.S. are pretty high-priced markets. And then you're obviously seeing pricing in Texas, particularly North Texas, move at very nice percentages. So what I would tell you is you're going to continue to see good robust pricing. But what's going to happen is when Mideast, which is principally Indiana and Ohio, and the Midwest, which is principally Iowa and Minnesota and Nebraska come in. Those tend to be more corporate average-y on pricing. So again, I think we feel very comfortable with the percentages that we put out there. To your question an asphalt. Here is the way I would think of it, if we look at asphalt, we did about 2.1 million tons of asphalt last year in the Rocky Mountain division. As you really look at it now, that's the only asphalt that we have left. So we did sell, frankly, a pretty modest asphalt position that we had around the San Antonio marketplace. So the fact that we don't have that business anymore is not going to be a dramatic driver or not on what we're seeing relative to our business. With respect to liquid asphalt or bitumen and where it is, Mike, my guess is that story is going to change a lot back to what I've said before, depending on where you are in the marketplace. Here is the circumstance, up and down the Front Range in Colorado. And when I speak to the Front Range, I'm really talking about the I-25 corridor that's where 80% of the people who live in Colorado reside. That market is very, very busy right now on public. It's very, very busy on private res and nonres. And in large parts, you've got a good asphalt market, particularly on subdivision side and on the infrastructure side. And a lot of the work in Colorado, particularly 1 year, 1.5 years ago was having to be lead a couple, some times, more times because they weren't having enough bidders who're available. That's going to be a tight market relative to aggregate. It's going to be a tight market relative to contractors, who are able to do much of that work. And again, I think it's we're looking at our asphalt business that is principally a Colorado asphalt business, we feel pretty good about it. Now relative to your question on how it did do in the first quarter, it didn't really do much in the first quarter. And we don't expect it to do much in the first quarter. Again, because you are there in the Rocky Mountains. If we're looking at what asphalt sales were for us both internally and externally in the first quarter, it was 134,000 tons versus 147,000 tons in the prior year. And the 147,000 tons in the prior year had the Texas business in it as well."

I mean the ready-mixed business that really you are looking at when you look at these numbers is what's going on in Texas.

So again, as you're looking at volume is up 31%, the pricing is up 12%, you can see what's happened with gross profit. Again, I think this is really more of a story that candidly we're not that surprised by. We think we've got a very good position in ready-mix, both in Texas and in Colorado. I'm particularly pleased to see what we're doing in Texas, though, relative to the EBITDA. Because part of what we've said before, we would like to see those margins in Texas approach what we see in margins in Colorado. So if we're looking at EBITDA-ish this year in the Southwest of $38 million, if we're able to do in the Southwest on margins what we've been seeing ourselves doing in Colorado, that could translate at the right day in the right hour to about $75 million in gross margins. So it's a -- one, it was a very good story in the first quarter. Two, we expect it to be a good story for the rest of the year, but we also expect to see that Texas business continue to do better."

With me today is Anne Lloyd, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.
To facilitate today's discussion, we've made available during this webcast and on our website supplemental financial information which we believe will be helpful. As detailed specifically on Slide 2, please remember that today's teleconference may include forward-looking statements as defined by securities laws in connection with future events or future operating or financial performance. Like other businesses, we're subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially. Except as legally required, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether resulting from new information, future developments or otherwise. We refer you to the legal disclaimers contained in our first quarter earnings release and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which are available on both our own and the SEC websites.
Also, as a reminder, any margin references in our discussion are based on net sales and exclude freight and delivery revenues. These and other non-GAAP measures are explained in our supplemental financial information on our website and in our SEC filings. 
As detailed in the release we distributed, Martin Marietta delivered record first quarter results reflecting strong operational performance as we began to reap the benefits of a more favorable, broad-based construction-centric phase of recovery in some geographic areas and expansion in others. Our impressive first quarter numbers included record net sales, record net earnings, consolidated gross margin expansion of 790 basis points and an increase in earnings per share of nearly 9x the $0.07 reported last quarter. 
On a consolidated basis, our operations achieved a nearly 70% incremental gross margin. Another notable highlight is our nearly 20% gross margin, mirroring the level attained in the first quarter of 2006, a time when the overall economy was near an all-time highs and annual housing starts in the United States were nearly 2 million units. To deliver similar performance in 2016, with an economy only in the early stages of construction recovery in many of our key markets, is indicative of the strength and benefit of our geographic positioning and strategic planning.
Against that backdrop, the Aggregates product line delivered robust volume and pricing growth of 13% and 8% respectively. The Mid-America Group led with a 28% increase in aggregates product line shipments. This performance was driven by the commencement of several large, principally state-funded, highway projects across the Carolinas, together with increased residential and nonresidential construction activity. The West Group reported a 5% increase in shipments and an 11% increase in average selling price. Of particular note for the quarter, North Texas Aggregates product line shipments -- volume and pricing increased 28% and 12%, respectively. The Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex is the fastest growing area in Texas, and one of the top, nationally, for both employment growth and residential construction. Additionally, the Texas Department of Transportation has announced construction plans in excess of $8 billion per annum over the next several years. This program, which, together with the funding provided by the North Texas and Harris County Tollway Authorities, should lead to further growth in customer backlogs. Our attractive leading Texas market positions will allow us to capitalize on these opportunities for the balance of the year and indeed for years to come. In addition to volume growth in the quarter, we benefited from a stronger pricing environment. Simply put, aggregate pricing is up, broadly, across the company's business.
The ready-mixed concrete product line enjoyed strong demand and much improved operating conditions in Texas. This twofold combination drove a 31% increase in shipments and a nearly 12% increase in average selling price. The result, a 46% increase in net sales and an 810 basis point improvement in gross margin. Texas-based ready-mixed concrete operations are expected to contribute significantly to full year profitability following a profoundly weather-impacted 2015 that, effectively, masked the potential of this TXI-acquired business. The stated aim and expectation is for profit margins in the Texas ready-mixed concrete business to rival that of our Colorado-based business. We see these early 2016 results as a good start toward the fulfillment of that goal.
As a result of the September 2015 sale of our California Cement business, comparability of results for the Cement segment will be affected throughout the year. The 2015 impact of the California Cement operations is detailed on Slide 5. Our remaining Cement business, which is entirely in Texas, benefited from considerably better weather, but importantly, strong demand, which is forecasted by the Portland Cement Association to continue for the next several years. For the quarter, the business generated nearly $70 million of net sales and $33 million of gross profit. This translated to a 47% gross margin, which increased over 1,000 basis points as compared to the prior year period. EBITDA for the Cement business was $37.8 million, a 37.5% increase from the prior year quarter. 
Lastly, the Magnesia Specialties business delivered record first quarter net sales of $59.5 million. The Magnesia Specialties team continues to diligently manage the cost profile of the business. And despite U.S. steel capacity utilization being nearly 2.5% lower than the prior year quarter, our business delivered gross margin expansion of 430 basis points to a first quarter record 38.6% gross profit margin.
Looking at our entire business, given the strong first quarter performance and increasingly positive outlooks for the Southeast, most of Texas and our downstream businesses, we have raised our full year EBITDA guidance. We now anticipate a range of $1 billion to $1,050,000,000 of EBITDA with increased profitability and margin expansion expected across nearly every business line. 
The broad-based acceleration in construction recovery is visible in all 3 primary end-use markets. Again, first quarter growth was driven by large projects in the Mid-America and Southeast Groups with a 25% and a 11% increase, respectively, in infrastructure shipments. Notably, important cities in the Carolinas are enjoying the benefits of this trend. Places like Charlotte are benefiting from the new I-77 HOT lanes P3 project and ongoing work at the Charlotte Douglas International Airport. Also, Charleston, South Carolina has significant port growth as well as strong attended infrastructure development. 
Similarly, in the southeast, the long anticipated I-4 activity in Florida contributed to the positive quarter-over-quarter change. Overall, Aggregates product line shipments to the infrastructure end-use market accounted for approximately 39% of our shipments and increased 13% over the prior year quarter. We are encouraged by solid growth across this end-use market resulting from state-level funding initiatives passed just last year. With the acceleration of projects in North Carolina, Georgia and Iowa, combined with another year of robust Texas Department of Transportation program lettings, we expect continued meaningful demand growth.
The nonresidential end-use market comprised of 2 components, light construction and heavy construction, accounted for 33% of quarterly aggregate shipments and increased 14% as compared with the prior year quarter. The light component is primarily office and retail, with demand generally tied to employment growth and residential demand. Consistent with the drivers, light nonresidential aggregates volumes increased 20%, led by nearly 26% growth in the Mid-America Group. Following several years of modest recovery in this area of our business, strong employment growth and residential activity in North Carolina is driving increased nonresidential construction investment. The heavy nonresidential construction component is primarily industrial building as well as energy and energy-related activity. These shipments represented 24% of quarterly Aggregates product line volumes and increased 12% compared with the first quarter of 2015. 
The residential market accounted for 18% of quarterly Aggregates product line shipments and reported a 20% increase compared with the prior year quarter. Strength in housing activity is evident across the United States, as housing permits, starts and completions are each up more than 10% for the trailing 12 months ended March 2016. Although U.S. housing activity remains well below historic averages, the re-acceleration of growth in our key states, particularly in the Southeastern portion of the country, is expected to drive increased aggregates demand throughout the year. The ChemRock/Rail market accounted for the remaining 10% of Aggregates product line volumes and increased slightly. 
Consolidated gross profit margin was nearly 20% and expanded by the previously mentioned 790 basis points over the prior year first quarter, reflecting margin expansion in all reportable segments. Robust demand and much improved weather conditions drove significant growth for the ready-mixed concrete and Cement businesses, which increased gross profit margins by 810 basis points and over 1,000 basis points respectively. 
To summarize the growth in our consolidated results, first quarter 2016 delivered record net sales of $734 million, an increase of $102 million or 16%; gross profit of $145 million, an increase of $70 million or 95%; record earnings from operations of $84 million, an increase of 228%; and EBITDA of $153 million, an increase of 67%. Net earnings growth drove a 91% increase in operating cash flow in the first quarter to $67 million compared with $35 million in the prior year quarter.
During the quarter, we repurchased an additional 1 million shares of our common stock in line with our stated capital allocation strategy. And together with our dividend, we returned $176 million to our shareholders. We have authorization to repurchase up to 20 million shares of our stock. Since the initial share repurchase authorization in February 2015, through the end of the first quarter 2016, we repurchased 4.3 million shares, returning nearly $670 million to shareholders. As a result, 15.7 million shares remain under the current authorization.
Finally, our ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated EBITDA for the trailing 12 months ended March 2016 was 2.1x, in compliance with our leverage covenant and in line with our targeted leverage of 2x.
As we also noted in today's earnings release, we have upwardly revised our 2016 guidance for Aggregates volume and EBITDA. Our improved outlook reflects additional strength in underlying demand, and increased margin expansion from our original projections. We're confident that continued positive employment growth in our key markets, strong contractor backlogs and normal weather patterns would drive more than $1 billion of EBITDA in 2016, a new milestone for Martin Marietta. You will also note that we increased our expectations for public sector growth from mid-single digits to mid- to high single digit volume growth in 2016. The growth reflects continued state and/or municipal-level funding initiatives that are positively impacting several of our key states, including Texas, North Carolina, Colorado, Iowa, Georgia and Florida.
To conclude, we are very pleased with our first quarter performance and improved expectations for the balance of the year. We're positioned to deliver record results as we continue to recognize the considerable benefits of our unwavering focus on our leading positions in economically diverse, high-growth markets. We remain committed to the diligent execution of our strategic plan, steadfast to our core foundational pillars and dedicated to delivering increased shareholder value.

So really, we're not going to look at Q1 and let that necessarily dictate the way the entire rest of the year looks. To answer your question very directly relative to what we saw as pull-forward, as you recall when we ended the year last year, we thought we had probably 3.5 million to 4 million tons of aggregates that we felt like had some form of deferral because of the remarkably wet weather that we've experienced in 2015. Our best estimate is we saw about 1 million ton pull forward in Q1. Our guess, as we're looking forward, is that's probably not a bad number for you to think about relative to Q2 and Q3, with the number then getting marginally smaller as we go into Q4. So again, from a timing perspective, based on what we see on infrastructure, we just feel like this is the first quarter. Again, trying to address the other piece of your question, what did we see pull forward, I'd tried to address very specifically what we saw in the quarter and what we anticipate in the quarters going forward."

North Carolina has put forward a budget that could add up to $1.1 billion -- $1 billion through the biennium. And what we saw after North Carolina did that last fall was the acceleration of about 90 projects in North Carolina. Some of those were going out as far as 2025 and even beyond. So we're seeing that type of pull-forward, not just here in our home state. We're seeing that to a degree in Georgia as well. Governor Deal came forward with a series of projects that he would like to see accelerated. So I think we will see some of that this year. If you recall, last year, we had seen the gas price -- the gas tax go up in Iowa. It was going to add about 30% to what that state DOT could do. We've also seen some near-term initiatives in Nebraska that will clearly be more profoundly felt next year. We've also seen good activity, not just at the state level in Colorado, but we've also seen it at the municipal level in Colorado. Colorado Springs has put some very specific plans in place that will help drive volumes, we feel like, in southern Colorado to a degree even this year. So Kathryn, what I would say, are state and local initiatives helping in some places now? Yes. Will that continue, I think, to be even more profound as we go into next year? I think the answer to that is, yes as well. Remember, to the extent that we get a benefit from the FAST Act that's going to, principally, be a 2017 and after event. We will likely feel some of that in some discrete markets this year, but we will likely feel more state impact in those markets and then probably the 1, 2 impact of that beginning more in earnest in 2017."

One, volume always helps, and more volume in the East always helps, too. So if we come and take a look at, really, what had happened if we're just looking at margin guidance in the Eastern United States, in particular, if we're seeing volumes, obviously, moving in a better direction in North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia, that's an awfully nice help. And the fact is if you look at incrementals for the business, we were right on target or ahead of target, if you look at the numbers that we put forward. But interestingly, if you take a look at Mid-America, that group had margin improvement to 46% versus 37% in the first quarter of last year. But here's the trick to it, Kathryn. The Mid-Atlantic Division was almost 70%, Mideast was 42% and the Midwest, really, this time of year doesn't make any money because they're caught up in winter. So again, as we're looking at the type of improvement that we think we can see, where that's going to come from is going to matter. The other piece of it that matters is we were able to operate remarkably more efficiently in Texas simply because it was dry. So if you pull together 2 different things: one, more normalized or friendly weather, which helps; and then a certain degree of geographic mix that helps as well. The simple fact is, Kathryn, we could do something this quarter we haven't been able to do in a while. We had a dry track to run on and we just put the reins down and let the horse go. And when you do that, those are the types of results that we think we can see."

And keep in mind, that does include the cost of the fixed priced hedge that we have in that. So really, if we look at it and think of it in our numbers, the hedge actually gave us about a $4.5 million headwind as we're going through the quarter. As a reminder, the hedge wraps up at the end of this year. But if we also look ahead, I can give you a good sense of what gallons looked like last year. We did 9.9 gallons -- 9.9 million Q1 this year versus 9.2 million Q1 last year. In Q2 last year, we did a little bit more than 11 million gallons. In Q3, it was almost 12 million gallons. In Q4, it was a little bit over 10.1 million for a total of almost 42.5 million gallons. So that will give you a sense of it. The other thing that I would say is if we're looking back to Q1 last year, diesel is at $2.04 versus the $1.84 this year.

If we're looking at what the cost of nat gas was, that was down about 32% for the quarter. So nat gas was giving that a tailwind. But even while steel was down 2.5% versus where it was last quarter, it was still at that 70% number that Anne referenced in the last conversation that we were just having with Kathryn. And candidly, 70% isn't an overheated number. I mean, we built that business with that very capable team, recognizing that 70 was probably a pretty safe number to have out there. And look, are we awfully proud of seeing margins at 38% when you got steel at 70%? I think those are tremendous numbers, and I think that team really should take a bow.

Garik, as I sit here and really just think about our Aggregates business and take a measure of it, what I would say to you is, it wouldn't surprise me at the end of the year to have a record year in the Rocky Mountain division. It wouldn't surprise me to have a record year in our Midwest division. I think we're going to have a record year in our Southwest division. We're going to have a remarkably better year in our Southeast division, and we're going to have remarkably better year in our Mid-Atlantic division.

That 21% market share or in that ZIP Code is not a place that we think is a bad place for our business to be. I've also referenced the fact that we, I believe, can be a remarkably efficient producer of cement in that marketplace as well. I think one reason that you saw a modest pullback perhaps in the pricing is we've seen relatively good activity on volumes as you saw. And what we've also done is we've had some wholesale sales, particularly in that North Texas market, to other producers that are in that marketplace. And the wholesale prices clearly go at a different number. So if I'm looking at, probably, about 40,000 tons that we sold in the quarter that were wholesale tons, and then take a look at really what were some product mix issues. Simply -- really selling more customers picking our product FOB to plant, and I would say that was more driven in South Texas than it was driven in North Texas. And then back to -- as we discussed in February, there are some competitive dynamics there that we're sensitive to. I think when you tally those together, it brings you to the point that you see in the full results. What I believe is if we have the weather in Texas that I think we're going to have, I think we're likely to have a very active year in Texas. I like the way I'm seeing our ready-mix business run. Frankly, I like the way I'm seeing other ready-mix businesses run in Texas right now. I think the fact is it's pretty conceivable that you could have cement shortages in Texas as we get to the main part of the year. And I'll let you draw your own conclusions on what that may mean relative to cement pricing going forward. Again, as we're looking at this business from an efficiency perspective, on pricing and really running it for profitability, I'm very comfortable with where that is. The other thing that's interesting to me, Garik, is to see what's going on with cement pricing in other parts of the United States as well. So if I'm looking in places like Colorado, or the Carolinas or otherwise, I'm seeing cement prices in those markets that are at times $25 or more a ton of where we sit in Texas right now, which gives me a sense we've got some nice runway ahead of us on this. But keep in mind, as we take a look at where we sit on pricing in cement in Texas today, we're 20% up in South Texas from where the prices were when we combined with TXI, and we're 30% up in North Texas of where prices were. So I have tried to give you some context. I apologize for the length of my response, but I think the context is important."

As I look at aggregates pricing, here's what I would say. We've got 17 out of 20 districts where it's just remarkably positive. We've got almost half of those where it's up at least $1 a ton and several districts where we're up $2 a ton. So we're see",392,"Yes. As I look at aggregates pricing, here's what I would say. We've got 17 out of 20 districts where it's just remarkably positive. We've got almost half of those where it's up at least $1 a ton and several districts where we're up $2 a ton. So we're seeing nice price movement in really important markets. The only markets where we're not seeing remarkable price movement, it's fascinating to me, we got some freight adjustments that we had to deal with in some, and we simply have some mix issues in others. So I am looking quarry by quarry, product by product. I'm seeing good price increases in all of those. What I would say, too, Jerry, is we're in a marketplace where volumes continue to go up. So pricing, as you know, having botched this going through the cycle, behaved exceptionally well even in a down market. From where I'm sitting right now, Jerry, I think trying to measure it going forward if F.W. Dodge is a good indicator. Dodge right now is looking at 3 good years ahead of us right now. We probably would have said the same thing last year, and that was before we ended up with the 5-year Highway Bill. So as we're sitting here, Jerry, I think the rhythm and cadence of price increases this year won't be dramatically different than they were last year, for example. I think they've been very strong so far. I think you're going to have a geographic mix that's going to give a tailwind to the way pricing is looking. But I also think that what we said for the last couple of years is entirely true. And that is the Western United States on a percentage basis has more pricing power ahead of it than does the East, simply because the East is a more mature market, prices are higher so your percentages up won't be as great. But again, as North Carolina continues to recover, as Georgia continues to recover, as Florida continues to recover and as places like Dallas-Fort Worth, as I referenced in my opening comments, have the type of volume growth and pricing growth that they're experiencing, the pricing story we think will continue to be a very good one, not just for a matter of quarters, probably for a matter of years."

Now do I think Colorado is going to be there from a time perspective at the same time as Texas is? No, I don't. It's going to move a little bit more slowly than Texas.

Keep in mind, what we move by rail in the United States all by itself, ignoring everything else that's shipped by truck or otherwise, is the top 10 aggregates producer in the United States.

At the same time, you're close enough to the Gulf in areas like Houston that you tend to have areas that can dry out relatively well, particularly if they have a windy circumstance. So I'll put it this way, James. May is an important month. It always has been. The 2 months in the Aggregates business that tend to be disproportionately important are May and October. May, because this is the first time across the geographic footprint that you have every bit of your business, usually, really hitting on almost all cylinders and October because that's the last month that, a, is usually dry and a lot of contractors feel like by the time they get to Thanksgiving, in many respects, they'll be packing up their equipment for the year.

But we're seeing good nonres in that market. We're also seeing good nonres in Dallas, in Denver, in Orlando, in College Station in Texas as well. So the nonres that we're seeing looks pretty good. I think one data point that's probably worth knowing is 6 of the Martin Marietta states rank in the top 10 for growth in nonres starts. And 2 of those states include Florida and Colorado. I think a lot of it, Adam, really comes back to this notion that we discussed, I think, a lot over the last couple of years because we were hoping that it would come to fruition the way that it has. Where you are matters. And as we're looking at the states in which we have leading positions, and keep in mind those leading positions today, 1 or 2 are in 85% versus 65% of our markets 5 years ago. We've tried to position ourselves in states that have near-term and long-term growth and that tend to have multiple economic drivers in them as well. So again, I don't think the nonres story is dramatically different. But we are seeing some of those very large projects, for example, in South Texas firm up and we're sticking those backlogs even more capably in our hip pocket right now."

Colorado is going to have both, separate and distinct from what's going on in Colorado Springs. Iowa has both. Nebraska has both. Texas has both. Remember, the extra funding that comes through Texas just from Prop 7, by the time we get to September 2017, is more money than the increase on a per annum basis than you see even the FAST Act. So the FAST Act is nice because it does put dollars there. But the primary component of the FAST Act that's going to be helpful is time.

So that's not a problem. What I would say is this, when you look at Q1, don't ever take Q1 in a vacuum as really a good litmus test on exactly what's going on in pricing. Going back to the conversation that we had a few minutes ago, the Midwest is not cranking during Q1. The Mideast is not cranking into Q1. So what you're seeing in Q1 is a lot of North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida, all of which in the Eastern U.S. are pretty high-priced markets. And then you're obviously seeing pricing in Texas, particularly North Texas, move at very nice percentages. So what I would tell you is you're going to continue to see good robust pricing. But what's going to happen is when Mideast, which is principally Indiana and Ohio, and the Midwest, which is principally Iowa and Minnesota and Nebraska come in. Those tend to be more corporate average-y on pricing. So again, I think we feel very comfortable with the percentages that we put out there. To your question an asphalt. Here is the way I would think of it, if we look at asphalt, we did about 2.1 million tons of asphalt last year in the Rocky Mountain division. As you really look at it now, that's the only asphalt that we have left. So we did sell, frankly, a pretty modest asphalt position that we had around the San Antonio marketplace. So the fact that we don't have that business anymore is not going to be a dramatic driver or not on what we're seeing relative to our business. With respect to liquid asphalt or bitumen and where it is, Mike, my guess is that story is going to change a lot, back to what I've said before, depending on where you are in the marketplace. Here is the circumstance up and down the Front Range in Colorado. And when I speak to the Front Range, I'm really talking about the I-25 corridor that's where 80% of the people who live in Colorado reside. That market is very, very busy right now on public. It's very, very busy on private res and nonres. And in large part, you've got a good asphalt market, particularly on subdivision side and on the infrastructure side. And a lot of the work in Colorado, particularly 1 year, 1.5 years ago was having to be let a couple, sometimes -- more times because they weren't having enough bidders who're available. That's going to be a tight market relative to aggregate. It's going to be a tight market relative to contractors who are able to do much of that work. And again, I think as we're looking at our asphalt business that is principally a Colorado asphalt business, we feel pretty good about it. Now relative to your question on how did it do in the first quarter, it didn't really do much in the first quarter. And we don't expect it to do much in the first quarter. Again, because you are there in the Rocky Mountains.

Again, I think this is really more of a story that, candidly, we're not that surprised by. We think we've got a very good position in ready-mix both in Texas and in Colorado. I'm particularly pleased to see what we're doing in Texas, though, relative to the EBITDA. Because part of what we'd said before, we would like to see those margins in Texas approach what we see in margins in Colorado. So if we're looking at EBITDA-ish this year in the Southwest of $38 million, if we're able to do in the Southwest on margins what we've been seeing ourselves do in Colorado that could translate at the right day and the right hour to about $75 million in gross margin. So it's a -- one, it was a very good story in the first quarter. Two, we expect it to be a good story for the rest of the year, but we also expect to see that Texas business continue to do better."

With me today is Anne Lloyd, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. 
To facilitate today's discussion, we've made available during this webcast and on our website supplemental financial information which we believe will be helpful. As detailed specifically on Slide 2, please remember that today's teleconference may include forward-looking statements as defined by securities laws in connection with future events or future operating or financial performance. Like other businesses, we're subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially. Except as legally required, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether resulting from new information, future developments or otherwise. We refer you to the legal disclaimers contained in our second quarter earnings release and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which are available on both our own and the SEC websites. 
Also, as a reminder, any margin references in our discussion are based on net sales and exclude freight and delivery revenues. These and other non-GAAP measures are explained in our supplemental financial information on our website and in our SEC filings. 
As detailed in our release distributed earlier this morning, Martin Marietta delivered strong top line and bottom line growth in a record-setting second quarter. These results were driven by broad-based gains across majority of the company's geographic footprint. 
Importantly, this was enabled by our strategic approach of developing leading positions in markets along higher growth corridors possessing attractive near and long-term economic characteristics. 
For the quarter, we delivered record net sales of $915 million, an increase of 8% or $65 million gain over the second quarter of last year. That increase, combined with an improvement in our gross margin, led to record gross profit and net earnings. In fact, gross profit increased $47 million and net earnings increased $40 million, respectively. These outstanding results underscored the earnings power of our business model as well as the overall health of our markets and demonstrate our ability to capitalize on improving economic conditions. 
Consolidated gross profit margin expanded 340 basis points to nearly 27% and diluted earnings per share of $1.90 increased 56% both compared with the prior year quarter. The efficiencies achieved by our steadfast commitment to operational excellence is also evident and on a consolidated basis for every $1 in net sales, our operations delivered $0.71 of additional gross profit, above our stated target of 60%. 
As will be expanded upon in a moment, we're pleased to note that in addition to increased volume, widespread pricing improvement contributed significantly to the quarter's results. Aggregates product line pricing increased 7%, led by the West Group's 10% growth with notable strength across our Texas and Colorado footprints. The ready-mixed concrete business delivered a 15% increase in pricing, again, with strength in both Texas and Colorado, led by robust pricing along the I-35 corridor, running from North to South through Dallas, Austin and San Antonio, Texas. 
Despite the near-term threefold impact of adverse weather conditions, declining railroad balanced volumes and lower direct shale energy shipments, our aggregates product line delivered volume growth of 1.3%. 
During the quarter, poor weather in our top markets nearly rivaled that experience in the second quarter 2015. We faced extremely wet conditions particularly in the first 2 months of the second quarter in many of our key states, including Texas and the Carolinas as shown in the divisional precipitation mass on Slide 5. 
As forecasted by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the El Niño weather pattern, which began in the second quarter of 2015 continued through May 2016. What does that mean? Last year, we reported that enough rain fell in Texas to meet New York City's water needs for 7 years. This May, the National Weather Service reported 35 trillion gallons of rain fell in Texas, enough to cover the entire state in water [indiscernible]. 
This rainfall led to extreme flooding due to saturated land conditions from an already very wet spring. Saturated soils are significant impediment to new construction activity. 
The Mid-America Group led the company with a nearly 5% increase I n aggregates product line shipments driven by acceleration of residential and nonresidential construction activity across the Carolinas. The Southeast Group shipments increased nearly 2%. Large infrastructure projects in Georgia and Florida were catalyst for growth in the Southeast Group, but were partially offset by lower balanced shipments. The West Group, where shipments were affected by heavy rainfall, reported a 3% decline, including the volumes related to the recently completed Colorado acquisitions. 
In addition to weather-deferred shipments, the West Group aggregate product line volumes were impacted by declines in shale-related shipments, delays associated with several Texas Department of Transportation projects and lower balanced sales due to reduced capital and maintenance expenditures by railroads as highlighted in recent press releases from that industry group.  These factors drove the West Group's negative volume comparison to prior year. 
Overall, aggregates shipments for the first half of 2016 increased over 6%, in line with our full year expectations. The pace and trajectory of volume increases are particularly visible along the high-growth corridors to the Carolinas, Georgia and into Florida. 
As anticipated, economic recovery in the Southeastern United States is accelerating. 
For example, Georgia's net tax revenue collections through this past May compared to last year's comparable period were up nearly 10% or $1.7 billion. 
Further, product demand in portions of the Carolinas have us considering adding work shifts to better serve customer needs. We expect continued steady construction growth in this important part of our geography to complement expansion in other regions of the country. 
The ready-mixed concrete product line is benefiting from strong demand in North Texas and Colorado. Robust volumes, combined with improved cost performance, together with modestly improving operating conditions, drove 43% increase in net sales and a 560 basis point expansion of gross margin. The expectation remains for our Texas ready-mixed concrete profit margins to continue to improve similar to the pattern experienced in our Colorado-based business. We view the results for the 6 months of the year as confirmation at our expectations are well-placed. 
For the second quarter, the Cement business generated nearly $60 million of net sales and $24 million of gross profit, representing a 40% gross margin. Note that as a result of the September 2015 sale of our California Cement business, comparability of results for this segment will be affected throughout the year. The 2015 impact of the California Cement operations is detailed on Slide 6. 
Lastly, the Magnesia Specialties business delivered another solid quarter, with second quarter net sales of nearly $59 million. Our continued focus on diligently managing the cost profile of the business led to a gross profit margin of 36.8%, an expansion of 170 basis points versus the prior year second quarter. 
Varying degrees of construction recovery are visible in all 3 primary and used markets. Infrastructure shipments accounted for approximately 43% of our aggregates' volume and increased 1.3% over the prior year quarter, driven by large projects in the Southeast Group. 
Notably, the acceleration of projects in the Atlanta market along the I-95 and I-75 corridors in addition to continued I-4 activity in Central Florida enabled positive quarter-over-quarter growth despite the impact of weather delayed shipments in the Mid-America and West Group. 
Importantly, we continue to see increasing demand across this end-use market and remain confident in its study and meaningful growth particularly as we move into 2017 and begin to see and enjoy the benefits of increased federal highway spending under the FAST Act and the multiple state initiatives. Among them, the Texas Department of Transportation plans to spend $70 billion on its highway from 2017 to 2026, especially in the growing Martin Marietta metro areas such as Dallas, San Antonio, Austin and Houston, doubling the prior decade's record investment level. 
The nonresidential end-use market comprised of 2 components: Light construction and heavy construction accounted for 33% of aggregate shipments in the quarter and increased 2.8% compared with the prior year quarter. The light component is primarily office and retail construction with demand generally tied to employment growth and residential demand. While the heavy nonresidential component is primarily industrial building as well as energy and energy-related activity. 
Growth in the nonresidential end-use market was led by an approximate 14% increase in the Mid-America Group, driven by office and retail development in North Carolina resulting from continued employment gains and solid residential activity. 
The residential market accounted for 17% of quarterly aggregates product line shipments and reported a nearly 11% increase compared with prior year quarter. Strength in housing activity is evident across the United States as starts and completions are inched up considerably for the trailing 12 months ended June 2016. 
While U.S. housing activity remains well below historic averages, the re-acceleration of growth in our key states, particularly in the Southeastern portion of the country, is expected to drive increased aggregates demand throughout the remainder of the year. 
The ChemRock/Rail market accounted for the remaining 7% of aggregates product line volumes, which decreased compared to the prior year quarter as a result of reduced ballast sales. 
In addition to our quarterly results presented in today's earnings release, we also provided 2 updates to portions of our previously provided guidance. 
First, SG&A guidance of $220 million has been increased to a range of $225 million to $230 million. This modest change is primarily related to the timing and value share-based compensation. 
Second, the company guidance on 2016 cement pricing change, current expectations are for full year increase of 2% to 4%. This change lowered our full year outlook for the Cement business' net sales by $10 million and results primarily from the sharp downturn in energy and energy-related activity.  We believe markets have now broadly stabilized and anticipate healthier pricing momentum as the company benefits from its leading positions in high-growth Texas regions. 
To summarize, our consolidated second quarter results by virtually every meaningful and controllable metric, Martin Marietta delivered a very strong quarter, highlighted by record net sales, record gross profit and record net earnings. 
Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization, was over $266 million for the quarter, an increase of $60 million. EBITDA as a percentage of net sales, excluding freight and delivery revenues, expanded 478 basis points to over 29%, approaching our prior peak level of EBITDA margin on 20% fewer times. 
During the quarter, we repurchased an additional 215,000 shares of our common stock for $40 million and together with our dividend, we returned $66 million to our shareholders. 
We have authorization to repurchase up to 20 million shares of our stock. Since the initial share repurchase authorization in February 2015 through the end of the second quarter 2016, we repurchased 4.5 million shares, which, coupled with our sustained dividend, returned $869 million to shareholders. 
As a result, 15.5 million shares remain under the current authorization. 
Finally, our ratio of consolidated net debt to consolidated EBITDA for the trailing 12 months ended June 2016 was 1.98x in compliance with our leverage covenant and in line with our targeted leverage of 2x. 
As we look forward to the balance of the year and beyond, we expect continued steady growth in construction activity in our markets. Both Dodge and PCA forecast growth in construction starts for the balance of 2016 and the next several years. The Dodge Momentum Index, which measures the initial report of nonresidential construction projects and tends to lead nonresidential construction spending by 1 full year, increased over 11% in June to 134.4, its highest level since early 2009. 
Residential construction permits starts and completions remains strong. Infrastructure activity should continue to accelerate as the FAST Act and other state initiatives drive increased construction of highways, streets, roads and bridges. 
Strong employment gains would serve as a key indicator of economic growth underpinned the construction forecast. In fact, of our key states [indiscernible] ranks second nationally in job growth; Texas ranks third; Georgia ranks fourth and North Carolina ranks eighth. 
A host of key metropolitan areas in our markets had employment gains above 3%, including Dallas and Austin, Texas; Atlanta, Georgia; Orlando, Tampa and Jacksonville, Florida; Raleigh, North Carolina and Charleston, South Carolina. 
To conclude, we are very pleased with our second quarter performance, and we're well positioned to deliver solid results in the last half of the year. We will continue to realize the considerable benefit of our superior geographic positions, operating in markets that are economically diverse and high-growth. We remain committed to the diligent execution of our strategic plan. Steadfast to our core foundation of pillars of operational excellence, cost discipline, customer satisfaction and sustainability and dedicated to delivering increased shareholder value.

What I would say is volumes are down approximately 2 million tons for the quarter based on what we thought it would be and, really, as we rack it up, it falls into 3 different buckets. Number one, I would say shale volume was down about 750,000 tons versus the prior year. So that's your first bridge number. Your second bridge number, Kathryn, should be on the railroad balance. We saw that down about 250,000 tons compared to the prior year. But still the single largest moving factor there is relative to what we experienced with respect to weather. We're seeing tonnage affected by weather somewhere between 1 million and 1.5 million tons a quarter. So that gives you your bridge. The other part of your question, I think, it's a good one, Kathryn, is what are we looking relative to backlogs and how does that feel. And what I would say, in particular, Texas last year, had the wettest May in history. This year, it had one other wettest May in history. I mentioned that because if we simply look at a portion of the Texas market, let's look at what we got in North Texas, we've got about 3.6 million tons of backlog in North Texas and only about 600,000 of that shift during the first half of 2016. So clearly, there's pretty considerable A, backlog and pretty considerable jam up on that backlog. There's some big jobs that are really waiting to go in more robust fashion U.S. 380, near Denton is one of them. State Highway 175 outside of Dallas is another, and Interstate 45 and 35 both had considerable work. So from a volume perspective, what did we see deferred? It was the 2 million tons broken down into those buckets that I gave you relative to large projects and what the backlog looks like. We feel very comfortable with our backlog, at this position, we just need to be able to go on a number of those jobs, particularly textile jobs. Kathryn, was that a good response?"

If we look at what's going on in Colorado, in the Rocky Mountain everything within the borders of Colorado, which really very healthy. The only place in the Rocky Mountain group that we're seeing any degree of volume struggle is outside of Colorado, where it's more balanced driven. So we do have some ballast rise in Utah, we have 1 up in Wyoming as well, so we are seeing some pressure of those back in the same issues that we discussed before. What I will tell you is what we're seeing in Metro Denver, what we're seeing North of Denver, what we're seeing South of Denver, whether its aggregates, ready-mix or hot mix is only very, very healthy marketplace, particularly downstream paving, we're getting considerably more work this year than we were last year at the same time. I want to say for the quarter, we had been on nearly 35 more jobs in Metro in North than we've been on last year. So we see Colorado being very busy not just for the balance of this year. We see Colorado being very busy for next year. With respect to the other part of your question on North Carolina, we're seeing a very healthy sharp so that's been a market that has continued to perform well. Importantly, as we go East in Charlotte and get to triad, we're seeing considerably more infrastructure work in Greensboro, High Point and Winston-Salem. That's a part of the state because of textiles, furniture and other manufacturing that suffered more than the rest of the state, we are now seeing both residential and nonresidential recovery in that marketplace. As we come further East yet and hit Raleigh-Durham and Chapel Hill, infrastructure work here is very healthy. Multifamily residential has been very, very healthy. Residential is starting to move in the direction that we would expect so again, we're seeing a much healthier North Carolina. The part of this state is still waiting for more economic fuse to hit are the more costal areas that are continuing to get better and better quarter after quarter. So I didn't want to make sure I went through those areas pretty clearly with you, Kathryn."

That cannot do over because they have thousands of miles of track that they need to maintain. So that's not a matter of if, it's a matter of when. I think with respect to the second part of your question, I think what's going to happen is aggregate business will likely get better service under railroads because we have been a very steady customer all the way through. So if you go back to the notion that with a larger shippers stoned, on 4 out of the 5 Class I railroads and our network is at least double the next largest network, our ability, I believe, to move stone from stone producing areas to stone starts parts of the country, particularly in South Texas and along the Gulf and Atlantic Coast will oddly enough most likely be held by the circumstance."

Keep in mind that the numbers that we put out at the beginning of the year were based on the balanced numbers that we had been supplied by Class I railroads. So again, the dialogue is active with them. They've been very clear that was going to be back half pushed. If we're looking simply to the grid power volume or others down on the different railroads, I mean, the fact is we can look at year-to-date car volume, UP is down 10%, CFX is down almost 7%, North of [indiscernible] almost 6%.  So you can clearly see why they would pull that. I think going back to Kathryn's point in her question, it can only be held back so long. And keep in mind, a lot of these places, too, have seen pretty considerable flooding in the first half of the year. So railroads have been underwater and have seen that type duress. They will have needs as we head into the back half of the year. Now in fairness, if we are looking at headwinds and tailwinds could be and it's probably a good moment to think about that as we do at this question, I would clearly put that in a potential headwind for us as we go into the back half of the year. So I really think about those probably in 2 different ranches, Jerry. I think tailwinds that we have going into the back half of the year is the rate and trajectory of recovery into Carolinas and Southeast and some of that, by the way , could be ballast. I think another tailwind that we have a strong demand in Midwest and Rocky Mountains and I think strong contracted backlog is a tailwind as well. So I think you got those 3. But I do think that if you are looking at both the headwinds are, I think that ballast shipments could be a headwind. And if we don't see some improvement into the back half of the year, there are probably 600,000-ish tons that could be at risk there. Clearly, we do need good normal weather for the balance of the year, and we do need TxDOT to have more of their work going in a more timely basis. Now the other issue and I don't think the railroad necessarily suffer from this, but I think a lot of other trades do right now, getting truck drivers, tradesmen, welders, other things simple within the supply chain are under varying degrees of duress in different parts of the country. So I do think there's some headwinds, I do think there's some tailwinds and I give you that in the context of I do believe ballast is the potential headwind. So fair enough here."

I mean, streets starts were down 16%, but again, our view was we're going to see an expected recovery in half 2 and really more going into '17. What fascinating to me, Jerry, is to go back and take a look at some of the key states and look at it over not a several month period but over a 2014 to 2016 time frame relative to the subject.

North Carolina, the change on a percentage '14 to '16, 58%; Nebraska, same time frame, up 41%; Iowa, up 18%; Arkansas, up 11%; South Carolina, up 53%; Florida, up 18% now with the same time frame because you did see a pullback, is Texas down, it is.

Because operating at the type of environment at which they're operating is challenging because it stop starts. And these businesses don't do stop start very well. Here's what I'll tell you. I look at cost structure, momentum on the labor side it's been very good, momentum on energy has been very good, momentum on maintenance and repair has gotten considerably better. One of the things that we did last year, in particular, as we accelerated the purchase of some rolling stock, particularly in the Midwest and United States and in some of my earlier comments, I spoke to the fact that, that's going to be a business that's going to be as busy this year as it can be until snow fly there. And what we saw with incremental additions to rolling stock in that marketplace is was on maintenance and repair hit considerably better. So again, our cost structure is doing what I believe our cost structure we're doing again our teams have done exceptional work. The other piece of it that I think it's worth remembering is in large part we're watching the price fall to the bottom line, and that has really been very powerful. And if you think about what you're seeing relative to the price increases, you've heard us say that for a matter of months, but you've heard us say for a matter of years that it will be most likely that you would see the Western United States on a percentage basis price increase outperform the Eastern United States and particularly in parts of Texas. And that's what we're seeing. I think the other thing to your point, Garik, on what it looks like going forward I think you've heard us refer to in the past is that we believe in time, Colorado, we start to see that same type of pricing performance with a lag behind Texas. We're starting to see evidence of that taking shape as well. So to your question on incrementals, cost performance has been really very good. Capital deployment has continued to drive down cost in areas that needed to drive down, prices falling to the bottom line, and importantly, it's doing exactly what we thought. And keep in mind, we thought we would see these better incrementals early on in the cycle. So, so far, no surprises."

That's what drives the 2 to 4 pricing that we're showing up. Clearly, when we spoke about Texas on the last earnings call, we said we thought.
Q1 maybe going into Q2, it's going to be a shakeout period where pricing in Texas. Obviously, you've got imports that have come in at least the port of Houston that are modestly different than what you see over the last several years. At the same time, part of what we're doing, particularly in North Texas is we're serving more of our own cement needs in that marketplace as well. So when we're looking at shipping more cement farther to feed some of our ready-mix operations. And you've also got some of the competitive postures that have been in that marketplace. Of that in my way of thinking is what has really helped the price down in addition to the weather that we saw. So as we look at it clearly, pricing in North Texas is better than it's been in South Texas. We're seeing increases in both markets, and we feel like we've now seen nice stability in that marketplace. I can tell you, we're seeing bidding in North Texas today at numbers much closer to the 112, 113, 114 type numbers, and that's more in line with what we would have expected."

We're looking at ASPs in that overall market in the Southwest up almost 17%. So if we're looking at that type of performance in Texas, it's much better. But I'll tell you as we look across 5 different districts of ready-mix in that marketplace. There's only one that has ASPs less than $100 a cubic yard. That's getting them into a much more acceptable type of level. So yes, it's getting better in Texas. While weather was really wet, and was not necessarily ready-mix's friend.

So clearly, I was saying that before we had A, interest of potential rain flooding across the entire state of Texas. So I guess my view is not that far removed for PCA as because if we look at what we think to be capacity additions to Texas over the next several years and who knows if all those come forward even with those capacity additions, what you're seeing is about a 3 million-ton per annum shortfall of cement. So what Texas not had genuinely for 24 months period is normal weather. They have not had a normal Texas summer and our sense is that's going to happen. And when that happens in construction activity on the public side, which is half of our business is as robust as we believe it will and when places like Dallas continue to be as they are today, the best housing market in the United States, those are the types of formulas that come together to create cement shortages in that type of circumstance."

To give you a compare, last year in the second quarter, I look at over 1 million tons, but that wasn't going great guns last year. This sector doesn't stay down, this sector is going to have a return. Do I think the sectors going back to the type of volume that we were seeing in 2014, which by the way, was almost 7.5 million tons? I don't think it goes there. But I think it could very well go back to numbers that we were seeing at least in '15 or maybe in '16 if we look at full year '15, that was 3.6 million tons. So basically half of what it had been in '14. I'm not sure that somewhere between that 2 5 and 3 5 would be a good steady run rate for energy as it returns, and again, I think we're pretty well placed to serve that when it does."

Equally if you take a look at where we are relative to what's going on with natural gas pricing, I mean, you've got a 21% cost reduction versus prior year so if you've got steel at over 70%, you've got nat gas down 21%, that's helps a lot.

So we're looking at ASPs in the Rocky Mountains, for example, that are higher than they are in the Southwest. And that's one reason I say that's a more mature business. But what I would say in the Southwest is, if we're looking at type of growth that I believe we're looking at in North Texas, if we're looking at the type of growth that I think we're looking at in the other markets that are close to that and with some of the large vertically-integrated jobs that we have in South Texas that have multiple years ahead of them, again, I would say this is a game that's in relatively early innings in Texas right now. If you go back to the comments that I had in my prepared remarks, we anticipate seeing, from return in other perspective the Texas business looking more and more like the Colorado business. And as we said, we believe the results that we've seen so far this year, in particular, results that we saw in this quarter is good evidence that the team is moving up there. We've had a very capable management team that oversees this business. They knew exactly what our aims and desires are, and they're doing a very fine job right now of meeting that."

If we look at it in new money terms and not all of this is new but some of the sum of the head from some of this is going to be relatively new. In Iowa, put in $0.10 gas affect effective March 1, 2015, that's going to basically give that state about a 30% increase of construction activity, that matters to us. Obviously, with House Bill 157 last year, Georgia basically increased their gas tax. They added almost $1 billion to annual construction budgets. We think both the Georgia and the Iowa pieces of it probably hit obviously more meaningfully in 2017, but we do think the fact back half of '16 could see some activities from that. Obviously, Texas has just a very healthy letting schedule, and they have over the last several years. That's going to continue to build on itself. I think the the notions that we discussed around project delays administratively is something to be mindful of in Texas. Keep in mind that perhaps 7 money is coming when we get the September 2017 that should be about $2.5 billion per annum. Nebraska did not to the same degree that Iowa did, but they put in the gas tax increase of $0.015 on January 1, that's going to go up the same amount for the next 3 years so hats off to a $0.06 increase. That's going to about a $75 million total impact in that state, and we've got a very attractive position there. If we look at what's happened in North Carolina last year with the Legislature in session, the basically added almost $1 billion to highway transportation spending what North Carolina refers to as the biennium so that's a 2-year process. South Carolina is looking to do more with what they call their Pennies for Progress Program, which would be delighted to see them do. Again, the work that we're seeing in South Carolina, right down in Charleston is very robust work. What we're seeing in Columbia is very good work and equally, my pence is government of Indiana wanted to see if he keeps his job as governor of Indiana because Berni is running for another one. And he's looking to invest in an additional $1 billion in state roads, highways, bridges over a 4-year period there. So again, we've got a number of core states that matter a lot to us that do have a series of good initiatives coming behind them. [indiscernible] program, I don't know, we're just have to see where that goes. I'll tell you I'm still one of those people who peers like the TIFIA program is going to be impactful can and will be going to the future. Remember what we've seen in TIFIA since 2012 is a $49 billion investment. So in markets that we care deeply about right now, we've seen 2 new applications in calendar 2015 and '16 and clearly, in a couple of projects in Colorado, we're at $1.7 billion on I-70 and 470, the loop and then about $1.4 billion DFW project, the Midtown Express and then we're still waiting for the Monroe bypass in Charlotte to go, and that's about an $839 million job. So I think we'll see what happens with Tiger, but I think between the FAST Act, state initiatives and what we've seen in TIFIA, it's pretty good future."

With me today is Anne Lloyd, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. 
To facilitate today's discussion, we've made available during this webcast and on our website supplemental financial information which we believe will be helpful. As detailed specifically on Slide 2, please remember that today's teleconference may include forward-looking statements as defined by securities laws in connection with future events or future operating or financial performance. Like other businesses, we're subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially. Except as legally required, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether resulting from new information, future developments or otherwise. We refer you to the legal disclaimers contained in our second quarter earnings release and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which are available on both our own and the SEC websites. 
Also, as a reminder, any margin references in our discussion are based on net sales and exclude freight and delivery revenues. These and other non-GAAP measures are explained in our supplemental financial information on our website and in our SEC filings. 
As detailed in our release distributed earlier this morning, Martin Marietta delivered strong top line and bottom line growth in a record-setting second quarter. These results were driven by broad-based gains across the majority of the company's geographic footprint.
Importantly, this was enabled by our strategic approach of developing leading positions in markets along higher growth corridors possessing attractive near and long-term economic characteristics.
For the quarter, we delivered record net sales of $915 million, an increase of 8% or $65 million gain over the second quarter of last year. That increase, combined with an improvement in our gross margin, led to record gross profit and net earnings. In fact, gross profit increased $47 million and net earnings increased $40 million, respectively. These outstanding results underscore the earnings power of our business model as well as the overall health of our markets and demonstrate our ability to capitalize on improving economic conditions.
Consolidated gross profit margin expanded 340 basis points to nearly 27% and diluted earnings per share of $1.90 increased 56%, both compared with the prior year quarter. The efficiencies achieved by our steadfast commitment to operational excellence is also evident and in -- that on a consolidated basis for every $1 in net sales, our operations delivered $0.71 of additional gross profit, above our stated target of 60%.
As will be expanded upon in a moment, we're pleased to note that in addition to increased volume, widespread pricing improvement contributed significantly to the quarter's results. Aggregates product line pricing increased 7%, led by the West Group's 10% growth with notable strength across our Texas and Colorado footprints. The ready-mixed concrete business delivered a 15% increase in pricing, again, with strength in both Texas and Colorado, led by robust pricing along the I-35 corridor, running from North to South through Dallas, Austin and San Antonio, Texas.
Despite the near-term threefold impact of adverse weather conditions, declining railroad balanced volumes and lower direct shale energy shipments, our aggregates product line delivered volume growth of 1.3%.
During the quarter, poor weather in our top markets nearly rivaled that experience in the second quarter 2015. We faced extremely wet conditions particularly in the first 2 months of the second quarter in many of our key states, including Texas and the Carolinas as shown in the divisional precipitation mass on Slide 5.
As forecasted by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the El Niño weather pattern, which began in the second quarter of 2015 continued through May 2016. What does that mean? Last year, we reported that enough rain fell in Texas to meet New York City's water needs for 7 years. This May, the National Weather Service reported 35 trillion gallons of rain fell in Texas, enough to cover the entire state in water 8 inches deep.
This rainfall led to extreme flooding due to saturated land conditions from an already very wet spring. Saturated soils are significant impediment to new construction activity. 
The Mid-America Group led the company with a nearly 5% increase in aggregates product line shipments driven by acceleration of residential and nonresidential construction activity across the Carolinas. The Southeast Group shipments increased nearly 2%. Large infrastructure projects in Georgia and Florida were catalyst for growth in the Southeast Group, but were partially offset by lower balanced shipments. The West Group, where shipments were affected by heavy rainfall, reported a 3% decline, including the volumes related to the recently completed Colorado acquisitions.
In addition to weather-deferred shipments, the West Group aggregate product line volumes were impacted by decline in shale-related shipments, delays associated with several Texas Department of Transportation projects and lower balanced sales due to reduced capital and maintenance expenditures by railroads as highlighted in recent press releases from that industry group.  These factors drove the West Group's negative volume comparison to prior year.
Overall, aggregates shipments for the first half of 2016 increased over 6%, in line with our full year expectations. The pace and trajectory of volume increases are particularly visible along the high-growth corridors to the Carolinas, Georgia and into Florida.
As anticipated, economic recovery in the Southeastern United States is accelerating.
For example, Georgia's net tax revenue collections through this past May compared to last year's comparable period were up nearly 10% or $1.7 billion.
Further, product demand in portions of the Carolinas have us considering adding work shifts to better serve customer needs. We expect continued steady construction growth in this important part of our geography to complement expansion in other regions of the country.
The ready-mixed concrete product line is benefiting from strong demand in North Texas and Colorado. Robust volumes, combined with improved cost performance, together with modestly improving operating conditions, drove 43% increase in net sales and a 560 basis point expansion of gross margin. The expectation remains for our Texas ready-mixed concrete profit margins to continue to improve similar to the pattern experienced in our Colorado-based business. We view the results for the 6 months of the year as confirmation that our expectations are well-placed.
For the second quarter, the Cement business generated nearly $60 million of net sales and $24 million of gross profit, representing a 40% gross margin. Note that as a result of the September 2015 sale of our California Cement business, comparability of results for this segment will be affected throughout the year. The 2015 impact of the California Cement operations is detailed on Slide 6.
Lastly, the Magnesia Specialties business delivered another solid quarter, with second quarter net sales of nearly $59 million. Our continued focus on diligently managing the cost profile of the business led to a gross profit margin of 36.8%, an expansion of 170 basis points versus the prior year second quarter.
Varying degrees of construction recovery are visible in all 3 primary end-use markets. Infrastructure shipments accounted for approximately 43% of our aggregates' volume and increased 1.3% over the prior year quarter, driven by large projects in the Southeast Group.
Notably, the acceleration of projects in the Atlanta market along the I-95 and I-75 corridors in addition to continued I-4 activity in Central Florida enabled positive quarter-over-quarter growth despite the impact of weather delayed shipments in the Mid-America and West Groups.
Importantly, we continue to see increasing demand across this end-use market and remain confident in its study and meaningful growth particularly as we move into 2017 and begin to see and enjoy the benefits of increased federal highway spending under the FAST Act and the multiple state initiatives. Among them, the Texas Department of Transportation plans to spend $70 billion on its highway from 2017 to 2026, especially in the growing Martin Marietta metro areas such as Dallas, San Antonio, Austin and Houston, doubling the prior decade's record investment level. 
The nonresidential end-use market comprised of 2 components: light construction and heavy construction accounted for 33% of aggregate shipments in the quarter and increased 2.8% compared with the prior year quarter. The light component is primarily office and retail construction with demand generally tied to employment growth and residential demand. While the heavy nonresidential component is primarily industrial building as well as energy and energy-related activity.
Growth in the nonresidential end-use market was led by an approximate 14% increase in the Mid-America Group, driven by office and retail development in North Carolina resulting from continued employment gains and solid residential activity.
The residential market accounted for 17% of quarterly aggregates product line shipments and reported a nearly 11% increase compared with prior year quarter. Strength in housing activity is evident across the United States as starts and completions are each up considerably for the trailing 12 months ended June 2016.
While U.S. housing activity remains well below historic averages, the re-acceleration of growth in our key states, particularly in the Southeastern portion of the country, is expected to drive increased aggregates demand throughout the remainder of the year. 
The ChemRock/Rail market accounted for the remaining 7% of aggregates product line volumes, which decreased compared to the prior year quarter as a result of reduced ballast sales. 
In addition to our quarterly results presented in today's earnings release, we also provided 2 updates to portions of our previously provided guidance.
First, SG&A guidance of $220 million has been increased to a range of $225 million to $230 million. This modest change is primarily related to the timing and value share-based compensation.
Second, the company's guidance on 2016 cement pricing change, current expectations are for full year increase of 2% to 4%. This change lowered our full year outlook for the Cement business' net sales by $10 million and results primarily from the sharp downturn in energy and energy-related activity.  We believe markets have now broadly stabilized and anticipate healthier pricing momentum as the company benefits from its leading positions in high-growth Texas regions.
To summarize, our consolidated second quarter results by virtually every meaningful and controllable metric, Martin Marietta delivered a very strong quarter, highlighted by record net sales, record gross profit and record net earnings.
Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization, was over $266 million for the quarter, an increase of $60 million. EBITDA as a percentage of net sales, excluding freight and delivery revenues, expanded 478 basis points to over 29%, approaching our prior peak level of EBITDA margin on 20% fewer times.
During the quarter, we repurchased an additional 215,000 shares of our common stock for $40 million. And together with our dividend, we returned $66 million to our shareholders. 
We have authorization to repurchase up to 20 million shares of our stock. Since the initial share repurchase authorization in February 2015 through the end of the second quarter 2016, we repurchased 4.5 million shares, which, coupled with our sustained dividend, returned $869 million to shareholders.
As a result, 15.5 million shares remain under the current authorization. 
Finally, our ratio of consolidated net debt to consolidated EBITDA for the trailing 12 months ended June 2016 was 1.98x in compliance with our leverage covenant and in line with our targeted leverage of 2x.
As we look forward to the balance of the year and beyond, we expect continued steady growth in construction activity in our markets. Both Dodge and PCA forecast growth in construction starts for the balance of 2016 and the next several years. The Dodge Momentum Index, which measures the initial report of nonresidential construction projects and tends to lead nonresidential construction spending by one full year, increased over 11% in June to 134.4, its highest level since early 2009.
Residential construction permits starts and completions remains strong. Infrastructure activity should continue to accelerate as the FAST Act and other state initiatives drive increased construction of highways, streets, roads and bridges.
Strong employment gains would serve as a key indicator of economic growth underpinned the construction forecast. In fact, of our key states Florida ranks second nationally in job growth; Texas ranks third; Georgia ranks fourth and North Carolina ranks eighth.
A host of key metropolitan areas in our markets had employment gains above 3%, including Dallas and Austin, Texas; Atlanta, Georgia; Orlando, Tampa and Jacksonville, Florida; Raleigh, North Carolina and Charleston, South Carolina. 
To conclude, we are very pleased with our second quarter performance, and we're well positioned to deliver solid results in the last half of the year. We will continue to realize the considerable benefits of our superior geographic positions, operating in markets that are economically diverse and high-growth. We remain committed to the diligent execution of our strategic plan, steadfast to our core foundation of pillars of operational excellence, cost discipline, customer satisfaction and sustainability and dedicated to delivering increased shareholder value.

And, really, as we rack it up, it falls into 3 different buckets. Number one, I would say shale volume was down about 750,000 tons versus the prior year. So that's your first bridge number. Your second bridge number, Kathryn, should be on the railroad balance. We saw that down about 250,000 tons compared to the prior year. But still the single largest moving factor there is relative to what we experienced with respect to weather. We're seeing tonnage affected by weather somewhere between 1 million and 1.5 million tons a quarter. So that gives you your bridge. The other part of your question, I think, it's a good one, Kathryn, is what are we looking relative to backlogs and how does that feel. And what I would say, in particular, Texas last year, had the wettest May in history. This year, it had one other wettest May in history. I mentioned that because if we simply look at a portion of the Texas market, let's look at what we got in North Texas, we've got about 3.6 million tons of backlog in North Texas and only about 600,000 of that shift during the first half of 2016. So clearly, there's pretty considerable, a, backlog and pretty considerable jam up on that backlog. There's some big jobs that are really waiting to go in a more robust fashion U.S. 380, near Denton is one of them. State Highway 175 outside of Dallas is another, and Interstate 45 and 35 both had considerable work. So from a volume perspective, what did we see deferred? It was the 2 million tons broken down into those buckets that I gave you relative to large projects and what the backlog looks like. We feel very comfortable with our backlog, at this position, we just need to be able to go on a number of those jobs, particularly textile [ph] jobs. Kathryn, was that a good response?"

Colorado had a much better quarter. If we look at what's going on in Colorado, in the Rocky Mountain group, what I would tell you is everything within the borders of Colorado was really very healthy. The only place in the Rocky Mountain group that we're seeing any degree of volume struggle is outside of Colorado, where it's more balanced driven. So we do have some ballast rise in Utah, we have one up in Wyoming as well, so we are seeing some pressure of those back to those same issues that we discussed before. What I will tell you is what we're seeing in Metro Denver, what we're seeing North of Denver, what we're seeing South of Denver, whether its aggregates, ready-mix or hot mix is all a very, very healthy marketplace, particularly downstream paving, we're getting considerably more work this year than we were last year at the same time. I want to say for the quarter, we had been on nearly 35 more jobs in Metro in North than we've been on last year. So we see Colorado being very busy not just for the balance of this year. We see Colorado being very busy for next year. With respect to the other part of your question on North Carolina, we're seeing a very healthy sharp so that's been a market that has continued to perform well. Importantly, as we go East in Charlotte and get to triad, we're seeing considerably more infrastructure work in Greensboro, High Point and Winston-Salem. That's a part of the state because of textiles, furniture and other manufacturing that suffered more than the rest of the state. We are now seeing both residential and nonresidential recovery in that marketplace. As we come further East yet and hit Raleigh-Durham and Chapel Hill, infrastructure work here is very healthy. Multifamily residential has been very, very healthy. Residential is starting to move in the direction that we would expect. So again, we're seeing a much healthier North Carolina. The part of this state is still waiting for more economic [indiscernible] to hit it are the more coastal areas that are continuing to get better and better quarter after quarter. So I didn't want to make sure I went through those areas pretty clearly with you, Kathryn."

I think with respect to the second part of your question, I think what's going to happen is aggregate business will likely get better service under railroads because we have been a very steady customer all the way through. So if you go back to the notion that with a larger shippers stoned, on 4 out of the 5 Class I railroads and our network is at least double the next largest network, our ability, I believe, to move stone from stone producing areas to stone starts parts of the country, particularly in South Texas and along the Gulf and Atlantic Coast will oddly enough most likely be held by the circumstance."

Keep in mind the numbers that we put out at the beginning of the year were based on the balanced numbers that we had been supplied by Class I railroads. So again, the dialogue is active with them. They've been very clear that was going to be back half pushed. If we're looking simply to the graded power volume or others down on the different railroads. I mean, the fact is we can look at year-to-date car volumes and say UP is down 10%, CSX is down almost 7%, Norfolk Southern down almost 6%.  So you can clearly see why they would pull back. I think going back to Kathryn's point in her question, it can only be held back so long. And keep in mind, a lot of these places, too, have seen pretty considerable flooding in the first half of the year. So railroads have been underwater and have seen that type of duress. They will have needs as we head into the back half of the year. Now in fairness, if we're looking at what headwinds and tailwinds could be, and it's probably a good moment to think about that as we do at this question. I would clearly put that in a potential headwind for us as we go into the back half of the year. So I really think about those probably in 2 different tranches, Jerry. I think tailwinds that we have going into the back half of the year is the rate and trajectory of recovery into Carolinas and Southeast and some of that, by the way , could be ballast. I think another tailwind that we have is strong demand in the Midwest and Rocky Mountains. And I think a strong contracted backlog is a tailwind as well. So I think you've got those 3. But I do think that if you are looking at what the headwinds are, I think the ballast shipments could be a headwind. And if we don't see some improvement at the back half of the year, there are probably 600,000-ish tons that could be at risk there. Clearly, we do need good normal weather for the balance of the year, and we do need TxDOT to have more of their work go in a more timely basis. Now the other issue, and I don't think the railroads necessarily suffer from this, but I think a lot of other trades do right now, getting truck drivers, tradesmen, welders, other things simple within the supply chain are under varying degrees of duress in different parts of the country. So I do think there's some headwinds, I do think there's some tailwinds and I give you that in the context of I do believe ballast is the potential headwind. So fair enough here."

So it's fascinating to look at where it was happy. I mean, streets starts were down 16%. But again, our view was we're going to see an expected recovery in half 2 and really more going into '17. What's fascinating to me, Jerry, is to go back and take a look at some of the key states and look at it over not a several month period but over a 2014 to 2016 time frame relative to the subject. And this is what I find. North Carolina, the change on a percentage '14 to '16, 58%; Nebraska, same time frame, up 41%; Iowa, up 18%; Arkansas, up 11%; South Carolina, up 53%; Florida, up 18%. Now with that same time frame because you did see a pullback, is Texas down, it is. But again, it just seemed that normal give-and-take in that. So again, I'm not sure that we're seeing anything relative to public transportation that's surprising to us.

Number one, I think we need to really give a tip of the hat to our operating teams. Because operating in the type of environment at which they're operating is really challenging because it stop start. And these businesses don't do stop start very well. Here's what I'll tell you. So look at cost structure, momentum on the labor side has been very good, momentum on energy has been very good, momentum on maintenance and repair has gotten considerably better. One of the things that we did last year, in particular, as we accelerated the purchase of some rolling stock, particularly in the Midwest and United States and in some of my earlier comments, I spoke to the fact that, that's going to be a business that's going to be as busy this year as it can be until snow fly is there. And what we saw with incremental additions to rolling stock in that marketplace is we saw maintenance and repair hit considerably better. So again, our cost structure is doing what I believe our cost structure we're doing, again, our teams have done exceptional work. The other piece of it that I think it's worth remembering is in large part we're watching the price fall to the bottom line, and that has really been very powerful. And if you think about what you're seeing relative to the price increases, you've heard us say not for a matter of months, but you've heard us say for a matter of years that it would be most likely that you would see the Western United States on a percentage basis price increase outperform the Eastern United States and particularly in parts of Texas. And that's what we're seeing. I think the other thing to your point, Garik, on what it looks like going forward. Part of what I believe you've heard us refer to in the past is that we believe in time, Colorado, we start to see that same type of pricing performance with a lag behind Texas. We're starting to see evidence of that taking shape as well. So to your question on incrementals, cost performance has been really very good. Capital deployment has continued to drive down cost in areas that needed to drive down, prices fall into the bottom line. And importantly, it's doing exactly what we thought. And keep in mind, we thought we would see these better incrementals early on in the cycle. So, so far, no surprises."

That's what drives the 2 to 4 pricing that we're showing up. Clearly, when we spoke about Texas on the last earnings call, we said we thought Q1 maybe going into Q2. It's going to be a shakeout period we're pricing in Texas. Obviously, you've got imports that have come in at least the port of Houston that are modestly different than we've seen over the last several years. At the same time, part of what we're doing, particularly in North Texas is we're serving more of our own cement needs in that marketplace as well. So when we're looking at shipping more cement farther to feed some of our ready-mix operations. And you've also got some of the competitive postures that have been in that marketplace. That in my way of thinking is what has really held the price down in addition to the weather that we saw. So as we look at it clearly, pricing in North Texas is better than it's been in South Texas. We're seeing increases in both markets, and we feel like we've now seen nice stability in that marketplace. I can tell you, we're seeing bidding in North Texas today at numbers much closer to the 112, 113, 114 type numbers, and that's more in line with what we would have expected."

We're looking at ASPs in that overall market in the Southwest up almost 17%. So if we're looking at that type of performance in Texas, it's much better. What I'll tell you is we look across 5 different districts of ready-mix in that marketplace. There's only one that has ASPs less than $100 a cubic yard. That's getting them into a much more acceptable type of level. So yes, it's getting better in Texas. While weather was really wet, and was not necessarily ready-mix's friend.

So I guess my view is not that far removed from where PCA is, because if we look at what we think to be capacity additions to Texas over the next several years and who knows if all those come forward even with those capacity additions, what you're seeing is about a 3 million-ton per annum shortfall of cement. So what Texas has not had genuinely for 24 months period is normal weather. They have not had a normal Texas summer and our sense is that's going to happen. And when that happens in construction activity on the public side, which is half of our business is as robust as we believe it will. And when places like Dallas continue to be as they are today, the best housing market in the United States, those are the types of formulas that come together to create cement shortages in that type of circumstance."

But I think it could very well go back to numbers that we were seeing at least in '15 or maybe in '16 if we look at full year '15, that was 3.6 million tons. So basically half of what it had been in '14. I'm not sure that, that is somewhere between that 2 5 and 3 5 wouldn't be a good steady run rate for energy as it returns.

I think one of the biggest issues and as you recall, when I was pointing to the question that Jerry had, I talked about both headwinds and tailwinds. And I do think that issue, that tailwind issue that I described or the headwind issue on workers, drivers, technical trades, those type of things, in other words, everything that's in the supply chain and again, we saw some of this last year, too, when we had that wet weather coming out of Q2, I think that may end up being an issue. It's hard for us to measure right now. But my guess is that something that you'll hear in the marketplace as you do your channel checks, too."

I mean, we really -- if we're looking at what's going on in the steel industry, the steel industry for us if you're looking at the 2 components that drive that business broadly, is what's going on with steel capacity, that's about 72%, which is a perfectly fine place to be. If it's about 70%, we're going to be fine. Equally if you take a look at where we are relative to what's going on with natural gas pricing, I mean, you've got a 21% cost reduction versus prior year so if you've got steel at over 70%, you've got nat gas down 21%, that's helps a lot. But then when you got good business on the MagChem side and keep in mind I want to say historically about 12%, 13% of our revenue is going overseas in that business, maybe a little bit more right now. So the type of business that we're seeing that we think doesn't just have quarter-to-quarter type of impact to it, but likely has a multiple year impact to it is actually very attractive to us right now."

So if you think back to it, what we've done in growing that business in Colorado all the way down to Front Range, all the way down I-25 has really given more breadth and depth to that marketplace. So we're looking at ASPs in the Rocky Mountains, for example, that are higher than they are in the Southwest. And that's one reason I say that's a more mature business. But what I would say in the Southwest is, if we're looking at type of growth that I believe we're looking at in North Texas, if we're looking at the type of growth that I think we're looking at in the other markets that are close to that and with some of the large vertically-integrated jobs that we have in South Texas that have multiple years ahead of them. Again, I would say this is a game that's in relatively early innings in Texas right now. If you go back to the comments that I had in my prepared remarks, we anticipate seeing, from return in other perspective the Texas business looking more and more like the Colorado business. And as we said, we believe the results that we've seen so far this year, in particular, results that we saw in this quarter is good evidence that the team is moving there. We've had a very capable management team that oversees this business. They know exactly what our aims and desires are, and they're doing a very fine job right now of meeting that."

So really, if we're looking at greenfielding in markets, they're going to need to be compelling reasons why to do that because there's really not a lot of need right now to add capacity. The greater need is greater efficiencies and to find those attractive markets where we want to have a more compelling presence. So to the extent that we can look to drive the marketplace in which we have a 1 or 2 position. And right now it's 85% of our markets versus 65%, let's call it, 6 years ago, if we can take that 85% number up to 95% or to 90% and keep doing that, that's awfully good and high use for our dollars, so that's how we're going to think about that."

Let's talk about it in a couple of different tranches. I mean, if we look at it in new money terms and that all of this is new, but some of the hit from some of this is going to be relatively new. In Iowa, put in $0.10 gas tax effective March 1, 201",579,"Sure. Let's talk about it in a couple of different tranches. I mean, if we look at it in new money terms and that all of this is new, but some of the hit from some of this is going to be relatively new. In Iowa, put in $0.10 gas tax effective March 1, 2015, that's going to basically give that state about a 30% increase of construction activity, that matters to us. Obviously, with House Bill 157 last year, Georgia basically increased their gas tax. They added almost $1 billion to annual construction budgets. We think both the Georgia and the Iowa pieces of it probably hit, obviously, more meaningfully in 2017. But we do think the back half of '16 could see some activities from that. Obviously, Texas has just a very healthy letting schedule, and they have over the last several years. That's going to continue to build on itself. I think the notions that we discussed around project delays administratively is something to be mindful of in Texas. Keep in mind that perhaps 7 money is coming when we get to September 2017 that should be about $2.5 billion per annum. Nebraska did not to the same degree that Iowa did, but they put in the gas tax increase of $0.015 on January 1, that's going to go up that same amount for the next 3 years so adds off to a $0.06 increase. That's going to about a $75 million total impact in that state. And we've got a very attractive position there. If we look at what's happened in North Carolina last year when the Legislature was in session, they basically added almost $1 billion to highway transportation spending. Now what North Carolina refers to as the biennium. So that's a 2-year process. South Carolina is looking to do more with what they call their Pennies for Progress Program, which would be delighted to see them do. Again, the work that we're seeing in South Carolina, right now in Charleston is very robust work. What we're seeing in Columbia is very good work and equally, my pence is government of Indiana wanted to see if he keeps his job as governor of Indiana because Berni is running for another one. And he's looking to invest an additional $1 billion in state roads, highways, bridges over a 4-year period there. So again, we've got a number of core states that matter a lot to us that do have a series of good initiatives coming behind them. [indiscernible] gas program, I don't know, we just have to see where that goes. I'll tell you I'm still one of those people who feels like the TIFIA program in, where it's going to be impactful can and will be going into the future. And remember what we've seen in TIFIA since 2012 is a $49 billion investment. So in markets that we care deeply about right now, we've seen 2 new applications in calendar 2015 and '16 and clearly, in a couple of projects in Colorado, we're at $1.7 billion on I-70 and 470, the loop. And then about $1.4 billion DFW project, the Midtown Express. And then we're still waiting for the Monroe bypass in Charlotte to go, and that's about an $839 million job. So I think we'll have to see what happens with Tiger brands, but I think between the FAST Act, state initiatives and what we've seen in TIFIA, it's pretty good future."

With me today is Anne Lloyd, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. 
To facilitate today's discussion, we've made available during this webcast and on our website supplemental financial information which we believe will be helpful. As detailed specifically on Slide 2, please remember that today's teleconference may include forward-looking statements as defined by securities laws in connection with future events or future operating or financial performance. Like other businesses, we're subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially. Except as legally required, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether resulting from new information, future developments or otherwise. We refer you to the legal disclaimers contained in our second quarter earnings release and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which are available on both our own and the SEC websites. 
Also, as a reminder, any margin references in our discussion are based on net sales and exclude freight and delivery revenues. These and other non-GAAP measures are explained in our supplemental financial information on our website and in our SEC filings. 
As detailed in our release distributed earlier this morning, Martin Marietta delivered strong top line and bottom line growth in the record-setting second quarter. These results were driven by broad-based gains across the majority of the company's geographic footprint. Importantly, this was enabled by our strategic approach of developing leading positions in markets along higher growth corridors possessing attractive near and long-term economic characteristics.
For the quarter, we delivered record net sales of $915 million, an increase of 8% or a $65 million gain over the second quarter of last year. That increase, combined with an improvement in our gross margin, led to record gross profit and net earnings. In fact, gross profit increased $47 million and net earnings increased $40 million, respectively. These outstanding results underscore the earnings power of our business model as well as the overall health of our markets and demonstrate our ability to capitalize on improving economic conditions.
Consolidated gross profit margin expanded 340 basis points to nearly 27% and diluted earnings per share of $1.90 increased 56%, both compared with the prior year quarter. The efficiencies achieved by our steadfast commitment to operational excellence is also evident and in -- that on a consolidated basis for every $1 in net sales, our operations delivered $0.71 of additional gross profit, above our stated target of 60%.
As will be expanded upon in a moment, we're pleased to note that in addition to increased volume, widespread pricing improvement contributed significantly to the quarter's results. Aggregates product line pricing increased 7%, led by the West Group's 10% growth with notable strength across our Texas and Colorado footprints. The ready-mixed concrete business delivered a 15% increase in pricing, again, with strength in both Texas and Colorado, led by robust pricing along the I-35 corridor, running from north to south through Dallas, Austin and San Antonio, Texas.
Despite the near-term threefold impact of adverse weather conditions, declining railroad balance volumes and lower direct shale energy shipments, our aggregates product line delivered volume growth of 1.3%. During the quarter, poor weather in our top markets nearly rivaled that experienced in the second quarter 2015. We faced extremely wet conditions particularly in the first 2 months of the second quarter in many of our key states, including Texas and the Carolinas as shown in the divisional precipitation mass on Slide 5.
As forecasted by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the El Niño weather pattern, which began in the second quarter of 2015 continued through May 2016. What does that mean? Last year, we reported that enough rain fell in Texas to meet New York City's water needs for 7 years. This May, the National Weather Service reported 35 trillion gallons of rain fell in Texas, enough to cover the entire state in water 8 inches deep. This rainfall led to extreme flooding due to saturated land conditions from an already very wet spring. Saturated soils are significant impediment to new construction activity. 
The Mid-America Group led the company with a nearly 5% increase in aggregates product line shipments driven by acceleration of residential and nonresidential construction activity across the Carolinas. The Southeast Group shipments increased nearly 2%. Large infrastructure projects in Georgia and Florida were catalyst for growth in the Southeast Group, but were partially offset by lower balanced shipments. The West Group, where shipments were affected by heavy rainfall, reported a 3% decline, including the volumes related to the recently completed Colorado acquisitions.
In addition to weather-deferred shipments, the West Group aggregate product line volumes were impacted by decline in shale-related shipments, delays associated with several Texas Department of Transportation projects and lower balanced sales due to reduced capital and maintenance expenditures by railroads, as highlighted in recent press releases from that industry group.  These factors drove the West Group's negative volume comparison to prior year.
Overall, aggregates shipments for the first half of 2016 increased over 6%, in line with our full year expectations. The pace and trajectory of volume increases are particularly visible along the high-growth corridors through the Carolinas, Georgia and into Florida. As anticipated, economic recovery in the Southeastern United States is accelerating. For example, Georgia's net tax revenue collections through this past May compared to last year's comparable period were up nearly 10% or $1.7 billion. Further, product demand in portions of the Carolinas have us considering adding work shifts to better serve customer needs. We expect continued steady construction growth in this important part of our geography to complement expansion in other regions of the country.
The ready-mixed concrete product line is benefiting from strong demand in North Texas and Colorado. Robust volumes, combined with improved cost performance, together with modestly improving operating conditions, drove a 43% increase in net sales and a 560 basis point expansion of gross margin. The expectation remains for our Texas ready-mixed concrete profit margins to continue to improve similar to the pattern experienced in our Colorado-based business. We view the results for the 6 months of the year as confirmation that our expectations are well-placed.
For the second quarter, the Cement business generated nearly $60 million of net sales and $24 million of gross profit, representing a 40% gross margin. Note that as a result of the September 2015 sale of our California Cement business, comparability of results for this segment will be affected throughout the year. The 2015 impact of the California Cement operations is detailed on Slide 6. Lastly, the Magnesia Specialties business delivered another solid quarter, with second quarter net sales of nearly $59 million. Our continued focus on diligently managing the cost profile of the business led to a gross profit margin of 36.8%, an expansion of 170 basis points versus the prior year second quarter.
Varying degrees of construction recovery are visible in all 3 primary end-use markets. Infrastructure shipments accounted for approximately 43% of our aggregates volume and increased 1.3% over the prior year quarter, driven by large projects in the Southeast Group. Notably, the acceleration of projects in the Atlanta market along the I-95 and I-75 corridors in addition to continued I-4 activity in Central Florida enabled positive quarter-over-quarter growth despite the impact of weather delayed shipments in the Mid-America and West Groups.
Importantly, we continue to see increasing demand across this end-use market and remain confident in its study and meaningful growth particularly as we move into 2017 and begin to see and enjoy the benefits of increased federal highway spending under the FAST Act and the multiple state initiatives. Among them, the Texas Department of Transportation plans to spend $70 billion on its highways from 2017 to 2026, especially in the growing Martin Marietta metro areas such as Dallas, San Antonio, Austin and Houston, doubling the prior decade's record investment level. 
The nonresidential end-use market comprised of 2 components: light construction and heavy construction accounted for 33% of aggregate shipments in the quarter and increased 2.8% compared with the prior year quarter. The light component is primarily office and retail construction with demand generally tied to employment growth and residential demand; while the heavy nonresidential component is primarily industrial building as well as energy and energy-related activity.
Growth in the nonresidential end-use market was led by an approximate 14% increase in the Mid-America Group, driven by office and retail development in North Carolina resulting from continued employment gains and solid residential activity. The residential market accounted for 17% of quarterly aggregates product line shipments and reported a nearly 11% increase compared with prior year quarter. Strength in housing activity is evident across the United States as starts and completions are each up considerably for the trailing 12 months ended June 2016. While U.S. housing activity remains well below historic averages, the re-acceleration of growth in our key states, particularly in the Southeastern portion of the country, is expected to drive increased aggregates demand throughout the remainder of the year.  The ChemRock/Rail market accounted for the remaining 7% of aggregates product line volumes, which decreased compared to the prior year quarter as a result of reduced ballast sales.  
In addition to our quarterly results presented in today's earnings release, we also provided 2 updates to portions of our previously provided guidance. First, SG&A guidance of $220 million has been increased to a range of $225 million to $230 million. This modest change is primarily related to the timing and value share-based compensation. Second, the company's guidance on 2016 cement pricing change, current expectations are for full year increase of 2% to 4%. This change lowered our full year outlook for the Cement business' net sales by $10 million and results primarily from the sharp downturn in energy and energy-related activity.  We believe markets have now broadly stabilized and anticipate healthier pricing momentum as the company benefits from its leading positions in high-growth Texas regions. To summarize our consolidated second quarter results by virtually every meaningful and controllable metric, Martin Marietta delivered a very strong quarter, highlighted by record net sales, record gross profit and record net earnings. 
Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization, was over $266 million for the quarter, an increase of $60 million. EBITDA as a percentage of net sales, excluding freight and delivery revenues, expanded 478 basis points to over 29%, approaching our prior peak level of EBITDA margin on 20% fewer tons. During the quarter, we repurchased an additional 215,000 shares of our common stock for $40 million. And together with our dividend, we returned $66 million to our shareholders. 
We have authorization to repurchase up to 20 million shares of our stock. Since the initial share repurchase authorization in February 2015 through the end of the second quarter 2016, we've repurchased 4.5 million shares, which, coupled with our sustained dividend, returned $869 million to shareholders. As a result, 15.5 million shares remain under the current authorization.  Finally, our ratio of consolidated net debt to consolidated EBITDA for the trailing 12 months ended June 2016 was 1.98x in compliance with our leverage covenant and in line with our targeted leverage of 2x.
As we look forward to the balance of the year and beyond, we expect continued steady growth in construction activity in our markets. Both Dodge and PCA forecast growth in construction starts for the balance of 2016 and the next several years. The Dodge Momentum Index, which measures the initial report of nonresidential construction projects and tends to lead nonresidential construction spending by 1 full year, increased over 11% in June to 134.4, its highest level since early 2009. Residential construction permits starts and completions remains strong. Infrastructure activity should continue to accelerate as the FAST Act and other state initiatives drive increased construction of highways, streets, roads and bridges.
Strong employment gains would serve as a key indicator of economic growth underpinned the construction forecast. In fact, of our key states Florida ranks second nationally in job growth; Texas ranks third; Georgia ranks fourth and North Carolina ranks eighth. A host of key metropolitan areas in our markets had employment gains above 3%, including Dallas and Austin, Texas; Atlanta, Georgia; Orlando, Tampa and Jacksonville, Florida; Raleigh, North Carolina and Charleston, South Carolina. 
To conclude, we are very pleased with our second quarter performance, and we're well positioned to deliver solid results in the last half of the year. We will continue to realize the considerable benefits of our superior geographic positions, operating in markets that are economically diverse and high-growth. We remain committed to the diligent execution of our strategic plan, steadfast to our core foundation of pillars of operational excellence, cost discipline, customer satisfaction and sustainability and dedicated to delivering increased shareholder value.

And, really, as we rack it up, it falls into 3 different buckets. Number one, I would say shale volume was down about 750,000 tons versus the prior year. So that's your first bridge number. Your second bridge number, Kathryn, should be on the railroad balance. We saw that down about 250,000 tons compared to the prior year. But still the single largest moving factor there is relative to what we experienced with respect to weather. We're seeing tonnage affected by weather somewhere between 1 million and 1.5 million tons a quarter. So that gives you your bridge. The other part of your question, and I think it's a good one, Kathryn, is what are we looking relative to backlogs and how does that feel. And what I would say, in particular, Texas last year, had the wettest May in history. This year, it had one other wettest May in history. I mentioned that because if we simply look at a portion of the Texas market, let's look at what we've got in North Texas, we've got about 3.6 million tons of backlog in North Texas and only about 600,000 of that shipped during the first half of 2016. So clearly, there is pretty considerable, a, backlog and pretty considerable jam up on that backlog. There's some big jobs that are really waiting to go in a more robust fashion U.S. 380, near Denton is one of them. State Highway 175 outside of Dallas is another, and Interstate 45 and 35 both had considerable work. So from a volume perspective, what did we see deferred? It was the 2 million tons broken down into those buckets that I gave you relative to large projects and what the backlog looks like. We feel very comfortable with our backlog, at this position, we just need to be able to go on a number of those jobs, particularly TxDOT jobs. Kathryn, was that responsive?"

If we look at what's going on in Colorado, in the Rocky Mountain group, what I would tell you is everything within the borders of Colorado was really very healthy.",392,"Well here's what I would say with respect to Colorado. Colorado had a much better quarter. If we look at what's going on in Colorado, in the Rocky Mountain group, what I would tell you is everything within the borders of Colorado was really very healthy. The only place in the Rocky Mountain group that we're seeing any degree of volume struggle is outside of Colorado, where it's more ballast driven. So we do have some ballast quarries in Utah, we have one up in Wyoming as well, so we are seeing some pressure of those back to those same issues that we discussed before. What I will tell you is what we're seeing in Metro Denver, what we're seeing North of Denver, what we're seeing South of Denver, whether its aggregates, ready-mix or hot mix is all a very, very healthy marketplace, particularly downstream paving, we're bidding considerably more work this year than we were last year at the same time. I want to say for the quarter, we had been on nearly 35 more jobs in Metro in North than we've been on last year. So we see Colorado being very busy not just for the balance of this year. We see Colorado being very busy for next year. With respect to the other part of your question on North Carolina, we're seeing a very healthy sharp so that's been a market that has continued to perform well. Importantly, as we go East in Charlotte and get to triad, we're seeing considerably more infrastructure work in Greensboro, High Point and Winston-Salem. That's a part of the state because of textiles, furniture and other manufacturing that suffered more than the rest of the state. We are now seeing both residential and nonresidential recovery in that marketplace. As we come farther east yet and hit Raleigh-Durham and Chapel Hill, infrastructure work here is very healthy. Multifamily residential has been very, very healthy. Residential is starting to move in the direction that we would expect. So again, we're seeing a much healthier North Carolina. But part of this state that's still waiting for more economic juice to hit it are the more coastal areas that are continuing to get better and better quarter after quarter. So I didn't want to make sure I went through those areas pretty clearly with you, Kathryn."

Maintenance is something that in the early and since in the downturn, it's always going to see the stick pull back. And I think that's exactly we're doing I think it's fairly predictable once they saw their volumes declining. That cannot endure because they have thousands of miles of track that they need to maintain. So that's not a matter of if, it's a matter of when. I think with respect to the second part of your question, I think what's going to happen is aggregate business will likely get better service on the railroads because we have been a very steady customer all the way through. So if you go back to the notion that with a larger shippers stoned, on 4 out of the 5 Class I railroads and our network is at least double the next largest network, our ability, I believe, to move stone from stone producing areas to stone starts parts of the country, particularly in South Texas and along the Gulf and Atlantic Coast will oddly enough most likely be helped by the circumstance."

Keep in mind the numbers that we put out at the beginning of the year were based on the balanced numbers that we had been supplied by Class I railroads. So again, the dialogue is active with them. They've been very clear that it was going to be back half pushed. If we're looking simply to the graded power volume or others down on the different railroads. I mean, the fact is we can look at year-to-date car volumes and say UP is down 10%, CSX is down almost 7%, Norfolk Southern down almost 6%.  So you can clearly see why they would pull back. I think going back to Kathryn's point in her question, it can only be held back so long. And keep in mind, a lot of these places, too, have seen pretty considerable flooding in the first half of the year. So where you've got railroads have been underwater and have seen that type of duress, they will have needs as we head into the back half of the year. Now in fairness, if we're looking at what headwinds and tailwinds could be, and it's probably a good moment to think about that as we do at this question. I would clearly put that in a potential headwind for us as we go into the back half of the year. So I really think about those probably in 2 different tranches, Jerry. I think tailwinds that we have going into the back half of the year is the rate and trajectory of recovery into Carolinas and Southeast and some of that, by the way, could be ballast. I think another tailwind that we have is strong demand in the Midwest and Rocky Mountains. And I think a strong contractor backlog is a tailwind as well. So I think you've got those 3. But I do think that if you are looking at what the headwinds are, I think the ballast shipments could be a headwind. And if we don't see some improvement at the back half of the year, there are probably 600,000-ish tons that could be at risk there. Clearly, we do need good normal weather for the balance of the year, and we do need TxDOT to have more of their work go in a more timely basis. And the other issue, and I don't think the railroads necessarily suffer from this, but I think a lot of other trades do right now, getting truck drivers, tradesmen, welders, other things simple within the supply chain are under varying degrees of duress in different parts of the country. So I do think there's some headwinds, I do think there's some tailwinds and I give you that in the context of I do believe ballast is the potential headwind. So fair enough, Jer."

I think our verbiage in the past is because of how long we had gone without a highway bill, it was more likely than usual that we might see some of that activity in the second half of 2016. So it's fascinating to look at where it was happy. I mean, street starts were down 16%. But again, our view was we're going to see an expected recovery in half 2 and really more going into '17. What's fascinating to me, Jerry, is to go back and take a look at some of the key states and look at it over not a several month period but over a 2014 to 2016 time frame relative to the subject. And this is what I find. North Carolina, the change on a percentage '14 to '16, 58%; Nebraska, same time frame, up 41%; Iowa, up 18%; Arkansas, up 11%; South Carolina, up 53%; Florida, up 18%. Now with that same time frame because you did see a pullback, is Texas down, it is. But again, it just seemed that normal give-and-take in that. So again, I'm not sure that we're seeing anything relative to public transportation that's surprising to us. I think we see good momentum going into the back half of the year, and I think we see very good momentum going into 2017."

It seems like to hit the midpoint of your guidance, you need some around 60% so in line with the long term. But can you talk about some of the levers that you saw in the second quarter, in particular, on lower volume, you got 70% consolidating incremental margins, which is pretty strong. And what are you seeing as far as the levers of Austin incrementals in the back half of the year? And could we perhaps see some conservatism in the incremental margin guidance in the near to medium term?"

Number one, I think we need to really give a tip of the hat to our operating teams. Because operating in the type of environment at which they're operating is really challenging because it stop start. And these businesses don't do stop start very well. Here's what I'll tell you. So look at cost structure, momentum on the labor side has been very good, momentum on energy has been very good, momentum on maintenance and repair has gotten considerably better. I mean one of the things that we did last year, in particular, as we accelerated the purchase of some rolling stock, particularly in the Midwestern United States and in some of my earlier comments, I spoke to the fact that, that's going to be a business that's going to be as busy this year as it can be until snow fly is there. And what we saw with incremental additions to rolling stock in that marketplace is we saw maintenance and repair hit considerably better. So again, our cost structure is doing what I believe our cost structure we're doing, again, our teams have done exceptional work. The other piece of it that I think's worth remembering is in large part we're watching the price fall to the bottom line, and that has really been very powerful. And if you think about what you're seeing relative to the price increases, you've heard us say not for a matter of months, but you've heard us say for a matter of years that it would be most likely that you would see the Western United States on a percentage basis price increase outperform the Eastern United States and particularly in parts of Texas. And that's what we're seeing. I think the other thing to your point, Garik, on what it looks like going forward. Part of what I believe you've heard us refer to in the past is that we believed in time, Colorado would start to see that same type of pricing performance with a lag behind Texas. We're starting to see evidence of that taking shape as well. So to your question on incrementals, cost performance has been really very good. Capital deployment has continued to drive down cost in areas that needed to drive down, prices fall into the bottom line. And importantly, it's doing exactly what we thought. And keep in mind, we thought we would see these better incrementals early on in the cycle. So, so far, no surprises."

Clearly, when we spoke about Texas on the last earnings call, we said we thought Q1 maybe going into Q2. It's going to be a shakeout period we're pricing in Texas. Obviously, you've got imports that have come in, at least the Port of Houston that are modestly different than we've seen over the last several years. At the same time, part of what we're doing, particularly in North Texas is we're serving more of our own cement needs in that marketplace as well. So when we're looking at shipping more cement farther to feed some of our ready-mix operations. And you've also got some of the competitive postures that have been in that marketplace. That in my way of thinking is what has really held the price down in addition to the weather that we saw. So as we look at it, clearly, pricing in North Texas is better than it's been in South Texas. We're seeing increases in both markets, and we feel like we've now seen nice stability in that marketplace. I can tell you, we're seeing bidding in North Texas today at numbers much closer to the 112, 113, 114 type numbers, and that's more in line with what we would have expected."

We're looking at ASPs in that overall market in the Southwest up almost 17%. So if we're looking at that type of performance in Texas, it's much better. What I'll tell you is we looked across 5 different districts of ready-mix in that marketplace. There's only one that has ASPs less than $100 a cubic yard. That's getting them into a much more acceptable type of level. So yes, it's getting better in Texas. While weather was really wet, and was not necessarily ready-mix's friend.

So clearly, I was saying that before we had 8 inches of potential rain flooding across the entire state of Texas. So I guess my view is not that far removed from where PCA is, because if we look at what we think to be capacity additions to Texas over the next several years and who knows if all those come forward even with those capacity additions, what you're seeing is about a 3 million ton per annum shortfall of cement. So what Texas has not had genuinely for a 24-month period is normal weather. They have not had a normal Texas summer and our sense is that's going to happen. And when that happens in construction activity on the public side, which is half of our business is as robust as we believe it will. And when places like Dallas continue to be as they are today, the best housing market in the United States, those are the types of formulas that come together to create cement shortages in that type of circumstance."

This sector doesn't stay down, this sector is going to have to have return. Do I think the sector is going back to the type of volume that we were seeing in 2014, which by the way, was almost 7.5 million tons? I don't think it goes there. But I think it could very well go back to numbers that we were seeing at least in '15 or maybe in '16 if we look at full year '15, that was 3.6 million tons. So basically half of what it had been in '14. I'm not sure that, that is somewhere between that 2.5 million and 3.5 million wouldn't be a good steady run rate for energy as it returns.

So if you think back to it, what we've done in growing that business in Colorado all the way down to Front Range, all the way down I-25 has really given more breadth and depth to that marketplace. So we're looking at ASPs in the Rocky Mountains, for example, that are higher than they are in the Southwest. And that's one reason I say that's a more mature business. But what I would say in the Southwest is, if we're looking at type of growth that I believe we're looking at in North Texas, if we're looking at the type of growth that I think we're looking at in the other markets that are close to that and with some of the large vertically-integrated jobs that we have in South Texas that have multiple years ahead of them. Again, I would say this is a game that's in relatively early innings in Texas right now. If you go back to the comments that I had in my prepared remarks, we anticipate seeing, from a return in other perspective the Texas business looking more and more like the Colorado business. And as we said, we believe the results that we've seen so far this year, in particular, results that we saw in this quarter is good evidence that the team is moving there. We've had a very capable management team that oversees this business. They know exactly what our aims and desires are, and they're doing a very fine job right now of meeting that."

And depending on what the market is going to dictate, how we look at that market, how we want to invest or otherwise. The other thing that we are mindful of, we have the ability to greenfield. We've clearly done that in places like Medina. We're going to do some of that in Hunter. I think we've done that very well. I think we've done more of that probably than others in the space. At the same time, if we go back 8, 9 years ago, this was a company that was producing and selling 205 million tons of stone on a pre-TXI basis. So really, if we're looking at greenfielding in markets, they're going to need to be compelling reasons why to do that because there's really not a lot of need right now to add capacity. The greater need is greater efficiencies and to find those attractive markets where we want to have a more compelling presence. So to the extent that we can look to drive the marketplace in which we have a 1 or 2 position. And right now it's 85% of our markets versus 65%, let's call it, 6 years ago, if we can take that 85% number up to 95% or to 90% and keep doing that, that's awfully good and high use for our dollars, so that's how we're going to think about that."

Let's talk about it in a couple of different tranches. I mean, if we look at it in new money terms and that all of this is new, but some of the hit from some of this is going to be relatively new. I mean Iowa put in $0.10 gas tax effective March 1,",580,"Sure. Let's talk about it in a couple of different tranches. I mean, if we look at it in new money terms and that all of this is new, but some of the hit from some of this is going to be relatively new. I mean Iowa put in $0.10 gas tax effective March 1, 2015, that's going to basically give that state about a 30% increase of construction activity, that matters to us. Obviously, with House Bill 157 last year, Georgia basically increased their gas tax. They added almost $1 billion to annual construction budgets. We think both the Georgia and the Iowa pieces probably hit, obviously, more meaningfully in 2017. But we do think the back half of '16 could see some activities from that. Obviously, Texas has just a very healthy letting schedule, and they have over the last several years. That's going to continue to build on itself. I think the notions that we discussed around project delays administratively is something to be mindful of in Texas. Keep in mind that Prop 7 money is coming when we get to September 2017 that should be about $2.5 billion per annum. Nebraska did not to the same degree that Iowa did, but they put in the gas tax increase of $0.015 on January 1, that's going to go up that same amount for the next 3 years so adds up to a $0.06 increase. That's going to about a $75 million total impact in that state. And we've got a very attractive position there. If we look at what's happened in North Carolina last year when the Legislature was in session, they basically added almost $1 billion to highway transportation spending. Now what North Carolina refers to as the biennium. So that's a 2-year process. South Carolina is looking to do more with what they call their Pennies for Progress Program, which we'd be delighted to see them do. Again, the work that we're seeing in South Carolina, right now in Charleston is very robust work. What we're seeing in Columbia is very good work and equally, Mike Pence is governor of Indiana, wanted to see if he keeps his job as governor of Indiana because Bernie is running for another one. And he's looking to invest an additional $1 billion in state roads, highways, bridges over a 4-year period there. So again, we've got a number of core states that matter a lot to us that do have a series of good initiatives coming behind them. TIGER grants program, you know what, I don't know, we'll just have to see where that goes. I'll tell you I'm still one of those people who feels like the TIFIA program in, where it's going to be impactful can and will be going into the future. And remember what we've seen in TIFIA since 2012 is a $49 billion investment. So in markets that we care deeply about right now, we've seen 2 new applications in calendar 2015 and '16 and clearly, in a couple of projects in Colorado, with $1.7 billion on I-70 and 470, the loop. And then about $1.4 billion DFW project, the Midtown Express. And then we're still waiting for the Monroe bypass in Charlotte to go, and that's about an $839 million job. So I think we'll have to see what happens with Tiger brands, but I think between the FAST Act, state initiatives and what we've seen in TIFIA, it's pretty good future."

We refer you to the legal disclaimers contained in our second quarter earnings release and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which are available on both our own and the SEC websites. 
Also, as a reminder, any margin references in our discussion are based on net sales and exclude freight and delivery revenues. These and other non-GAAP measures are explained in our supplemental financial information on our website and in our SEC filings. 
As detailed in our release distributed earlier this morning, Martin Marietta delivered strong top line and bottom line growth in the record-setting second quarter. These results were driven by broad-based gains across the majority of the company's geographic footprint. Importantly, this was enabled by our strategic approach of developing leading positions in markets along higher growth corridors possessing attractive near and long-term economic characteristics.
For the quarter, we delivered record net sales of $915 million, an increase of 8% or a $65 million gain over the second quarter of last year. That increase, combined with an improvement in our gross margin, led to record gross profit and net earnings. In fact, gross profit increased $47 million and net earnings increased $40 million, respectively. These outstanding results underscore the earnings power of our business model as well as the overall health of our markets and demonstrate our ability to capitalize on improving economic conditions.
Consolidated gross profit margin expanded 340 basis points to nearly 27% and diluted earnings per share of $1.90 increased 56%, both compared with the prior year quarter. The efficiencies achieved by our steadfast commitment to operational excellence is also evident and in -- that on a consolidated basis for every $1 in net sales, our operations delivered $0.71 of additional gross profit, above our stated target of 60%.
As will be expanded upon in a moment, we're pleased to note that in addition to increased volume, widespread pricing improvement contributed significantly to the quarter's results. Aggregates product line pricing increased 7%, led by the West Group's 10% growth with notable strength across our Texas and Colorado footprints. The ready-mixed concrete business delivered a 15% increase in pricing, again, with strength in both Texas and Colorado, led by robust pricing along the I-35 corridor, running from north to south through Dallas, Austin and San Antonio, Texas.
Despite the near-term threefold impact of adverse weather conditions, declining railroad balance volumes and lower direct shale energy shipments, our aggregates product line delivered volume growth of 1.3%. During the quarter, poor weather in our top markets nearly rivaled that experienced in the second quarter 2015. We faced extremely wet conditions particularly in the first 2 months of the second quarter in many of our key states, including Texas and the Carolinas as shown in the divisional precipitation mass on Slide 5.
As forecasted by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the El Niño weather pattern, which began in the second quarter of 2015 continued through May 2016. What does that mean? Last year, we reported that enough rain fell in Texas to meet New York City's water needs for 7 years. This May, the National Weather Service reported 35 trillion gallons of rain fell in Texas, enough to cover the entire state in water 8 inches deep. This rainfall led to extreme flooding due to saturated land conditions from an already very wet spring. Saturated soils are significant impediment to new construction activity. 
The Mid-America Group led the company with a nearly 5% increase in aggregates product line shipments driven by acceleration of residential and nonresidential construction activity across the Carolinas. The Southeast Group shipments increased nearly 2%. Large infrastructure projects in Georgia and Florida were catalyst for growth in the Southeast Group, but were partially offset by lower balanced shipments. The West Group, where shipments were affected by heavy rainfall, reported a 3% decline, including the volumes related to the recently completed Colorado acquisitions.
In addition to weather-deferred shipments, the West Group aggregate product line volumes were impacted by decline in shale-related shipments, delays associated with several Texas Department of Transportation projects and lower balanced sales due to reduced capital and maintenance expenditures by railroads, as highlighted in recent press releases from that industry group.  These factors drove the West Group's negative volume comparison to prior year.
Overall, aggregates shipments for the first half of 2016 increased over 6%, in line with our full year expectations. The pace and trajectory of volume increases are particularly visible along the high-growth corridors through the Carolinas, Georgia and into Florida. As anticipated, economic recovery in the Southeastern United States is accelerating. For example, Georgia's net tax revenue collections through this past May compared to last year's comparable period were up nearly 10% or $1.7 billion. Further, product demand in portions of the Carolinas have us considering adding work shifts to better serve customer needs. We expect continued steady construction growth in this important part of our geography to complement expansion in other regions of the country.
The ready-mixed concrete product line is benefiting from strong demand in North Texas and Colorado. Robust volumes, combined with improved cost performance, together with modestly improving operating conditions, drove a 43% increase in net sales and a 560 basis point expansion of gross margin. The expectation remains for our Texas ready-mixed concrete profit margins to continue to improve similar to the pattern experienced in our Colorado-based business. We view the results for the 6 months of the year as confirmation that our expectations are well-placed.
For the second quarter, the Cement business generated nearly $60 million of net sales and $24 million of gross profit, representing a 40% gross margin. Note that as a result of the September 2015 sale of our California Cement business, comparability of results for this segment will be affected throughout the year. The 2015 impact of the California Cement operations is detailed on Slide 6. Lastly, the Magnesia Specialties business delivered another solid quarter, with second quarter net sales of nearly $59 million. Our continued focus on diligently managing the cost profile of the business led to a gross profit margin of 36.8%, an expansion of 170 basis points versus the prior year second quarter.
Varying degrees of construction recovery are visible in all 3 primary end-use markets. Infrastructure shipments accounted for approximately 43% of our aggregates volume and increased 1.3% over the prior year quarter, driven by large projects in the Southeast Group. Notably, the acceleration of projects in the Atlanta market along the I-95 and I-75 corridors in addition to continued I-4 activity in Central Florida enabled positive quarter-over-quarter growth despite the impact of weather delayed shipments in the Mid-America and West Groups.
Importantly, we continue to see increasing demand across this end-use market and remain confident in its study and meaningful growth particularly as we move into 2017 and begin to see and enjoy the benefits of increased federal highway spending under the FAST Act and the multiple state initiatives. Among them, the Texas Department of Transportation plans to spend $70 billion on its highways from 2017 to 2026, especially in the growing Martin Marietta metro areas such as Dallas, San Antonio, Austin and Houston, doubling the prior decade's record investment level. 
The nonresidential end-use market comprised of 2 components: light construction and heavy construction accounted for 33% of aggregate shipments in the quarter and increased 2.8% compared with the prior year quarter. The light component is primarily office and retail construction with demand generally tied to employment growth and residential demand; while the heavy nonresidential component is primarily industrial building as well as energy and energy-related activity.
Growth in the nonresidential end-use market was led by an approximate 14% increase in the Mid-America Group, driven by office and retail development in North Carolina resulting from continued employment gains and solid residential activity. The residential market accounted for 17% of quarterly aggregates product line shipments and reported a nearly 11% increase compared with prior year quarter. Strength in housing activity is evident across the United States as starts and completions are each up considerably for the trailing 12 months ended June 2016. While U.S. housing activity remains well below historic averages, the re-acceleration of growth in our key states, particularly in the Southeastern portion of the country, is expected to drive increased aggregates demand throughout the remainder of the year.  The ChemRock/Rail market accounted for the remaining 7% of aggregates product line volumes, which decreased compared to the prior year quarter as a result of reduced ballast sales.  
In addition to our quarterly results presented in today's earnings release, we also provided 2 updates to portions of our previously provided guidance. First, SG&A guidance of $220 million has been increased to a range of $225 million to $230 million. This modest change is primarily related to the timing and value share-based compensation. Second, the company's guidance on 2016 cement pricing change, current expectations are for full year increase of 2% to 4%. This change lowered our full year outlook for the Cement business' net sales by $10 million and results primarily from the sharp downturn in energy and energy-related activity.  We believe markets have now broadly stabilized and anticipate healthier pricing momentum as the company benefits from its leading positions in high-growth Texas regions. To summarize our consolidated second quarter results by virtually every meaningful and controllable metric, Martin Marietta delivered a very strong quarter, highlighted by record net sales, record gross profit and record net earnings. 
Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization, was over $266 million for the quarter, an increase of $60 million. EBITDA as a percentage of net sales, excluding freight and delivery revenues, expanded 478 basis points to over 29%, approaching our prior peak level of EBITDA margin on 20% fewer tons. During the quarter, we repurchased an additional 215,000 shares of our common stock for $40 million. And together with our dividend, we returned $66 million to our shareholders. 
We have authorization to repurchase up to 20 million shares of our stock. Since the initial share repurchase authorization in February 2015 through the end of the second quarter 2016, we've repurchased 4.5 million shares, which, coupled with our sustained dividend, returned $869 million to shareholders. As a result, 15.5 million shares remain under the current authorization.  Finally, our ratio of consolidated net debt to consolidated EBITDA for the trailing 12 months ended June 2016 was 1.98x in compliance with our leverage covenant and in line with our targeted leverage of 2x.
As we look forward to the balance of the year and beyond, we expect continued steady growth in construction activity in our markets. Both Dodge and PCA forecast growth in construction starts for the balance of 2016 and the next several years. The Dodge Momentum Index, which measures the initial report of nonresidential construction projects and tends to lead nonresidential construction spending by 1 full year, increased over 11% in June to 134.4, its highest level since early 2009. Residential construction permits starts and completions remains strong. Infrastructure activity should continue to accelerate as the FAST Act and other state initiatives drive increased construction of highways, streets, roads and bridges.
Strong employment gains would serve as a key indicator of economic growth underpinned the construction forecast. In fact, of our key states Florida ranks second nationally in job growth; Texas ranks third; Georgia ranks fourth and North Carolina ranks eighth. A host of key metropolitan areas in our markets had employment gains above 3%, including Dallas and Austin, Texas; Atlanta, Georgia; Orlando, Tampa and Jacksonville, Florida; Raleigh, North Carolina and Charleston, South Carolina. 
To conclude, we are very pleased with our second quarter performance, and we're well positioned to deliver solid results in the last half of the year. We will continue to realize the considerable benefits of our superior geographic positions, operating in markets that are economically diverse and high-growth. We remain committed to the diligent execution of our strategic plan, steadfast to our core foundation of pillars of operational excellence, cost discipline, customer satisfaction and sustainability and dedicated to delivering increased shareholder value.

And, really, as we rack it up, it falls into 3 different buckets. Number one, I would say shale volume was down about 750,000 tons versus the prior year. So that's your first bridge number. Your second bridge number, Kathryn, should be on the railroad balance. We saw that down about 250,000 tons compared to the prior year. But still the single largest moving factor there is relative to what we experienced with respect to weather. We're seeing tonnage affected by weather somewhere between 1 million and 1.5 million tons a quarter. So that gives you your bridge. The other part of your question, and I think it's a good one, Kathryn, is what are we looking relative to backlogs and how does that feel. And what I would say, in particular, Texas last year, had the wettest May in history. This year, it had one other wettest May in history. I mentioned that because if we simply look at a portion of the Texas market, let's look at what we've got in North Texas, we've got about 3.6 million tons of backlog in North Texas and only about 600,000 of that shipped during the first half of 2016. So clearly, there is pretty considerable, a, backlog and pretty considerable jam up on that backlog. There's some big jobs that are really waiting to go in a more robust fashion U.S. 380, near Denton is one of them. State Highway 175 outside of Dallas is another, and Interstate 45 and 35 both had considerable work. So from a volume perspective, what did we see deferred? It was the 2 million tons broken down into those buckets that I gave you relative to large projects and what the backlog looks like. We feel very comfortable with our backlog, at this position, we just need to be able to go on a number of those jobs, particularly TxDOT jobs. Kathryn, was that responsive?"

Colorado had a much better quarter. If we look at what's going on in Colorado, in the Rocky Mountain group, what I would tell you is everything within the borders of Colorado was really very healthy. The only place in the Rocky Mountain group that we're seeing any degree of volume struggle is outside of Colorado, where it's more ballast driven. So we do have some ballast quarries in Utah, we have one up in Wyoming as well, so we are seeing some pressure of those back to those same issues that we discussed before. What I will tell you is what we're seeing in Metro Denver, what we're seeing North of Denver, what we're seeing South of Denver, whether its aggregates, ready-mix or hot mix is all a very, very healthy marketplace, particularly downstream paving, we're bidding considerably more work this year than we were last year at the same time. I want to say for the quarter, we had been on nearly 35 more jobs in Metro in North than we've been on last year. So we see Colorado being very busy not just for the balance of this year. We see Colorado being very busy for next year. With respect to the other part of your question on North Carolina, we're seeing a very healthy sharp so that's been a market that has continued to perform well. Importantly, as we go East in Charlotte and get to triad, we're seeing considerably more infrastructure work in Greensboro, High Point and Winston-Salem. That's a part of the state because of textiles, furniture and other manufacturing that suffered more than the rest of the state. We are now seeing both residential and nonresidential recovery in that marketplace. As we come farther east yet and hit Raleigh-Durham and Chapel Hill, infrastructure work here is very healthy. Multifamily residential has been very, very healthy. Residential is starting to move in the direction that we would expect. So again, we're seeing a much healthier North Carolina. But part of this state that's still waiting for more economic juice to hit it are the more coastal areas that are continuing to get better and better quarter after quarter. So I didn't want to make sure I went through those areas pretty clearly with you, Kathryn."

And I think that's exactly we're doing I think it's fairly predictable once they saw their volumes declining. That cannot endure because they have thousands of miles of track that they need to maintain. So that's not a matter of if, it's a matter of when. I think with respect to the second part of your question, I think what's going to happen is aggregate business will likely get better service on the railroads because we have been a very steady customer all the way through. So if you go back to the notion that with a larger shippers stoned, on 4 out of the 5 Class I railroads and our network is at least double the next largest network, our ability, I believe, to move stone from stone producing areas to stone starts parts of the country, particularly in South Texas and along the Gulf and Atlantic Coast will oddly enough most likely be helped by the circumstance."

Keep in mind the numbers that we put out at the beginning of the year were based on the balanced numbers that we had been supplied by Class I railroads. So again, the dialogue is active with them. They've been very clear that it was going to be back half pushed. If we're looking simply to the graded power volume or others down on the different railroads. I mean, the fact is we can look at year-to-date car volumes and say UP is down 10%, CSX is down almost 7%, Norfolk Southern down almost 6%.  So you can clearly see why they would pull back. I think going back to Kathryn's point in her question, it can only be held back so long. And keep in mind, a lot of these places, too, have seen pretty considerable flooding in the first half of the year. So where you've got railroads have been underwater and have seen that type of duress, they will have needs as we head into the back half of the year. Now in fairness, if we're looking at what headwinds and tailwinds could be, and it's probably a good moment to think about that as we do at this question. I would clearly put that in a potential headwind for us as we go into the back half of the year. So I really think about those probably in 2 different tranches, Jerry. I think tailwinds that we have going into the back half of the year is the rate and trajectory of recovery into Carolinas and Southeast and some of that, by the way, could be ballast. I think another tailwind that we have is strong demand in the Midwest and Rocky Mountains. And I think a strong contractor backlog is a tailwind as well. So I think you've got those 3. But I do think that if you are looking at what the headwinds are, I think the ballast shipments could be a headwind. And if we don't see some improvement at the back half of the year, there are probably 600,000-ish tons that could be at risk there. Clearly, we do need good normal weather for the balance of the year, and we do need TxDOT to have more of their work go in a more timely basis. And the other issue, and I don't think the railroads necessarily suffer from this, but I think a lot of other trades do right now, getting truck drivers, tradesmen, welders, other things simple within the supply chain are under varying degrees of duress in different parts of the country. So I do think there's some headwinds, I do think there's some tailwinds and I give you that in the context of I do believe ballast is the potential headwind. So fair enough, Jer."

I think our verbiage in the past is because of how long we had gone without a highway bill, it was more likely than usual that we might see some of that activity in the second half of 2016. So it's fascinating to look at where it was happy. I mean, street starts were down 16%. But again, our view was we're going to see an expected recovery in half 2 and really more going into '17. What's fascinating to me, Jerry, is to go back and take a look at some of the key states and look at it over not a several month period but over a 2014 to 2016 time frame relative to the subject. And this is what I find. North Carolina, the change on a percentage '14 to '16, 58%; Nebraska, same time frame, up 41%; Iowa, up 18%; Arkansas, up 11%; South Carolina, up 53%; Florida, up 18%. Now with that same time frame because you did see a pullback, is Texas down, it is. But again, it just seemed that normal give-and-take in that. So again, I'm not sure that we're seeing anything relative to public transportation that's surprising to us.

Number one, I think we need to really give a tip of the hat to our operating teams. Because operating in the type of environment at which they're operating is really challenging because it stop start. And these businesses don't do stop start very well. Here's what I'll tell you. So look at cost structure, momentum on the labor side has been very good, momentum on energy has been very good, momentum on maintenance and repair has gotten considerably better. I mean one of the things that we did last year, in particular, as we accelerated the purchase of some rolling stock, particularly in the Midwestern United States and in some of my earlier comments, I spoke to the fact that, that's going to be a business that's going to be as busy this year as it can be until snow fly is there. And what we saw with incremental additions to rolling stock in that marketplace is we saw maintenance and repair hit considerably better. So again, our cost structure is doing what I believe our cost structure we're doing, again, our teams have done exceptional work. The other piece of it that I think's worth remembering is in large part we're watching the price fall to the bottom line, and that has really been very powerful. And if you think about what you're seeing relative to the price increases, you've heard us say not for a matter of months, but you've heard us say for a matter of years that it would be most likely that you would see the Western United States on a percentage basis price increase outperform the Eastern United States and particularly in parts of Texas. And that's what we're seeing. I think the other thing to your point, Garik, on what it looks like going forward. Part of what I believe you've heard us refer to in the past is that we believed in time, Colorado would start to see that same type of pricing performance with a lag behind Texas. We're starting to see evidence of that taking shape as well. So to your question on incrementals, cost performance has been really very good. Capital deployment has continued to drive down cost in areas that needed to drive down, prices fall into the bottom line. And importantly, it's doing exactly what we thought. And keep in mind, we thought we would see these better incrementals early on in the cycle. So, so far, no surprises."

Clearly, when we spoke about Texas on the last earnings call, we said we thought Q1 maybe going into Q2. It's going to be a shakeout period we're pricing in Texas. Obviously, you've got imports that have come in, at least the Port of Houston that are modestly different than we've seen over the last several years. At the same time, part of what we're doing, particularly in North Texas is we're serving more of our own cement needs in that marketplace as well. So when we're looking at shipping more cement farther to feed some of our ready-mix operations. And you've also got some of the competitive postures that have been in that marketplace. That in my way of thinking is what has really held the price down in addition to the weather that we saw. So as we look at it, clearly, pricing in North Texas is better than it's been in South Texas. We're seeing increases in both markets, and we feel like we've now seen nice stability in that marketplace.

Dallas is doing considerably better, so we need to start with that. But if we're looking at just what's going on relative to ASP, ASPs in the Texas market have clearly outperformed. We're looking at ASPs in that overall market in the Southwest up almost 17%. So if we're looking at that type of performance in Texas, it's much better. What I'll tell you is we looked across 5 different districts of ready-mix in that marketplace. There's only one that has ASPs less than $100 a cubic yard. That's getting them into a much more acceptable type of level. So yes, it's getting better in Texas. While weather was really wet, and was not necessarily ready-mix's friend.

We don't have any ready-mix in Houston, which is probably the single most challenged market in Texas. That's my way of coming back to your very good question. Now we feel pretty good about where we are in the ready-mix business in Texas. It's time to add notion of where you are matters, and where you want to be vertically-integrated matters.

So clearly, I was saying that before we had 8 inches of potential rain flooding across the entire state of Texas. So I guess my view is not that far removed from where PCA is, because if we look at what we think to be capacity additions to Texas over the next several years and who knows if all those come forward even with those capacity additions, what you're seeing is about a 3 million ton per annum shortfall of cement. So what Texas has not had genuinely for a 24-month period is normal weather. They have not had a normal Texas summer and our sense is that's going to happen. And when that happens in construction activity on the public side, which is half of our business is as robust as we believe it will. And when places like Dallas continue to be as they are today, the best housing market in the United States, those are the types of formulas that come together to create cement shortages in that type of circumstance."

This sector doesn't stay down, this sector is going to have to have return. Do I think the sector is going back to the type of volume that we were seeing in 2014, which by the way, was almost 7.5 million tons? I don't think it goes there. But I think it could very well go back to numbers that we were seeing at least in '15 or maybe in '16 if we look at full year '15, that was 3.6 million tons. So basically half of what it had been in '14. I'm not sure that, that is somewhere between that 2.5 million and 3.5 million wouldn't be a good steady run rate for energy as it returns.

So we're looking at ASPs in the Rocky Mountains, for example, that are higher than they are in the Southwest. And that's one reason I say that's a more mature business. But what I would say in the Southwest is, if we're looking at type of growth that I believe we're looking at in North Texas, if we're looking at the type of growth that I think we're looking at in the other markets that are close to that and with some of the large vertically-integrated jobs that we have in South Texas that have multiple years ahead of them. Again, I would say this is a game that's in relatively early innings in Texas right now. If you go back to the comments that I had in my prepared remarks, we anticipate seeing, from a return in other perspective the Texas business looking more and more like the Colorado business. And as we said, we believe the results that we've seen so far this year, in particular, results that we saw in this quarter is good evidence that the team is moving there.

And depending on what the market is going to dictate, how we look at that market, how we want to invest or otherwise. The other thing that we are mindful of, we have the ability to greenfield. We've clearly done that in places like Medina. We're going to do some of that in Hunter. I think we've done that very well. I think we've done more of that probably than others in the space. At the same time, if we go back 8, 9 years ago, this was a company that was producing and selling 205 million tons of stone on a pre-TXI basis. So really, if we're looking at greenfielding in markets, they're going to need to be compelling reasons why to do that because there's really not a lot of need right now to add capacity. The greater need is greater efficiencies and to find those attractive markets where we want to have a more compelling presence. So to the extent that we can look to drive the marketplace in which we have a 1 or 2 position. And right now it's 85% of our markets versus 65%, let's call it, 6 years ago, if we can take that 85% number up to 95% or to 90% and keep doing that, that's awfully good and high use for our dollars, so that's how we're going to think about that."

Let's talk about it in a couple of different tranches. I mean, if we look at it in new money terms and that all of this is new, but some of the hit from some of this is going to be relatively new.

I mean, if we look at it in new money terms and that all of this is new, but some of the hit from some of this is going to be relatively new. I mean Iowa put in $0.10 gas tax effective March 1, 2015, that's going to basically give that state about a 30% increase of construction activity, that matters to us. Obviously, with House Bill 157 last year, Georgia basically increased their gas tax. They added almost $1 billion to annual construction budgets. We think both the Georgia and the Iowa pieces probably hit, obviously, more meaningfully in 2017. But we do think the back half of '16 could see some activities from that. Obviously, Texas has just a very healthy letting schedule, and they have over the last several years. That's going to continue to build on itself. I think the notions that we discussed around project delays administratively is something to be mindful of in Texas. Keep in mind that Prop 7 money is coming when we get to September 2017 that should be about $2.5 billion per annum. Nebraska did not to the same degree that Iowa did, but they put in the gas tax increase of $0.015 on January 1, that's going to go up that same amount for the next 3 years so adds up to a $0.06 increase. That's going to about a $75 million total impact in that state. And we've got a very attractive position there. If we look at what's happened in North Carolina last year when the Legislature was in session, they basically added almost $1 billion to highway transportation spending. Now what North Carolina refers to as the biennium. So that's a 2-year process. South Carolina is looking to do more with what they call their Pennies for Progress Program, which we'd be delighted to see them do. Again, the work that we're seeing in South Carolina, right now in Charleston is very robust work. What we're seeing in Columbia is very good work and equally, Mike Pence is governor of Indiana, wanted to see if he keeps his job as governor of Indiana because Bernie is running for another one. And he's looking to invest an additional $1 billion in state roads, highways, bridges over a 4-year period there. So again, we've got a number of core states that matter a lot to us that do have a series of good initiatives coming behind them. TIGER grants program, you know what, I don't know, we'll just have to see where that goes. I'll tell you I'm still one of those people who feels like the TIFIA program in, where it's going to be impactful can and will be going into the future. And remember what we've seen in TIFIA since 2012 is a $49 billion investment. So in markets that we care deeply about right now, we've seen 2 new applications in calendar 2015 and '16 and clearly, in a couple of projects in Colorado, with $1.7 billion on I-70 and 470, the loop. And then about $1.4 billion DFW project, the Midtown Express. And then we're still waiting for the Monroe bypass in Charlotte to go, and that's about an $839 million job. So I think we'll have to see what happens with Tiger brands, but I think between the FAST Act, state initiatives and what we've seen in TIFIA, it's pretty good future."

To facilitate today's discussion, we've made available during this webcast and on our website supplemental financial information which we believe will be helpful. As detailed on Slide 2, today's teleconference may include forward-looking statements as defined by securities laws in connection with future events or future operating or financial performance. Like other businesses, we're subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially. Except as legally required, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether resulting from new information, future developments or otherwise. We refer you to the legal disclaimers contained in our third quarter earnings release and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which are available on both our own and the SEC websites. 
Also, as a reminder, any margin references in our discussion are based on net sales and exclude freight and delivery revenues. These and other non-GAAP measures are explained in our supplemental financial information on our website and in our SEC filings. 
As set forth in this morning's release, Martin Marietta delivered exceptional record-breaking performance. These results validate the earnings power of our business model and demonstrate how our efforts are translating into enhanced shareholder value. 
In the third quarter of 2016, we expanded margins and set new records for quarterly net sales and profitability. Despite some notable headwinds that I will address later, we achieved record-setting performance due to several attributes that differentiate Martin Marietta. Our commitment to safety, our strategically positioned assets placed geographically in some of the nation's fastest-growing regions, our ability to achieve continued and consistent pricing gains for our valuable products and our relentless focus on cost containment. All of these led to record net sales of $1,038,000,000 and a gross margin of 28%, a 210 basis point improvement over what had been a record-setting prior year third quarter. 
Notably, our profitability growth was achieved in all business lines, demonstrating steady economic recovery across our geographic footprint and product categories. 
Overall, we earned a record $2.49 per diluted share for the quarter. The profitability growth translated into an increase in operating cash flow at nearly $95 million and a $75 million increase in earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation depletion and amortization or EBITDA for the quarter. In fact, the year-to-date September 30, 2016 EBITDA of $742 million is within $9 million of the EBITDA generated for the entirety of 2015. 
At the moment, we believe we're in a more durable, construction-centric recovery across most of our markets. We're confident in our ability to both growth top line revenues, further increase profitability and cash flow, and importantly, continue to enhance long-term shareholder value. 
Widespread pricing gains contributed significantly to our results. Aggregates product line pricing increased approximately 9% over the prior year quarter. Nearly all markets in Texas achieved double-digit pricing growth, which helped lead the West Group's 14% increase in Aggregate average selling price. 
Consistent with our expectations, Aggregates pricing in our Colorado market, up 9% over the prior year quarter, is now beginning to trend with or ahead of the corporate average. 
The Southeast Group and Mid-America Group reported increases of 7% and 5%, respectively. 
The ready-mixed concrete business with operations primarily in Texas and Colorado, delivered a 6% average selling price increase on per cubic yard basis. 
Aggregates product line pricing strength more than offset the quarter's volumes headwinds. Consistent with our commentary into 2016 half year mark, we've seen the fourfold continuing effect of delays in Department of Transportation projects, particularly in Texas, declines in railroad ballast shipments, abnormally wet weather in many markets, and lastly, slower energy-related demand for construction materials. 
For comparative purposes, it's important to remember the third quarter of 2015 benefited from volume tailwinds following months of historic rainfall in many key Martin Marietta markets. 
By contrast, during this year's third quarter, particularly in August and September, important market such as Texas, the Carolinas and Iowa, experienced precipitation rivaling or exceeding the rainfall seen in the second quarter 2015 as best illustrated on the maps on Slide 5. These weather events, together with the second quarter significant rainfall, inevitably led to severe flooding in some areas making heavy-side construction activities oftentimes impossible. 
This circumstance was exacerbated on the Eastern seaboard of the United States in October as Hurricane Matthew left behind approximately 13 trillion gallons of water, nearly 1 billion gallons of which partially filled our Benson, North Carolina quarry. 
Matthew was the first major hurricane on record to make landfall into the Bahamas with the storm's eye wall literally passing through our free board operation. 
While some of our East Coast facilities experienced flooding, sporadic power outages and minor equipment damage, we were able to slowly and systematically resume sales at the vast majority of our affected locations, a testament to the resiliency of our operational teams. 
As is typical with natural disasters, emergency repairs to homes, businesses and transportation networks are vital in the early days and weeks post disaster. Permanent repairs to roads and other structures typically take months or years. 
In this regard, the United States government has approved the early release of federal highway funds for emergency road repairs in North Carolina. 
The personal impact of these storms in our employees and communities is not lost on us. In our home State of North Carolina loan, there are many who continue to experience the devastating effects of flooding. in fact, 34 counties have perceived disaster declarations for public systems and more than 17 Eastern North Carolina counties have disaster declarations for individual assistance. Many families will likely remain in emergency shelters through the upcoming holiday season. Our thoughts and prayers all those affected by Hurricane Matthew from the Caribbean through the Southeastern United States. We stand ready to provide help in terms of materials and support those who need it so that our neighbors can get the relief that they need to start anew. 
Our management has proven to be quite adept in dealing with unforeseen events, and we moved quickly to remedy situations as best we can. Yes, there will be short-term dislocations and sometimes, there will be delays in moving our products to customers, but we see that situation for what it is, temporary. Our business is built on long-term growth potential, and today, we are encouraged by the trends indicating strong underlying demand for our products and future growth for our business. 
This optimism is anchored in positive macroeconomic facts, including the employment growth nationally, a catalyst for construction activity, added 8 million jobs during the past 3 years. We expect the infrastructure growth to be bolstered as funding from the $305 billion FAST Act begins to meaningfully impact construction projects in 2017 and beyond. 
Additionally, many states, notably Texas and Georgia, continue to approve alternative funding sources to finance much needed infrastructure projects to support growing populations. 
In addition to improvements in infrastructure spending, we see broad positive trends in nonresidential growth despite some markets experiencing a slowdown in energy-related demand and the under present bearing interpretation of construction start data. 
For example, both Texas and Georgia are still attracting large corporate headquarter relocations, which is fueling construction activity. In fact, Dallas leads the nation in nonresidential construction growth with Atlanta not far behind ranked #4. 
Similarly, we are particularly pleased to observe positive trends across our markets in North Carolina and South Carolina, with increased investments notably in office, retail, manufacturing and industrial development. We believe construction start data is being affected by the natural ebb and flow of megaprojects through the construction cycle. 
The residential marketplace for Martin Marietta continues to slowly, steadily, and importantly, broadly recover. Dallas still leads the country in housing growth. It's notable, however, that we're seeing a changing but nonetheless, predictable evolution in many cities throughout the United States. 
Specifically, there's an emerging trend in many of our markets toward an increase more entry-level single-family housing activity. This is a natural progression as multifamily vacancy rates are low and corresponding rental rates are high. This circumstance leads to more families transitioning to traditional homes and thus, encouraging developers to open and pursue new subdivision work. 
By its nature, single-family housing is considerably more aggregate intensive than multifamily construction. We see this trend in important Martin Marietta cities such as Atlanta, Charlotte, Raleigh and Austin, just to name a few. 
Furthermore, while all the specific data points are anecdotally important, it's notable that we do not see evidence of saturation or excessive speculate building across our specific geographies. Rather, we believe our markets have room for continued growth and we're well positioned to capitalize on this increased construction activity. 
The ready-mixed concrete product line is benefiting from both strong demand and steady pricing growth. This combination led to a 12% increase in heritage net sales. Including the results from the July acquisition in Central Texas, net sales increased 26%, reflecting significant contributions from large, ongoing energy-related projects in Texas. 
Our pricing strength and relentless commitment to cost discipline, the latter being one of our core foundational pillars, is evident in our gross margin trajectory. The Aggregates business gross margin expanded 120 basis points, led by the Southeast Group, which achieved a 530 basis point improvement. Our Aggregates product line gross margin was 32%, an increase of 50 basis points.  Our Aggregates related downstream operations reported a gross margin of 19%, an increase of 390 basis points. 
For the third quarter, the Cement business generated $60 million of net sales and $30 million of gross profit. Again, this is despite facing project delays and unusually wet weather in Texas. 
Excluding the results of the divested California Cement business from the prior year, quarter which provides the same on same comparison, operational improvements and better pricing led to a 570 basis point expansion into the business's gross margin to nearly 50%. 
The 2015 impact of the now divested California Cement operations is detailed on Slide 
7. The business's third quarter results reflect $2 million of kiln maintenance cost. Fourth quarter expenses are forecasted to be $10 million. 
The Magnesia Specialties business delivered another record quarter with net sales of $60 million, an increase of 5%. Lower natural gas and kiln outage cost led to our gross margin of 38%, an improvement of 400 basis points over the prior quarter. 
Lastly, it's important to note that on a consolidated basis, we achieved an incremental gross margin of 91%, considerably above our internal target. We clearly have a host of trends that will positively affect our top line as well as the diversity of geographic regions and product categories that provide us stability in terms of our sales. Our aim is to always translate any growth into profits and cash. 
Our focus on controllable costs led to a reduction in SG&A expense as a percentage of net sales to 5.4%. Our consolidated earnings from operations for the quarter were $240 million compared with $179 million in the prior year quarter. Our business is generating significant cash, with operating cash flow increasing 30% through the 9 months ended September 30 compared with prior year period. 
Accordingly, we have both the means and the strategic plan in place to undertake value-enhancing acquisition activity as well as fund capital investment in our business, each critical to our near term and long-term strategy. 
That said, we are also appropriately focused on returning cash to shareholders. 
Based on our confidence in the outlook for our business and cash generation, Martin Marietta's Board of Directors recently approved a 5% increase in our cash dividend that was paid in September. Our annualized cash dividend rate is $1.68 per share. Together with our ongoing share repurchase program as of September 30, we returned nearly $900 million to shareholders since the beginning of 2015. 
Over the same period, we've reduced our debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratio from nearly 2.5x to 1.9x at September 30.  At the quarter's end, our ratio was in line with our target. 
During the quarter, we also extended our trade receivables borrowing facility and increased the borrowing base to $300 million. 
In today's earnings release, we updated our full year 2016 guidance. The revisions reflect the project and weather-related delays most notably in the Southwest and the impact of Hurricane Matthew. We thus lowered our aggregates product line volume guidance. Revisions to submit guidance, specifically reflect the higher percentage of shipments to our own internal ready-mixed concrete business, reflective of our recent Central Texas acquisition and the previously discussed near-term headwinds, particularly pertaining to South Texas. 
Overall, we expect strong pricing trends to continue for the full year and record consolidated pretax profitability. 
We believe overall construction markets in our geographies have broadly stabilized and anticipate steady volume growth in 2017. Pricing momentum is expected to remain robust, and we will benefit from leading positions in high-growth markets, including Atlanta, Dallas, Denver and the Carolinas. 
As we look forward to the final 2 months of 2016 and beyond, our profitability outlook is the strongest in years. Our expectation for increased levels of construction activity is underpinned by strong employment gains in our top markets and concurrence by third party forecasters. Of our key states, Florida ranks second nationally in growth while Texas ranks third. Georgia ranks fourth and North Carolina ranks eighth. 
Our longer-term outlook is consistent with those of Dodge MPCA, which forecast growth and construction starts for the remainder of 2016 and the next several years. 
The Dodge Momentum Index, which measures the initial report of nonresidential construction projects and tends to lead nonresidential construction spending by 1 full year, increased over 5% in September to 129, signaling additional growth in what we view as a multi-year recovery. 
The notion of slowing growth in residential construction in the United States has been influenced by decline in multifamily development, with the decrease largely concentrated in a few metro areas such as Miami, Houston and New York. Growth in the entry level single-family portion of residential construction remains positive. 
Dodge currently forecasting a family starts to increase 7% in 2016 followed by 9% growth in 2017 as compared to a multifamily decline of 5% and 2%, respectively. Infrastructure activity should accelerate as the FAST Act and other state funding initiatives in key Martin Marietta markets drive increased construction of highways, streets, roads and bridges. 
To conclude, we're very pleased with our record performance in the third quarter, and we look forward to completing a year of significant accomplishments. We foresee additional growth over the next several years, driven by the successful execution of our strategic plan. We remain committed to our core foundational pillars: World-class safety; ethical conduct; operational excellence; cost discipline; customer satisfaction; and sustainability. 
By doing so, we will be true to our aim of increasing long-term shareholder value.

As I said, we had about 1 billion of gallons of water that has found its way into our Benson quarry. Remarkably, that quarry is still operating from some upper benches and perhaps even more remarkably, we removed about half of that water from that quarry since that quarry [indiscernible] that. And all of that started hitting the Bahamas around October 6, work its way up in East Coast. Looking at process volume impacts, I got to tell you, it's hard to sort that out. But here's the way that I would encourage you to think about it. If we look over the last several years, in October, in the markets or the divisions that were affected by the storm, what we typically see for traditional workday of volumes that could be going to those markets of about 200,000 tons. So if we're starting to clock on October 6 from Matthew hit the Bahamas and consider there a lot of communities in eastern North Carolina that are still very much dealing with the storm and its aftereffects. The range of volumes could be in that 2 million-ton-ish type of framework. And again, these represent about 30% of a typical October volume from those affected areas. So it's hard to put science to it, Trey, but again, we try to look at that sort out what we believe the affect will be, and we think that's not a bad way to think about it. You've raised a very good point, and that is October is an important month. It's an important month for the aggregates industry, it's an important month for Martin Marietta because typically, you have what we're seeing here in North Carolina today. It's temperate, it's dry and clearly Matthew did not permit us to start the month under that normal recipe. But that's how we handicap it right now, Trey. Did that help?"

And what's odd, Trey, is the way that construction starts or actually the score is kept on those because the stats typically include 100% of the total cost of the project in the month of a start. So what happens in the stats is it completely ignores the construction spending covers the period of months or years after the start. So here's what happened with those. If we look at the first half of 2015, my recollection is there's around 13 different projects across the United States valued at $1 billion or more. So there was $9 billion LNG project in Texas, there was an $8.5 billion petrochem plant in Louisiana and I think there were 2 different office starts in New York that in excess of $3.5 billion. By contrast, if you roll forward, take a look of 2016, and you're looking even from the January to July period as opposed to 13 in the previous year, there were only 4 valued at $1 billion or more. But here's what happens, as 2016 progress, you see a growing number of those large projects reach the start stage, and you see the delta in starts suddenly start to close. So as we're sitting here looking at 2016, total construction starts in '16 are estimated to be up 1% to let's call it up 676 billion. But they're expected to grow an additional 5% in 2017. So again, as we're looking at this year that I think has been impacted by a number of very different issues relative to weather, relative to the timing of starts, number one, we're not concerned about what we've seen this year; and number two, as we're looking at both the forecasters are seeing relative to nonres next year, again, this part of what gives us the confidence that I tried to portray in my opening comments."

Trey, I'll tell you what I do. I'll go through what I usually don't do on this call and try to give you an overview what we're seeing on a market-by-market basic.

I'll go through what I usually don't do on this call and try to give you an overview what we're seeing on a market-by-market basic. Before I jump into that, I don't want to tag under what you just said. And here's what I'll say in that regard. Q3 last year set a high bar for Q3 this year. And volume didn't equal for what we did last year, profitability exceeded what we did last year. Equally, people need to remember the construction industry across the U.S. is going to have a very difficult Q1 compare. We had remarkably warm and dry weather compared basis last year or this year in Q1 which means the entire industry is going to have a tougher comp in Q1 next year. Remember what we've always said, too in a lot of years, the last 2 weeks of March, either make or break the first quarter. So I would caution people just to think about that from a rational perspective as we go into the year. If I look at our business in summary fashion and go from west to east and start in the Rocky Mountain division, I would tell you the economic outlook there continues to be very good, private sector growth remains strong. We're putting a lot of energy to work in that marketplace. The DOT program in Colorado is very healthy. In fact, one of the biggest issues CDOT has is having enough bidders on different project. The only real headwind is this division are ballast volumes and we talked about that and clearly they've been affected as the railroads have had more issues relative to energy throughout the year. They're profitable. The outlook I think it's excellent. The ready-mix business is performing at a very high level as is there paving business. One thing that I think it's important to say about that business is I think they're in relatively early innings as far as maturity. I don't think there even stretchy getting Colorado. Midwest, if really we're talking in that context about Iowa, Nebraska, Minnesota. This is absolutely been our most consistent market. Their downs are not very low and their ups are really very steady. Presently, Iowa, which is our largest market in the Midwest, is going absolutely in all cylinders as we go into 2017. We think there will be more DOT money flowing through. We think there's a continuing positive nonres outlook in that marketplace driven by data center activity that continues. And the other thing that we're seeing and this has been a story that you heard about several years ago which you're going to higher here about it more for the next several years, it's reinvigorated wind farm market. And those are very, very aggregates intensive. The other piece of that market that strikes me as really quite good is they have a very healthy residential market. So the only headwind we have in the Midwest is you are seeing lower farm net incomes. When to give you a sense of it, we're watching that move from several years ago at about $80,000 to more like $18,000. I mean, that's a big fall. What I would tell you, too, is 15 or 20 years ago, our market in that marketplace would absolutely positively fall at Ag and that's not what is doing here today. And again, I would say that marketplace is similar to Colorado. I think it's probably in the sixth inning type phase. The Southwest in cement, you've really got to divide to a degree. You've got a North Texas economy that absolutely remains one of the best in the nation. Infrastructure is very strong. We talked about the fact that res is leading the nation as is nonres. The bulk of the I-35 corridor remains very, very positive from Dallas to San Antonio and San Antonio. And what you're seeing in pricing there to us is predictable but a very good story. I think one of the issues that they're going to have in North Texas is finding enough people to do the work, and I'm not talking about us, I'm talking about more contractor, subcontractors, material suppliers and others. I think as you look at that market in North Dallas, it's going to be tight next year. And frankly, our volumes which were very high, into this year are even higher from a backlog perspective going into next year. I think if you give a little bit farther South in Texas, clearly, Houston is feeling the effects of an energy downturn. And we have seen some of that in our business. I think it's important to remember as you think about Houston and Texas overall, 45% of our aggregates volume are in Dallas, 30% are in Central Texas and San Antonio and Austin. About 15% are in Houston. So do we feel some headwinds in Houston? We do. From our perspective, that's not really the big driver of our business. So again, we think that's likely to be a good, steady, stable marketplace. Remember, TxDOT is going to have a of healthy budget, we believe, for the next decade and about 50% of our volumes in Texas find their way to some form of TxDOT. Here's the important piece of it, Trey, and that is what we're seeing as we come across the Mississippi. Because the mid-Atlantic, which really encompasses North Carolina, Virginia and South Carolina is much healthier. We're seeing volumes up in that marketplace. We think we're going to continue to see volumes up in that marketplace. It's notable to see that in Boulder, Colorado today, a handful of years after 500-year of flooding, they still have $35 million that they're putting to flood repair in Boulder, Colorado today. That gives you some sense of a type of investment, I think, we're likely to see not for 1 year or 2, but maybe for the better part of a decade and parts of the Eastern North Carolina. There are considerable parts of I-95 that were literally underwater, and that's clearly not a good thing for highways from our perspective, we think there's going to have a lot of maintenance repair there. As we look at the Southeast and Georgia and Florida, those are 2 of the best economies in the United States today. Plenty of room to grow in the Atlanta market and part of what we're seeing as we believe we're going to see much more work along I-4 next year. I-4 was [indiscernible] from about 6 months worth of delays this year, so again if we looking at where parts of the country are as far as innings are concerned, I think that's one is probably in the third or fourth inning. And finally in the mid-east, which is really what we have in Indianapolis and Ohio and West Virginia. In Ohio, West Virginia is having a tough time. I mean, I think that's a fair observation. Energy has made that market tough. At the same time, as we look at what's going on in Indianapolis today, it has been, and it continues to be a very stable market. Good infrastructure work, better asphalt and better ready-mixed concrete work in that market that we've seen for a while, and we have seen a remarkable absorption on warehousing space and that marketplace. So as we look at that, it's probably deeper in the innings. I would give that probably a seventh inning from a deepness perspective. But that gives you your march literally from east to west or west to east, I suppose, and a sense of where we are in each one of those. I'm sorry for how long that was, but I do think that's important march."

Let's talk a little bit about the acquisition that we've made. We purchased the remaining portion of Ratliff ready-mix. Ratliff is a company that TXI historically had a joint venture relationship with. So this is something that's been on the radar for a while. We picked up about 1.1 million cubic yards, they got 23 plants. And really, it's in that Golden triangle, Kathryn, it's on the I-35 and I-45 corridor. So if you're looking at that's really in a couple of tranches. You're  looking between DFW and Austin, and you're looking between DFW and college station. So that actually fixed an important niche for us in Texas. And as we come back to your question on delays. Our primary delays are going to be in North Texas. As you may recall, in Q2, with half year, we had indicated that we came into 2016 with about a 3.5 million ton backlog of TxDOT work and only 600,000 tons is shipped against the backlog. What I would tell you is that, again, in Q3, there was very limited activity of those projects. But we did start to see some move later in the quarter. And here's one way to think about your question more color. North Texas project delays, we got 20 major projects there in the backlog. One dating back, Kathryn, to fall of 2012, 4 finally started in September 2016, and 3 began in October 2016. 8 of the 20 have not yet begun shipping, and we have an infrastructure backlog now of about 5.4 million tons. The other thing that's important for you to glean is TxDOT has hired several hundred additional people, and we think that's of the moment. And we think that's a moment because I think there's a clear understanding within TxDOT that what they're faced with our administrative delays. We think that they are eager to remove those. So I think we will see nice movement of that in 2017. As I said, what we've seen in 2016 in Texas has been an anomaly relative to that DOT. It hasn't necessarily been that much of an anomaly relative to other state's DTOs, but it has been relative to Texas. So I tried to help on Ratliff and give you the additional color in North Texas, in particular. Is that response helpful, Kathryn?"

The cost structure  is better, we see much better pricing activity in that business of. And here's the other piece we're seeing there. You're seeing some headwinds aggregate volume because you got more brand-new projects in parts of Texas, and you have to be working with wet soils. But when you got concrete and some other gets to be on more industrial or more mature type projects, concrete can actually goes. Here's the odd thing. We were seeing internal aggregates to our ready-mix business actually better in third quarter.

If they've got a heavy financial incentive to go and accelerating project, they will. If they have a strong financial disincentive to get something done, they'll follow that as well. But the it think there are a lot of contractors who are just as busy as they want to be, they're making good money, they don't want to over extend their businesses and if the don't have good multi-year backlogs and just continue to work back in '17, '18, '19 and '20, I think they're very pleased with that. And if you're seeing what we did in this quarter with down volume, if we see just good, steady, slow volume in this business based on the enterprise that we built, I think it's very powerful. And I think additional stimulus from who ever the next President is could be a very powerful in this business. Do think it's a '17 event? No. Do I think it could be a mid-'18 event? Yes, probably so."

Except as legally required, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether resulting from new information, future developments or otherwise. We refer you to the legal disclaimers contained in our third quarter earnings release and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which are available on both our own and the SEC websites. 
Also, as a reminder, any margin references in our discussion are based on net sales and exclude freight and delivery revenues. These and other non-GAAP measures are explained in our supplemental financial information on our website and in our SEC filings. 
As set forth in this morning's release, Martin Marietta delivered exceptional record-breaking performance. These results validate the earnings power of our business model and demonstrate how our efforts are translating into enhanced shareholder value. 
In the third quarter of 2016, we expanded margins and set new records for quarterly net sales and profitability. Despite some notable headwinds that I will address later, we achieved record-setting performance due to several attributes that differentiate Martin Marietta. Our commitment to safety, our strategically-positioned assets placed geographically in some of the nation's fastest-growing regions, our ability to achieve continued and consistent pricing gains for our valuable products and our relentless focus on cost containment. All of this led to record net sales of $1,038,000,000 and a gross margin of 28%, a 210 basis point improvement over what had been a record-setting prior year third quarter. Notably, our profitability growth was achieved in all business lines, demonstrating steady economic recovery across our geographic footprint and product categories. 
Overall, we earned a record $2.49 per diluted share for the quarter. The profitability growth translated into an increase in operating cash flow at nearly $95 million and a $75 million increase in earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization or EBITDA for the quarter. In fact, the year-to-date September 30, 2016 EBITDA of $742 million is within $9 million of the EBITDA generated for the entirety of 2015. 
At the moment, we believe we're in a more durable, construction-centric recovery across most of our markets. We're confident in our ability to both growth top line revenues, further increase profitability and cash flow, and importantly, continue to enhance long-term shareholder value. 
Widespread pricing gains contributed significantly to our results. Aggregates product line pricing increased approximately 9% over the prior year quarter. Nearly all markets in Texas achieved double-digit pricing growth, which helped lead the West Group's 14% increase in Aggregate average selling price. 
Consistent with our expectations, Aggregates pricing in our Colorado market, up 9% over the prior year quarter, is now beginning to trend with or ahead of the corporate average. The Southeast Group and Mid-America Group reported increases of 7% and 5%, respectively. The ready-mixed concrete business with operations primarily in Texas and Colorado, delivered a 6% average selling price increase on a per cubic yard basis. 
Aggregates product line pricing strength more than offset the quarter's volumes headwinds. Consistent with our commentary at the 2016 half year mark, we've seen the fourfold continuing effect of delays in Department of Transportation projects, particularly in Texas; declines in railroad ballast shipments; abnormally wet weather in many markets; and lastly, slower energy-related demand for construction materials. 
For comparative purposes, it's important to remember that third quarter of 2015 benefited from volume tailwinds following months of historic rainfall in many key Martin Marietta markets. By contrast, during this year's third quarter, particularly in August and September, important markets such as Texas, the Carolinas and Iowa, experienced precipitation rivaling or exceeding the rainfall seen in the second quarter 2015, as best illustrated on the maps on Slide 5. These weather events, together with the second quarter significant rainfall, inevitably led to severe flooding in some areas making heavy-side construction activities oftentimes impossible. 
This circumstance was exacerbated on the Eastern seaboard of the United States in October as Hurricane Matthew left behind approximately 13 trillion gallons of water, nearly 1 billion gallons of which partially filled our Benson, North Carolina quarry. 
Matthew was the first major hurricane on record to make landfall into Bahamas with the storm's eye wall literally passing through our free board operation. 
While some of our East Coast facilities experienced flooding, sporadic power outages and minor equipment damage, we were able to slowly and systematically resume sales at the vast majority of our affected locations, a testament to the resiliency of our operational teams. 
As is typical with natural disasters, emergency repairs to homes, businesses and transportation networks are vital in the early days and weeks post disaster. Permanent repairs to roads and other structures typically take months or years. 
In this regard, the United States government has approved the early release of federal highway funds for emergency road repairs in North Carolina. 
The personal impact of these storms on our employees and communities is not lost on us. At our home State of North Carolina loan, there are many who continue to experience the devastating effects of flooding. In fact, 34 counties have perceived disaster declarations for public assistance and more than 17 Eastern North Carolina counties have disaster declarations for individual assistance. Many families will likely remain in emergency shelters through the upcoming holiday season. Our thoughts and prayers are with all those affected by Hurricane Matthew from the Caribbean through the Southeastern United States. We stand ready to provide help in terms of materials and support those who need it, so that our neighbors can get the relief that they need to start anew. 
Our management has proven to be quite adept in dealing with unforeseen events, and we moved quickly to remedy situations as best we can. Yes, there will be short-term dislocations and sometimes there will be delays in moving our products to customers, but we see that situation for what it is, temporary. Our business is built on long-term growth potential, and today, we are encouraged by the trends indicating strong underlying demand for our products and future growth for our business. 
This optimism is anchored in positive macroeconomic facts, including the employment growth nationally, a catalyst for construction activity, added 8 million jobs during the past 3 years. We expect infrastructure growth to be bolstered as funding from the $305 billion FAST Act begins to meaningfully impact construction projects in 2017 and beyond. 
Additionally, many states, notably Texas and Georgia, continue to approve alternative funding sources to finance much needed infrastructure projects to support growing populations. 
In addition to improvements in the infrastructure spending, we see broad positive trends in nonresidential growth despite some markets experiencing a slowdown in energy-related demand and the under present bearing interpretations of construction start data. 
For example, both Texas and Georgia are still attracting large corporate headquarter relocations, which is fueling construction activity. In fact, Dallas leads the nation in nonresidential construction growth with Atlanta not far behind, ranked #4. 
Similarly, we are particularly pleased to observe positive trends across our markets in North Carolina and South Carolina, with increased investment notably in office, retail, manufacturing and industrial development. We believe construction start data is being affected by the natural ebb and flow of megaprojects through the construction cycle. 
The residential marketplace for Martin Marietta continues to slowly, steadily, and importantly, broadly recover. Dallas still leads the country in housing growth. It's notable, however, that we're seeing a changing but nonetheless, predictable evolution in many cities throughout the United States. 
Specifically, there's an emerging trend in many of our markets toward an increase in more entry-level single-family housing activity. This is a natural progression as multifamily vacancy rates are low and corresponding rental rates are high. This circumstance leads to more families transitioning to traditional homes, and thus, encouraging developers to open and pursue new subdivision work. 
By its nature, single-family housing is considerably more aggregate intensive than as multifamily construction. We see this trend in important Martin Marietta cities, such as Atlanta, Charlotte, Raleigh and Austin, just to name a few. 
Furthermore, while all the specific data points are anecdotally important, it's notable that we do not see evidence of saturation or excessive speculate building across our specific geographies. Rather, we believe our markets have room for continued growth and we're well positioned to capitalize on this increased construction activity. 
The ready mixed concrete product line is benefiting from both strong demand and steady pricing growth. This combination led to a 12% increase in heritage net sales. Including the results from the July acquisition in Central Texas, net sales increased 26%, reflecting significant contributions from large, ongoing energy-related projects in Texas. 
Our pricing strength and relentless commitment to cost discipline, the latter being one of our core foundational pillars, is evident in our gross margin trajectory. The Aggregates business gross margin expanded 120 basis points, led by the Southeast Group, which achieved a 530 basis point improvement. Our Aggregates product line gross margin was 32%, an increase of 50 basis points. Our Aggregates-related downstream operations reported a gross margin of 19%, an increase of 390 basis points. 
For the third quarter, the Cement business generated $60 million of net sales and $30 million of gross profit. Again, this is despite facing project delays and unusually wet weather in Texas. 
Excluding the results of the divested California Cement business from the prior year quarter, which provides the same on same comparison, operational improvements and better pricing led to a 570 basis point expansion into the business' gross margin to nearly 50%. 
The 2015 impact of the now divested California Cement operations is detailed on Slide 7. The business' third quarter results reflect $2 million of kiln maintenance cost. Fourth quarter expenses are forecasted to be $10 million. 
The Magnesia Specialties business delivered another record quarter with net sales of $60 million, an increase of 5%. Lower natural gas and kiln outage cost led to a gross margin of 38%, an improvement of 400 basis points over the prior year quarter. 
Lastly, it's important to note that on a consolidated basis, we achieved an incremental gross margin of 91%, considerably above our internal target. We clearly have a host of trends that will positively affect our top line as well as the diversity of geographic regions and product categories that provide us stability in terms of our sales. Our aim is to always translate any growth into profits and cash. 
Our focus on controllable costs led to a reduction in SG&A expense as a percentage of net sales to 5.4%. Our consolidated earnings from operations for the quarter were $240 million compared with $179 million in the prior year quarter. Our business is generating significant cash, with operating cash flow increasing 30% through the 9 months ended September 30 compared with prior year period. Accordingly, we have both the means and the strategic plan in place to undertake value-enhancing acquisition activity as well as fund capital investment in our business, each critical to our near term and long-term strategy. That said, we are also appropriately focused on returning cash to shareholders. 
Based on our confidence in the outlook for our business and cash generation, Martin Marietta's Board of Directors recently approved a 5% increase in our cash dividend that was paid in September. Our annualized cash dividend rate is $1.68 per share. Together with our ongoing share repurchase program as of September 30, we've returned nearly $900 million to shareholders since the beginning of 2015. 
Over the same period, we've reduced our debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratio from nearly 2.5x to 1.9x at September 30.  At the quarter's end, our ratio was in line with our target. During the quarter, we also extended our trade receivables borrowing facility and increased the borrowing base to $300 million. 
In today's earnings release, we updated our full year 2016 guidance. The revisions reflect the project and weather-related delays, most notably in the Southwest and the impact of Hurricane Matthew. We thus lowered our Aggregates product line volume guidance. Revisions to submit guidance, specifically reflect a higher percentage of shipments to our own internal ready mixed concrete business, reflective of our recent Central Texas acquisition and the previously discussed near-term headwinds, particularly pertaining to South Texas. Overall, we expect strong pricing trends to continue for the full year and record consolidated pretax profitability. 
We believe overall construction markets in our geographies have broadly stabilized and anticipate steady volume growth in 2017. Pricing momentum is expected to remain robust, and we will benefit from leading positions in high-growth markets, including Atlanta, Dallas, Denver and the Carolinas. 
As we look forward to the final 2 months of 2016 and beyond, our profitability outlook is the strongest in years. Our expectation for increased levels of construction activity is underpinned by strong employment gains in our top markets and concurrence by third party forecasters. Of our key states, Florida ranks second nationally in growth, while Texas ranks third. Georgia ranks fourth and North Carolina ranks eighth. 
Our longer-term outlook is consistent with those of Dodge and PCA, which forecast growth and construction starts for the remainder of 2016 and the next several years. The Dodge Momentum Index, which measures the initial report of nonresidential construction projects and tends to lead nonresidential construction spending by 1 full year, increased over 5% in September to 129, signaling additional growth in what we view as a multi-year recovery.
The notion of slowing growth in residential construction in the United States has been influenced by decline in multifamily development, with the decrease largely concentrated in a few metro areas such as Miami, Houston and New York. Growth in the entry level single-family portion of residential construction remains positive. 
Dodge currently forecast single-family starts to increase 7% in 2016 followed by 9% growth in 2017 as compared to a multifamily decline of 5% and 2%, respectively. Infrastructure activity should accelerate as the FAST Act and other state funding initiatives in key Martin Marietta markets drive increased construction of highways, streets, roads and bridges. 
To conclude, we're very pleased with our record performance in the third quarter, and we look forward to completing a year of significant accomplishments. We foresee additional growth over the next several years, driven by the successful execution of our strategic plan. We remain committed to our core foundational pillars: World-class safety; ethical conduct; operational excellence; cost discipline; customer satisfaction; and sustainability. By doing so, we will be true to our aim of increasing long-term shareholder value.

As I said, we had about 1 billion of gallons of water that found its way into our Benson quarry. Remarkably, that quarry is still operating from some upper benches, and perhaps, even more remarkably, we removed about half of that water from that quarry since that quarry would sit with that. And all of that started hitting the Bahamas around October 6, worked its way up the East Coast. Looking at precise volume impacts, I got to tell you, it's hard to sort that out, but here's the way that I would encourage you to think about it. If we look over the last several years, in October, in the markets or the divisions that were affected by this storm, what we typically see per traditional workday or volumes that could be going in those markets of about 200,000 tons. So if we're starting to clock on October 6 from Matthew hit the Bahamas and consider there a lot of communities in Eastern North Carolina that are still very much dealing with the storm and its aftereffects, the range of volumes could be in that 2 million-ton-ish type of framework. And again, this represents about 30% of a typical October volume from those affected areas. So it's hard to put science to it, Trey, but again, we try to look at that, sort out what we believe the affect will be, and we think that's not a bad way to think about it. You raised a very good point, and that is October is an important month. It's an important month for the Aggregates industry, it's an important month for Martin Marietta because typically, you have what we're seeing here in North Carolina today, it's temperate, it's dry and, clearly, Matthew did not permit us to start the month under that normal recipe, but that's how we handicap it right now, Trey. Did that help?"

And what's odd, Trey, is the way that construction starts are actually the score is kept on those because the stats typically include 100% of the total cost of a project in the month of the start. So",327,"Sure, I'll try to. I mean, we look at the starts, too. And what's odd, Trey, is the way that construction starts are actually the score is kept on those because the stats typically include 100% of the total cost of a project in the month of the start. So what happens in the stats is it completely ignores. The construction spending covers the period of months or years after the start. So here's what happens with those. If we look at the first half of 2015, my recollection is there are around 13 different projects across the United States valued at $1 billion or more. So there was $9 billion LNG project in Texas, there was an $8.5 billion petrochem plant in Louisiana, and I think there were 2 different office starts in New York that -- in excess of $3.5 billion. By contrast, if you roll forward, take a look of 2016, and you're looking even from the January to July period as opposed to 13 in the previous year, there were only 4 valued at $1 billion or more. But here's what happens. As 2016 progressed, you see a growing number of those large projects reach the start stage, and you see the delta in starts suddenly start to close. So as we're sitting here looking at 2016, total construction starts in '16 are estimated to be up 1% to let's call it up 676 billion, but they're expected to grow an additional 5% in 2017. So again, as we're looking at this year that I think has been impacted by a number of very different issues relative to weather, relative to the timing of starts, number one, we're not concerned about what we've seen this year; and number two, as we're looking at what the third -- forecasters are seeing relative to nonres next year, again, that's part of what gives us the confidence that I tried to portray in my opening comments."

Trey, I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll go through what I usually do on this call and try to give you an overview of what we're seeing on a market-by-market basic. Before I jump into that, I do want to tag on what you just said. And here'",1326,"Sorry, thank you. Trey, I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll go through what I usually do on this call and try to give you an overview of what we're seeing on a market-by-market basic. Before I jump into that, I do want to tag on what you just said. And here's what I'll say in that regard. Q3 last year set a high bar for Q3 this year. And volume didn't equal for what we did last year, profitability exceeded what we did last year. Equally, people need to remember that construction industry across the U.S. is going to have a very difficult Q1 compare. We had remarkably warm and dry weather on a compare basis last year or this year in Q1, which means the entire industry is going to have a tougher comp in Q1 next year. Remember what we've always said, too, in a lot of years, the last 2 weeks of March, either make or break the first quarter. So I would caution people just to think about that from a rational perspective as we go into the year. If I look at our business in summary fashion and go from west to east and start in the Rocky Mountain division, I would tell you the economic outlook there continues to be very good, private sector growth remains strong. We're putting a lot of energy to work in that marketplace. The DOT program in Colorado is very healthy. In fact, one of the biggest issues CDOT has is having enough bidders on different projects. The only real headwind is this division are ballast volumes, and we talked about that and, clearly, they have been affected as the railroads have had more issues relative to energy throughout the year. They are profitable. The outlook, I think, is excellent. Their ready mix business is performing at a very high level as is their paving business. One thing that I think is important to say about that business is, I think, they are in relatively early innings as far as maturity. I don't think they are even in the seventh inning stretch getting Colorado. Midwest, and really we're talking in that context about Iowa, Nebraska, Minnesota, this has absolutely been our most consistent market. Their downs are not very low and their ups are really very steady. Presently, Iowa, which is our largest market in the Midwest, is going absolutely in all cylinders as we go into 2017. We think there will be more DOT money flowing through. We think there is a continuing positive nonres outlook in that marketplace driven by data center activity that continues. And the other thing that we're seeing and this has been a story that you heard about several years ago, but you're going to hear about it more, I think, for the next several years, it's a reinvigorated wind farm market. And those are very, very aggregates intensive. The other piece of that market that strikes me as really quite good is they have a very healthy residential market. So the only headwind we have in the Midwest is you are seeing lower farm net incomes. I mean, to give you a sense of it, we're watching that move from several years ago at about $80,000 to more like $18,000. I mean, that's a big fall. What I would tell you, too, is 15 or 20 years ago, our market in that marketplace would have absolutely positively fall at Ag, and that's not what it's doing here today. And again, I would say that marketplace is similar to Colorado. I think it's probably in the sixth inning type phase. The Southwest in cement, you've really got to divide to a degree. You've got a North Texas economy that absolutely remains one of the best in the nation. Infrastructure is very strong. We talked about the fact that res is leading the nation as is nonres. The bulk of the I-35 corridor remains very, very positive from Dallas to San Antonio and San Antonio. And what you're seeing in pricing there to us is a predictable but a very good story. I think one of the issues that they're going to have in North Texas is finding enough people to do the work, and I'm not talking about us, I'm talking more about contractor, subcontractors, material suppliers and others. I think as you look at that market in North Dallas, it's going to be tight next year. And frankly, our volumes which were very high coming into this year are even higher from a backlog perspective going into next year. I think if you give a little bit farther South in Texas, clearly, Houston is feeling the effect of an energy downturn. And we have seen some of that in our business. I think it's important to remember as you think about Houston and Texas overall, 45% of our aggregates volume are in Dallas, 30% are in Central Texas and San Antonio and Austin, about 15% are in Houston. So do we feel some headwinds in Houston? We do. From our perspective, that's really not the big driver of our business. So again, we think that's likely to be a good, steady, stable marketplace. Remember, TxDOT is going to have a very healthy budget, we believe, for the next decade and about 50% of our volumes in Texas find their way to some form of TxDOT. Here's the important piece of it, Trey, and that is what we're seeing as we come across the Mississippi, because the mid-Atlantic, which really encompasses North Carolina, Virginia and South Carolina is much healthier. We're seeing volumes up in that marketplace. We think we're going to continue to see volumes up in that marketplace. It's notable to see that in Boulder, Colorado today, a handful of years after 500-year of flooding, they still have $35 million that they're putting to flood repair in Boulder, Colorado today. That gives you some sense of the type of investment, I think, we're likely to see not for a year or 2, but maybe for the better part of a decade in parts of the Eastern North Carolina. There were considerable parts of I-95 that were literally underwater, and that's clearly not a good thing for highways. From our perspective, we think there's going to have to be a lot of maintenance repair there. As we look at the Southeast in Georgia and Florida, those are 2 of the best economies in the United States today. Plenty of room to grow in the Atlanta market and part of what we're seeing is, we believe, we're going to see much more work along I-4 next year. I-4 was [indiscernible] from about 6 months worth of delays this year. So again, if we're looking at where parts of the country are as far as innings are concerned, I think that's one is probably in the third or fourth inning. And finally, in the mid-east, which is really what we have in Indianapolis and Ohio and West Virginia. Ohio and West Virginia is having a tough time. I mean, I think that's a fair observation. Energy has made that market tough. At the same time, as we look at what's going on in Indianapolis today, it has been and it continues to be a very stable market. Good infrastructure work, better asphalt and better ready mixed concrete work in that market that we've seen for a while, and we have seen a remarkable absorption on warehousing space in that marketplace as well. So as we look at that, it's probably deeper in the innings. I would give that probably a seventh inning from a deepness perspective. But that gives you your march literally from east to west or west to east, I suppose, and a sense on where we are in each one of those. I'm sorry for how long that was, but I do think that's important march."

Ratliff was a company that TXI historically had a joint venture relationship with. So this is something that's been on the radar for a while. We picked up about 1.1 million cubic yards, they got 23 plants. And really, it's in that Golden triangle, Kathryn. It's on the I-35 and the I-45 corridor. So if you're looking at it, it's really in a couple of tranches. You're looking between DFW and Austin, and you're looking between DFW and College Station. So this actually fits an important niche for us in Texas. And as we come back to your question on delays. And again, our primary delays are going to be in North Texas. As you may recall, in Q2, at half year, we had indicated that we came into 2016 with about a 3.5 million ton backlog of TxDOT work and only 600,000 tons had shipped against that backlog. What I would tell you is, again, in Q3, there was very limited activity on those projects. But we did start to see some movement later in the quarter. I mean, here's one way to think about your question on more color. North Texas project delays, we got 20 major projects there in the backlog. One dating back, get this Kathryn, to the fall of 2012; 4 finally started in September 2016; and 3 began in October of 2016. 8 of the 20 have not yet begun shipping, and we have an infrastructure backlog now of about 5.4 million tons. The other thing that's important for you to glean is TxDOT has hired several hundred additional people, and we think that's a moment. And we think that's a moment because I think there is a clear understanding within TxDOT that what they're faced with are administrative delays. We think that they are eager to remove those. So I think we will see nice movement on that in 2017. As I said, what we've seen in 2016 in Texas has been an anomaly relative to that DOT. It hasn't necessarily been that much of an anomaly relative to other state DTOs, but it has been relative to Texas. So I tried to help you on Ratliff and give you the additional color in North Texas, in particular. Is that responsive, Kathryn?"

The difference is this, flooding was coming back in rivers, and it was -- so you had rivers backing up in Eastern North Carolina, and you had rain in Western North Carolina finding its way to the East and it simply stayed there, and it stayed there for a very long time. And so studying my commentary, we're going to go into the holiday season and still have people living in shelters in Eastern North Carolina. So my sense is, Kathryn, that from an impacted in dollar and cents perspective, going forward, it's likely to be more impactful in Eastern North Carolina than it was in Colorado."

And here's the way that's working, Jerry, I mean our asphalt and paving business in Colorado is a very good business, and they continued to see nice year-over-year improvement in that marketplace. Our ready-mixed concrete business in Colorado is a good, solid, mature ready-mixed concrete business. Here's what's happening: We said that you should expect our ready-mixed concrete business in Texas to continue to get better. And over time, you should see it performing the way that we're seeing our business in Colorado perform. And if you look at that business, that's what's happening. The cost structure  is better, we're seeing much better pricing activity in that business. And here's the other piece that's helping there, you're seeing some headwinds in aggregate volume because you've got more brand-new projects in parts of Texas, and you have to be working with wet soils. But when you got concrete and some of it gets to be on more industrial or more mature type projects, concrete can actually go. So here's the odd thing, we were seeing internal aggregates to our ready-mixed business, actually, better in the third quarter. We're seeing stone going down on road projects coming down in the third quarter, which tells me the underlying business is good. But what you're seeing in Q3 on the downstream businesses is just the better performance that we were expecting to see."

So keep in mind, Craig, even when prop 1 was at its absolute peak, spanning from 2010 to 2015, those fiscal years for Texas, was trending at about $5.2 billion. If we're looking at it right now, prop 1 and prop 7 should provide about $2.5 billion by 2018, rising to $3.1 billion by 2021. So if we're sitting here right now, we're looking at what we feel like it's going to be probably a plus $7 billion program in 2017, very healthy on the out years, going into the year with some of the largest backlogs that we've ever had. So again, as we're looking at TxDOT and looking it at a marketplace that 50% of our volume finds its way into infrastructure, we feel very confident both in the near term and the long term there.

And clearly, that's what we're seeing, we're seeing it plus that. Here's what's happening. You're getting the incremental margin boost because you're seeing a shift to more in the East. And again, Garik, that's something that we've been very transparent on, and we've spoken about for years because we said we couldn't even hit the 60 all by itself, if we were just counting on a Western recovery all by itself.

I'd like to say that I thought we would, but I think that would be a little bit ambitious, so I'm not encouraging you to go and model that.

And the good news is they at somewhere in Marietta states where we think that can very much happen right now.

If they've got a heavy financial incentive to go and accelerate a project, they will. If they have a strong financial disincentive to get something done, they'll follow that as well. But I think there are a lot of contractors who are just as busy as they want to be.

Yes, probably so."

So now we're seeing the Eastern United States go through that same transition, frankly, that we saw the Western U.S. doing 18 or 24 months ago. So directly to your point, if we're building a multi-family facility, really, it's going to take stone on the base and concrete that's going to go into penance. If we see new subdivision work until those roads and streets are accepted by a local municipality for maintenance, everything that we're selling on the roads, everything that we're selling on the sidewalks, everything that we're selling on the utilities, everything that we're selling on a lot counts as residential. So when we see that type of turn hitting a city like Charlotte right now and Atlanta right now and Charlotte right now. By the way, all still in very early stages of that, it is much more aggregate intensive, and we think it's much more powerful."

As detailed on Slide 2, today's teleconference may include forward-looking statements as defined by securities laws in connection with future events or future operating or financial performance. Like other businesses, we're subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially. Except as legally required, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether resulting from new information, future developments or otherwise. We refer you to the legal disclaimers contained in our third quarter earnings release and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which are available on both our own and the SEC websites. 
Also, as a reminder, any margin references in our discussion are based on net sales and exclude freight and delivery revenues. These and other non-GAAP measures are explained in our supplemental financial information, on our website and in our SEC filings. 
As set forth in this morning's release, Martin Marietta delivered exceptional record-breaking performance. These results validate the earnings power of our business model and demonstrate how our efforts are translating into enhanced shareholder value. 
In the third quarter of 2016, we expanded margins and set new records for quarterly net sales and profitability. Despite some notable headwinds that I will address later, we achieved record-setting performance due to several attributes that differentiate Martin Marietta. Our commitment to safety, our strategically-positioned assets placed geographically in some of the nation's fastest-growing regions, our ability to achieve continued and consistent pricing gains for our valuable products and our relentless focus on cost containment. All of this led to record net sales of $1,038,000,000 and a gross margin of 28%, a 210 basis point improvement over what had been a record-setting prior year third quarter. Notably, our profitability growth was achieved in all business lines, demonstrating steady economic recovery across our geographic footprint and product categories. 
Overall, we earned a record $2.49 per diluted share for the quarter. The profitability growth translated into an increase in operating cash flow at nearly $95 million and a $75 million increase in earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization or EBITDA for the quarter. In fact, the year-to-date September 30, 2016 EBITDA of $742 million is within $9 million of the EBITDA generated for the entirety of 2015. 
At the moment, we believe we're in a more durable, construction-centric recovery across most of our markets. We're confident in our ability to both grow top line revenues, further increase profitability and cash flow, and importantly, continue to enhance long-term shareholder value. 
Widespread pricing gains contributed significantly to our results. Aggregates product line pricing increased approximately 9% over the prior year quarter. Nearly all markets in Texas achieved double-digit pricing growth, which helped lead the West Group's 14% increase in Aggregate average selling price. 
Consistent with our expectations, Aggregates pricing in our Colorado market, up 9% over the prior year quarter, is now beginning to trend with or ahead of the corporate average. The Southeast Group and Mid-America Group reported increases of 7% and 5%, respectively. The ready-mixed concrete business with operations primarily in Texas and Colorado, delivered a 6% average selling price increase on a per cubic yard basis. 
Aggregates product line pricing strength more than offset the quarter's volume headwinds. Consistent with our commentary at the 2016 half year mark, we've seen the fourfold continuing effect of delays in Department of Transportation projects, particularly in Texas; declines in railroad ballast shipments; abnormally wet weather in many markets; and lastly, slower energy-related demand for construction materials. 
For comparative purposes, it's important to remember that third quarter of 2015 benefited from volume tailwinds following months of historic rainfall in many key Martin Marietta markets. By contrast, during this year's third quarter, particularly in August and September, important markets such as Texas, the Carolinas and Iowa, experienced precipitation rivaling or exceeding the rainfall seen in the second quarter 2015, as best illustrated on the maps on Slide 5. These weather events, together with the second quarter's significant rainfall, inevitably led to severe flooding in some areas making heavy-side construction activities oftentimes impossible. 
This circumstance was exacerbated on the Eastern seaboard of the United States in October as Hurricane Matthew left behind approximately 13 trillion gallons of water, nearly one billion gallons of which partially filled our Benson, North Carolina quarry. 
Matthew was the first major hurricane on record to make landfall into Bahamas with the storm's eye wall literally passing through our Freeport operation. 
While some of our East Coast facilities experienced flooding, sporadic power outages and minor equipment damage, we were able to slowly and systematically resume sales at the vast majority of our affected locations, a testament to the resiliency of our operational teams. 
As is typical with natural disasters, emergency repairs to homes, businesses and transportation networks are vital in the early days and weeks post-disaster. Permanent repairs to roads and other structures typically take months or years. 
In this regard, the United States government has approved the early release of federal highway funds for emergency road repairs in North Carolina. 
The personal impact of these storms on our employees and communities is not lost on us. In our home State of North Carolina alone, there are many who continue to experience the devastating effects of flooding. In fact, 34 counties have perceived disaster declarations for public assistance and more than 17 Eastern North Carolina counties have disaster declarations for individual assistance. Many families will likely remain in emergency shelters through the upcoming holiday season. Our thoughts and prayers are with all those affected by Hurricane Matthew from the Caribbean through the Southeastern United States. We stand ready to provide help in terms of materials and support those who need it, so that our neighbors can get the relief that they need to start anew. 
Our management has proven to be quite adept in dealing with unforeseen events, and we moved quickly to remedy situations as best we can. Yes, there will be short-term dislocations and sometimes there will be delays in moving our products to customers, but we see that situation for what it is, temporary. Our business is built on long-term growth potential, and today, we are encouraged by the trends indicating strong underlying demand for our products and future growth for our business. 
This optimism is anchored in positive macroeconomic facts, including the employment growth nationally, a catalyst for construction activity, added 8 million jobs during the past 3 years. We expect infrastructure growth to be bolstered as funding from the $305 billion FAST Act begins to meaningfully impact construction projects in 2017 and beyond. 
Additionally, many states, notably Texas and Georgia, continue to approve alternative funding sources to finance much needed infrastructure projects to support growing populations. 
In addition to improvements in the infrastructure spending, we see broad positive trends in nonresidential growth despite some markets experiencing a slowdown in energy-related demand and the under-present bearing interpretations of construction start data. 
For example, both Texas and Georgia are still attracting large corporate headquarter relocations, which is fueling construction activity. In fact, Dallas leads the nation in nonresidential construction growth with Atlanta not far behind, ranked #4. 
Similarly, we are particularly pleased to observe positive trends across our markets in North Carolina and South Carolina, with increased investment notably in office, retail, manufacturing and industrial development. We believe construction start data is being affected by the natural ebb and flow of megaprojects through the construction cycle. 
The residential marketplace for Martin Marietta continues to slowly, steadily, and importantly, broadly recover. Dallas still leads the country in housing growth. It's notable, however, that we're seeing a changing but nonetheless, predictable evolution in many cities throughout the United States. 
Specifically, there's an emerging trend in many of our markets toward an increase in more entry-level single-family housing activity. This is a natural progression as multifamily vacancy rates are low and corresponding rental rates are high. This circumstance leads to more families transitioning to traditional homes, and thus, encouraging developers to open and pursue new subdivision work. 
By its nature, single-family housing is considerably more aggregate intensive than as multifamily construction. We see this trend in important Martin Marietta cities, such as Atlanta, Charlotte, Raleigh and Austin, just to name a few. 
Furthermore, while all the specific data points are anecdotally important, it's notable that we do not see evidence of saturation or excessive speculate building across our specific geographies. Rather, we believe our markets have room for continued growth and we're well positioned to capitalize on this increased construction activity. 
The ready mixed concrete product line is benefiting from both strong demand and steady pricing growth. This combination led to a 12% increase in heritage net sales. Including the results from a July acquisition in Central Texas, net sales increased 26%, reflecting significant contributions from large, ongoing energy-related projects in Texas. 
Our pricing strength and relentless commitment to cost discipline, the latter being one of our core foundational pillars, is evident in our gross margin trajectory. The Aggregates business gross margin expanded 120 basis points, led by the Southeast Group, which achieved a 530 basis point improvement. Our Aggregates product line gross margin was 32%, an increase of 50 basis points. Our Aggregates-related downstream operations reported a gross margin of 19%, an increase of 390 basis points. 
For the third quarter, the Cement business generated $60 million of net sales and $30 million of gross profit. Again, this is despite facing project delays and unusually wet weather in Texas. 
Excluding the results of the divested California Cement business from the prior year quarter, which provides the same on same comparison, operational improvements and better pricing led to a 570 basis point expansion into the business' gross margin to nearly 50%. 
The 2015 impact of the now divested California Cement operations is detailed on Slide 7. The business' third quarter results reflect $2 million of kiln maintenance cost. Fourth quarter expenses are forecasted to be $10 million. 
The Magnesia Specialties business delivered another record quarter with net sales of $60 million, an increase of 5%. Lower natural gas and kiln outage cost led to a gross margin of 38%, an improvement of 400 basis points over the prior year quarter. 
Lastly, it's important to note that on a consolidated basis, we achieved an incremental gross margin of 91%, considerably above our internal target. We clearly have a host of trends that will positively affect our top line as well as the diversity of geographic regions and product categories that provide us stability in terms of our sales. Our aim is to always translate any growth into profits and cash. 
Our focus on controllable costs led to a reduction in SG&A expense as a percentage of net sales to 5.4%. Our consolidated earnings from operations for the quarter were $240 million compared with $179 million in the prior year quarter. Our business is generating significant cash, with operating cash flow increasing 30% through the 9 months ended September 30 compared with prior year period. Accordingly, we have both the means and the strategic plan in place to undertake value-enhancing acquisition activity as well as fund capital investment in our business, each critical to our near term and long-term strategy. That said, we are also appropriately focused on returning cash to shareholders. 
Based on our confidence in the outlook for our business and cash generation, Martin Marietta's Board of Directors recently approved a 5% increase in our cash dividend that was paid in September. Our annualized cash dividend rate is $1.68 per share. Together with our ongoing share repurchase program as of September 30, we've returned nearly $900 million to shareholders since the beginning of 2015. 
Over the same period, we've reduced our debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratio from nearly 2.5x to 1.9x at September 30.  At the quarter's end, our ratio was in line with our target. During the quarter, we also extended our trade receivables borrowing facility and increased the borrowing base to $300 million. 
In today's earnings release, we updated our full year 2016 guidance. The revisions reflect the project and weather-related delays, most notably in the Southwest and the impact of Hurricane Matthew. We thus lowered our Aggregates product line volume guidance. Revisions to submit guidance, specifically reflect a higher percentage of shipments to our own internal ready mixed concrete business, reflective of our recent Central Texas acquisition and the previously discussed near-term headwinds, particularly pertaining to South Texas. Overall, we expect strong pricing trends to continue for the full year and record consolidated pretax profitability. 
We believe overall construction markets in our geographies have broadly stabilized and anticipate steady volume growth in 2017. Pricing momentum is expected to remain robust, and we will benefit from leading positions in high-growth markets, including Atlanta, Dallas, Denver and the Carolinas. 
As we look forward to the final 2 months of 2016 and beyond, our profitability outlook is the strongest in years. Our expectation for increased levels of construction activity is underpinned by strong employment gains in our top markets and concurrence by third party forecasters. Of our key states, Florida ranks second nationally in growth, while Texas ranks third. Georgia ranks fourth and North Carolina ranks eighth. 
Our longer-term outlook is consistent with those of Dodge and PCA, which forecast growth and construction starts for the remainder of 2016 and the next several years. The Dodge Momentum Index, which measures the initial report of nonresidential construction projects and tends to lead nonresidential construction spending by one full year, increased over 5% in September to 129, signaling additional growth in what we view as a multi-year recovery.
The notion of slowing growth in residential construction in the United States has been influenced by decline in multifamily development, with the decrease largely concentrated in a few metro areas such as Miami, Houston and New York. Growth in the entry level single-family portion of residential construction remains positive. 
Dodge currently forecasts single-family starts to increase 7% in 2016 followed by 9% growth in 2017 as compared to a multifamily decline of 5% and 2%, respectively. Infrastructure activity should accelerate as the FAST Act and other state funding initiatives in key Martin Marietta markets drive increased construction of highways, streets, roads and bridges. 
To conclude, we're very pleased with our record performance in the third quarter, and we look forward to completing a year of significant accomplishments. We foresee additional growth over the next several years, driven by the successful execution of our strategic plan. We remain committed to our core foundational pillars: World-class safety; ethical conduct; operational excellence; cost discipline; customer satisfaction; and sustainability. By doing so, we will be true to our aim of increasing long-term shareholder value.

As I said, we had about 1 billion of gallons of water that found its way into our Benson quarry. Remarkably, that quarry is still operating from some upper benches, and perhaps, even more remarkably, we removed about half of that water from that quarry since that quarry would sit with that. And all of that started hitting the Bahamas around October 6, worked its way up the East Coast. Looking at precise volume impacts, I got to tell you, it's hard to sort that out, but here's the way that I would encourage you to think about it. If we look over the last several years, in October, in the markets or the divisions that were affected by this storm, what we typically see per traditional workday or volumes that could be going in those markets of about 200,000 tons. So if we're starting the clock on October 6 when Matthew hit the Bahamas and consider there a lot of communities in Eastern North Carolina that are still very much dealing with the storm and its aftereffects, the range of volumes could be in that 2 million-ton-ish type of framework. And again, this represents about 30% of a typical October volume from those affected areas. So it's hard to put science to it, Trey, but again, we try to look at that, sort out what we believe the affect will be, and we think that's not a bad way to think about it. You raised a very good point, and that is October is an important month. It's an important month for the Aggregates industry, it's an important month for Martin Marietta because typically, you have what we're seeing here in North Carolina today, it's temperate, it's dry and, clearly, Matthew did not permit us to start the month under that normal recipe, but that's how we handicap it right now, Trey. Did that help?"

So wha",323,"Sure, I'll try to. I mean, we look at the starts, too. And what's odd, Trey, is the way that construction starts or actually the scores kept on those because the stats typically include 100% of the total cost of a project in the month of the start. So what happens in the stats is it completely ignores that construction spending covers the period of months or years after the start. So here's what happens with those. If we look at the first half of 2015, my recollection is there are around 13 different projects across the United States valued at $1 billion or more. So there was $9 billion LNG project in Texas, there was an $8.5 billion petrochem plant in Louisiana, and I think there were 2 different office starts in New York in excess of $3.5 billion. By contrast, if you roll forward, take a look of 2016, and you're looking even from the January to July period as opposed to 13 in the previous year, there were only 4 valued at $1 billion or more. But here's what happens. As 2016 progressed, you see a growing number of those large projects reach the start stage, and you see the delta in starts suddenly start to close. So as we're sitting here looking at 2016, total construction starts in '16 are estimated to be up 1% to let's call it $676 billion, but they're expected to grow an additional 5% in 2017. So again, as we're looking at this year that I think has been impacted by a number of very different issues relative to weather, relative to the timing of starts, number one, we're not concerned about what we've seen this year; and number two, as we're looking at what the third -- forecasters are seeing relative to nonres next year, again, that's part of what gives us the confidence that I tried to portray in my opening comments."

Trey, I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll go through what I usually do on this call and try to give you an overview of what we're seeing on a market-by-market basis. Before I jump into that, I do want to tag onto what you just said. And her",1320,"Sorry, thank you. Trey, I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll go through what I usually do on this call and try to give you an overview of what we're seeing on a market-by-market basis. Before I jump into that, I do want to tag onto what you just said. And here's what I'll say in that regard. Q3 last year set a high bar for Q3 this year. And volume didn't equal for what we did last year, profitability exceeded what we did last year. Equally, people need to remember the construction industry across the U.S. is going to have a very difficult Q1 compare. We had remarkably warm and dry weather on a compare basis last year or this year in Q1, which means the entire industry is going to have a tougher comp in Q1 next year. Remember what we've always said, too, in a lot of years, the last 2 weeks of March, either make or break the first quarter. So I would caution people just to think about that from a rational perspective as we go into the year. If I look at our business in summary fashion and go from west to east and start in the Rocky Mountain division, I would tell you the economic outlook there continues to be very good, private sector growth remains strong. We're putting a lot of energy to work in that marketplace. The DOT program in Colorado is very healthy. In fact, one of the biggest issues CDOT has is having enough bidders on different projects. The only real headwind in this division are ballast volumes, and we talked about that and, clearly, they have been affected as the railroads have had more issues relative to energy throughout the year. Their profitability outlook, I think, is excellent. Their ready mix business is performing at a very high level as is their paving business. One thing that I think is important to say about that business is, I think, they are in relatively early innings as far as maturity. I don't think they are even in the seventh inning stretch getting Colorado. Midwest, and really we're talking in that context about Iowa, Nebraska, Minnesota, this has absolutely been our most consistent market. Their downs are not very low and their ups are really very steady. Presently, Iowa, which is our largest market in the Midwest, is going absolutely in all cylinders as we go into 2017. We think there will be more DOT money flowing through. We think there is a continuing positive nonres outlook in that marketplace driven by data center activity that continues. And the other thing that we're seeing and this has been a story that you heard about several years ago, but you're going to hear about it more, I think, for the next several years, it's a reinvigorated wind farm market. And those are very aggregates intensive. The other piece of that market that strikes me as really quite good is they have a very healthy residential market. So the only headwind we have in the Midwest is you are seeing lower farm net incomes. I mean, to give you a sense of it, we're watching that move from several years ago at about $80,000 to more like $18,000. I mean, that's a big fall. What I would tell you, too, is 15 or 20 years ago, our market in that marketplace would have absolutely positively followed Ag, and that's not what it's doing here today. And again, I would say that marketplace is similar to Colorado. I think it's probably in the sixth inning type phase. The Southwest in cement, you've really got to divide to a degree. You've got a North Texas economy that absolutely remains one of the best in the nation. Infrastructure is very strong. We talked about the fact that res is leading the nation, as is nonres. The bulk of the I-35 corridor remains very, very positive from Dallas to San Antonio and San Antonio. And what you're seeing in pricing there to us is a predictable but a very good story. I think one of the issues that they're going to have in North Texas is finding enough people to do the work, and I'm not talking about us, I'm talking more about contractor, subcontractors, material suppliers and others. I think as you look at that market in North Dallas, it's going to be tight next year. And frankly, our volumes which were very high coming into this year are even higher from a backlog perspective going into next year. I think if you get a little bit farther South in Texas, clearly, Houston is feeling the effect of an energy downturn. And we have seen some of that in our business. I think it's important to remember as you think about Houston and Texas overall, 45% of our aggregates volume are in Dallas, 30% are in Central Texas, San Antonio and Austin, about 15% are in Houston. So do we feel some headwinds in Houston? We do. From our perspective, that's really not the big driver of our business. So again, we think that's likely to be a good, steady, stable marketplace. Remember, TxDOT is going to have a very healthy budget, we believe, for the next decade and about 50% of our volumes in Texas find their way to some form of TxDOT. Here's the important piece of it, Trey, and that is what we're seeing as we come across the Mississippi, because the mid-Atlantic, which really encompasses North Carolina, Virginia and South Carolina is much healthier. We're seeing volumes up in that marketplace. We think we're going to continue to see volumes up in that marketplace. It's notable to see that in Boulder, Colorado today, a handful of years after 500-year of flooding, they still have $35 million that they're putting to flood repair in Boulder, Colorado today. That gives you some sense of the type of investment, I think, we're likely to see not for a year or 2, but maybe for the better part of a decade in parts of the Eastern North Carolina. There were considerable parts of I-95 that were literally underwater, and that's clearly not a good thing for highways. From our perspective, we think there's going to have to be a lot of maintenance repair there. As we look at the Southeast in Georgia and Florida, those are 2 of the best economies in the United States today. Plenty of room to grow in the Atlanta market and part of what we're seeing is, we believe, we're going to see much more work along I-4 next year. I-4 was suffering from about 6 months worth of delays this year. So again, if we're looking at where parts of the country are as far as innings are concerned, I think that one is probably in the third or fourth inning. And finally, in the mid-east, which is really what we have in Indianapolis, Ohio and West Virginia. Ohio and West Virginia is having a tough time. I mean, I think that's a fair observation. Energy has made that market tough. At the same time, as we look at what's going on in Indianapolis today, it has been and it continues to be a very stable market. Good infrastructure work, better asphalt and better ready mixed concrete work in that market that we've seen for a while, and we have seen a remarkable absorption on warehousing space in that marketplace as well. So as we look at that, it's probably deeper in the innings. I would give that probably a seventh inning from a deepness perspective. But that gives you your march literally from east to west or west to east, I suppose, and a sense on where we are in each one of those. I'm sorry for how long that was, but I do think that's important march."

Ratliff was a company that TXI historically had a joint venture relationship with. So this is something that's been on the radar for a while. We picked up about 1.1 million cubic yards, they got 23 plants. And really, it's in that Golden triangle, Kathryn. It's on the I-35 and the I-45 corridor. So if you're looking at it, it's really in a couple of tranches. You're looking between DFW and Austin, and you're looking between DFW and College Station. So this actually fits an important niche for us in Texas. And as we come back to your question on delays. And again, our primary delays are going to be in North Texas. As you may recall, in Q2, at half year, we had indicated that we came into 2016 with about a 3.5 million ton backlog of TxDOT work and only 600,000 tons had shipped against that backlog. What I would tell you is, again, in Q3, there was very limited activity on those projects. But we did start to see some movement later in the quarter. I mean, here's one way to think about your question on more color. North Texas project delays, we got 20 major projects there in the backlog. One dating back, get this Kathryn, to the fall of 2012; 4 finally started in September 2016; and 3 began in October of 2016. Eight of the 20 have not yet begun shipping, and we have an infrastructure backlog now of about 5.4 million tons. The other thing that's important for you to glean is TxDOT has hired several hundred additional people, and we think that's a moment. And we think that's a moment because I think there is a clear understanding within TxDOT that what they're faced with are administrative delays. We think that they are eager to remove those. So I think we will see nice movement on that in 2017. As I said, what we've seen in 2016 in Texas has been an anomaly relative to that DOT. It hasn't necessarily been that much of an anomaly relative to other state DOTs, but it has been relative to Texas. So I tried to help you on Ratliff and give you the additional color in North Texas, in particular. Is that responsive, Kathryn?"

The difference is this, flooding was coming back in rivers, and it was -- so you had rivers backing up in Eastern North Carolina, and you had rain in Western North Carolina finding its way to the East and it simply stayed there, and it stayed there for a very long time. And so studying my commentary, we're going to go into the holiday season and still have people living in shelters in Eastern North Carolina. So my sense is, Kathryn, that from an impact in dollar and cents perspective, going forward, it's likely to be more impactful in Eastern North Carolina than it was in Colorado."

What we're seeing in Vidlothian [ph] is a very healthy market, and what we're seeing there relative to volumes and what we're seeing relative to price is -- it's pretty good place.

And here's the way that's working, Jerry, I mean our asphalt and paving business in Colorado is a very good business, and they continue to see nice year-over-year improvement in that marketplace. Our ready-mixed concrete business in Colorado is a good, solid, mature ready-mixed concrete business. Here's what's happening: We said that you should expect our ready-mixed concrete business in Texas to continue to get better. And over time, you should see it performing the way that we're seeing our business in Colorado perform. And if you look at that business, that's what's happening. The cost structure is better, we're seeing much better pricing activity in that business. And here's the other piece that's helping there, you're seeing some headwinds in aggregate volume because you've got more brand-new projects in parts of Texas, and you have to be working with wet soils. But when you've got  concrete and some of it gets to be on more industrial or more mature type projects, concrete can actually go. So here's the odd thing, we were seeing internal aggregates to our ready-mixed business, actually, better in the third quarter. We're seeing stone going down on road projects coming down in the third quarter, which tells me the underlying business is good. But what you're seeing in Q3 on the downstream businesses is just the better performance that we were expecting to see."

So keep in mind, Craig, even when prop 1 was at its absolute peak, spanning from 2010 to 2015, those fiscal years for Texas, was trending at about $5.2 billion. If we're looking at it right now, prop 1 and prop 7 should provide about $2.5 billion by 2018, rising to $3.1 billion by 2021. So if we're sitting here right now, we're looking at what we feel like is going to be probably a plus $7 billion program in 2017, very healthy on the out years, going into the year with some of the largest backlogs that we've ever had. So again, as we're looking at TxDOT and looking at a marketplace that 50% of our volume finds its way into infrastructure, we feel very confident both in the near term and the long term there.

And clearly, that's what we're seeing, we're seeing it plus that. Here's what's happening. You're getting the incremental margin boost because you're seeing a shift to more in the East. And again, Garik, that's something that we've been very transparent on, and we've spoken about for years because we said we couldn't even hit the 60 all by itself, if we were just counting on a Western recovery all by itself. So if you believe as I do, that we're in early innings in the Southeast and in relatively early innings in the Mid-Atlantic, then I think we're going to be certainly above that target as we said. Now, do I think we're going to show up every quarter with 90%? I'd like to say that I thought we would, but I think that would be a little bit ambitious, so I'm not encouraging you to go and model that. But again, I think, if you just come back, think about that average on 60 and keep in mind, pricing is probably doing better than we thought it was going to do as we went though the cycle. So maybe it lasts a little bit longer than we thought it would when we said that first 40 million tons. So I would tell you, it has the capacity to endure. I think geographic mix is our friend.

And the good news is they at somewhere in Marietta states where we think that can very much happen right now. But here's what's different and I think it's interesting, Stanley, and it's a clear, recurring theme that we're hearing from contractors and that is, they're busy, and they haven't gone and hired a bunch of new people to come to work for them because they're busy. If they've got a heavy financial incentive to go and accelerate a project, they will. If they have a strong financial disincentive to get something done, they'll follow that as well. But I think there are a lot of contractors who are just as busy as they want to be. They're making good money, they don't want to overextend their businesses and if they can have good multi-year backlogs and just continue to work that in '17, '18, '19 and '20, I think they're pretty pleased with that.

So now we're seeing the Eastern United States go through that same transition, frankly, that we saw the Western U.S. doing 18 or 24 months ago. So directly to your point, if we're building a multi-family facility, really, it's going to take stone on the base and concrete, that's going to go on the pads. If we see new subdivision work until those roads and streets are accepted by a local municipality for maintenance, everything that we're selling on the roads, everything that we're selling on the sidewalks, everything that we're selling on the utilities, everything that we're selling on the lot counts as residential. So when we see that type of turn hitting a city like Charlotte right now and Atlanta right now and Charlotte right now. By the way, all still in very early stages of that, it is much more aggregate intensive, and we think it's much more powerful."

To facilitate today's discussion, we've made available during this webcast and on our website supplemental financial information which we believe will be helpful. As detailed on Slide 2, today's teleconference may include forward-looking statements as defined by securities laws in connection with future events or future operating or financial performance. Like other businesses, we're subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially. Except as legally required, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether resulting from new information, future developments or otherwise. We refer you to the legal disclaimers contained in our third quarter earnings release and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which are available on both our own and the SEC websites. 
Also, as a reminder, any margin references in our discussion are based on net sales and exclude freight and delivery revenues. These and other non-GAAP measures are explained in our supplemental financial information, on our website and in our SEC filings. 
As set forth in this morning's release, Martin Marietta delivered exceptional record-breaking performance. These results validate the earnings power of our business model and demonstrate how our efforts are translating into enhanced shareholder value. 
In the third quarter of 2016, we expanded margins and set new records for quarterly net sales and profitability. Despite some notable headwinds that I will address later, we achieved record-setting performance due to several attributes that differentiate Martin Marietta. Our commitment to safety, our strategically positioned assets placed geographically in some of the nation's fastest-growing regions, our ability to achieve continued and consistent pricing gains for our valuable products and our relentless focus on cost containment. All of this led to record net sales of $1,038,000,000 and a gross margin of 28%, a 210 basis point improvement over what had been a record-setting prior year third quarter. Notably, our profitability growth was achieved in all business lines, demonstrating steady economic recovery across our geographic footprint and product categories. 
Overall, we earned a record $2.49 per diluted share for the quarter. The profitability growth translated into an increase in operating cash flow at nearly $95 million and a $75 million increase in earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization or EBITDA for the quarter. In fact, the year-to-date September 30, 2016 EBITDA of $742 million is within $9 million of the EBITDA generated for the entirety of 2015. 
At the moment, we believe we're in a more durable, construction-centric recovery across most of our markets. We're confident in our ability to both grow top line revenues, further increase profitability and cash flow, and importantly, continue to enhance long-term shareholder value. 
Widespread pricing gains contributed significantly to our results. Aggregates product line pricing increased approximately 9% over the prior year quarter. Nearly all markets in Texas achieved double-digit pricing growth, which helped lead the West Group's 14% increase in Aggregate average selling price. 
Consistent with our expectations, Aggregates pricing in our Colorado market, up 9% over the prior year quarter, is now beginning to trend with or ahead of the corporate average. The Southeast Group and Mid-America Group reported increases of 7% and 5%, respectively. The ready-mixed concrete business with operations primarily in Texas and Colorado, delivered a 6% average selling price increase on a per cubic yard basis. 
Aggregates product line pricing strength more than offset the quarter's volume headwinds. Consistent with our commentary at the 2016 half year mark, we've seen the fourfold continuing effect of delays in Department of Transportation projects, particularly in Texas; declines in railroad ballast shipments; abnormally wet weather in many markets; and lastly, slower energy-related demand for construction materials. 
For comparative purposes, it's important to remember that third quarter of 2015 benefited from volume tailwinds following months of historic rainfall in many key Martin Marietta markets. By contrast, during this year's third quarter, particularly in August and September, important markets such as Texas, the Carolinas and Iowa, experienced precipitation rivaling or exceeding the rainfall seen in the second quarter 2015, as best illustrated on the maps on Slide 5. These weather events, together with the second quarter's significant rainfall, inevitably led to severe flooding in some areas making heavy-side construction activities oftentimes impossible. 
This circumstance was exacerbated on the Eastern seaboard of the United States in October as Hurricane Matthew left behind approximately 13 trillion gallons of water, nearly 1 billion gallons of which partially filled our Benson, North Carolina quarry. 
Matthew was the first major hurricane on record to make landfall into Bahamas with the storm's eye wall literally passing through our Freeport operation. 
While some of our East Coast facilities experienced flooding, sporadic power outages and minor equipment damage, we were able to slowly and systematically resume sales at the vast majority of our affected locations, a testament to the resiliency of our operational teams. 
As is typical with natural disasters, emergency repairs to homes, businesses and transportation networks are vital in the early days and weeks post-disaster. Permanent repairs to roads and other structures typically take months or years. 
In this regard, the United States government has approved the early release of federal highway funds for emergency road repairs in North Carolina. 
The personal impact of these storms on our employees and communities is not lost on us. In our home State of North Carolina alone, there are many who continue to experience the devastating effects of flooding. In fact, 34 counties have perceived disaster declarations for public assistance and more than 17 Eastern North Carolina counties have disaster declarations for individual assistance. Many families will likely remain in emergency shelters through the upcoming holiday season. Our thoughts and prayers are with all those affected by Hurricane Matthew from the Caribbean through the Southeastern United States. We stand ready to provide help in terms of materials and support those who need it, so that our neighbors can get the relief that they need to start anew. 
Our management has proven to be quite adept in dealing with unforeseen events, and we moved quickly to remedy situations as best we can. Yes, there will be short-term dislocations and sometimes there will be delays in moving our products to customers, but we see that situation for what it is, temporary. Our business is built on long-term growth potential, and today, we are encouraged by the trends indicating strong underlying demand for our products and future growth for our business. 
This optimism is anchored in positive macroeconomic facts, including the employment growth nationally, a catalyst for construction activity, added 8 million jobs during the past 3 years. We expect infrastructure growth to be bolstered as funding from the $305 billion FAST Act begins to meaningfully impact construction projects in 2017 and beyond. 
Additionally, many states, notably Texas and Georgia, continue to approve alternative funding sources to finance much needed infrastructure projects to support growing populations. 
In addition to improvements in the infrastructure spending, we see broad positive trends in nonresidential growth despite some markets experiencing a slowdown in energy-related demand and the under-present bearing interpretations of construction start data. 
For example, both Texas and Georgia are still attracting large corporate headquarter relocations, which is fueling construction activity. In fact, Dallas leads the nation in nonresidential construction growth with Atlanta not far behind, ranked #4. 
Similarly, we are particularly pleased to observe positive trends across our markets in North Carolina and South Carolina, with increased investment notably in office, retail, manufacturing and industrial development. We believe construction start data is being affected by the natural ebb and flow of megaprojects through the construction cycle. 
The residential marketplace for Martin Marietta continues to slowly, steadily, and importantly, broadly recover. Dallas still leads the country in housing growth. It's notable, however, that we're seeing a changing but nonetheless, predictable evolution in many cities throughout the United States. 
Specifically, there's an emerging trend in many of our markets toward an increase in more entry-level single-family housing activity. This is a natural progression as multifamily vacancy rates are low and corresponding rental rates are high. This circumstance leads to more families transitioning to traditional homes, and thus, encouraging developers to open and pursue new subdivision work. 
By its nature, single-family housing is considerably more aggregate intensive than as multifamily construction. We see this trend in important Martin Marietta cities, such as Atlanta, Charlotte, Raleigh and Austin, just to name a few. 
Furthermore, while all the specific data points are anecdotally important, it's notable that we do not see evidence of saturation or excessive speculate building across our specific geographies. Rather, we believe our markets have room for continued growth and we're well positioned to capitalize on this increased construction activity. 
The ready mixed concrete product line is benefiting from both strong demand and steady pricing growth. This combination led to a 12% increase in heritage net sales. Including the results from a July acquisition in Central Texas, net sales increased 26%, reflecting significant contributions from large, ongoing energy-related projects in Texas. 
Our pricing strength and relentless commitment to cost discipline, the latter being one of our core foundational pillars, is evident in our gross margin trajectory. The Aggregates business gross margin expanded 120 basis points, led by the Southeast Group, which achieved a 530 basis point improvement. Our Aggregates product line gross margin was 32%, an increase of 50 basis points. Our Aggregates-related downstream operations reported a gross margin of 19%, an increase of 390 basis points. 
For the third quarter, the Cement business generated $60 million of net sales and $30 million of gross profit. Again, this is despite facing project delays and unusually wet weather in Texas. 
Excluding the results of the divested California Cement business from the prior year quarter, which provides the same on same comparison, operational improvements and better pricing led to a 570 basis point expansion into the business' gross margin to nearly 50%. 
The 2015 impact of the now divested California Cement operations is detailed on Slide 7. The business' third quarter results reflect $2 million of kiln maintenance cost. Fourth quarter expenses are forecasted to be $10 million. 
The Magnesia Specialties business delivered another record quarter with net sales of $60 million, an increase of 5%. Lower natural gas and kiln outage cost led to a gross margin of 38%, an improvement of 400 basis points over the prior year quarter. 
Lastly, it's important to note that on a consolidated basis, we achieved an incremental gross margin of 91%, considerably above our internal target. We clearly have a host of trends that will positively affect our top line as well as the diversity of geographic regions and product categories that provide us stability in terms of our sales. Our aim is to always translate any growth into profits and cash. 
Our focus on controllable costs led to a reduction in SG&A expense as a percentage of net sales to 5.4%. Our consolidated earnings from operations for the quarter were $240 million compared with $179 million in the prior year quarter. Our business is generating significant cash, with operating cash flow increasing 30% through the 9 months ended September 30 compared with prior year period. Accordingly, we have both the means and the strategic plan in place to undertake value-enhancing acquisition activity as well as fund capital investment in our business, each critical to our near term and long-term strategy. That said, we are also appropriately focused on returning cash to shareholders. 
Based on our confidence in the outlook for our business and cash generation, Martin Marietta's Board of Directors recently approved a 5% increase in our cash dividend that was paid in September. Our annualized cash dividend rate is $1.68 per share. Together with our ongoing share repurchase program as of September 30, we've returned nearly $900 million to shareholders since the beginning of 2015. 
Over the same period, we've reduced our debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratio from nearly 2.5x to 1.9x at September 30.  At the quarter's end, our ratio was in line with our target. During the quarter, we also extended our trade receivables borrowing facility and increased the borrowing base to $300 million. 
In today's earnings release, we updated our full year 2016 guidance. The revisions reflect the project and weather-related delays, most notably in the Southwest and the impact of Hurricane Matthew. We thus lowered our Aggregates product line volume guidance. Revisions to submit guidance, specifically reflect a higher percentage of shipments to our own internal ready mixed concrete business, reflective of our recent Central Texas acquisition and the previously discussed near-term headwinds, particularly pertaining to South Texas. Overall, we expect strong pricing trends to continue for the full year and record consolidated pretax profitability. 
We believe overall construction markets in our geographies have broadly stabilized and anticipate steady volume growth in 2017. Pricing momentum is expected to remain robust, and we will benefit from leading positions in high-growth markets, including Atlanta, Dallas, Denver and the Carolinas. 
As we look forward to the final 2 months of 2016 and beyond, our profitability outlook is the strongest in years. Our expectation for increased levels of construction activity is underpinned by strong employment gains in our top markets and concurrence by third party forecasters. Of our key states, Florida ranks second nationally in growth, while Texas ranks third. Georgia ranks fourth and North Carolina ranks eighth. 
Our longer-term outlook is consistent with those of Dodge and PCA, which forecast growth and construction starts for the remainder of 2016 and the next several years. The Dodge Momentum Index, which measures the initial report of nonresidential construction projects and tends to lead nonresidential construction spending by 1 full year, increased over 5% in September to 129, signaling additional growth in what we view as a multi-year recovery.
The notion of slowing growth in residential construction in the United States has been influenced by decline in multifamily development, with the decrease largely concentrated in a few metro areas such as Miami, Houston and New York. Growth in the entry level single-family portion of residential construction remains positive. 
Dodge currently forecasts single-family starts to increase 7% in 2016 followed by 9% growth in 2017 as compared to a multifamily decline of 5% and 2%, respectively. Infrastructure activity should accelerate as the FAST Act and other state funding initiatives in key Martin Marietta markets drive increased construction of highways, streets, roads and bridges. 
To conclude, we're very pleased with our record performance in the third quarter, and we look forward to completing a year of significant accomplishments. We foresee additional growth over the next several years, driven by the successful execution of our strategic plan. We remain committed to our core foundational pillars: World-class safety; ethical conduct; operational excellence; cost discipline; customer satisfaction; and sustainability. By doing so, we will be true to our aim of increasing long-term shareholder value.

As I said, we had about 1 billion of gallons of water that found its way into our Benson quarry. Remarkably, that quarry is still operating from some upper benches, and perhaps, even more remarkably, we removed about half of that water from that quarry since that quarry would sit with that. And all of that started hitting the Bahamas around October 6, worked its way up the East Coast. Looking at precise volume impacts, I got to tell you, it's hard to sort that out, but here's the way that I would encourage you to think about it. If we look over the last several years, in October, in the markets or the divisions that were affected by this storm, what we typically see per traditional workday or volumes that could be going in those markets of about 200,000 tons. So if we're starting the clock on October 6 when Matthew hit the Bahamas and consider there a lot of communities in Eastern North Carolina that are still very much dealing with the storm and its aftereffects, the range of volumes could be in that 2 million-ton-ish type of framework. And again, this represents about 30% of a typical October volume from those affected areas. So it's hard to put science to it, Trey, but again, we try to look at that, sort out what we believe the effect will be, and we think that's not a bad way to think about it. You raised a very good point, and that is October is an important month. It's an important month for the Aggregates industry, it's an important month for Martin Marietta because typically, you have what we're seeing here in North Carolina today, it's temperate, it's dry and, clearly, Matthew did not permit us to start the month under that normal recipe, but that's how we handicap it right now, Trey. Did that help?"

So wha",323,"Sure, I'll try to. I mean, we look at the starts, too. And what's odd, Trey, is the way that construction starts or actually the scores kept on those because the stats typically include 100% of the total cost of a project in the month of the start. So what happens in the stats is it completely ignores that construction spending covers the period of months or years after the start. So here's what happens with those. If we look at the first half of 2015, my recollection is there are around 13 different projects across the United States valued at $1 billion or more. So there was $9 billion LNG project in Texas, there was an $8.5 billion petrochem plant in Louisiana, and I think there were 2 different office starts in New York in excess of $3.5 billion. By contrast, if you roll forward, take a look of 2016, and you're looking even from the January to July period as opposed to 13 in the previous year, there were only 4 valued at $1 billion or more. But here's what happens. As 2016 progressed, you see a growing number of those large projects reach the start stage, and you see the delta in starts suddenly start to close. So as we're sitting here looking at 2016, total construction starts in '16 are estimated to be up 1% to let's call it $676 billion, but they're expected to grow an additional 5% in 2017. So again, as we're looking at this year that I think has been impacted by a number of very different issues relative to weather, relative to the timing of starts, number one, we're not concerned about what we've seen this year; and number two, as we're looking at what the third -- forecasters are seeing relative to nonres next year, again, that's part of what gives us the confidence that I tried to portray in my opening comments."

Trey, I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll go through what I usually do on this call and try to give you an overview of what we're seeing on a market-by-market basis. Before I jump into that, I do want to tag onto what you just said. And her",1320,"Sorry, thank you. Trey, I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll go through what I usually do on this call and try to give you an overview of what we're seeing on a market-by-market basis. Before I jump into that, I do want to tag onto what you just said. And here's what I'll say in that regard. Q3 last year set a high bar for Q3 this year. And volume didn't equal for what we did last year, profitability exceeded what we did last year. Equally, people need to remember the construction industry across the U.S. is going to have a very difficult Q1 compare. We had remarkably warm and dry weather on a compare basis last year or this year in Q1, which means the entire industry is going to have a tougher comp in Q1 next year. Remember what we've always said, too, in a lot of years, the last 2 weeks of March, either make or break the first quarter. So I would caution people just to think about that from a rational perspective as we go into the year. If I look at our business in summary fashion and go from west to east and start in the Rocky Mountain division, I would tell you the economic outlook there continues to be very good, private sector growth remains strong. We're putting a lot of energy to work in that marketplace. The DOT program in Colorado is very healthy. In fact, one of the biggest issues CDOT has is having enough bidders on different projects. The only real headwind in this division are ballast volumes, and we talked about that and, clearly, they have been affected as the railroads have had more issues relative to energy throughout the year. Their profitability outlook, I think, is excellent. Their ready mix business is performing at a very high level as is their paving business. One thing that I think is important to say about that business is, I think, they are in relatively early innings as far as maturity. I don't think they are even in the seventh inning stretch getting Colorado. Midwest, and really we're talking in that context about Iowa, Nebraska, Minnesota, this has absolutely been our most consistent market. Their downs are not very low and their ups are really very steady. Presently, Iowa, which is our largest market in the Midwest, is going absolutely in all cylinders as we go into 2017. We think there will be more DOT money flowing through. We think there is a continuing positive nonres outlook in that marketplace driven by data center activity that continues. And the other thing that we're seeing and this has been a story that you heard about several years ago, but you're going to hear about it more, I think, for the next several years, it's a reinvigorated wind farm market. And those are very aggregates intensive. The other piece of that market that strikes me as really quite good is they have a very healthy residential market. So the only headwind we have in the Midwest is you are seeing lower farm net incomes. I mean, to give you a sense of it, we're watching that move from several years ago at about $80,000 to more like $18,000. I mean, that's a big fall. What I would tell you, too, is 15 or 20 years ago, our market in that marketplace would have absolutely positively followed Ag, and that's not what it's doing here today. And again, I would say that marketplace is similar to Colorado. I think it's probably in the sixth inning type phase. The Southwest in cement, you've really got to divide to a degree. You've got a North Texas economy that absolutely remains one of the best in the nation. Infrastructure is very strong. We talked about the fact that res is leading the nation, as is nonres. The bulk of the I-35 corridor remains very, very positive from Dallas to San Antonio and San Antonio. And what you're seeing in pricing there to us is a predictable but a very good story. I think one of the issues that they're going to have in North Texas is finding enough people to do the work, and I'm not talking about us, I'm talking more about contractor, subcontractors, material suppliers and others. I think as you look at that market in North Dallas, it's going to be tight next year. And frankly, our volumes which were very high coming into this year are even higher from a backlog perspective going into next year. I think if you get a little bit farther South in Texas, clearly, Houston is feeling the effect of an energy downturn. And we have seen some of that in our business. I think it's important to remember as you think about Houston and Texas overall, 45% of our aggregates volume are in Dallas, 30% are in Central Texas, San Antonio and Austin, about 15% are in Houston. So do we feel some headwinds in Houston? We do. From our perspective, that's really not the big driver of our business. So again, we think that's likely to be a good, steady, stable marketplace. Remember, TxDOT is going to have a very healthy budget, we believe, for the next decade and about 50% of our volumes in Texas find their way to some form of TxDOT. Here's the important piece of it, Trey, and that is what we're seeing as we come across the Mississippi, because the mid-Atlantic, which really encompasses North Carolina, Virginia and South Carolina is much healthier. We're seeing volumes up in that marketplace. We think we're going to continue to see volumes up in that marketplace. It's notable to see that in Boulder, Colorado today, a handful of years after 500-year of flooding, they still have $35 million that they're putting to flood repair in Boulder, Colorado today. That gives you some sense of the type of investment, I think, we're likely to see not for a year or 2, but maybe for the better part of a decade in parts of the Eastern North Carolina. There were considerable parts of I-95 that were literally underwater, and that's clearly not a good thing for highways. From our perspective, we think there's going to have to be a lot of maintenance repair there. As we look at the Southeast in Georgia and Florida, those are 2 of the best economies in the United States today. Plenty of room to grow in the Atlanta market and part of what we're seeing is, we believe, we're going to see much more work along I-4 next year. I-4 was suffering from about 6 months worth of delays this year. So again, if we're looking at where parts of the country are as far as innings are concerned, I think that one is probably in the third or fourth inning. And finally, in the mid-east, which is really what we have in Indianapolis, Ohio and West Virginia. Ohio and West Virginia is having a tough time. I mean, I think that's a fair observation. Energy has made that market tough. At the same time, as we look at what's going on in Indianapolis today, it has been and it continues to be a very stable market. Good infrastructure work, better asphalt and better ready mixed concrete work in that market that we've seen for a while, and we have seen a remarkable absorption on warehousing space in that marketplace as well. So as we look at that, it's probably deeper in the innings. I would give that probably a seventh inning from a deepness perspective. But that gives you your march literally from east to west or west to east, I suppose, and a sense on where we are in each one of those. I'm sorry for how long that was, but I do think that's important march."

Ratliff was a company that TXI historically had a joint venture relationship with. So this is something that's been on the radar for a while. We picked up about 1.1 million cubic yards, they got 23 plants. And really, it's in that Golden triangle, Kathryn. It's on the I-35 and the I-45 corridor. So if you're looking at it, it's really in a couple of tranches. You're looking between DFW and Austin, and you're looking between DFW and College Station. So this actually fits an important niche for us in Texas. And as we come back to your question on delays. And again, our primary delays are going to be in North Texas. As you may recall, in Q2, at half year, we had indicated that we came into 2016 with about a 3.5 million ton backlog of TxDOT work and only 600,000 tons had shipped against that backlog. What I would tell you is, again, in Q3, there was very limited activity on those projects. But we did start to see some movement later in the quarter. I mean, here's one way to think about your question on more color. North Texas project delays, we got 20 major projects there in the backlog. One dating back, get this Kathryn, to the fall of 2012; 4 finally started in September 2016; and 3 began in October of 2016. 8 of the 20 have not yet begun shipping, and we have an infrastructure backlog now of about 5.4 million tons. The other thing that's important for you to glean is TxDOT has hired several hundred additional people, and we think that's a moment. And we think that's a moment because I think there is a clear understanding within TxDOT that what they're faced with are administrative delays. We think that they are eager to remove those. So I think we will see nice movement on that in 2017. As I said, what we've seen in 2016 in Texas has been an anomaly relative to that DOT. It hasn't necessarily been that much of an anomaly relative to other state DOTs, but it has been relative to Texas. So I tried to help you on Ratliff and give you the additional color in North Texas, in particular. Is that responsive, Kathryn?"

The difference is this, flooding was coming back in rivers, and it was -- so you had rivers backing up in Eastern North Carolina, and you had rain in Western North Carolina finding its way to the East and it simply stayed there, and it stayed there for a very long time. And so studying my commentary, we're going to go into the holiday season and still have people living in shelters in Eastern North Carolina. So my sense is, Kathryn, that from an impact in dollar and cents perspective, going forward, it's likely to be more impactful in Eastern North Carolina than it was in Colorado."

And here's the way that's working, Jerry, I mean our asphalt and paving business in Colorado is a very good business, and they continue to see nice year-over-year improvement in that marketplace. Our ready-mixed concrete business in Colorado is a good, solid, mature ready-mixed concrete business. Here's what's happening: We said that you should expect our ready-mixed concrete business in Texas to continue to get better. And over time, you should see it performing the way that we're seeing our business in Colorado perform. And if you look at that business, that's what's happening. The cost structure is better, we're seeing much better pricing activity in that business. And here's the other piece that's helping there, you're seeing some headwinds in aggregate volume because you've got more brand-new projects in parts of Texas, and you have to be working with wet soils. But when you've got  concrete and some of it gets to be on more industrial or more mature type projects, concrete can actually go. So here's the odd thing, we were seeing internal aggregates to our ready-mixed business, actually, better in the third quarter. We're seeing stone going down on road projects coming down in the third quarter, which tells me the underlying business is good. But what you're seeing in Q3 on the downstream businesses is just the better performance that we were expecting to see."

So keep in mind, Craig, even when prop 1 was at its absolute peak, spanning from 2010 to 2015, those fiscal years for Texas, was trending at about $5.2 billion. If we're looking at it right now, prop 1 and prop 7 should provide about $2.5 billion by 2018, rising to $3.1 billion by 2021. So if we're sitting here right now, we're looking at what we feel like is going to be probably a plus $7 billion program in 2017, very healthy on the out years, going into the year with some of the largest backlogs that we've ever had. So again, as we're looking at TxDOT and looking at a marketplace that 50% of our volume finds its way into infrastructure, we feel very confident both in the near term and the long term there.

I guess, what I would say, Garik, is what we talked about was averages, right?

And clearly, that's what we're seeing, we're seeing it plus that. Here's what's happening. You're getting the incremental margin boost because you're seeing a shift to more in the East. And again, Garik, that's something that we've been very transparent on, and we've spoken about for years because we said we couldn't even hit the 60 all by itself, if we were just counting on a Western recovery all by itself. So if you believe as I do, that we're in early innings in the Southeast and in relatively early innings in the Mid-Atlantic, then I think we're going to be certainly above that target as we said. Now, do I think we're going to show up every quarter with 90%? I'd like to say that I thought we would, but I think that would be a little bit ambitious, so I'm not encouraging you to go and model that. But again, I think, if you just come back, think about that average on 60 and keep in mind, pricing is probably doing better than we thought it was going to do as we went though the cycle. So maybe it lasts a little bit longer than we thought it would when we said that first 40 million tons. So I would tell you, it has the capacity to endure. I think geographic mix is our friend.

And the good news is they at somewhere in Marietta states where we think that can very much happen right now. But here's what's different and I think it's interesting, Stanley, and it's a clear, recurring theme that we're hearing from contractors and that is, they're busy, and they haven't gone and hired a bunch of new people to come to work for them because they're busy. If they've got a heavy financial incentive to go and accelerate a project, they will. If they have a strong financial disincentive to get something done, they'll follow that as well. But I think there are a lot of contractors who are just as busy as they want to be. They're making good money, they don't want to overextend their businesses and if they can have good multi-year backlogs and just continue to work that in '17, '18, '19 and '20, I think they're pretty pleased with that.

And I think additional stimulus, from whoever the next President is, could be very powerful in this business. Do I think it's a '17 event? No. Do I think it could be a mid-'18 event?

So now we're seeing the Eastern United States go through that same transition, frankly, that we saw the Western U.S. doing 18 or 24 months ago. So directly to your point, if we're building a multi-family facility, really, it's going to take stone on the base and concrete, that's going to go on the pads. If we see new subdivision work until those roads and streets are accepted by a local municipality for maintenance, everything that we're selling on the roads, everything that we're selling on the sidewalks, everything that we're selling on the utilities, everything that we're selling on the lot counts as residential. So when we see that type of turn hitting a city like Charlotte right now and Atlanta right now and Charlotte right now. By the way, all still in very early stages of that, it is much more aggregate intensive, and we think it's much more powerful."

As detailed specifically on Slide 2, please remember that today's teleconference may include forward-looking statements as defined by securities laws in connection with future events or future operating or financial performance. Like other businesses, we're subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially. Except as legally required, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether resulting from new information, future developments or otherwise. We refer you to the legal disclaimers contained in our second quarter earnings release and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which are available on both our own and the SEC websites. 
Also, as a reminder, any margin references in our discussion are based on net sales and exclude freight and delivery revenues. These and other non-GAAP measures are explained in our supplemental financial information on our website and in our SEC filings. 
As detailed in our release distributed earlier this morning, Martin Marietta delivered strong top line and bottom line growth in the record-setting second quarter. These results were driven by broad-based gains across the majority of the company's geographic footprint. Importantly, this was enabled by our strategic approach of developing leading positions in markets along higher growth corridors possessing attractive near and long-term economic characteristics.
For the quarter, we delivered record net sales of $915 million, an increase of 8% or a $65 million gain over the second quarter of last year. That increase, combined with an improvement in our gross margin, led to record gross profit and net earnings. In fact, gross profit increased $47 million and net earnings increased $40 million, respectively. These outstanding results underscore the earnings power of our business model as well as the overall health of our markets and demonstrate our ability to capitalize on improving economic conditions.
Consolidated gross profit margin expanded 340 basis points to nearly 27% and diluted earnings per share of $1.90 increased 56%, both compared with the prior year quarter. The efficiencies achieved by our steadfast commitment to operational excellence is also evident and in -- that on a consolidated basis for every $1 in net sales, our operations delivered $0.71 of additional gross profit, above our stated target of 60%.
As will be expanded upon in a moment, we're pleased to note that in addition to increased volume, widespread pricing improvement contributed significantly to the quarter's results. Aggregates product line pricing increased 7%, led by the West Group's 10% growth with notable strength across our Texas and Colorado footprints. The ready-mixed concrete business delivered a 15% increase in pricing, again, with strength in both Texas and Colorado, led by robust pricing along the I-35 corridor, running from north to south through Dallas, Austin and San Antonio, Texas.
Despite the near-term threefold impact of adverse weather conditions, declining railroad balance volumes and lower direct shale energy shipments, our aggregates product line delivered volume growth of 1.3%. During the quarter, poor weather in our top markets nearly rivaled that experienced in the second quarter 2015. We faced extremely wet conditions particularly in the first 2 months of the second quarter in many of our key states, including Texas and the Carolinas as shown in the divisional precipitation mass on Slide 5.
As forecasted by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the El Niño weather pattern, which began in the second quarter of 2015 continued through May 2016. What does that mean? Last year, we reported that enough rain fell in Texas to meet New York City's water needs for 7 years. This May, the National Weather Service reported 35 trillion gallons of rain fell in Texas, enough to cover the entire state in water 8 inches deep. This rainfall led to extreme flooding due to saturated land conditions from an already very wet spring. Saturated soils are significant impediment to new construction activity. 
The Mid-America Group led the company with a nearly 5% increase in aggregates product line shipments driven by acceleration of residential and nonresidential construction activity across the Carolinas. The Southeast Group shipments increased nearly 2%. Large infrastructure projects in Georgia and Florida were catalyst for growth in the Southeast Group, but were partially offset by lower balanced shipments. The West Group, where shipments were affected by heavy rainfall, reported a 3% decline, including the volumes related to the recently completed Colorado acquisitions.
In addition to weather-deferred shipments, the West Group aggregate product line volumes were impacted by decline in shale-related shipments, delays associated with several Texas Department of Transportation projects and lower balanced sales due to reduced capital and maintenance expenditures by railroads, as highlighted in recent press releases from that industry group.  These factors drove the West Group's negative volume comparison to prior year.
Overall, aggregates shipments for the first half of 2016 increased over 6%, in line with our full year expectations. The pace and trajectory of volume increases are particularly visible along the high-growth corridors through the Carolinas, Georgia and into Florida. As anticipated, economic recovery in the Southeastern United States is accelerating. For example, Georgia's net tax revenue collections through this past May compared to last year's comparable period were up nearly 10% or $1.7 billion. Further, product demand in portions of the Carolinas have us considering adding work shifts to better serve customer needs. We expect continued steady construction growth in this important part of our geography to complement expansion in other regions of the country.
The ready-mixed concrete product line is benefiting from strong demand in North Texas and Colorado. Robust volumes, combined with improved cost performance, together with modestly improving operating conditions, drove a 43% increase in net sales and a 560 basis point expansion of gross margin. The expectation remains for our Texas ready-mixed concrete profit margins to continue to improve similar to the pattern experienced in our Colorado-based business. We view the results for the 6 months of the year as confirmation that our expectations are well-placed.
For the second quarter, the Cement business generated nearly $60 million of net sales and $24 million of gross profit, representing a 40% gross margin. Note that as a result of the September 2015 sale of our California Cement business, comparability of results for this segment will be affected throughout the year. The 2015 impact of the California Cement operations is detailed on Slide 6. Lastly, the Magnesia Specialties business delivered another solid quarter, with second quarter net sales of nearly $59 million. Our continued focus on diligently managing the cost profile of the business led to a gross profit margin of 36.8%, an expansion of 170 basis points versus the prior year second quarter.
Varying degrees of construction recovery are visible in all 3 primary end-use markets. Infrastructure shipments accounted for approximately 43% of our aggregates volume and increased 1.3% over the prior year quarter, driven by large projects in the Southeast Group. Notably, the acceleration of projects in the Atlanta market along the I-95 and I-75 corridors in addition to continued I-4 activity in Central Florida enabled positive quarter-over-quarter growth despite the impact of weather delayed shipments in the Mid-America and West Groups.
Importantly, we continue to see increasing demand across this end-use market and remain confident in its study and meaningful growth particularly as we move into 2017 and begin to see and enjoy the benefits of increased federal highway spending under the FAST Act and the multiple state initiatives. Among them, the Texas Department of Transportation plans to spend $70 billion on its highways from 2017 to 2026, especially in the growing Martin Marietta metro areas such as Dallas, San Antonio, Austin and Houston, doubling the prior decade's record investment level. 
The nonresidential end-use market comprised of 2 components: light construction and heavy construction accounted for 33% of aggregate shipments in the quarter and increased 2.8% compared with the prior year quarter. The light component is primarily office and retail construction with demand generally tied to employment growth and residential demand; while the heavy nonresidential component is primarily industrial building as well as energy and energy-related activity.
Growth in the nonresidential end-use market was led by an approximate 14% increase in the Mid-America Group, driven by office and retail development in North Carolina resulting from continued employment gains and solid residential activity. The residential market accounted for 17% of quarterly aggregates product line shipments and reported a nearly 11% increase compared with prior year quarter. Strength in housing activity is evident across the United States as starts and completions are each up considerably for the trailing 12 months ended June 2016. While U.S. housing activity remains well below historic averages, the re-acceleration of growth in our key states, particularly in the Southeastern portion of the country, is expected to drive increased aggregates demand throughout the remainder of the year.  The ChemRock/Rail market accounted for the remaining 7% of aggregates product line volumes, which decreased compared to the prior year quarter as a result of reduced ballast sales.  
In addition to our quarterly results presented in today's earnings release, we also provided 2 updates to portions of our previously provided guidance. First, SG&A guidance of $220 million has been increased to a range of $225 million to $230 million. This modest change is primarily related to the timing and value share-based compensation. Second, the company's guidance on 2016 cement pricing change, current expectations are for full year increase of 2% to 4%. This change lowered our full year outlook for the Cement business' net sales by $10 million and results primarily from the sharp downturn in energy and energy-related activity.  We believe markets have now broadly stabilized and anticipate healthier pricing momentum as the company benefits from its leading positions in high-growth Texas regions. To summarize our consolidated second quarter results by virtually every meaningful and controllable metric, Martin Marietta delivered a very strong quarter, highlighted by record net sales, record gross profit and record net earnings. 
Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization, was over $266 million for the quarter, an increase of $60 million. EBITDA as a percentage of net sales, excluding freight and delivery revenues, expanded 478 basis points to over 29%, approaching our prior peak level of EBITDA margin on 20% fewer tons. During the quarter, we repurchased an additional 215,000 shares of our common stock for $40 million. And together with our dividend, we returned $66 million to our shareholders. 
We have authorization to repurchase up to 20 million shares of our stock. Since the initial share repurchase authorization in February 2015 through the end of the second quarter 2016, we've repurchased 4.5 million shares, which, coupled with our sustained dividend, returned $869 million to shareholders. As a result, 15.5 million shares remain under the current authorization.  Finally, our ratio of consolidated net debt to consolidated EBITDA for the trailing 12 months ended June 2016 was 1.98x in compliance with our leverage covenant and in line with our targeted leverage of 2x.
As we look forward to the balance of the year and beyond, we expect continued steady growth in construction activity in our markets. Both Dodge and PCA forecast growth in construction starts for the balance of 2016 and the next several years. The Dodge Momentum Index, which measures the initial report of nonresidential construction projects and tends to lead nonresidential construction spending by 1 full year, increased over 11% in June to 134.4, its highest level since early 2009. Residential construction permits starts and completions remains strong. Infrastructure activity should continue to accelerate as the FAST Act and other state initiatives drive increased construction of highways, streets, roads and bridges.
Strong employment gains would serve as a key indicator of economic growth underpinned the construction forecast. In fact, of our key states Florida ranks second nationally in job growth; Texas ranks third; Georgia ranks fourth and North Carolina ranks eighth. A host of key metropolitan areas in our markets had employment gains above 3%, including Dallas and Austin, Texas; Atlanta, Georgia; Orlando, Tampa and Jacksonville, Florida; Raleigh, North Carolina and Charleston, South Carolina. 
To conclude, we are very pleased with our second quarter performance, and we're well positioned to deliver solid results in the last half of the year. We will continue to realize the considerable benefits of our superior geographic positions, operating in markets that are economically diverse and high-growth. We remain committed to the diligent execution of our strategic plan, steadfast to our core foundation of pillars of operational excellence, cost discipline, customer satisfaction and sustainability and dedicated to delivering increased shareholder value.

And, really, as we rack it up, it falls into 3 different buckets. Number one, I would say shale volume was down about 750,000 tons versus the prior year. So that's your first bridge number. Your second bridge number, Kathryn, should be on the railroad balance. We saw that down about 250,000 tons compared to the prior year. But still the single largest moving factor there is relative to what we experienced with respect to weather. We're seeing tonnage affected by weather somewhere between 1 million and 1.5 million tons a quarter. So that gives you your bridge. The other part of your question, and I think it's a good one, Kathryn, is what are we looking relative to backlogs and how does that feel. And what I would say, in particular, Texas last year, had the wettest May in history. This year, it had one other wettest May in history. I mentioned that because if we simply look at a portion of the Texas market, let's look at what we've got in North Texas, we've got about 3.6 million tons of backlog in North Texas and only about 600,000 of that shipped during the first half of 2016. So clearly, there is pretty considerable, a, backlog and pretty considerable jam up on that backlog. There's some big jobs that are really waiting to go in a more robust fashion U.S. 380, near Denton is one of them. State Highway 175 outside of Dallas is another, and Interstate 45 and 35 both had considerable work. So from a volume perspective, what did we see deferred? It was the 2 million tons broken down into those buckets that I gave you relative to large projects and what the backlog looks like. We feel very comfortable with our backlog, at this position, we just need to be able to go on a number of those jobs, particularly TxDOT jobs. Kathryn, was that responsive?"

Colorado had a much better quarter. If we look at what's going on in Colorado, in the Rocky Mountain group, what I would tell you is everything within the borders of Colorado was really very healthy. The only place in the Rocky Mountain group that we're seeing any degree of volume struggle is outside of Colorado, where it's more ballast driven. So we do have some ballast quarries in Utah, we have one up in Wyoming as well, so we are seeing some pressure of those back to those same issues that we discussed before. What I will tell you is what we're seeing in Metro Denver, what we're seeing North of Denver, what we're seeing South of Denver, whether its aggregates, ready-mix or hot mix is all a very, very healthy marketplace, particularly downstream paving, we're bidding considerably more work this year than we were last year at the same time. I want to say for the quarter, we had been on nearly 35 more jobs in Metro in North than we've been on last year. So we see Colorado being very busy not just for the balance of this year. We see Colorado being very busy for next year. With respect to the other part of your question on North Carolina, we're seeing a very healthy sharp so that's been a market that has continued to perform well. Importantly, as we go East in Charlotte and get to triad, we're seeing considerably more infrastructure work in Greensboro, High Point and Winston-Salem. That's a part of the state because of textiles, furniture and other manufacturing that suffered more than the rest of the state. We are now seeing both residential and nonresidential recovery in that marketplace. As we come farther east yet and hit Raleigh-Durham and Chapel Hill, infrastructure work here is very healthy. Multifamily residential has been very, very healthy. Residential is starting to move in the direction that we would expect. So again, we're seeing a much healthier North Carolina. But part of this state that's still waiting for more economic juice to hit it are the more coastal areas that are continuing to get better and better quarter after quarter. So I didn't want to make sure I went through those areas pretty clearly with you, Kathryn."

That cannot endure because they have thousands of miles of track that they need to maintain. So that's not a matter of if, it's a matter of when. I think with respect to the second part of your question, I think what's going to happen is aggregate business will likely get better service on the railroads because we have been a very steady customer all the way through. So if you go back to the notion that with a larger shippers stoned, on 4 out of the 5 Class I railroads and our network is at least double the next largest network, our ability, I believe, to move stone from stone producing areas to stone starts parts of the country, particularly in South Texas and along the Gulf and Atlantic Coast will oddly enough most likely be helped by the circumstance."

Keep in mind the numbers that we put out at the beginning of the year were based on the balanced numbers that we had been supplied by Class I railroads. So again, the dialogue is active with them. They've been very clear that it was going to be back half pushed. If we're looking simply to the graded power volume or others down on the different railroads. I mean, the fact is we can look at year-to-date car volumes and say UP is down 10%, CSX is down almost 7%, Norfolk Southern down almost 6%.  So you can clearly see why they would pull back. I think going back to Kathryn's point in her question, it can only be held back so long. And keep in mind, a lot of these places, too, have seen pretty considerable flooding in the first half of the year. So where you've got railroads have been underwater and have seen that type of duress, they will have needs as we head into the back half of the year. Now in fairness, if we're looking at what headwinds and tailwinds could be, and it's probably a good moment to think about that as we do at this question. I would clearly put that in a potential headwind for us as we go into the back half of the year. So I really think about those probably in 2 different tranches, Jerry. I think tailwinds that we have going into the back half of the year is the rate and trajectory of recovery into Carolinas and Southeast and some of that, by the way, could be ballast. I think another tailwind that we have is strong demand in the Midwest and Rocky Mountains. And I think a strong contractor backlog is a tailwind as well. So I think you've got those 3. But I do think that if you are looking at what the headwinds are, I think the ballast shipments could be a headwind. And if we don't see some improvement at the back half of the year, there are probably 600,000-ish tons that could be at risk there. Clearly, we do need good normal weather for the balance of the year, and we do need TxDOT to have more of their work go in a more timely basis. And the other issue, and I don't think the railroads necessarily suffer from this, but I think a lot of other trades do right now, getting truck drivers, tradesmen, welders, other things simple within the supply chain are under varying degrees of duress in different parts of the country. So I do think there's some headwinds, I do think there's some tailwinds and I give you that in the context of I do believe ballast is the potential headwind. So fair enough, Jer."

So it's fascinating to look at where it was happy. I mean, street starts were down 16%. But again, our view was we're going to see an expected recovery in half 2 and really more going into '17. What's fascinating to me, Jerry, is to go back and take a look at some of the key states and look at it over not a several month period but over a 2014 to 2016 time frame relative to the subject. And this is what I find. North Carolina, the change on a percentage '14 to '16, 58%; Nebraska, same time frame, up 41%; Iowa, up 18%; Arkansas, up 11%; South Carolina, up 53%; Florida, up 18%. Now with that same time frame because you did see a pullback, is Texas down, it is. But again, it just seemed that normal give-and-take in that.

Number one, I think we need to really give a tip of the hat to our operating teams. Because operating in the type of environment at which they're operating is really challenging because it stop start. And these businesses don't do stop start very well. Here's what I'll tell you. So look at cost structure, momentum on the labor side has been very good, momentum on energy has been very good, momentum on maintenance and repair has gotten considerably better. I mean one of the things that we did last year, in particular, as we accelerated the purchase of some rolling stock, particularly in the Midwestern United States and in some of my earlier comments, I spoke to the fact that, that's going to be a business that's going to be as busy this year as it can be until snow fly is there. And what we saw with incremental additions to rolling stock in that marketplace is we saw maintenance and repair hit considerably better. So again, our cost structure is doing what I believe our cost structure we're doing, again, our teams have done exceptional work. The other piece of it that I think's worth remembering is in large part we're watching the price fall to the bottom line, and that has really been very powerful. And if you think about what you're seeing relative to the price increases, you've heard us say not for a matter of months, but you've heard us say for a matter of years that it would be most likely that you would see the Western United States on a percentage basis price increase outperform the Eastern United States and particularly in parts of Texas. And that's what we're seeing. I think the other thing to your point, Garik, on what it looks like going forward. Part of what I believe you've heard us refer to in the past is that we believed in time, Colorado would start to see that same type of pricing performance with a lag behind Texas. We're starting to see evidence of that taking shape as well. So to your question on incrementals, cost performance has been really very good. Capital deployment has continued to drive down cost in areas that needed to drive down, prices fall into the bottom line. And importantly, it's doing exactly what we thought. And keep in mind, we thought we would see these better incrementals early on in the cycle. So, so far, no surprises."

Clearly, when we spoke about Texas on the last earnings call, we said we thought Q1 maybe going into Q2. It's going to be a shakeout period we're pricing in Texas. Obviously, you've got imports that have come in, at least the Port of Houston that are modestly different than we've seen over the last several years. At the same time, part of what we're doing, particularly in North Texas is we're serving more of our own cement needs in that marketplace as well. So when we're looking at shipping more cement farther to feed some of our ready-mix operations. And you've also got some of the competitive postures that have been in that marketplace. That in my way of thinking is what has really held the price down in addition to the weather that we saw. So as we look at it, clearly, pricing in North Texas is better than it's been in South Texas. We're seeing increases in both markets, and we feel like we've now seen nice stability in that marketplace. I can tell you, we're seeing bidding in North Texas today at numbers much closer to the 112, 113, 114 type numbers, and that's more in line with what we would have expected."

But we have the utility issue here that we need to do it. So I don't think there's any funding issue at all in Texas right now. And I think, particularly in North Texas, what really needs to happen is they're more -- you hate to say it's administrative, but it's almost the first cousin to administrative issues that TxDOT needs to work its way through. I don't have any doubt that they will. I don't think anyone in Texas has any doubt that they will. As I said, it's not a matter of if, it's a matter of when."

And one of the recurring themes that I hear is that if family-owned businesses are looking to potentially make moves with their businesses, selling into what they feel like it's an up cycle is a pretty sensible thing for them to do. Now you should equally expect us to be thoughtful around value and not put ourselves in a position that we're overpaying. But at the same time, in a marketplace I think where people can look at our space and say, you know what, this looks like it's going to be pretty good for 3 or 4 or maybe 5 years.

So clearly, I was saying that before we had 8 inches of potential rain flooding across the entire state of Texas. So I guess my view is not that far removed from where PCA is, because if we look at what we think to be capacity additions to Texas over the next several years and who knows if all those come forward even with those capacity additions, what you're seeing is about a 3 million ton per annum shortfall of cement. So what Texas has not had genuinely for a 24-month period is normal weather. They have not had a normal Texas summer and our sense is that's going to happen. And when that happens in construction activity on the public side, which is half of our business is as robust as we believe it will. And when places like Dallas continue to be as they are today, the best housing market in the United States, those are the types of formulas that come together to create cement shortages in that type of circumstance."

This sector doesn't stay down, this sector is going to have to have return. Do I think the sector is going back to the type of volume that we were seeing in 2014, which by the way, was almost 7.5 million tons? I don't think it goes there. But I think it could very well go back to numbers that we were seeing at least in '15 or maybe in '16 if we look at full year '15, that was 3.6 million tons. So basically half of what it had been in '14. I'm not sure that, that is somewhere between that 2.5 million and 3.5 million wouldn't be a good steady run rate for energy as it returns.

If it's about 70%, we're going to be fine. Equally if you take a look at where we are relative to what's going on with natural gas pricing, I mean, you've got a 21% cost reduction versus prior year.

So if you think back to it, what we've done in growing that business in Colorado all the way down to Front Range, all the way down I-25 has really given more breadth and depth to that marketplace. So we're looking at ASPs in the Rocky Mountains, for example, that are higher than they are in the Southwest. And that's one reason I say that's a more mature business. But what I would say in the Southwest is, if we're looking at type of growth that I believe we're looking at in North Texas, if we're looking at the type of growth that I think we're looking at in the other markets that are close to that and with some of the large vertically-integrated jobs that we have in South Texas that have multiple years ahead of them. Again, I would say this is a game that's in relatively early innings in Texas right now. If you go back to the comments that I had in my prepared remarks, we anticipate seeing, from a return in other perspective the Texas business looking more and more like the Colorado business. And as we said, we believe the results that we've seen so far this year, in particular, results that we saw in this quarter is good evidence that the team is moving there. We've had a very capable management team that oversees this business. They know exactly what our aims and desires are, and they're doing a very fine job right now of meeting that."

At the same time, if we go back 8, 9 years ago, this was a company that was producing and selling 205 million tons of stone on a pre-TXI basis. So really, if we're looking at greenfielding in markets, they're going to need to be compelling reasons why to do that because there's really not a lot of need right now to add capacity. The greater need is greater efficiencies and to find those attractive markets where we want to have a more compelling presence. So to the extent that we can look to drive the marketplace in which we have a 1 or 2 position. And right now it's 85% of our markets versus 65%, let's call it, 6 years ago, if we can take that 85% number up to 95% or to 90% and keep doing that, that's awfully good and high use for our dollars, so that's how we're going to think about that."

Let's talk about it in a couple of different tranches. I mean, if we look at it in new money terms and that all of this is new, but some of the hit from some of this is going to be relatively new. I mean Iowa put in $0.10 gas tax effective March 1,",580,"Sure. Let's talk about it in a couple of different tranches. I mean, if we look at it in new money terms and that all of this is new, but some of the hit from some of this is going to be relatively new. I mean Iowa put in $0.10 gas tax effective March 1, 2015, that's going to basically give that state about a 30% increase of construction activity, that matters to us. Obviously, with House Bill 157 last year, Georgia basically increased their gas tax. They added almost $1 billion to annual construction budgets. We think both the Georgia and the Iowa pieces probably hit, obviously, more meaningfully in 2017. But we do think the back half of '16 could see some activities from that. Obviously, Texas has just a very healthy letting schedule, and they have over the last several years. That's going to continue to build on itself. I think the notions that we discussed around project delays administratively is something to be mindful of in Texas. Keep in mind that Prop 7 money is coming when we get to September 2017 that should be about $2.5 billion per annum. Nebraska did not to the same degree that Iowa did, but they put in the gas tax increase of $0.015 on January 1, that's going to go up that same amount for the next 3 years so adds up to a $0.06 increase. That's going to about a $75 million total impact in that state. And we've got a very attractive position there. If we look at what's happened in North Carolina last year when the Legislature was in session, they basically added almost $1 billion to highway transportation spending. Now what North Carolina refers to as the biennium. So that's a 2-year process. South Carolina is looking to do more with what they call their Pennies for Progress Program, which we'd be delighted to see them do. Again, the work that we're seeing in South Carolina, right now in Charleston is very robust work. What we're seeing in Columbia is very good work and equally, Mike Pence is governor of Indiana, wanted to see if he keeps his job as governor of Indiana because Bernie is running for another one. And he's looking to invest an additional $1 billion in state roads, highways, bridges over a 4-year period there. So again, we've got a number of core states that matter a lot to us that do have a series of good initiatives coming behind them. TIGER grants program, you know what, I don't know, we'll just have to see where that goes. I'll tell you I'm still one of those people who feels like the TIFIA program in, where it's going to be impactful can and will be going into the future. And remember what we've seen in TIFIA since 2012 is a $49 billion investment. So in markets that we care deeply about right now, we've seen 2 new applications in calendar 2015 and '16 and clearly, in a couple of projects in Colorado, with $1.7 billion on I-70 and 470, the loop. And then about $1.4 billion DFW project, the Midtown Express. And then we're still waiting for the Monroe bypass in Charlotte to go, and that's about an $839 million job. So I think we'll have to see what happens with Tiger brands, but I think between the FAST Act, state initiatives and what we've seen in TIFIA, it's pretty good future."

With me today is Anne Lloyd, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. 
To facilitate today's discussion, we've made available during this webcast and on our website supplemental financial information which we believe will be helpful. As detailed specifically on Slide 2, please remember that today's teleconference may include forward-looking statements as defined by securities laws in connection with future events or future operating or financial performance. Like other businesses, we're subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially. Except as legally required, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether resulting from new information, future developments or otherwise. We refer you to the legal disclaimers contained in our second quarter earnings release and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which are available on both our own and the SEC websites. 
Also, as a reminder, any margin references in our discussion are based on net sales and exclude freight and delivery revenues. These and other non-GAAP measures are explained in our supplemental financial information on our website and in our SEC filings. 
As detailed in our release distributed earlier this morning, Martin Marietta delivered strong top line and bottom line growth in the record-setting second quarter. These results were driven by broad-based gains across the majority of the company's geographic footprint. Importantly, this was enabled by our strategic approach of developing leading positions in markets along higher growth corridors possessing attractive near and long-term economic characteristics.
For the quarter, we delivered record net sales of $915 million, an increase of 8% or a $65 million gain over the second quarter of last year. That increase, combined with an improvement in our gross margin, led to record gross profit and net earnings. In fact, gross profit increased $47 million and net earnings increased $40 million, respectively. These outstanding results underscore the earnings power of our business model as well as the overall health of our markets and demonstrate our ability to capitalize on improving economic conditions.
Consolidated gross profit margin expanded 340 basis points to nearly 27% and diluted earnings per share of $1.90 increased 56%, both compared with the prior year quarter. The efficiencies achieved by our steadfast commitment to operational excellence is also evident and in -- that on a consolidated basis for every $1 in net sales, our operations delivered $0.71 of additional gross profit, above our stated target of 60%.
As will be expanded upon in a moment, we're pleased to note that in addition to increased volume, widespread pricing improvement contributed significantly to the quarter's results. Aggregates product line pricing increased 7%, led by the West Group's 10% growth with notable strength across our Texas and Colorado footprints. The ready-mixed concrete business delivered a 15% increase in pricing, again, with strength in both Texas and Colorado, led by robust pricing along the I-35 corridor, running from north to south through Dallas, Austin and San Antonio, Texas.
Despite the near-term threefold impact of adverse weather conditions, declining railroad balance volumes and lower direct shale energy shipments, our aggregates product line delivered volume growth of 1.3%. During the quarter, poor weather in our top markets nearly rivaled that experienced in the second quarter 2015. We faced extremely wet conditions particularly in the first 2 months of the second quarter in many of our key states, including Texas and the Carolinas as shown in the divisional precipitation mass on Slide 5.
As forecasted by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the El Niño weather pattern, which began in the second quarter of 2015 continued through May 2016. What does that mean? Last year, we reported that enough rain fell in Texas to meet New York City's water needs for 7 years. This May, the National Weather Service reported 35 trillion gallons of rain fell in Texas, enough to cover the entire state in water 8 inches deep. This rainfall led to extreme flooding due to saturated land conditions from an already very wet spring. Saturated soils are significant impediment to new construction activity. 
The Mid-America Group led the company with a nearly 5% increase in aggregates product line shipments driven by acceleration of residential and nonresidential construction activity across the Carolinas. The Southeast Group shipments increased nearly 2%. Large infrastructure projects in Georgia and Florida were catalyst for growth in the Southeast Group, but were partially offset by lower balanced shipments. The West Group, where shipments were affected by heavy rainfall, reported a 3% decline, including the volumes related to the recently completed Colorado acquisitions.
In addition to weather-deferred shipments, the West Group aggregate product line volumes were impacted by decline in shale-related shipments, delays associated with several Texas Department of Transportation projects and lower balanced sales due to reduced capital and maintenance expenditures by railroads, as highlighted in recent press releases from that industry group.  These factors drove the West Group's negative volume comparison to prior year.
Overall, aggregates shipments for the first half of 2016 increased over 6%, in line with our full year expectations. The pace and trajectory of volume increases are particularly visible along the high-growth corridors through the Carolinas, Georgia and into Florida. As anticipated, economic recovery in the Southeastern United States is accelerating. For example, Georgia's net tax revenue collections through this past May compared to last year's comparable period were up nearly 10% or $1.7 billion. Further, product demand in portions of the Carolinas have us considering adding work shifts to better serve customer needs. We expect continued steady construction growth in this important part of our geography to complement expansion in other regions of the country.
The ready-mixed concrete product line is benefiting from strong demand in North Texas and Colorado. Robust volumes, combined with improved cost performance, together with modestly improving operating conditions, drove a 43% increase in net sales and a 560 basis point expansion of gross margin. The expectation remains for our Texas ready-mixed concrete profit margins to continue to improve similar to the pattern experienced in our Colorado-based business. We view the results for the 6 months of the year as confirmation that our expectations are well-placed.
For the second quarter, the Cement business generated nearly $60 million of net sales and $24 million of gross profit, representing a 40% gross margin. Note that as a result of the September 2015 sale of our California Cement business, comparability of results for this segment will be affected throughout the year. The 2015 impact of the California Cement operations is detailed on Slide 6. Lastly, the Magnesia Specialties business delivered another solid quarter, with second quarter net sales of nearly $59 million. Our continued focus on diligently managing the cost profile of the business led to a gross profit margin of 36.8%, an expansion of 170 basis points versus the prior year second quarter.
Varying degrees of construction recovery are visible in all 3 primary end-use markets. Infrastructure shipments accounted for approximately 43% of our aggregates volume and increased 1.3% over the prior year quarter, driven by large projects in the Southeast Group. Notably, the acceleration of projects in the Atlanta market along the I-95 and I-75 corridors in addition to continued I-4 activity in Central Florida enabled positive quarter-over-quarter growth despite the impact of weather delayed shipments in the Mid-America and West Groups.
Importantly, we continue to see increasing demand across this end-use market and remain confident in its study and meaningful growth particularly as we move into 2017 and begin to see and enjoy the benefits of increased federal highway spending under the FAST Act and the multiple state initiatives. Among them, the Texas Department of Transportation plans to spend $70 billion on its highways from 2017 to 2026, especially in the growing Martin Marietta metro areas such as Dallas, San Antonio, Austin and Houston, doubling the prior decade's record investment level. 
The nonresidential end-use market comprised of 2 components: light construction and heavy construction accounted for 33% of aggregate shipments in the quarter and increased 2.8% compared with the prior year quarter. The light component is primarily office and retail construction with demand generally tied to employment growth and residential demand; while the heavy nonresidential component is primarily industrial building as well as energy and energy-related activity.
Growth in the nonresidential end-use market was led by an approximate 14% increase in the Mid-America Group, driven by office and retail development in North Carolina resulting from continued employment gains and solid residential activity. The residential market accounted for 17% of quarterly aggregates product line shipments and reported a nearly 11% increase compared with prior year quarter. Strength in housing activity is evident across the United States as starts and completions are each up considerably for the trailing 12 months ended June 2016. While U.S. housing activity remains well below historic averages, the re-acceleration of growth in our key states, particularly in the Southeastern portion of the country, is expected to drive increased aggregates demand throughout the remainder of the year.  The ChemRock/Rail market accounted for the remaining 7% of aggregates product line volumes, which decreased compared to the prior year quarter as a result of reduced ballast sales.  
In addition to our quarterly results presented in today's earnings release, we also provided 2 updates to portions of our previously provided guidance. First, SG&A guidance of $220 million has been increased to a range of $225 million to $230 million. This modest change is primarily related to the timing and value share-based compensation. Second, the company's guidance on 2016 cement pricing change, current expectations are for full year increase of 2% to 4%. This change lowered our full year outlook for the Cement business' net sales by $10 million and results primarily from the sharp downturn in energy and energy-related activity.  We believe markets have now broadly stabilized and anticipate healthier pricing momentum as the company benefits from its leading positions in high-growth Texas regions. To summarize our consolidated second quarter results by virtually every meaningful and controllable metric, Martin Marietta delivered a very strong quarter, highlighted by record net sales, record gross profit and record net earnings. 
Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization, was over $266 million for the quarter, an increase of $60 million. EBITDA as a percentage of net sales, excluding freight and delivery revenues, expanded 478 basis points to over 29%, approaching our prior peak level of EBITDA margin on 20% fewer tons. During the quarter, we repurchased an additional 215,000 shares of our common stock for $40 million. And together with our dividend, we returned $66 million to our shareholders. 
We have authorization to repurchase up to 20 million shares of our stock. Since the initial share repurchase authorization in February 2015 through the end of the second quarter 2016, we've repurchased 4.5 million shares, which, coupled with our sustained dividend, returned $869 million to shareholders. As a result, 15.5 million shares remain under the current authorization.  Finally, our ratio of consolidated net debt to consolidated EBITDA for the trailing 12 months ended June 2016 was 1.98x in compliance with our leverage covenant and in line with our targeted leverage of 2x.
As we look forward to the balance of the year and beyond, we expect continued steady growth in construction activity in our markets. Both Dodge and PCA forecast growth in construction starts for the balance of 2016 and the next several years. The Dodge Momentum Index, which measures the initial report of nonresidential construction projects and tends to lead nonresidential construction spending by 1 full year, increased over 11% in June to 134.4, its highest level since early 2009. Residential construction permits starts and completions remains strong. Infrastructure activity should continue to accelerate as the FAST Act and other state initiatives drive increased construction of highways, streets, roads and bridges.
Strong employment gains would serve as a key indicator of economic growth underpinned the construction forecast. In fact, of our key states Florida ranks second nationally in job growth; Texas ranks third; Georgia ranks fourth and North Carolina ranks eighth. A host of key metropolitan areas in our markets had employment gains above 3%, including Dallas and Austin, Texas; Atlanta, Georgia; Orlando, Tampa and Jacksonville, Florida; Raleigh, North Carolina and Charleston, South Carolina. 
To conclude, we are very pleased with our second quarter performance, and we're well positioned to deliver solid results in the last half of the year. We will continue to realize the considerable benefits of our superior geographic positions, operating in markets that are economically diverse and high-growth. We remain committed to the diligent execution of our strategic plan, steadfast to our core foundation of pillars of operational excellence, cost discipline, customer satisfaction and sustainability and dedicated to delivering increased shareholder value.

And, really, as we rack it up, it falls into 3 different buckets. Number one, I would say shale volume was down about 750,000 tons versus the prior year. So that's your first bridge number. Your second bridge number, Kathryn, should be on the railroad balance. We saw that down about 250,000 tons compared to the prior year. But still the single largest moving factor there is relative to what we experienced with respect to weather. We're seeing tonnage affected by weather somewhere between 1 million and 1.5 million tons a quarter. So that gives you your bridge. The other part of your question, and I think it's a good one, Kathryn, is what are we looking relative to backlogs and how does that feel. And what I would say, in particular, Texas last year, had the wettest May in history. This year, it had one other wettest May in history. I mentioned that because if we simply look at a portion of the Texas market, let's look at what we've got in North Texas, we've got about 3.6 million tons of backlog in North Texas and only about 600,000 of that shipped during the first half of 2016. So clearly, there is pretty considerable, a, backlog and pretty considerable jam up on that backlog. There's some big jobs that are really waiting to go in a more robust fashion U.S. 380, near Denton is one of them. State Highway 175 outside of Dallas is another, and Interstate 45 and 35 both had considerable work. So from a volume perspective, what did we see deferred? It was the 2 million tons broken down into those buckets that I gave you relative to large projects and what the backlog looks like. We feel very comfortable with our backlog, at this position, we just need to be able to go on a number of those jobs, particularly TxDOT jobs. Kathryn, was that responsive?"

Colorado had a much better quarter. If we look at what's going on in Colorado, in the Rocky Mountain group, what I would tell you is everything within the borders of Colorado was really very healthy. The only place in the Rocky Mountain group that we're seeing any degree of volume struggle is outside of Colorado, where it's more ballast driven. So we do have some ballast quarries in Utah, we have one up in Wyoming as well, so we are seeing some pressure of those back to those same issues that we discussed before. What I will tell you is what we're seeing in Metro Denver, what we're seeing North of Denver, what we're seeing South of Denver, whether its aggregates, ready-mix or hot mix is all a very, very healthy marketplace, particularly downstream paving, we're bidding considerably more work this year than we were last year at the same time. I want to say for the quarter, we had been on nearly 35 more jobs in Metro in North than we've been on last year. So we see Colorado being very busy not just for the balance of this year. We see Colorado being very busy for next year. With respect to the other part of your question on North Carolina, we're seeing a very healthy sharp so that's been a market that has continued to perform well. Importantly, as we go East in Charlotte and get to triad, we're seeing considerably more infrastructure work in Greensboro, High Point and Winston-Salem. That's a part of the state because of textiles, furniture and other manufacturing that suffered more than the rest of the state. We are now seeing both residential and nonresidential recovery in that marketplace. As we come farther east yet and hit Raleigh-Durham and Chapel Hill, infrastructure work here is very healthy. Multifamily residential has been very, very healthy. Residential is starting to move in the direction that we would expect. So again, we're seeing a much healthier North Carolina. But part of this state that's still waiting for more economic juice to hit it are the more coastal areas that are continuing to get better and better quarter after quarter. So I didn't want to make sure I went through those areas pretty clearly with you, Kathryn."

Maintenance is something that in the early and since in the downturn, it's always going to see the stick pull back. And I think that's exactly we're doing I think it's fairly predictable once they saw their volumes declining. That cannot endure because they have thousands of miles of track that they need to maintain. So that's not a matter of if, it's a matter of when. I think with respect to the second part of your question, I think what's going to happen is aggregate business will likely get better service on the railroads because we have been a very steady customer all the way through. So if you go back to the notion that with a larger shippers stoned, on 4 out of the 5 Class I railroads and our network is at least double the next largest network, our ability, I believe, to move stone from stone producing areas to stone starts parts of the country, particularly in South Texas and along the Gulf and Atlantic Coast will oddly enough most likely be helped by the circumstance."

Keep in mind the numbers that we put out at the beginning of the year were based on the balanced numbers that we had been supplied by Class I railroads. So again, the dialogue is active with them. They've been very clear that it was going to be back half pushed. If we're looking simply to the graded power volume or others down on the different railroads. I mean, the fact is we can look at year-to-date car volumes and say UP is down 10%, CSX is down almost 7%, Norfolk Southern down almost 6%.  So you can clearly see why they would pull back. I think going back to Kathryn's point in her question, it can only be held back so long. And keep in mind, a lot of these places, too, have seen pretty considerable flooding in the first half of the year. So where you've got railroads have been underwater and have seen that type of duress, they will have needs as we head into the back half of the year. Now in fairness, if we're looking at what headwinds and tailwinds could be, and it's probably a good moment to think about that as we do at this question. I would clearly put that in a potential headwind for us as we go into the back half of the year. So I really think about those probably in 2 different tranches, Jerry. I think tailwinds that we have going into the back half of the year is the rate and trajectory of recovery into Carolinas and Southeast and some of that, by the way, could be ballast. I think another tailwind that we have is strong demand in the Midwest and Rocky Mountains. And I think a strong contractor backlog is a tailwind as well. So I think you've got those 3. But I do think that if you are looking at what the headwinds are, I think the ballast shipments could be a headwind. And if we don't see some improvement at the back half of the year, there are probably 600,000-ish tons that could be at risk there. Clearly, we do need good normal weather for the balance of the year, and we do need TxDOT to have more of their work go in a more timely basis. And the other issue, and I don't think the railroads necessarily suffer from this, but I think a lot of other trades do right now, getting truck drivers, tradesmen, welders, other things simple within the supply chain are under varying degrees of duress in different parts of the country. So I do think there's some headwinds, I do think there's some tailwinds and I give you that in the context of I do believe ballast is the potential headwind. So fair enough, Jer."

So it's fascinating to look at where it was happy. I mean, street starts were down 16%. But again, our view was we're going to see an expected recovery in half 2 and really more going into '17. What's fascinating to me, Jerry, is to go back and take a look at some of the key states and look at it over not a several month period but over a 2014 to 2016 time frame relative to the subject. And this is what I find. North Carolina, the change on a percentage '14 to '16, 58%; Nebraska, same time frame, up 41%; Iowa, up 18%; Arkansas, up 11%; South Carolina, up 53%; Florida, up 18%. Now with that same time frame because you did see a pullback, is Texas down, it is. But again, it just seemed that normal give-and-take in that.

Number one, I think we need to really give a tip of the hat to our operating teams. Because operating in the type of environment at which they're operating is really challenging because it stop start. And these businesses don't do stop start very well. Here's what I'll tell you. So look at cost structure, momentum on the labor side has been very good, momentum on energy has been very good, momentum on maintenance and repair has gotten considerably better. I mean one of the things that we did last year, in particular, as we accelerated the purchase of some rolling stock, particularly in the Midwestern United States and in some of my earlier comments, I spoke to the fact that, that's going to be a business that's going to be as busy this year as it can be until snow fly is there. And what we saw with incremental additions to rolling stock in that marketplace is we saw maintenance and repair hit considerably better. So again, our cost structure is doing what I believe our cost structure we're doing, again, our teams have done exceptional work. The other piece of it that I think's worth remembering is in large part we're watching the price fall to the bottom line, and that has really been very powerful. And if you think about what you're seeing relative to the price increases, you've heard us say not for a matter of months, but you've heard us say for a matter of years that it would be most likely that you would see the Western United States on a percentage basis price increase outperform the Eastern United States and particularly in parts of Texas. And that's what we're seeing. I think the other thing to your point, Garik, on what it looks like going forward. Part of what I believe you've heard us refer to in the past is that we believed in time, Colorado would start to see that same type of pricing performance with a lag behind Texas. We're starting to see evidence of that taking shape as well. So to your question on incrementals, cost performance has been really very good. Capital deployment has continued to drive down cost in areas that needed to drive down, prices fall into the bottom line. And importantly, it's doing exactly what we thought. And keep in mind, we thought we would see these better incrementals early on in the cycle. So, so far, no surprises."

Clearly, when we spoke about Texas on the last earnings call, we said we thought Q1 maybe going into Q2. It's going to be a shakeout period we're pricing in Texas. Obviously, you've got imports that have come in, at least the Port of Houston that are modestly different than we've seen over the last several years. At the same time, part of what we're doing, particularly in North Texas is we're serving more of our own cement needs in that marketplace as well. So when we're looking at shipping more cement farther to feed some of our ready-mix operations. And you've also got some of the competitive postures that have been in that marketplace. That in my way of thinking is what has really held the price down in addition to the weather that we saw. So as we look at it, clearly, pricing in North Texas is better than it's been in South Texas. We're seeing increases in both markets, and we feel like we've now seen nice stability in that marketplace. I can tell you, we're seeing bidding in North Texas today at numbers much closer to the 112, 113, 114 type numbers, and that's more in line with what we would have expected."

We're looking at ASPs in that overall market in the Southwest up almost 17%. So if we're looking at that type of performance in Texas, it's much better. What I'll tell you is we looked across 5 different districts of ready-mix in that marketplace. There's only one that has ASPs less than $100 a cubic yard. That's getting them into a much more acceptable type of level. So yes, it's getting better in Texas. While weather was really wet, and was not necessarily ready-mix's friend.

So clearly, I was saying that before we had 8 inches of potential rain flooding across the entire state of Texas. So I guess my view is not that far removed from where PCA is, because if we look at what we think to be capacity additions to Texas over the next several years and who knows if all those come forward even with those capacity additions, what you're seeing is about a 3 million ton per annum shortfall of cement. So what Texas has not had genuinely for a 24-month period is normal weather. They have not had a normal Texas summer and our sense is that's going to happen.

To give you a compare, last year in the second quarter, I looked at over 1 million tons, and -- but that wasn't going great guns last year. This sector doesn't stay down, this sector is going to have to have return. Do I think the sector is going back to the type of volume that we were seeing in 2014, which by the way, was almost 7.5 million tons? I don't think it goes there. But I think it could very well go back to numbers that we were seeing at least in '15 or maybe in '16 if we look at full year '15, that was 3.6 million tons. So basically half of what it had been in '14. I'm not sure that, that is somewhere between that 2.5 million and 3.5 million wouldn't be a good steady run rate for energy as it returns.

So if you think back to it, what we've done in growing that business in Colorado all the way down to Front Range, all the way down I-25 has really given more breadth and depth to that marketplace. So we're looking at ASPs in the Rocky Mountains, for example, that are higher than they are in the Southwest. And that's one reason I say that's a more mature business. But what I would say in the Southwest is, if we're looking at type of growth that I believe we're looking at in North Texas, if we're looking at the type of growth that I think we're looking at in the other markets that are close to that and with some of the large vertically-integrated jobs that we have in South Texas that have multiple years ahead of them. Again, I would say this is a game that's in relatively early innings in Texas right now. If you go back to the comments that I had in my prepared remarks, we anticipate seeing, from a return in other perspective the Texas business looking more and more like the Colorado business. And as we said, we believe the results that we've seen so far this year, in particular, results that we saw in this quarter is good evidence that the team is moving there. We've had a very capable management team that oversees this business. They know exactly what our aims and desires are, and they're doing a very fine job right now of meeting that."

So really, if we're looking at greenfielding in markets, they're going to need to be compelling reasons why to do that because there's really not a lot of need right now to add capacity. The greater need is greater efficiencies and to find those attractive markets where we want to have a more compelling presence. So to the extent that we can look to drive the marketplace in which we have a 1 or 2 position.

We think both the Georgia and the Iowa pieces probably hit, obviously, more meaningfully in 2017. But we do think the back half of '16 could see some activities from that. Obviously, Texas has just a very healthy letting schedule, and they have over the last several years. That's going to continue to build on itself. I think the notions that we discussed around project delays administratively is something to be mindful of in Texas. Keep in mind that Prop 7 money is coming when we get to September 2017 that should be about $2.5 billion per annum. Nebraska did not to the same degree that Iowa did, but they put in the gas tax increase of $0.015 on January 1, that's going to go up that same amount for the next 3 years so adds up to a $0.06 increase. That's going to about a $75 million total impact in that state. And we've got a very attractive position there. If we look at what's happened in North Carolina last year when the Legislature was in session, they basically added almost $1 billion to highway transportation spending. Now what North Carolina refers to as the biennium. So that's a 2-year process. South Carolina is looking to do more with what they call their Pennies for Progress Program, which we'd be delighted to see them do. Again, the work that we're seeing in South Carolina, right now in Charleston is very robust work. What we're seeing in Columbia is very good work and equally, Mike Pence is governor of Indiana, wanted to see if he keeps his job as governor of Indiana because Bernie is running for another one. And he's looking to invest an additional $1 billion in state roads, highways, bridges over a 4-year period there. So again, we've got a number of core states that matter a lot to us that do have a series of good initiatives coming behind them. TIGER grants program, you know what, I don't know, we'll just have to see where that goes. I'll tell you I'm still one of those people who feels like the TIFIA program in, where it's going to be impactful can and will be going into the future. And remember what we've seen in TIFIA since 2012 is a $49 billion investment. So in markets that we care deeply about right now, we've seen 2 new applications in calendar 2015 and '16 and clearly, in a couple of projects in Colorado, with $1.7 billion on I-70 and 470, the loop. And then about $1.4 billion DFW project, the Midtown Express. And then we're still waiting for the Monroe bypass in Charlotte to go, and that's about an $839 million job. So I think we'll have to see what happens with Tiger brands, but I think between the FAST Act, state initiatives and what we've seen in TIFIA, it's pretty good future."

With me today is Anne Lloyd, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. 
To facilitate today's discussion, we've made available during this webcast and on our website supplemental financial information which we believe will be helpful. As detailed specifically on Slide 2, please remember that today's teleconference may include forward-looking statements as defined by securities laws in connection with future events or future operating or financial performance. Like other businesses, we're subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially. Except as legally required, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether resulting from new information, future developments or otherwise. We refer you to the legal disclaimers contained in our second quarter earnings release and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which are available on both our own and the SEC websites. 
Also, as a reminder, any margin references in our discussion are based on net sales and exclude freight and delivery revenues. These and other non-GAAP measures are explained in our supplemental financial information on our website and in our SEC filings. 
As detailed in our release distributed earlier this morning, Martin Marietta delivered strong top line and bottom line growth in the record-setting second quarter. These results were driven by broad-based gains across the majority of the company's geographic footprint. Importantly, this was enabled by our strategic approach of developing leading positions in markets along higher growth corridors possessing attractive near and long-term economic characteristics.
For the quarter, we delivered record net sales of $915 million, an increase of 8% or a $65 million gain over the second quarter of last year. That increase, combined with an improvement in our gross margin, led to record gross profit and net earnings. In fact, gross profit increased $47 million and net earnings increased $40 million, respectively. These outstanding results underscore the earnings power of our business model as well as the overall health of our markets and demonstrate our ability to capitalize on improving economic conditions.
Consolidated gross profit margin expanded 340 basis points to nearly 27% and diluted earnings per share of $1.90 increased 56%, both compared with the prior year quarter. The efficiencies achieved by our steadfast commitment to operational excellence is also evident and in -- that on a consolidated basis for every $1 in net sales, our operations delivered $0.71 of additional gross profit, above our stated target of 60%.
As will be expanded upon in a moment, we're pleased to note that in addition to increased volume, widespread pricing improvement contributed significantly to the quarter's results. Aggregates product line pricing increased 7%, led by the West Group's 10% growth with notable strength across our Texas and Colorado footprints. The ready-mixed concrete business delivered a 15% increase in pricing, again, with strength in both Texas and Colorado, led by robust pricing along the I-35 corridor, running from north to south through Dallas, Austin and San Antonio, Texas.
Despite the near-term threefold impact of adverse weather conditions, declining railroad balance volumes and lower direct shale energy shipments, our aggregates product line delivered volume growth of 1.3%. During the quarter, poor weather in our top markets nearly rivaled that experienced in the second quarter 2015. We faced extremely wet conditions particularly in the first 2 months of the second quarter in many of our key states, including Texas and the Carolinas as shown in the divisional precipitation mass on Slide 5.
As forecasted by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the El Niño weather pattern, which began in the second quarter of 2015 continued through May 2016. What does that mean? Last year, we reported that enough rain fell in Texas to meet New York City's water needs for 7 years. This May, the National Weather Service reported 35 trillion gallons of rain fell in Texas, enough to cover the entire state in water 8 inches deep. This rainfall led to extreme flooding due to saturated land conditions from an already very wet spring. Saturated soils are significant impediment to new construction activity. 
The Mid-America Group led the company with a nearly 5% increase in aggregates product line shipments driven by acceleration of residential and nonresidential construction activity across the Carolinas. The Southeast Group shipments increased nearly 2%. Large infrastructure projects in Georgia and Florida were catalyst for growth in the Southeast Group, but were partially offset by lower balanced shipments. The West Group, where shipments were affected by heavy rainfall, reported a 3% decline, including the volumes related to the recently completed Colorado acquisitions.
In addition to weather-deferred shipments, the West Group aggregate product line volumes were impacted by decline in shale-related shipments, delays associated with several Texas Department of Transportation projects and lower balanced sales due to reduced capital and maintenance expenditures by railroads, as highlighted in recent press releases from that industry group.  These factors drove the West Group's negative volume comparison to prior year.
Overall, aggregates shipments for the first half of 2016 increased over 6%, in line with our full year expectations. The pace and trajectory of volume increases are particularly visible along the high-growth corridors through the Carolinas, Georgia and into Florida. As anticipated, economic recovery in the Southeastern United States is accelerating. For example, Georgia's net tax revenue collections through this past May compared to last year's comparable period were up nearly 10% or $1.7 billion. Further, product demand in portions of the Carolinas have us considering adding work shifts to better serve customer needs. We expect continued steady construction growth in this important part of our geography to complement expansion in other regions of the country.
The ready-mixed concrete product line is benefiting from strong demand in North Texas and Colorado. Robust volumes, combined with improved cost performance, together with modestly improving operating conditions, drove a 43% increase in net sales and a 560 basis point expansion of gross margin. The expectation remains for our Texas ready-mixed concrete profit margins to continue to improve similar to the pattern experienced in our Colorado-based business. We view the results for the 6 months of the year as confirmation that our expectations are well-placed.
For the second quarter, the Cement business generated nearly $60 million of net sales and $24 million of gross profit, representing a 40% gross margin. Note that as a result of the September 2015 sale of our California Cement business, comparability of results for this segment will be affected throughout the year. The 2015 impact of the California Cement operations is detailed on Slide 6. Lastly, the Magnesia Specialties business delivered another solid quarter, with second quarter net sales of nearly $59 million. Our continued focus on diligently managing the cost profile of the business led to a gross profit margin of 36.8%, an expansion of 170 basis points versus the prior year second quarter.
Varying degrees of construction recovery are visible in all 3 primary end-use markets. Infrastructure shipments accounted for approximately 43% of our aggregates volume and increased 1.3% over the prior year quarter, driven by large projects in the Southeast Group. Notably, the acceleration of projects in the Atlanta market along the I-95 and I-75 corridors in addition to continued I-4 activity in Central Florida enabled positive quarter-over-quarter growth despite the impact of weather delayed shipments in the Mid-America and West Groups.
Importantly, we continue to see increasing demand across this end-use market and remain confident in its study and meaningful growth particularly as we move into 2017 and begin to see and enjoy the benefits of increased federal highway spending under the FAST Act and the multiple state initiatives. Among them, the Texas Department of Transportation plans to spend $70 billion on its highways from 2017 to 2026, especially in the growing Martin Marietta metro areas such as Dallas, San Antonio, Austin and Houston, doubling the prior decade's record investment level. 
The nonresidential end-use market comprised of 2 components: light construction and heavy construction accounted for 33% of aggregate shipments in the quarter and increased 2.8% compared with the prior year quarter. The light component is primarily office and retail construction with demand generally tied to employment growth and residential demand; while the heavy nonresidential component is primarily industrial building as well as energy and energy-related activity.
Growth in the nonresidential end-use market was led by an approximate 14% increase in the Mid-America Group, driven by office and retail development in North Carolina resulting from continued employment gains and solid residential activity. The residential market accounted for 17% of quarterly aggregates product line shipments and reported a nearly 11% increase compared with prior year quarter. Strength in housing activity is evident across the United States as starts and completions are each up considerably for the trailing 12 months ended June 2016. While U.S. housing activity remains well below historic averages, the re-acceleration of growth in our key states, particularly in the Southeastern portion of the country, is expected to drive increased aggregates demand throughout the remainder of the year.  The ChemRock/Rail market accounted for the remaining 7% of aggregates product line volumes, which decreased compared to the prior year quarter as a result of reduced ballast sales.  
In addition to our quarterly results presented in today's earnings release, we also provided 2 updates to portions of our previously provided guidance. First, SG&A guidance of $220 million has been increased to a range of $225 million to $230 million. This modest change is primarily related to the timing and value share-based compensation. Second, the company's guidance on 2016 cement pricing change, current expectations are for full year increase of 2% to 4%. This change lowered our full year outlook for the Cement business' net sales by $10 million and results primarily from the sharp downturn in energy and energy-related activity.  We believe markets have now broadly stabilized and anticipate healthier pricing momentum as the company benefits from its leading positions in high-growth Texas regions. To summarize our consolidated second quarter results by virtually every meaningful and controllable metric, Martin Marietta delivered a very strong quarter, highlighted by record net sales, record gross profit and record net earnings. 
Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization, was over $266 million for the quarter, an increase of $60 million. EBITDA as a percentage of net sales, excluding freight and delivery revenues, expanded 478 basis points to over 29%, approaching our prior peak level of EBITDA margin on 20% fewer tons. During the quarter, we repurchased an additional 215,000 shares of our common stock for $40 million. And together with our dividend, we returned $66 million to our shareholders. 
We have authorization to repurchase up to 20 million shares of our stock. Since the initial share repurchase authorization in February 2015 through the end of the second quarter 2016, we've repurchased 4.5 million shares, which, coupled with our sustained dividend, returned $869 million to shareholders. As a result, 15.5 million shares remain under the current authorization.  Finally, our ratio of consolidated net debt to consolidated EBITDA for the trailing 12 months ended June 2016 was 1.98x in compliance with our leverage covenant and in line with our targeted leverage of 2x.
As we look forward to the balance of the year and beyond, we expect continued steady growth in construction activity in our markets. Both Dodge and PCA forecast growth in construction starts for the balance of 2016 and the next several years. The Dodge Momentum Index, which measures the initial report of nonresidential construction projects and tends to lead nonresidential construction spending by 1 full year, increased over 11% in June to 134.4, its highest level since early 2009. Residential construction permits starts and completions remains strong. Infrastructure activity should continue to accelerate as the FAST Act and other state initiatives drive increased construction of highways, streets, roads and bridges.
Strong employment gains would serve as a key indicator of economic growth underpinned the construction forecast. In fact, of our key states Florida ranks second nationally in job growth; Texas ranks third; Georgia ranks fourth and North Carolina ranks eighth. A host of key metropolitan areas in our markets had employment gains above 3%, including Dallas and Austin, Texas; Atlanta, Georgia; Orlando, Tampa and Jacksonville, Florida; Raleigh, North Carolina and Charleston, South Carolina. 
To conclude, we are very pleased with our second quarter performance, and we're well positioned to deliver solid results in the last half of the year. We will continue to realize the considerable benefits of our superior geographic positions, operating in markets that are economically diverse and high-growth. We remain committed to the diligent execution of our strategic plan, steadfast to our core foundation of pillars of operational excellence, cost discipline, customer satisfaction and sustainability and dedicated to delivering increased shareholder value.

And, really, as we rack it up, it falls into 3 different buckets. Number one, I would say shale volume was down about 750,000 tons versus the prior year. So that's your first bridge number. Your second bridge number, Kathryn, should be on the railroad balance. We saw that down about 250,000 tons compared to the prior year. But still the single largest moving factor there is relative to what we experienced with respect to weather. We're seeing tonnage affected by weather somewhere between 1 million and 1.5 million tons a quarter. So that gives you your bridge. The other part of your question, and I think it's a good one, Kathryn, is what are we looking relative to backlogs and how does that feel. And what I would say, in particular, Texas last year, had the wettest May in history. This year, it had one other wettest May in history. I mentioned that because if we simply look at a portion of the Texas market, let's look at what we've got in North Texas, we've got about 3.6 million tons of backlog in North Texas and only about 600,000 of that shipped during the first half of 2016. So clearly, there is pretty considerable, a, backlog and pretty considerable jam up on that backlog. There's some big jobs that are really waiting to go in a more robust fashion U.S. 380, near Denton is one of them. State Highway 175 outside of Dallas is another, and Interstate 45 and 35 both had considerable work. So from a volume perspective, what did we see deferred? It was the 2 million tons broken down into those buckets that I gave you relative to large projects and what the backlog looks like. We feel very comfortable with our backlog, at this position, we just need to be able to go on a number of those jobs, particularly TxDOT jobs. Kathryn, was that responsive?"

Colorado had a much better quarter. If we look at what's going on in Colorado, in the Rocky Mountain group, what I would tell you is everything within the borders of Colorado was really very healthy. The only place in the Rocky Mountain group that we're seeing any degree of volume struggle is outside of Colorado, where it's more ballast driven. So we do have some ballast quarries in Utah, we have one up in Wyoming as well, so we are seeing some pressure of those back to those same issues that we discussed before. What I will tell you is what we're seeing in Metro Denver, what we're seeing North of Denver, what we're seeing South of Denver, whether its aggregates, ready-mix or hot mix is all a very, very healthy marketplace, particularly downstream paving, we're bidding considerably more work this year than we were last year at the same time. I want to say for the quarter, we had been on nearly 35 more jobs in Metro in North than we've been on last year. So we see Colorado being very busy not just for the balance of this year. We see Colorado being very busy for next year. With respect to the other part of your question on North Carolina, we're seeing a very healthy sharp so that's been a market that has continued to perform well. Importantly, as we go East in Charlotte and get to triad, we're seeing considerably more infrastructure work in Greensboro, High Point and Winston-Salem. That's a part of the state because of textiles, furniture and other manufacturing that suffered more than the rest of the state. We are now seeing both residential and nonresidential recovery in that marketplace. As we come farther east yet and hit Raleigh-Durham and Chapel Hill, infrastructure work here is very healthy. Multifamily residential has been very, very healthy. Residential is starting to move in the direction that we would expect. So again, we're seeing a much healthier North Carolina. But part of this state that's still waiting for more economic juice to hit it are the more coastal areas that are continuing to get better and better quarter after quarter. So I didn't want to make sure I went through those areas pretty clearly with you, Kathryn."

That cannot endure because they have thousands of miles of track that they need to maintain. So that's not a matter of if, it's a matter of when. I think with respect to the second part of your question, I think what's going to happen is aggregate business will likely get better service on the railroads because we have been a very steady customer all the way through. So if you go back to the notion that with a larger shippers stoned, on 4 out of the 5 Class I railroads and our network is at least double the next largest network, our ability, I believe, to move stone from stone producing areas to stone starts parts of the country, particularly in South Texas and along the Gulf and Atlantic Coast will oddly enough most likely be helped by the circumstance."

Keep in mind the numbers that we put out at the beginning of the year were based on the balanced numbers that we had been supplied by Class I railroads. So again, the dialogue is active with them. They've been very clear that it was going to be back half pushed. If we're looking simply to the graded power volume or others down on the different railroads. I mean, the fact is we can look at year-to-date car volumes and say UP is down 10%, CSX is down almost 7%, Norfolk Southern down almost 6%.  So you can clearly see why they would pull back. I think going back to Kathryn's point in her question, it can only be held back so long. And keep in mind, a lot of these places, too, have seen pretty considerable flooding in the first half of the year. So where you've got railroads have been underwater and have seen that type of duress, they will have needs as we head into the back half of the year. Now in fairness, if we're looking at what headwinds and tailwinds could be, and it's probably a good moment to think about that as we do at this question. I would clearly put that in a potential headwind for us as we go into the back half of the year. So I really think about those probably in 2 different tranches, Jerry. I think tailwinds that we have going into the back half of the year is the rate and trajectory of recovery into Carolinas and Southeast and some of that, by the way, could be ballast. I think another tailwind that we have is strong demand in the Midwest and Rocky Mountains. And I think a strong contractor backlog is a tailwind as well. So I think you've got those 3. But I do think that if you are looking at what the headwinds are, I think the ballast shipments could be a headwind. And if we don't see some improvement at the back half of the year, there are probably 600,000-ish tons that could be at risk there. Clearly, we do need good normal weather for the balance of the year, and we do need TxDOT to have more of their work go in a more timely basis. And the other issue, and I don't think the railroads necessarily suffer from this, but I think a lot of other trades do right now, getting truck drivers, tradesmen, welders, other things simple within the supply chain are under varying degrees of duress in different parts of the country.

So it's fascinating to look at where it was happy. I mean, street starts were down 16%. But again, our view was we're going to see an expected recovery in half 2 and really more going into '17. What's fascinating to me, Jerry, is to go back and take a look at some of the key states and look at it over not a several month period but over a 2014 to 2016 time frame relative to the subject. And this is what I find. North Carolina, the change on a percentage '14 to '16, 58%; Nebraska, same time frame, up 41%; Iowa, up 18%; Arkansas, up 11%; South Carolina, up 53%; Florida, up 18%. Now with that same time frame because you did see a pullback, is Texas down, it is. But again, it just seemed that normal give-and-take in that. So again, I'm not sure that we're seeing anything relative to public transportation that's surprising to us.

Number one, I think we need to really give a tip of the hat to our operating teams. Because operating in the type of environment at which they're operating is really challenging because it stop start. And these businesses don't do stop start very well. Here's what I'll tell you. So look at cost structure, momentum on the labor side has been very good, momentum on energy has been very good, momentum on maintenance and repair has gotten considerably better. I mean one of the things that we did last year, in particular, as we accelerated the purchase of some rolling stock, particularly in the Midwestern United States and in some of my earlier comments, I spoke to the fact that, that's going to be a business that's going to be as busy this year as it can be until snow fly is there. And what we saw with incremental additions to rolling stock in that marketplace is we saw maintenance and repair hit considerably better. So again, our cost structure is doing what I believe our cost structure we're doing, again, our teams have done exceptional work. The other piece of it that I think's worth remembering is in large part we're watching the price fall to the bottom line, and that has really been very powerful. And if you think about what you're seeing relative to the price increases, you've heard us say not for a matter of months, but you've heard us say for a matter of years that it would be most likely that you would see the Western United States on a percentage basis price increase outperform the Eastern United States and particularly in parts of Texas. And that's what we're seeing. I think the other thing to your point, Garik, on what it looks like going forward. Part of what I believe you've heard us refer to in the past is that we believed in time, Colorado would start to see that same type of pricing performance with a lag behind Texas. We're starting to see evidence of that taking shape as well. So to your question on incrementals, cost performance has been really very good. Capital deployment has continued to drive down cost in areas that needed to drive down, prices fall into the bottom line. And importantly, it's doing exactly what we thought. And keep in mind, we thought we would see these better incrementals early on in the cycle. So, so far, no surprises."

We anticipate more coming in October as well. That's what drives the 2 to 4 pricing that we're showing up. Clearly, when we spoke about Texas on the last earnings call, we said we thought Q1 maybe going into Q2. It's going to be a shakeout period we're pricing in Texas. Obviously, you've got imports that have come in, at least the Port of Houston that are modestly different than we've seen over the last several years. At the same time, part of what we're doing, particularly in North Texas is we're serving more of our own cement needs in that marketplace as well. So when we're looking at shipping more cement farther to feed some of our ready-mix operations. And you've also got some of the competitive postures that have been in that marketplace. That in my way of thinking is what has really held the price down in addition to the weather that we saw. So as we look at it, clearly, pricing in North Texas is better than it's been in South Texas. We're seeing increases in both markets, and we feel like we've now seen nice stability in that marketplace. I can tell you, we're seeing bidding in North Texas today at numbers much closer to the 112, 113, 114 type numbers, and that's more in line with what we would have expected."

We're looking at ASPs in that overall market in the Southwest up almost 17%. So if we're looking at that type of performance in Texas, it's much better. What I'll tell you is we looked across 5 different districts of ready-mix in that marketplace. There's only one that has ASPs less than $100 a cubic yard. That's getting them into a much more acceptable type of level. So yes, it's getting better in Texas. While weather was really wet, and was not necessarily ready-mix's friend.

So I guess my view is not that far removed from where PCA is, because if we look at what we think to be capacity additions to Texas over the next several years and who knows if all those come forward even with those capacity additions, what you're seeing is about a 3 million ton per annum shortfall of cement. So what Texas has not had genuinely for a 24-month period is normal weather. They have not had a normal Texas summer and our sense is that's going to happen. And when that happens in construction activity on the public side, which is half of our business is as robust as we believe it will. And when places like Dallas continue to be as they are today, the best housing market in the United States, those are the types of formulas that come together to create cement shortages in that type of circumstance."

Do I think the sector is going back to the type of volume that we were seeing in 2014, which by the way, was almost 7.5 million tons? I don't think it goes there. But I think it could very well go back to numbers that we were seeing at least in '15 or maybe in '16 if we look at full year '15, that was 3.6 million tons. So basically half of what it had been in '14. I'm not sure that, that is somewhere between that 2.5 million and 3.5 million wouldn't be a good steady run rate for energy as it returns.

It's hard for us to measure right now. But my guess is that something that you'll hear in the marketplace as you do your channel checks, too."

I mean, we really -- if we're looking at what's going on in the steel industry, the steel industry for us if you're looking at the 2 components that drive that business broadly, is what's going on with steel capacity, that's about 72%, which is a perfectly fine place to be. If it's about 70%, we're going to be fine. Equally if you take a look at where we are relative to what's going on with natural gas pricing, I mean, you've got a 21% cost reduction versus prior year. So if you've got steel at over 70%, you've got nat gas down 21%, that's helps a lot. But then when you got good business on the MagChem side and keep in mind I want to say historically about 12%, 13% of our revenue is going overseas in that business, maybe a little bit more right now. So the type of business that we're seeing that we think doesn't just have quarter-to-quarter type of impact to it, but likely has a multiple year impact to it is actually very attractive to us right now."

So if you think back to it, what we've done in growing that business in Colorado all the way down to Front Range, all the way down I-25 has really given more breadth and depth to that marketplace. So we're looking at ASPs in the Rocky Mountains, for example, that are higher than they are in the Southwest. And that's one reason I say that's a more mature business. But what I would say in the Southwest is, if we're looking at type of growth that I believe we're looking at in North Texas, if we're looking at the type of growth that I think we're looking at in the other markets that are close to that and with some of the large vertically-integrated jobs that we have in South Texas that have multiple years ahead of them. Again, I would say this is a game that's in relatively early innings in Texas right now. If you go back to the comments that I had in my prepared remarks, we anticipate seeing, from a return in other perspective the Texas business looking more and more like the Colorado business. And as we said, we believe the results that we've seen so far this year, in particular, results that we saw in this quarter is good evidence that the team is moving there. We've had a very capable management team that oversees this business. They know exactly what our aims and desires are, and they're doing a very fine job right now of meeting that."

And depending on what the market is going to dictate, how we look at that market, how we want to invest or otherwise. The other thing that we are mindful of, we have the ability to greenfield. We've clearly done that in places like Medina. We're going to do some of that in Hunter. I think we've done that very well. I think we've done more of that probably than others in the space. At the same time, if we go back 8, 9 years ago, this was a company that was producing and selling 205 million tons of stone on a pre-TXI basis. So really, if we're looking at greenfielding in markets, they're going to need to be compelling reasons why to do that because there's really not a lot of need right now to add capacity. The greater need is greater efficiencies and to find those attractive markets where we want to have a more compelling presence. So to the extent that we can look to drive the marketplace in which we have a 1 or 2 position. And right now it's 85% of our markets versus 65%, let's call it, 6 years ago, if we can take that 85% number up to 95% or to 90% and keep doing that, that's awfully good and high use for our dollars, so that's how we're going to think about that."

Let's talk about it in a couple of different tranches. I mean, if we look at it in new money terms and that all of this is new, but some of the hit from some of this is going to be relatively new. I mean Iowa put in $0.10 gas tax effective March 1,",580,"Sure. Let's talk about it in a couple of different tranches. I mean, if we look at it in new money terms and that all of this is new, but some of the hit from some of this is going to be relatively new. I mean Iowa put in $0.10 gas tax effective March 1, 2015, that's going to basically give that state about a 30% increase of construction activity, that matters to us. Obviously, with House Bill 157 last year, Georgia basically increased their gas tax. They added almost $1 billion to annual construction budgets. We think both the Georgia and the Iowa pieces probably hit, obviously, more meaningfully in 2017. But we do think the back half of '16 could see some activities from that. Obviously, Texas has just a very healthy letting schedule, and they have over the last several years. That's going to continue to build on itself. I think the notions that we discussed around project delays administratively is something to be mindful of in Texas. Keep in mind that Prop 7 money is coming when we get to September 2017 that should be about $2.5 billion per annum. Nebraska did not to the same degree that Iowa did, but they put in the gas tax increase of $0.015 on January 1, that's going to go up that same amount for the next 3 years so adds up to a $0.06 increase. That's going to about a $75 million total impact in that state. And we've got a very attractive position there. If we look at what's happened in North Carolina last year when the Legislature was in session, they basically added almost $1 billion to highway transportation spending. Now what North Carolina refers to as the biennium. So that's a 2-year process. South Carolina is looking to do more with what they call their Pennies for Progress Program, which we'd be delighted to see them do. Again, the work that we're seeing in South Carolina, right now in Charleston is very robust work. What we're seeing in Columbia is very good work and equally, Mike Pence is governor of Indiana, wanted to see if he keeps his job as governor of Indiana because Bernie is running for another one. And he's looking to invest an additional $1 billion in state roads, highways, bridges over a 4-year period there. So again, we've got a number of core states that matter a lot to us that do have a series of good initiatives coming behind them. TIGER grants program, you know what, I don't know, we'll just have to see where that goes. I'll tell you I'm still one of those people who feels like the TIFIA program in, where it's going to be impactful can and will be going into the future. And remember what we've seen in TIFIA since 2012 is a $49 billion investment. So in markets that we care deeply about right now, we've seen 2 new applications in calendar 2015 and '16 and clearly, in a couple of projects in Colorado, with $1.7 billion on I-70 and 470, the loop. And then about $1.4 billion DFW project, the Midtown Express. And then we're still waiting for the Monroe bypass in Charlotte to go, and that's about an $839 million job. So I think we'll have to see what happens with Tiger brands, but I think between the FAST Act, state initiatives and what we've seen in TIFIA, it's pretty good future."
