I want to thank you for joining us on today's call. These first quarter calls are always about the future and the past and today's no different, but I want to start with a recap of 2015 for",1356,"Well, thanks, operator, and welcome, good afternoon, everyone. I want to thank you for joining us on today's call. 
These first quarter calls are always about the future and the past and today's no different, but I want to start with a recap of 2015 for 2 reasons: First, it was a solid year for us with some excellent results. And as I'll discuss, this says a lot about how we're managing the business. And second, we saw some trends emerge in 2015 that are likely to impact the current year. But I'll start with the operating environment. It offered some challenges, although the underlying foundation of the recovery remained positive. We capitalized on some broad-based opportunities such as the continued rebound in commercial construction. And we saw widening demand from sectors such as hospitality, renewables and public works.  At the same time, we dealt with a significant drag from upstream oil and gas and its knock-on effect, a weak Canadian dollar and fleet growth in the industry, which according to Rouse, is outpacing demand. 
Nevertheless, for the full year of 2015, we delivered a record amount of adjusted EBITDA of $2.8 billion at a margin of 48.7%, which is the highest in our company's history. And our free cash flow came in at $919 million after CapEx, which was also a record. These numbers tell a good story. It shows how can we be flexible and adjust our CapEx while delivering value for investors.
So when me look to 2016, the headwinds are still with us. There are also some evident macro constraints puts pressure on industrial activity, the Canadian economy as well as some unknowns. But underneath these dynamics, the nonresidential construction markets are continuing to recover, and that's a key point. The equipment rental industry is continuing to grow. 
That's why if you ask me where we stand on the operating environment, there's really 2 answers to that. One has to do with the short term, meaning 2016, and the other's longer term relating to the rental cycle. 
Short term, our stance is to be cautious of CapEx and proactive about pursuing profitable growth opportunities in areas such as specialty services, and I'll talk more about specialty in a minute. For the company as a whole, we think that our 2016 revenue could range from roughly $100 million to $200 million in either side of last year's performance. And this includes a significant negative impact from FX, as Bill will discuss in a moment.
But it takes into consideration the continuing drag from the Canadian economy on our performance. Canada is a commodity-driven country with economic issues that go deeper than Alberta and oil sands. Real GDP growth in Canada this year is projected to be less than 1%. And as the largest rental company in Canada, we're going to feel some pain, and it could be significant, but we'll do what we can do to mitigate the impact on rates and utilization through fleet management.
Now with rates, for the company overall, we're projecting a year-over-year decline of 1% to 2%. We've moved rates higher for 5 straight years and we've maintained a premium price for our services. And sometimes, that can make our rates more vulnerable to pressure in the short term. But rate integrity is the best long-term strategy for value creation. 
With utilization, we're guiding to approximately 68%, which would be an increase of 70 basis points. We see improvement coming from our disciplined management of CapEx and OEC-on-Rent, the continued recovery in nonresidential construction spending, secular penetration and absorption of fleet excess in the industry.
What our outlook doesn't is timing, and that's a big part of our 2016 plan. We'll be very careful about the role of our CapEx. In the first quarter, we expect to spend less than half of the CapEx we spent in last year's first quarter. The CapEx we do spend will be focused on growth factors and key customers. And from there, we'll test the waters. Our full year plan is for approximately $1.2 billion of gross CapEx, and we have the flexibility to move that number up or down based on the data that we see from our operations.
So now turning to the longer term. Beyond the current market uncertainty, we agree with industry forecasters that there are multiple years of growth ahead for rental in North America. The latest projections from Global Insight is about 6% annual growth in construction and industrial rentals to at least 2017. We're seeing levels of customer activity support this view. That point can be lost while revenues bottom out for reasons I mentioned earlier. So it's important to note that our actual market activity is solid and in many cases, trending upward. And our customers are, on a whole, optimistic. 
So I'll give you a few examples. Our southeast region had a strong finish to the year. The activity is coming from a mix of sectors including automotive plants, infrastructure and amusement parks. On the West Coast, commercial construction is going strong along with renewables. Our Pacific West region has won some business on a number of solar projects. And more universally, we're on large multiyear construction projects in industries ranging from ag business to biotech to hotels and to sports arenas.
The real standouts continued to be our specialty services of Trench Safety and Power & HVAC. For the full year, combined, these services increased the rental revenue by 21%. And a healthy 16% of that revenue increase came from same store. Now while we continue to invest in fleet for the specialty operations as well as our pump business, we've been expanding our pump footprint in new geographies and diversifying our customer base beyond upstream oil and gas. And we expect to realize some benefits from these actions in 2016.
Specialty services is an important part of our game plan through value creation. But when I speak to investors one to one, I often caution against thinking specialty is a stand-alone business. It's true these are high-margin operations in their own right, but they're greater value lies in the holistic view of the company and especially in cross-selling. We cross-sell our specialty services to National Accounts to create a stickier customer relationships, compete more effectively on major contracts and earn a larger share of the wallet. In 2015, we generated 22% more revenue from cross-selling versus the prior year, and we believe there's significant more financial benefits to be realized.
This is just one area of the business that we operated more effectively. In 2015, we also performed at a record safety level and became a more technology-enabled company. We're even better at change management. And we're continuing to invest in improving our route process and service capabilities. And our employees are incredibly engaged in our company's future. All these are important attributes that to customers.
And finally, I want to -- make a comment about our liquidity. We generated over $900 million of free cash flow in 2015, and we do expect to -- create about the same or more in 2016. We plan to utilize this cash flow to buy back shares and pay down debt this year, and these are the most prudent uses of our cash this time.
So in closing, I want to emphasize that while 2016 contains some unknowns, we are absolutely certain of our ability to manage through any volatility. 2015 didn't always go according to our plan, but it is very profitable for us. We executed on our strategy. We showed discipline as an organization. And this will also showcase our resilience and flexibility we have in adapting to change in order to drive returns. And these qualities will serve us well in 2016 when we expect to deal with some ongoing challenges. And they will serve us equally well in the longer term as we benefit from a rental cycle that has still years of growth ahead. 
So with that, I'll shift this over to Bill for the financial results. And then after that, we'll take your questions. Over to you, Bill."
36005,322055873,922549,"United Rentals, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 28, 2016",2016-01-28,"Earnings Calls","United Rentals, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone, from me as well. I'll try to add some more color to the key metrics that you've all seen, starting with the revenue picture. Rental revenue in particular, revenue was down 3.2% in the quarter this year versus",1960,"Thanks, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone, from me as well. 
I'll try to add some more color to the key metrics that you've all seen, starting with the revenue picture. Rental revenue in particular, revenue was down 3.2% in the quarter this year versus last year. That's about $42 million of revenue decline. Pieces of that really start with rerent and ancillary. Those two combined were a little better than flat, so call it up $0.5 million the net of those 2 components. The real driver in the change in the quarter was OER growth. Within that, rate, rental rate down 1.8%, that was about a $21 million decline versus last year. Our volume increase of 0.2%, accounted for about $3 million of improved revenue year-over-year. That's a plus year-over-year.
Inflation, CapEx inflation cost us about $19 million, a little more than $19 million versus last year. And then everything else, mix and all other components aggregated to a decline of about $6 million year-over-year. So those are the key pieces of that $42 million rental revenue drop in the quarter and explains the 3.2% decline from last year.
One other operating measure within that year-over-year rental revenue performance was time utilization, 68.2% for the quarter. It was Down 2.4 percentage points for the quarter. I'll point out that, that does include the impact of Canadian currency translation of the fleet on rent in the volume component.
Speaking of Canadian currency, the impact in the quarter for the currency was very significant. Canadian dollar cost us $22 million versus where we would have been had it stayed flat, so a pretty significant impact in revenue growth for the quarter.
And just one real quick note on the full year rental revenue, $4.949 billion, up 2.7% last year. I'll note that, that also included the impact of the currency headwind. Currency in the full year period cost us $78 million versus unchanged currency, so a very significant impact in the full year as well. In fact, if you excluded that, our growth rate would have been as high as 4.3% for full year rental revenue as opposed to the 2.7% that we recorded.
Our used equipment, we generated $157 million of used proceeds in the quarter. That's basically flat with the prior year. And the adjusted gross margin came in at 46.5%. That margin is down from the prior year by about 2%, but it's still very strong relative to the margin that we've achieved in our long history. And I think that reflects the fact that we've been very focused on driving as much of our used equipment sales activity through our retail channel as we could. 
In the quarter, retail accounted for 77% of the proceeds that we realized. And that's the highest share through the retail channel that we've achieved in a number of years, probably going back to  before the last downturn. So we feel good about the overall used equipment results that we drove in the quarter and in the year and look for the used equipment market to continue with a robust pricing and momentum here in the near term as well.
On the profitability front starting with adjusted EBITDA, it was $744 million in the quarter and came in at the margin of 48.9%. That's a $31 million decline or a 70 basis point decline in the margin. The $31 million versus last year is made up as follows: Rental rates cost us about $20 million in EBITDA, whereas volume was a positive of about $2 million over the last year. CapEx inflation was about a $14 million reduction versus last year. And that used sales margin in dollar terms cost us about $5 million versus the last year. Our usual merit increase impact of about $6 million reduction in EBITDA came through in the quarter. And then we had the biggest positive in the quarter year-over-year, as we talked about throughout the year, was our reduced incentive compensation accruals. That was a benefit of about $19 million.
Bad debt expense was about $2 million of headwind versus the prior year. And everything else aggregated to $5 million headwind versus the prior year. So those are the key components of the $31 million of EBITDA change in the year. 
I will also point out that spread throughout a number of those lines was the impact of currency. It all aggregated to about $8 million of headwind from currency on a year-over-year basis to bring us to that full year -- excuse me, that quarterly number.
For the full year just real briefly, our adjusted EBITDA $2.832 billion was an increase of 4.2%, and that included an unfavorable currency impact of $29.3 million for the full year. So again, currency is a pretty significant impact.
On flow-through, adjusted EBITDA flow-through for the company finished the year at 86.4%. But I'll point out that, that includes the impact of the lower incentive accruals, that was a benefit, as well as the impact of the currency change year-over-year, which actually sounds bizarre but also is a benefit to flow-through as well, just given the impact -- the separate impacts on revenue and EBITDA. If you exclude both currency and incentive comp, the flow-through calculates out to 65% for the company. And that's consistent with the roughly 60% that we guide to or guided to for 2015.
Moving to EPS. Adjusted EPS in the quarter was $2.19, and that was essentially flat with the prior year. I will point out, however, that on a year-over-year basis, currency was in the adjusted EPS number. It cost us about $0.02 in adjusted EPS. 
We also had a significant tax law change that was finalized in the fourth quarter in the state of Connecticut. Lots of detail around that, but when you net out the impact of that tax law change, it cost us about $0.06 versus last year. 
And then I'd also point to the mix shift versus the U.S. and Canada. Canada took a smaller share of our income in the fourth quarter and actually the full year-end 2015. So if that mix shift had not happened, we would have been better by $0.02 as well in the adjusted EPS number. So keep those 3 things in mind as you think about the quarter EPS.
Same with the full year, $8.02 adjusted EPS for the full year. That was an increase of 16% last year, but again that was impacted by the currency impact, which in the full year was about $0.08 of headwind. Also the Connecticut tax law change, a portion of which was accounted for in the second quarter tax rate and the remainder was finalized in the fourth quarter. So if you aggregate those impacts in the year, that was about $0.12 of headwind. And then the shift in mix between U.S. and Canada cost us about $0.13 for the full year.
On free cash flow, a great story here in 2015, $919 million, which compares to $557 million in 2014. Obviously, the lower rental CapEx was a big part of the positive impact year-over-year, but also the higher profitability contributed as well. Our cash taxes also had an impact. They were lower cash taxes paid. And favorable working capital effects were also at play during the year for that $900 million or $919 million of free cash flow.
CapEx, you've seen already gross rental CapEx reduce in the quarter by $109 million, and that brought the full year total to $1.534 billion, somewhat below the $1.6 billion that we have been guiding to. And net rental CapEx was about a $1 billion number for the full year. 
On the liquidity front, $1.1 billion of liquidity at the end of the quarter, that included ABL capacity, just over $870 million and cash at the balance sheet of about $108 million -- $180 million there. So we're well positioned on liquidity, as we typically are.
Just a quick note on the share repurchase programs. We completed, during the quarter, the $750 million repurchase program that we were operating under previously. We bought off the remaining $10 million of that program in the quarter. And then we also began purchases under the new $1 billion authorization, and in fact, completed $111 million against that authorization during the quarter as well. So total of $122 million of repurchases in the quarter, and it puts us on a path to executing the new $1 billion program over the course of the next 18 months. We started in November of last year. And so we expect to complete it by the end of April in 2017. 
As I pointed out in prior quarter, we do need to be mindful, as we execute the program, of our limitations on share repurchases, in particular the restricted payments limitation in our debt covenants. However, when you aggregate those RP baskets available to us plus the available cash that's held at the holding company, we have about $500 million worth of available capacity at the end of December in order to execute share repurchases. So we feel that we are well positioned to be able to manage the program on a prudent, timely basis as we go through the year.
Return on invested capital in the year, just to touch that real briefly, was 8.8%, and that number was essentially flat compared to 2014.
Let me finish just by addressing our outlook really briefly. You've all seen the numbers that we put out. I'd just point out that as Michael mentioned, we have a somewhat lighter range around the midpoint of our guidance for revenue and EBITDA. And indeed, we've instituted a range for our view on rental rates. That wider range represents truly our view of the uncertainty that we're managing through right? here and now. And we put the wider range there to give us a little bit more flexibility in responding to whatever the environment hands to us as we go throughout 2016. In particular, the range on rental rate, the minus 1% rental rate, top end of that range reflects our carryover. Our carryover from 2015 is essentially 1%. And so as we go through 2016, in order to achieve the 1% decline, the top end of the range would require us to have some slight increases during the peak season on a monthly sequential basis, which we think is a reasonable outlook. To get to the 2% would require essentially flat monthly sequentials during the peak season.
The time utilization improvement of 70 basis points is also we believe are reasonable, given the approach that we're taking to the management of CapEx spend. $1.2 billion of gross capital netting down to about $700 million after used proceeds, we think again is a great way for us to approach the environment that we're managing through right now. If we do that, then we'll net out to that $900 million to $1 billion of free cash flow that you see in our guidance very comfortably.
So those are the key things that I wanted to offer as prepared comments. Before I ask the operator to open the call for Q&A, I'll just reiterate the comments that Michael made. Caution and flexibility are 2 of the key watchwords as we think about 2016. And we're going to make sure that we continue to evaluate the environment carefully and make decisions about what to do in response in a very prudent way. I think you can count on that. Certainly look forward to talking to all of you as we go forward throughout the year-end managing the business.
So with that, I'll ask the operator to open the call for questions and answers. Operator?"

I think it came in a little weaker than we thought, and Canada was certainly a part of that. As a result, the carryover that we brought into '16 starts at the lower point, and we're watching very carefully how rates develop from here. And to our point earlier, that's going to be watched for the entire year. Canada, I don't know if you guys want to handle Canada notion. But Canada did have a fairly sharp decline in the fourth quarter, sharper than we expected when we talked to you at third quarter call. And we're watching that very carefully and thinking very, very aggressively about what do we do in response, right, what are the drivers, is it something we can address, and if not, what can we do in response. So that's how we're thinking about Canada, and I honestly think about the whole business as we come earlier in the year. Michael, you guys want to add anything?"

And we certainly had to partner up and depend some strong relationships here and there on a national account base. But I wouldn't point to it as a concession-driven situation. The fact of the 1-point carryover is really a function of what Bill stated, what Q4 sequentials looked like. When you have 0.5 negative in both November and December, that made the full year carryover a full point negative. So when you look at our range of 1 to 2, we'd have to be flat for the full year of '16 to achieve that 1.

As went in the fourth and first quarter, I've always told a lot of investors that -- this is going to be the challenge. this is was the challenge that we have simply because we don't have oil like we've had over the last 5 years. So it's more seasonal trend, more nonresidential trend.

And welcome and good afternoon, everyone. I want to thank you for joining us on today's call. These first quarter calls are always about the future than the past, and today is no different. But I want to start with a recap of 201",1372,"Well, thanks, operator. And welcome and good afternoon, everyone. I want to thank you for joining us on today's call. 
These first quarter calls are always about the future than the past, and today is no different. But I want to start with a recap of 2015 for 2 reasons. First, it was a solid year for us with some excellent results. And as I'll discuss, that says a lot about how we're managing the business. And second, we saw some trends emerge in 2015 that are likely to impact the current year. 
I'll start with the operating environment. It offered some challenges, although the underlying foundation of the recovery remained positive. We capitalized on some broad-based opportunities such as the continued rebound in commercial construction, and we saw a lively demand from sectors such as hospitality, renewables and public works.  
At the same time, we dealt with a significant drag for upstream oil and gas and its knock-on effect, a weak Canadian dollar and fleet growth in the industry, which according to Rouse, is outpacing demand. 
Nevertheless, for the full year of 2015, we delivered a record amount of adjusted EBITDA of $2.8 billion and a margin of 48.7%, which is the highest in our company's history. And our free cash flow came in at $919 million after CapEx, which was also a record. These numbers tell a good story. They show how we can be flexible and adjust our CapEx while delivering value for investors.
So as we look to 2016, the headwinds are still with us. There are also some evident macro constraints for this pressure on industrial activity, the Canadian economy as well as some unknowns. But underneath these dynamics, the nonresidential construction markets are continuing to recover, and that's a key point. The equipment rental industry is continuing to grow. 
That's why if you ask me where we stand on our operating environment, there's really 2 answers to that. One has to do with the short term, meaning 2016, and the other is longer term relating to the rental cycle. 
Short term, our stance is to be cautious on CapEx and proactive about pursuing profitable growth opportunities in areas such as specialty services, and I'll talk more about specialty in a minute. For the company as a whole, we think that our 2016 revenue can range from roughly $100 million to $200 million in either side of last year's performance. And this includes a significant negative impact from FX, as Bill will discuss in a moment.
And it takes into consideration the continuing drag from the Canadian economy on our performance. Canada is a commodity-driven country with economic issues that go deeper than Alberta and the oil sands. Real GDP growth in Canada this year is projected to be less than 1%. And as the largest rental company in Canada, we're going to feel some pain, and it could be significant. But we'll do what we can do to mitigate the impact on rates and utilization through fleet management.
Now with the rates, the company overall were projecting a year-over-year decline of 1% to 2%. We've moved rates higher for 5 straight years and we've maintained a premium price for our services. And sometimes, that can make our rates more vulnerable to pressure in the short term, but rate integrity is the best long-term strategy for value creation. 
With utilization, we're guiding to approximately 68%, which would be an increase of 70 basis points. We see improvement coming from our disciplined management of CapEx, at OEC on rent, the continued recovery in nonresidential construction spending, secular penetration and the absorption of split excess in the industry. What our outlook doesn't show is timing, and that's a big part of our 2016 plan. We're going to be very careful about the rollout of our CapEx. 
In the first quarter, we expect to spend less than half of the CapEx we spent in last year's first quarter. The CapEx we do spend will be focused on growth sectors and key customers. And from there, we'll test the waters. Full year plan is for approximately $1.2 billion of gross CapEx, and we have the flexibility to move that number up or down based on the data that we see from our operations.
So now turning to the longer term. Beyond the current market uncertainty, we agree with industry forecasters that there are multiple years of growth ahead for -- in rental in North America. The latest projection from Global Insight is about 6% annual growth in construction and industrial rentals to at least 2017. 
We're seeing levels of customer activity support this view. That point can't be lost when revenues flattens out for reasons I mentioned earlier. So it's important to note that our actual market activity is solid, and in many cases, trending upward. And our customers are, on a whole, optimistic. 
So I'll give you a few examples. Our Southeast region had a strong finish to the year. The activity is coming from a mix of sectors, including automotive plants, infrastructure and amusement parks. On the West Coast, commercial construction is going strong along with renewables. Our Pacific West region has won some business on a number of solo projects. And more universally, we're on large multiyear construction projects at industries ranging from ag business to biotech to hotels and to sports arenas.
The real standouts continued to be our specialty services of Trench Safety and Power & HVAC. For the full year combined these services increased our rental revenue by 21%, and a healthy 16% of that revenue increase came from same store. Now, we'll continue to invest in fleet and cold starts for these specialty operations as well as our pump business. We've been expanding our pump footprint in new geographies and diversifying our customer base beyond upstream oil and gas. And we expect to realize some benefits from these actions in 2016. Specialty service is an important part of our game plan for value creation. 
But when I speak to investors one-on-one, I often caution against thinking specialty is a stand-alone business. It's true these are high-margin operations in their own right, but their greater value lies in the holistic view of the company and specifically in cross-selling. We cross-sell our specialty services to National Accounts to create stickier customer relationships, compete more effectively on major contracts and earn a larger share of the wallet. 
In 2015, we generated 22% more revenue from cross-selling versus the prior year, and we believe there's significant more financial benefit to be realized. It's just one area of the business that we're operating more effectively. 
In 2015, we also performed at a record safety level. We became a more technology-enabled company or even better, a changed management, and we're continuing to invest in improving our rental process and service capabilities. And our employees are incredibly engaged in our company's future. All these are important attributes that manage the customers.
And finally, I want to talk about -- make a comment about our liquidity. We generated over $900 million of free cash flow in 2015, and we do expect this -- create about the same or more in 2016. We plan to utilize this cash flow to buy back shares and pay down debt this year, and these are the most prudent uses of our cash this time.
So in closing, I want to emphasize that while 2016 contains some unknowns, we are absolutely certain about our ability to manage any volatility. 2015 didn't always go according to our plan, but it was very profitable for us. We executed our -- on our strategy. We showed discipline as an organization. And this year, we also showcased our resilience and flexibility we have in adapting to change in order to drive returns. And these qualities will serve us well in 2016 when we expect to deal with some ongoing challenges. And they will serve us equally well in the longer term as we benefit from a rental cycle that has still years of growth ahead. 
So with that, I'll shift this over to Bill for the financial results. And then after that, we'll take your questions. So over to you, Bill."
36005,322055873,922894,"United Rentals, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 28, 2016",2016-01-28,"Earnings Calls","United Rentals, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone, from me as well. I'll try to add some more color to the key metrics that you've all seen starting with the revenue picture, rental revenue in particular.

I'll try to add some more color to the key metrics that you've all seen starting with the revenue picture, rental revenue in particular. 
Rental revenue was down 3.2% in the quarter this year versus last year. That's about $42 million of revenue decline. Pieces of that really start with re-rent and ancillary. Those 2 combined were a little better than flat, so call it up $0.5 million, the net of those 2 components. 
The real driver in the change in the quarter was OER growth. Within that rate -- rental rate, down 1.8%That was about a $21 million decline versus last year. Our volume increase of 0.2% accounted for about $3 million of improved revenue year-over-year. That's a plus, year-over-year.
Inflation. CapEx inflation cost us about $19 million -- a little more than $19 million versus last year. And then everything else, mix and all other components, aggregated to a decline of about $6 million year-over-year. So those are the key pieces of that $42 million rental revenue drop in the quarter and explains the 3.2% decline from last year.
One other operating measure within that year-over-year rental revenue performance was time utilization. 68.2% for the quarter was down 2.4 percentage points for the quarter. I'll point out that, that does include the impact of Canadian currency translation of the fleet on rent in the volume component.
Speaking of Canadian currency, the impact in the quarter for the currency was very significant. Canadian dollar cost us $22 million versus where we would have been had it stayed flat, so a pretty significant impact in revenue growth for the quarter.
And just one real quick note on the full year rental revenue. $4.949 billion, up 2.7% last year. I'll note that, that also included the impact of the currency headwind. Currency in the full year period cost us $78 million versus unchanged currency, so a very significant impact in the full year as well. In fact, if you excluded that, our growth rate would have been as high as 4.3% for full year rental revenue as opposed to the 2.7% that we reported.
On used equipment, we generated $157 million of used proceeds in the quarter. That's basically flat with the prior year, and the adjusted gross margin came in at 46.5%. That margin is down from the prior year by about 2%, but it's still very strong relative to the margin that we've achieved in our long history. And I think that reflects the fact that we've been very focused on driving as much of our used equipment sales activity through our retail channel as we could. 
In the quarter, retail accounted for 77% of the proceeds that we realized, and that's the highest share through the retail channel that we have achieved in a number of years, probably going back to before the last downturn. So we feel good about the overall used equipment result that we drove in the quarter and in the year, and look forward the used equipment market to continue with robust pricing and momentum here in the near term as well.
On the profitability front starting with adjusted EBITDA, it was $744 million in the quarter and came in at the margin of 48.9%. That's a $31 million decline or a 70-basis-point decline in the margin. The $31 million versus last year is made up as follows. Rental rates cost us about $20 million in EBITDA, whereas volume was a positive of about $2 million over the last year. CapEx inflation was about a $14 million reduction versus last year, and that used sales margin in dollar terms cost us about $5 million versus the last year. 
Our usual merit increase impact of about $6 million of reduction in EBITDA came through in the quarter. And then we had the biggest positive in the quarter year-over-year as we talked about throughout the year was our reduced incentive compensation accruals. That was a benefit of about $19 million.
Bad debt expense was about $2 million of headwind versus the prior year, and everything else aggregated to $5 million headwind versus the prior year. So those are the key components of the $31 million of EBITDA change in the year. 
I will also point out that spread throughout a number of those lines was the impact of currency. It all aggregated to about $8 million of headwind from currency on a year-over-year basis to bring us to that full year -- or excuse me, that quarterly number.
For the full year, just real briefly, our adjusted EBITDA $2.832 billion was an increase of 4.2%, and that included an unfavorable currency impact of $29.3 million for the full year. So again, currency with a pretty significant impact.
On flow-through, adjusted EBITDA flow-through for the company finished the year at 86.4%. But I'll point out that, that includes the impact of the lower incentive accruals, that was a benefit, as well as the impact of the currency change year-over-year, which actually sounds bizarre, but it also was a benefit to flow-through as well just given the impacts -- the separate impacts on revenue and EBITDA. 
If you exclude both currency and incentive comp, the flow-through calculates out to 65% for the company, and that's broadly consistent with the roughly 60% that we guide to -- or guided to for 2015.
Moving to EPS. Adjusted EPS in the quarter was $2.19, and that was essentially flat with the prior year. I will point out, however, that on a year-over-year basis, currency was at play and then the adjusted EPS number. It cost us about $0.02 in adjusted EPS. 
We also had a significant tax law change that was finalized in the fourth quarter in the state of Connecticut. Lots of detail around that, but when you net out the impact of that tax law change, it cost us about $0.06 versus last year. And then I'd also point to the mix shift between the U.S. and Canada.
Canada took a smaller share of our income in the fourth quarter, and actually indeed over the full year in 2015. So if that mix shift had not happened, we would have been better by $0.02 as well in the adjusted EPS number. So keep those 3 things in mind as you think about the quarter EPS.
Same with the full year, $8.02 adjusted EPS for the full year. That was an increase of 16% last year. But again, that was impacted by the currency impact, which in the full year was about $0.08 of headwind. Also the Connecticut tax law change, a portion of which was accounted for in the second quarter tax rate and the remainder was finalized in the fourth quarter. So if you aggregate those impacts in the year, that was about $0.12 of headwind. And then the shift in mix between U.S. and Canada cost us about $0.13 for the full year.
On free cash flow, great story here in 2015, $919 million, which compares to $557 million in 2014. Obviously, the lower rental CapEx was a big part of the positive impact year-over-year, but also the higher profitability contributed as well. Our cash taxes also had an impact. They were lower cash taxes paid, and favorable working capital effects were also at play during the year for that $900 million or $919 million of free cash flow.
Rental CapEx, as you've seen already, gross rental CapEx reduced in the quarter by $109 million, and that brought the full year total to $1.534 billion, somewhat below the $1.6 billion that we have been guiding to. And net rental CapEx was about the $1 billion number for the full year. 
On the liquidity front, $1.1 billion of liquidity at the end of the quarter. That included ABL capacity just over $870 million and cash on the balance sheet of about $108 million -- $180 million there. So we're well-positioned on liquidity as we typically are.
Just a quick note on our share repurchase programs. We completed, during the quarter, the $750 million repurchase program that we were operating under previously. We bought off the remaining $10 million of that program in the quarter. And then we also began purchases under the new billion-dollar authorization and in fact, completed $111 million against that authorization during the quarter as well. So a total of $122 million of repurchases in the quarter, and it put us on a path to executing the new billion-dollar program over the course of the next 18 months. We started it in November of last year, and so we expect to complete it by the end of April in 2017. 
As I pointed out in prior quarter, we do need to be mindful as we execute the program of our limitations on share repurchases, in particular, the restricted payments limitations in our debt covenants. However, when you aggregate those RP baskets available to us, plus the available cash that's held at the holding company, we have about $500 million worth of available capacity at the end of December in order to execute share repurchases. So we feel that we're well-positioned to be able to manage the program on a prudent, timely basis as we go through the year.
Return on invested capital in the year, just to touch that real briefly, was 8.8%, and that number was essentially flat compared to 2014.
Let me finish just by addressing our outlook really briefly. You've all seen the numbers that we put out. I'd just point out that as Michael mentioned, we have a somewhat lighter range around the midpoint of our guidance for revenue EBITDA. And indeed, we've instituted a range for our view on rental rates. That wider range represents truly our view of the uncertainty that we're managing through right here and now, and we put the wider range there to give us a little bit more flexibility in responding to whatever the environment hands to us as we go throughout 2016. 
In particular, the range on rental rate, the minus 1% rental rate, top end of that range reflects our carryover. Our carryover from 2015 is essentially 1%. And so as we go through 2016, in order to achieve the 1% decline, the top end of the range would require us to have some slight increases during the peak season on a monthly sequential basis, which we think is a reasonable outlook. To get to the 2% would require essentially flat monthly sequentials during the peak season.
The time utilization improvement, 70 basis points, is also we believe very reasonable, given the approach that we're taking to our management of the CapEx spend. $1.2 billion of gross capital netting down to about $700 million after used proceeds, we think again is a great way for us to approach the environment that we're managing through right now. If we do that, then we'll net out to that $900 million to $1 billion of free cash flow that you see in our guidance very comfortably.
So those are the key things that I wanted to offer as prepared comments. Before I open the -- ask the operator to open the call for Q&A, I'll just reiterate some of the comments that Michael made. Caution and flexibility are 2 of the key watchwords as we think about 2016, and we're going to make sure that we continue to evaluate the environment very carefully and make decisions about what to do in response in a very prudent way. I think you can count on that and certainly look forward to talking to all of you as we go forward throughout the year in managing the business.
So with that, I'll ask the operator to open the call for questions and answers. Operator?"

We're pretty much through the oil and gas movement. The exposure now in the upstream is down to 4%, down from 6% 1.5 years ago when we started tracking this. So our exposure is certainly less. And if we end up getting a little bit more of a dip than where the baseline is today, I don't -- certainly don't think it's anything that we'd have to call out in large fleet movement.

And I realized that there's a reasonable position that says, ""Hey, Bill, '16 and '17 are not looking good right now, so you should change your view right now."" We haven't gotten to that point. The good news is that we've got the capability, all right? We're executing the program on a steady pace over time, and we've got the capability to pull it back if we do change our view based on the experience that we have in the marketplace, right? If the first several months of the year come in weaker than we expect right now, then we will have to rethink that approach to the share repurchase and debt paydown. And that's how we're approaching it, right? This is part of the notion of flexibility. We set up a point of view. We establish a plan based on that point of view. But then we keep our head on a swivel as they say, and keep asking ourselves, is it still right? Is it still right?

And welcome and good afternoon, everyone. I want to thank you for joining us on today's call. These first quarter calls are always about the future than the past, and today is no different. But I want to start with a recap of 201",1377,"Well, thanks, operator. And welcome and good afternoon, everyone. I want to thank you for joining us on today's call. 
These first quarter calls are always about the future than the past, and today is no different. But I want to start with a recap of 2015 for 2 reasons. First, it was a solid year for us with some excellent results. And as I'll discuss, that says a lot about how we're managing the business. And second, we saw some trends emerge in 2015 that are likely to impact the current year. 
I'll start with the operating environment. It offered some challenges, although the underlying foundation of the recovery remained positive. We capitalized on some broad-based opportunities such as the continued rebound in commercial construction, and we saw a lively demand from sectors such as hospitality, renewables and public works.  
At the same time, we dealt with a significant drag for upstream oil and gas and its knock-on effect, a weak Canadian dollar and fleet growth in the industry, which according to Rouse, is outpacing demand. 
Nevertheless, for the full year of 2015, we delivered a record amount of adjusted EBITDA of $2.8 billion and a margin of 48.7%, which is the highest in our company's history. And our free cash flow came in at $919 million after CapEx, which was also a record. These numbers tell a good story. They show how we can be flexible and adjust our CapEx while delivering value for investors.
So as we look to 2016, the headwinds are still with us. There are also some evident macro constraints such as pressure on industrial activity, the Canadian economy as well as some unknowns. But underneath these dynamics, the nonresidential construction markets are continuing to recover, and that's a key point. The equipment rental industry is continuing to grow. 
That's why if you ask me where we stand on our operating environment, there's really 2 answers to that. One has to do with the short term, meaning 2016, and the other is longer term relating to the rental cycle. 
Short term, our stance is to be cautious on CapEx and proactive about pursuing profitable growth opportunities in areas such as specialty services, and I'll talk more about specialty in a minute. For the company as a whole, we think that our 2016 revenue can range from roughly $100 million to $200 million on either side of last year's performance. And this includes a significant negative impact from FX, as Bill will discuss in a moment.
And it takes into consideration the continuing drag from the Canadian economy on our performance. Canada is a commodity-driven country with economic issues that go deeper than Alberta and the oil sands. Real GDP growth in Canada this year is projected to be less than 1%. And as the largest rental company in Canada, we're going to feel some pain, and it could be significant. But we'll do what we can do to mitigate the impact on rates and utilization through fleet management.
Now with the rates. For the company overall we're projecting a year-over-year decline of 1% to 2%. We've moved rates higher for 5 straight years, and we've maintained a premium price for our services. And sometimes that can make our rates more vulnerable to pressure in the short term, but rate integrity is the best long-term strategy for value creation. 
With utilization, we're guiding to approximately 68%, which would be an increase of 70 basis points. We see improvement coming from our disciplined management of CapEx at OEC on rent, the continued recovery in nonresidential construction spending, secular penetration and the absorption of fleet excess in the industry. What our outlook doesn't show is timing, and that's a big part of our 2016 plan. We're going to be very careful about the rollout of our CapEx. 
In the first quarter, we expect to spend less than half of the CapEx we spent in last year's first quarter. The CapEx that we do spend will be focused on growth sectors and key customers. And from there, we'll test the waters. Our full year plan is for approximately $1.2 billion of gross CapEx, and we have the flexibility to move that number up or down based on the data that we see from our operations.
So now turning to the longer term. Beyond the current market uncertainty, we agree with industry forecasters that there are multiple years of growth ahead for -- in rental in North America. The latest projection from Global Insight is about 6% annual growth in construction and industrial rentals to at least 2017. 
Now we're seeing levels of customer activity to support this view. That point can't be lost when revenue flattens out for reasons I mentioned earlier. So it's important to note that our actual market activity is solid, and in many cases, trending upward. And our customers are, on a whole, optimistic. 
So I'll give you a few examples. Our Southeast region had a strong finish to the year. The activity is coming from a mix of sectors, including automotive plants, infrastructure and amusement parks. On the West Coast, commercial construction is going strong along with renewables. Our Pacific West region has won some business on a number of solo projects. And more universally, we're on large multiyear construction projects at industries ranging from ag business to biotech to hotels and to sports arenas.
The real standouts continue to be our specialty services of Trench Safety and Power & HVAC. For the full year combined -- these services increased our rental revenue by 21%, and a healthy 16% of that revenue increase came from same store. Now, we'll continue to invest in fleet and cold-starts for these specialty operations as well as our pump business. We've been expanding our pump footprint in new geographies and diversifying our customer base beyond upstream oil and gas. And we expect to realize some benefits from these actions in 2016. Specialty service is an important part of our game plan for value creation. 
But when I speak to investors one-on-one, I often caution against thinking specialty is a stand-alone business. It's true these are high-margin operations in their own right, but their greater value lies in the holistic view of the company and specifically in cross-selling. We cross-sell our specialty services to National Accounts to create stickier customer relationships, compete more effectively on major contracts and earn a larger share of their wallet. 
In 2015, we generated 22% more revenue from cross-selling versus the prior year, and we believe there's significant more financial benefit to be realized. This is just one area of the business that we're operating more effectively. 
In 2015, we also performed at a record safety level. We became a more technology-enabled company where, even better, it changed management, and we're continuing to invest in improving our rental process and service capabilities. And our employees are incredibly engaged in our company's future. All these are important attributes that manage to customers.
And finally, I want to talk -- or make a comment about our liquidity. We generated over $900 million of free cash flow in 2015, and we do expect to create about the same or more in 2016. We plan to utilize this cash flow to buy back shares and pay down debt this year, and these are the most prudent uses of our cash at this time.
So in closing, I want to emphasize that while 2016 contains some unknowns, we are absolutely certain about our ability to manage through any volatility. 2015 didn't always go according to our plan, but it was very profitable for us. We executed on our strategy. We showed discipline as an organization. And this year, we also showcased our resilience and flexibility we have in adapting to change in order to drive returns. And these qualities will serve us well in 2016 when we expect to deal with some ongoing challenges. And they will serve us equally well in the longer term as we benefit from a rental cycle that has still years of growth ahead. 
So with that, I'll shift this over to Bill for the financial results. And then after that, we'll take your questions. So over to you, Bill."
36005,322055873,923161,"United Rentals, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 28, 2016",2016-01-28,"Earnings Calls","United Rentals, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone, from me as well. I'll try to add some more color to the key metrics that you've all seen starting with the revenue picture, rental revenue in particular. Rental revenue was down 3.2% in the quarter this year v",1977,"Thanks, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone, from me as well. I'll try to add some more color to the key metrics that you've all seen starting with the revenue picture, rental revenue in particular. 
Rental revenue was down 3.2% in the quarter this year versus last year. That's about $42 million of revenue decline. Pieces of that really start with re-rent and ancillary. Those 2 combined were a little better than flat, so call it up $0.5 million, the net of those 2 components. 
The real driver in the change in the quarter was OER growth. Within that rate -- rental rate, down 1.8%. That was about a $21 million decline versus last year. Our volume increase of 0.2% accounted for about $3 million of improved revenue year-over-year. That's a plus, year-over-year.
Inflation. CapEx inflation cost us about $19 million -- a little more than $19 million versus last year. And then everything else, mix and all other components, aggregated to a decline of about $6 million year-over-year. So those are the key pieces of that $42 million rental revenue drop in the quarter and explains the 3.2% decline from last year.
One other operating measure within that year-over-year rental revenue performance was time utilization. 68.2% for the quarter was down 2.4 percentage points for the quarter. I'll point out that, that does include the impact of Canadian currency translation of the fleet on rent in the volume component.
Speaking of Canadian currency, the impact in the quarter for the currency was very significant. Canadian dollar cost us $22 million versus where we would have been had it stayed flat, so a pretty significant impact in revenue growth for the quarter.
And just one real quick note on the full year rental revenue. $4.949 billion, up 2.7% last year. I'll note that, that also included the impact of the currency headwind. Currency in the full year period cost us $78 million versus unchanged currency, so a very significant impact in the full year as well. In fact, if you excluded that, our growth rate would have been as high as 4.3% for full year rental revenue as opposed to the 2.7% that we reported.
On used equipment, we generated $157 million of used proceeds in the quarter. That's basically flat with the prior year, and the adjusted gross margin came in at 46.5%. That margin is down from the prior year by about 2%, but it's still very strong relative to the margin that we've achieved in our long history. And I think that reflects the fact that we've been very focused on driving as much of our used equipment sales activity through our retail channel as we could. 
In the quarter, retail accounted for 77% of the proceeds that we realized, and that's the highest share through the retail channel that we have achieved in a number of years, probably going back to before the last downturn. So we feel good about the overall used equipment result that we drove in the quarter and in the year, and look forward the used equipment market to continue with robust pricing and momentum here in the near term as well.
On the profitability front starting with adjusted EBITDA, it was $744 million in the quarter and came in at a margin of 48.9%. That's a $31 million decline or a 70-basis-point decline in the margin. The $31 million versus last year is made up as follows. Rental rates cost us about $20 million in EBITDA, whereas volume was a positive of about $2 million over the last year. CapEx inflation was about a $14 million reduction versus last year, and that used sales margin in dollar terms cost us about $5 million versus the last year. 
Our usual merit increase impact of about $6 million of reduction in EBITDA came through in the quarter. And then we had the biggest positive in the quarter year-over-year as we talked about throughout the year was our reduced incentive compensation accruals. That was a benefit of about $19 million.
Bad debt expense was about $2 million of headwind versus the prior year, and everything else aggregated to a $5 million headwind versus the prior year. So those are the key components of the $31 million of EBITDA change in the year. 
I will also point out that spread throughout a number of those lines was the impact of currency. It all aggregated to about $8 million of headwind from currency on a year-over-year basis to bring us to that full year -- or excuse me, that quarterly number.
For the full year, just real briefly, our adjusted EBITDA $2.832 billion was an increase of 4.2%, and that included an unfavorable currency impact of $29.3 million for the full year. So again, currency with a pretty significant impact.
On flow-through, adjusted EBITDA flow-through for the company finished the year at 86.4%. But I'll point out that, that includes the impact of the lower incentive accruals, that was a benefit, as well as the impact of the currency change year-over-year, which actually sounds bizarre, but it also was a benefit to flow-through as well just given the impacts -- the separate impacts on revenue and EBITDA. 
If you exclude both currency and incentive comp, the flow-through calculates out to 65% for the company, and that's broadly consistent with the roughly 60% that we guide to -- or guided to for 2015.
Moving to EPS. Adjusted EPS in the quarter was $2.19, and that was essentially flat with the prior year. I will point out, however, that on a year-over-year basis currency was at play, and in the adjusted EPS number it cost us about $0.02 in adjusted EPS. 
We also had a significant tax law change that was finalized in the fourth quarter in the state of Connecticut. Lots of detail around that, but when you net out the impact of that tax law change, it cost us about $0.06 versus last year. And then I'd also point to the mix shift between the U.S. and Canada.
Canada took a smaller share of our income in the fourth quarter, and actually indeed over the full year in 2015. So if that mix shift had not happened, we would have been better by $0.02 as well in the adjusted EPS number. So keep those 3 things in mind as you think about the quarter EPS.
Same with the full year, $8.02 adjusted EPS for the full year. That was an increase of 16% last year. But again, that was impacted by the currency impact, which in the full year was about $0.08 of headwind. Also the Connecticut tax law change, a portion of which was accounted for in the second quarter tax rate and the remainder was finalized in the fourth quarter. So if you aggregate those impacts in the year, that was about $0.12 of headwind. And then the shift in mix between U.S. and Canada cost us about $0.13 for the full year.
On free cash flow, great story here in 2015, $919 million, which compares to $557 million in 2014. Obviously, the lower rental CapEx was a big part of the positive impact year-over-year, but also the higher profitability contributed as well. Our cash taxes also had an impact. They were lower cash taxes paid, and favorable working capital effects were also at play during the year for that $900 million or $919 million of free cash flow.
Rental CapEx, as you've seen already, gross rental CapEx reduced in the quarter by $109 million, and that brought the full year total to $1.534 billion, somewhat below the $1.6 billion that we had been guiding to. And net rental CapEx was about the $1 billion number for the full year. 
On the liquidity front, $1.1 billion of liquidity at the end of the quarter. That included ABL capacity just over $870 million and cash on the balance sheet of about $108 million -- $180 million there. So we're well-positioned on liquidity as we typically are.
Just a quick note on our share repurchase programs. We completed, during the quarter, the $750 million repurchase program that we were operating under previously. We bought out the remaining $10 million of that program in the quarter. And then we also began purchases under the new billion-dollar authorization and in fact, completed $111 million against that authorization during the quarter as well. So a total of $122 million of repurchases in the quarter, and it put us on a path to executing the new billion-dollar program over the course of the next 18 months. We started it in November of last year, and so we expect to complete it by the end of April in 2017. 
As I pointed out in prior quarter, we do need to be mindful as we execute the program of our limitations on share repurchases, in particular, the restricted payments limitations in our debt covenants. However, when you aggregate those RP baskets available to us, plus the available cash that's held at the holding company, we have about $500 million worth of available capacity at the end of December in order to execute share repurchases. So we feel that we're well-positioned to be able to manage the program on a prudent, timely basis as we go through the year.
Return on invested capital in the year, just to touch that real briefly, was 8.8%, and that number was essentially flat compared to 2014.
Let me finish just by addressing our outlook really briefly. You've all seen the numbers that we put out. I'd just point out that as Michael mentioned, we have a somewhat wider range around the midpoint of our guidance for revenue EBITDA. And indeed, we've instituted a range for our view on rental rates. That wider range represents truly our view of the uncertainty that we're managing through right here and now, and we put the wider range there to give us a little bit more flexibility in responding to whatever the environment hands to us as we go throughout 2016. 
In particular, the range on rental rate, the minus 1% rental rate, top end of that range reflects our carryover. Our carryover from 2015 is essentially 1%. And so as we go through 2016, in order to achieve the 1% decline, the top end of the range would require us to have some slight increases during the peak season on a monthly sequential basis, which we think is a reasonable outlook. To get to the 2% would require essentially flat monthly sequentials during the peak season.
The time utilization improvement, 70 basis points, is also we believe very reasonable, given the approach that we're taking to our management of the CapEx spend. $1.2 billion of gross capital netting down to about $700 million after used proceeds we think, again, is a great way for us to approach the environment that we're managing through right now. If we do that, then we'll net out to that $900 million to $1 billion of free cash flow that you see in our guidance very comfortably.
So those are the key things that I wanted to offer as prepared comments. Before I open the -- ask the operator to open the call for Q&A, I'll just reiterate some of the comments that Michael made. Caution and flexibility are 2 of the key watchwords as we think about 2016, and we're going to make sure that we continue to evaluate the environment very carefully and make decisions about what to do in response in a very prudent way. I think you can count on that and certainly look forward to talking to all of you as we go forward throughout the year in managing the business.
So with that, I'll ask the operator to open the call for questions and answers. Operator?"

So if you think of the relative rate we've enjoyed in the past, Western Canada and anywhere where we're doing shale drilling was the highest relative rate.

So that would be the highest that you would see. But as you can imagine, losing your highest rate business in Texas or in North Dakota or in Western Pennsylvania, Ohio, right, up in the Marcellus shale, those were the ones that had the bigger declines.

I would say the concession part of the equation happened earlier in the year and mostly in upstream and Western Canada. There are not really any concessions outside of that.

And we certainly had to partner up and defend some strong relationships here and there in our National Account base, but I wouldn't point to it as a concession-driven situation. The fact of the 1-point carryover is really a function of what Bill stated what Q4 sequentials looked like. When you have 0.5 negative in both November and December, that made the full year carryover of a full point negative. So when you look at our range of 1 to 2, we'd have to be flat for the full year of '16 to achieve that 1.

And as we went to the fourth and first quarter, I've always told a lot of investors that that's -- this is going to be the challenge. This is the challenge that we have simply because we don't have oil like we've had over the last 5 years. So it's more seasonal trend, more non-res trend.

We still are targeting getting that run rate up to $100 million by the end of this year. So there are lots of other actions that we're going to continue to look at.

Welcome, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on today's call. As you saw last night, our first quarter results were shaped by a market that is fundamentally positive, while presenting some of double constraints. And",1243,"Thanks, operator. Welcome, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on today's call. As you saw last night, our first quarter results were shaped by a market that is fundamentally positive, while presenting some of double constraints. And we delivered $584 million of adjusted EBITDA on $1.3 billion of revenue. With lower rental rates, partially offset by higher volumes.
It was a solid performance, particularly in light of the challenges of oil and gas in Canada. In addition, we generated strong free cash flow of $627 million, and we're on track for free cash flow in the range of $900 million to $1 billion this year, in line with our outlook.
But behind the scenes are results showed some encouraging momentum. While utilization was down 10 basis points for the quarter versus the prior year, it was up year-over-year both February and March, driven by an increase in OEC on rent. The utilization in March increased by 100 basis points.
But taken in total, these numbers reflect a good quarter. The obvious disappointment was rate and that's a major focus for us. Impact, we believe that we can improve our rate management in this years are pretty environment even though there is still some uncertainty out there.
So I'll start by summarizing what we know then what we don't know by 2016. We know that the cycle appears to be in fact, volumes continue to be stong across a majority of our businesses. Secular penetrations still a tailwind and demand from nonresidential construction is on the rise. We also know that our industry added a lot of fleet last year. The new fleet combined with equipment coming out of Canada and the oil patch has created an oversupply in U.S. markets in the short term. However, our services are still earning premium pricing. Strategically, this is the right positioning for us in the long-term.
Canada was a major constraints, the drag from Canadian business was significant in the quarter. It accounted for almost a full point of rate decline, and we're managing through it by reducing fleet weak markets, particularly in western provinces. So we're pleased to see that Canadian government is taking the steps to turn the economy around. And importantly, for us, the current plan includes an investment of more than $120 billion in Canadian infrastructure over 10 years, with $11 billion to be allocated immediately.
So I'll start with what we don't know. We don't know when supply and demand will achieve equilibrium, no single rental company controls the timing but we do believe the market is moving in that direction. Independent data indicates that the growth in supply is now tracking below the growth in demand. Rouse reports that the absorption ratio hit an inflection point in March of last year. The timing makes sense when you think about the decline in oil and gas. That the negative ratio hit bottom in November and has been improving ever since. Last month, the ratio is close to parity and is the best we've seen in a year.
If rental companies continued to show discipline with CapEx in 2016, excess fleet will be absorbed more quickly by the growth in demand. Oil and gas is another question mark, and there's plenty of speculation but no certainty about the future of the sector. We don't think upstream veridical has hit bottom yet. And finally, a change in the relative strength in the American dollar would affect the results and report from Canada and that's the challenge to predict.
So it's been a series of puts and takes, but when you analyze all the various dynamics, it comes down in the sight of market growth. And the cycle is still very much on track. And in our view, it will be several years before it reaches its peak. It's also the consensus of industry analysts that supports our -- that view as well as our customers.
Nevertheless, our experience tells us the pricing will be very difficult to predict in the short term. And while rate is just 1 component of our outlook, it underlie some of our other metrics. Consequently, remain some adjustments to our guidance as above will discuss in a moment.
Before I move on, I want to emphasize that our focus continues to be managing our business for a significant long-term value. And as leader in our industry, we're not willing to be a bystander. We're taking every measure to ensure that we generate the highest possible returns on our capital over time, and that includes managing rates more effectively.
We're also being very diligent about taking costs out of the business. Our lineage is on track to reach an annual run rate of $100 million in savings by year-end, and we're committed to that target, and we see more room for improvement next year.
Let's talk about CapEx. In the first quarter, our capital spend was down about 2/3 versus last year, and gives us major flexibility in managing the balance of our CapEx spend in 2016. Last night, we are reaffirming our $1.2 billion CapEx target for the full year, and this is based on the substantial demand that we're seeing in many of our end markets.
So here's a quick snapshot of the quarter. Nonresidential construction in the U.S. increased year-over-year by more than 11% through February, which is the latest data available. It shows rentals across a wide range verticals. We saw year-over-year revenue increases in some of our largest end market such as infrastructure, chemicals and refinery. And we generated double-digit growth from verticals that are important targets for us. These include pharmaceuticals, entertainment and disaster recovery.
Our specialty rental operations are continuing to turn in strong performance. Rental revenues were up 8.7% year-over-year for specialty with same-store growth being more than 6%. And a combined revenues from Trench Safety and Power HVAC, our 2 largest specialty business increased by 12% year-over-year. Again, largely on same-store basis.
With our pump business, we're continuing to diversify our market base both in terms of verticals and geographies. In the first quarter, we opened cold-starts for pump in Tennessee and Minnesota.
Specialty is the area for our business that we're funding for growth again in 2016. We have a lot of investor interest in this operation so I want to take this opportunity to invite to our visit in May 5 in Tampa. We're taking investors to a co-located trends Power -- Pump and Power starting at note. It's good opportunity to spend some time in the field with several of our key leaders, including Paul MacDonald, who runs our Specialty business. Space is limited to these give Fred a call this week if you're interested in attending.
So in summary [indiscernible] realistic about 2016, we've looked at this year from every angle and the prospects for equipment rental in North America appears strong, demand is building and our fleet on rent is keeping pace. our folks continues to be on many aspects of our business that are within our control. These include asset management, our cost structure and cash generation. And you will see us flex all these areas as conditions warrant, while strategically will stay the course in a are that offer significant opportunities that deliver for our shareholders.
And so with that, I'll hand it over to Bill who will go over the results with you. So Bill, over to you."
36005,330266285,960829,"United Rentals, Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2016",2016-04-21,"Earnings Calls","United Rentals, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mike, and good morning to everyone. It's usual, I'll add some color to the numbers that you've already seen or heard from Mike just now. Starting with the rental revenue, $1,117,000,000 of rental revenue in the quarter, that was down 7/10 of a per",1813,"Thanks, Mike, and good morning to everyone. It's usual, I'll add some color to the numbers that you've already seen or heard from Mike just now. Starting with the rental revenue, $1,117,000,000 of rental revenue in the quarter, that was down 7/10 of a percent or $8 million year-over-year and the components are as follows: Re-rent and ancillary revenues, net out to an increase year-over-year of $2 million. Ancillary was up a little bit more, up $4 million, offset by re-rent in coming down slightly. Within owned equipment revenue, the increase in total -- excuse me, that decrease totaled about $10 million with the rate accounting for about $28 million of decline on that 2.8% year-over-year rate decline that we reported, and that was almost exactly offset by volume being up pretty strongly. $28 million of volume contribution on the 2.7% increase in the OEC on rent that we reported. Many to get that as the replacement CapEx inflation for the quarter, that was about $20 million of year-over-year decline, reflecting about 2% impact from the inflation of the CapEx that we replaced.
Mix and other was a solid positive contributor this quarter, plus $10 million versus last year, and that very largely reflects the fact that there was an extra day in the recording period this year. So net all that together was $10 million of decline in OER, that said. And that though both the $8 million of decline that we saw overall.
Within that revenue decline, I'll point out that we did have an attached from the Canadian dollar. It's weaker this year by about $10 million worth of impacts. So if you exclude the Canadian dollar currency impact, we actually would have reported an increase in our rental revenue of 0.3%.
While on Canada, and also point out that, that's just the Canadian dollar impact. If you just what the U.S.-only performance in rental revenue, our U.S. on the rental revenue was actually up 3% in the quarter, that's up 3% when you exclude Canada.
Time utilization performance in the quarter actually trended very nicely us as you went through each month. The overall quarter as you saw was down 10 basis points but within that, we had a decline in January of about 150 basis points and then February, the utilization flips to a positive 30 basis points, on its way to the 100 basis point year-over-year improvement that we reported in the earnings release. So but we're on a pretty good positive trend in utilization in the quarter.
Moving briefly to used equipment sales, $115 million of proceeds from used this quarter was essentially flat with last year. The margin of 48.7% was down, just over 2 basis points. And that's, primarily driven by some of the discounting that we've done to move a volume in the quarter at a little bit higher pace than the we might otherwise have gone. When you look at the margin overall, 48.7% adjusted gross margin, it's still a very high level of margin in absolute terms versus where margins have been historically.
Within that used equipment sales result, we sold about $60 million -- excuse me, 60% of our revenue through the retail channel consistent with where we were in the first quarter and consistent with what we have been trying to do to focus much of our sales effort through retail channel. So a solid use result in the quarter to get us started for the year.
On profitability, just real briefly on adjusted EBITDA, $584 million, was down $18 million or 3% versus last year, and the margin was 44.6%, that was down 120 basis points. The key components of that rate impact that we called out earlier cost us about $27 million compared to last year but that was offset by the volume impact, which was a positive $18 million in the quarter.
Fleet inflation was a headwind of about $12 million so the net effect of all of those was really, driven by the rate result and inflation.
The ancillary revenue impact that I pointed out earlier was a benefit of about $2 million in the quarter. That offsets the used equipment sales result, which was a negative $2 million in the quarter compared to last year. Then we had our normal merit increase impact of about  $6 million in the quarter and the mix and other benefits, primarily driven by that extra day was a positive 9 in the quarter. So all of that next to that $18 million year-over-year decline that we called out.
Sprinkled throughout that decline was about $3 million worth of headwind from the impact of currency that occurs in various lines here. So that $3 million was reflecting that $10 million decline of revenue that I talked about from currency.
Very briefly on adjusted EPS. We delivered $1.40 of EPS in the quarter, and that was $0.06 better than last year. And again, that overcame the impact of Canadian currency, which was about a $0.02 headwind compared to last year in the quarter. So a solid EPS result for us during the quarter as well.
On free cash flow, a god quarter there, $627 million in the first quarter, that's up $177 million versus last year. The key drivers there, obviously, the lower CapEx spend in the quarter was a benefit of about $223 million year-over-year. We also had lower interest expense of about $20 million. And offsetting those 2 benefits were really timing of working capital that cost us about $67 million versus last year and obviously, the adjusted EBITDA result decline of $18 million. So those are the key components of that $177 million improvement. I would caution against the running to far with the overall results of [ph] 6 27  in the quarter as you think about the full year free cash flow, the timing in some of the subsequent quarters will weigh that down. Still, we expect to deliver between $900 million and $1 billion worth of free cash flow over the full year.
On rental CapEx, you saw the $100 million in the quarter, down $223 million versus last year, and that's consistent with the approach that we have taken rental CapEx this year, which was to give ourselves as much flexibility as we can early the year and then decide as we go through the year where it's appropriate to spend. So we still are expecting to spend $1.2 billion across the entire quarter for rental CapEx or -- excuse me, across the entire year for rental CapEx. The quarters will vary this year as we respond to demand.
On liquidity, real briefly. We spent -- we finished the year at $1.4 billion of liquidity, just over $1.4 billion, and That reflected about $1.2 billion in ABL capacity and another $200 million in cash on the balance sheet.
Let me just touch on the share repurchase program briefly. We purchased in the quarter, $153 million worth of shares, that resulted in about $2.7 million -- 2.7 million shares coming back to us. And if you look at the entire current authorization, the $1 billion authorization we're operating under, it -- we spent about $264 million through the end of the quarter against that program. So we're on the pace that we've talked about. As we think about the share repurchase program, our intention right now is to continue the way that we've said, steady purchases toward about $675 million or so worth of repurchases this year. And they'll be fairly steady throughout the month.
I've mentioned before the restricted payments limitations that we had to make sure that we operate within from our debt covenants. As we finished the quarter, we had about $556 million worth of available capacity, either from our baskets in the debt or from cash capacity at the hauling company. So we're very well-positioned to continue the share repurchase program without concern about those limitations slowing us down.
ROIC for the quarter was 8.7%, that was down 30 basis points from the prior year and clearly the folks the impact of the weaker rate environment after netting out be somewhat stronger demand environment and higher utilization.
Let me finish up with just a real brief comment on the updated outlook. You saw the numbers with rental -- excuse me, total revenue coming down to a range of $5.6 billion to $5.8 billion, and adjusted EBITDA coming down to a range of $2.650 billion to $2.750 billion. Essentially, we adjusted both ranges down to reflect the renewed outlook on rate. It's impacted about $100 million, and so that was at midpoint, it was about $100 million. So that was the motivation for revising those components of the guidance downward. Our new view of rate is now for a decline of 3% to 4% over the course of the year and really, that reflects the experience that we've had earlier in the year. We can talk about the sequential rate performance that we had in the first 3 months of the year, but it's fair to say that those came in weaker than we expected and the new rate guidance for the full year essentially reflects that decline.
Our utilization is going the other way, we've had a stronger start through the year on utilization and on fleet on rent. And so we now expect our utilization for the year to be up about 100 basis points, that will bring us there at around 68.3% for the full year.
No change to the CapEx plan as we've mentioned before, $1.2 billion is still the gross spend that we're targeting, which should net down to about $700 million after used sales proceeds. But again, no change to the free cash flow outlook between $900 million and $1 billion.
Final comment is just with regards to April. We've got a lot of questions about how April has started so we figured we'd offer up just a little bit more thought about that. On the rate front, it's fair to say that April had started slightly better than what we saw sequentially in March. We call April so far, month-to-date at something like a sequential minus [ph] $0.05 on utilization. It's also slightly better than where we finished out. As of yesterday, our utilization against last year was up 130 basis points. So we think it's important to understand how the early part of the year plays out and as we think about the remainder of the year, we're optimistic, optimistic about our ability to put the fleet on rent about our ability to start realizing rate more effectively than we had. And as always, we're going to drive as hard as we can toward all of those objectives.
So with that, I'll ask the operator to open the call for questions and answers. Operator?"

So we're not here to say that there are going to be sequential declines every month going forward. We're saying that we want to make sure that we understand how our business looks if you don't get a significant turnaround in the short term.

But on Slide 18, just trying to think about the midpoint of your CapEx is basically net CapEx goes up, 27%, 28%. And when I think about the way you're laying out the rest of the year, you actually exit the fourth quarter with rental rates down over 3%. But in that slide, you're saying you think will be modest rate growth. So I'm just trying to think through -- if I'm going to raise CapEx that much in '17, I'm exiting '16 with a lot of negative carryover underrate. Obviously, I guess, the answer you're just bullish on '17. I'm just trying to how that makes sense to start the year. That negative run rate, you're going to raise net CapEx midpoint by 28%, and we think the full year rate in '17 is going to be positive."

If we finished the year at the same pace as last year on this a sequential, right, that approximately 3.5% set of sequents. The carryover for '17 in that scenario would be something like 1 point negative, right? So we look at that, and we say, that's not insurmountable to overcome during the course of 2017 and get back to positive rate throughout the course of next year. So that's how we think about, sort of, what we have to overcome in order to get to modest rate increase next year. As for the CapEx, we gave a range, right? We said it could be $1.2 billion or $1.7 billion, I think, it was. And we're using that as a statement that we're going to be very focused on preserving flexibility in responding to the market, more so than just saying, hey, we are going to spend $1 billion, that was $1.6 billion at the top end of that range. We're going to spend $1.6 billion, right here and now in 2017, come hell or high water, right? So we're going to be responsive, we're going to be very mindful of how rates do behave as we finish up 2016, and that will inform our thought about that rates are going to look like in '17 and inform our thoughts about what CapEx plans should be as a result."

So that economic we expect to play out as a year goes on, and that's why we are encouraged by our ability to improve our rate realization. When it gets to actual sequential increases, we'll depend on things that are outside of our control, including the overall level of industry fleets and used level of utilization of that fleet in the industry does way we spend so much time talking about how industry fleet is being absorbed. You used the word confidence, it's a matter of confidence to say that you're going to start moving sequential rate higher several months down the road. Our experience recently has made us to be mindful of getting too aggressive and far out ahead of where the market actually is. And so that's way we put the rate forecast out there that we did. The key for us is to make sure that our management processes are focused on realizing as much rate as we can in the marketplace. And if we do that and if the industry absorbs more of for the fleet that's out there and avoids bringing in a lot of excess fleet to come out of the problem from  here. Then the rate, we realize it's going to be better than what we've got in the guidance range. But it's hard to put that down in black and white in the forecast as we sit right here."

Welcome, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on today's call. As you saw last night, our first quarter results were shaped by a market that is fundamentally positive, while presenting some of notable constraints. And",1253,"Thanks, operator. Welcome, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on today's call. As you saw last night, our first quarter results were shaped by a market that is fundamentally positive, while presenting some of notable constraints. And we delivered $584 million of adjusted EBITDA on $1.3 billion of revenue, with lower rental rates partially offset by higher volumes.
It was a solid performance, particularly in light of the challenges of oil and gas in Canada. In addition, we generated strong free cash flow of $627 million, and we're on track for free cash flow in the range of $900 million to $1 billion this year, in line with our outlook.
But behind the scenes, our results showed some encouraging momentum. While utilization was down 10 basis points for the quarter versus the prior year, it was up year-over-year, both February and March, driven by increase in OEC on rent. The utilization in March increased by 100 basis points.
But taken in total, these numbers reflect a good quarter. The obvious disappointment was rate, and that's a major focus for us. In fact, we believe that we can improve our rate management in this year's operating environment even though there's still some uncertainty out there.
So I'll start by summarizing what we know then what we don't know about 2016. We know that the cycle appears to be intact, volumes continue to be strong across a majority of our businesses. Secular penetration is still a tailwind and demand from nonresidential construction is on the rise. We also know that our industry added a lot of fleet last year. The new fleet combined with equipment coming out of Canada and the oil patch has created an oversupply in U.S. markets in the short term. However, our services are still earning premium pricing. Strategically, this is the right positioning for us in the long term.
Canada was a major constraint. The drag from our Canadian business was significant in the quarter. It accounted for almost a full point of rate decline, and we're managing through it by reducing fleet weak markets, particularly in western provinces. So we're pleased to see that Canadian government is taking steps to turn the economy around. And importantly, for us, the current plan includes an investment of more than $120 billion in Canadian infrastructure over 10 years, with $11 billion to be allocated immediately.
So I'll start with what we don't know. We don't know when supply and demand will achieve equilibrium. No single rental company controls that timing, but we do believe the market is moving in that direction. Independent data indicates that the growth in supply is now tracking below the growth in demand. Rouse reports that the absorption ratio hit an inflection point in March of last year. The timing makes sense when you think about the decline in oil and gas. Then the negative ratio hit bottom in November and has been improving ever since. Last month, the ratio was close to parity and is the best it's been seen -- we've seen in a year.
If rental companies continue to show discipline with CapEx in 2016, excess fleet will be absorbed more quickly by the growth in demand. Oil and gas is another question mark, and there's plenty of speculation but no certainty about the future of the sector. We don't think upstream vertical has hit bottom yet. And finally, a change in the relative strength of the American dollar would affect the results we report from Canada, and that's a challenge to predict.
So it's been a series of puts and takes, but when you analyze all the various dynamics, it comes down to the size of market growth. And the cycle is still very much on track. And in our view, it will be several years before it reaches its peak. It's also the consensus of industry analysts that supports our -- supports that view as well as our customers.
Nevertheless, our experience tells us the pricing will be very difficult to predict in the short term. And while rate is just one component of our outlook, it underlies some of our other metrics. Consequently, we made some adjustments to our guidance as Bill will discuss in a moment.
Before I move on, I want to emphasize that our focus continues to be managing our business for significant long-term value. And as a leader in our industry, we're not willing to be a bystander. We're taking every measure to ensure that we generate the highest possible returns on our capital over time, and that includes managing rates more effectively.
We're also being very diligent about taking costs out of the business. Our lean initiative is on track to reach an annual run rate of $100 million in savings by year-end, and we're committed to that target, and we see more room for improvement next year.
Now let's talk about CapEx. In the first quarter, our capital spend was down by 2/3 versus last year, and it gives us major flexibility in managing the balance of our CapEx spend in 2016. Last night, we reaffirmed our $1.2 billion CapEx target for the full year, and this is based on the substantial demand that we're seeing in many of our end markets.
So here's a quick snapshot of the quarter. Nonresidential construction in U.S. increased year-over-year by more than 11% through February, which is the latest data available. It shows rentals across a wide range verticals. We saw year-over-year revenue increases in some of our largest end markets such as infrastructure, chemicals and refinery. And we generated double-digit growth from verticals that are important targets for us. These include pharmaceuticals, entertainment and disaster recovery.
Our specialty rental operations continue to turn in strong performance. Rental revenues were up 8.7% year-over-year for specialty with same-store growth being more than 6%. And the combined rental revenues from Trench Safety and Power HVAC, our 2 largest specialty businesses, increased by 12% year-over-year, again, largely on same-store basis.
With our pump business, we're continuing to diversify our market base both in terms of verticals and geographies. In the first quarter, we opened cold-starts for pump in Tennessee and Minnesota.
Specialty is the area of our business that we're funding for growth again in 2016. We have a lot of investor interest in these operations. So I want to take this opportunity to invite you to a branch visit on May 5 in Tampa. We're taking investors to a co-located Trench Power -- Pump and Power branch starting at noon. It's a good opportunity to spend some time in the field with several of our key leaders, including Paul McDonnell, who runs the Specialty business. Space is limited, so please give Fred a call this week if you're interested in attending.
So in [indiscernible] and realistic about 2016. We've looked at this year from every angle, and the prospects for equipment rental in North America appears strong. Demand is building, and our fleet on rent is keeping pace. Our focus continues to be on many aspects of our business that are within our control. These include asset management, our cost structure and cash generation. And you will see us flex all these areas as conditions warrant, while strategically we'll stay the course in a year to offer significant opportunities to deliver for our shareholders.
And so with that, I'll hand it over to Bill who will go over the results with you. So Bill, over to you."

As usual, I'll add some color to the numbers that you've already seen or heard from Mike just now. Starting with rental revenue, $1,117,000,000 of rental revenue in the quarter. That was down 7/10 of a percent o",1794,"Thanks, Mike, and good morning to everyone. As usual, I'll add some color to the numbers that you've already seen or heard from Mike just now. Starting with rental revenue, $1,117,000,000 of rental revenue in the quarter. That was down 7/10 of a percent or $8 million year-over-year, and the components are as follows: Re-rent and ancillary revenues, netted out to an increase year-over-year of $2 million. Ancillary was up a little bit more, up $4 million, offset by re-rent coming down slightly. Within owned equipment revenue, the increase totaled -- excuse me, the decrease totaled about $10 million with rate accounting for about $28 million of decline on that 2.8% year-over-year rate decline that we reported, and that was almost exactly offset by volume being up pretty strongly. $28 million of volume contribution on the 2.7% increase in OEC on rent that we reported. Netting against that is the replacement CapEx inflation for the quarter. That was about $20 million of year-over-year decline, reflecting about 2% impact from the inflation of the CapEx that we replaced.
Mix and other was a solid positive contributor this quarter, plus $10 million versus last year, and that very largely reflects the fact that there was an extra day in the reporting period this year. So net all that together was $10 million of decline in OER, as I said, and that totals the $8 million of decline that we saw overall.
Within that revenue decline, I'll point out that we did have an impact from the Canadian dollar. It's weaker this year by about $10 million worth of rental impacts. So if you excluded that Canadian dollar currency impact, we actually would have reported an increase in our rental revenue of 0.3%.
While on Canada, I'd also point out that, that's just the Canadian dollar impact. If you just look at the U.S.-only performance in rental revenue, our U.S.-only rental revenue was actually up 3% in the quarter, that's up 3% when you exclude Canada.
Time utilization performance in the quarter actually trended very nicely as you went through each month. The overall quarter, as you saw, was down 10 basis points but within that, we had a decline in January of about 150 basis points and then February, the utilization flipped to a positive 30 basis points, on its way to the 100 basis point year-over-year improvement that we reported in the earnings release. So we're on a pretty good positive trend in utilization in the quarter.
Moving briefly to used equipment sales, $115 million of proceeds from used this quarter was essentially flat with last year. The margin of 48.7% down, just over 2 basis points. And that's primarily driven by some of the discounting that we've done to move volume in the quarter at a little bit higher pace than we might otherwise have done. When you look at the margin overall, 48.7% adjusted gross margin, it's still a very high level of margin in absolute terms versus where margins have been historically.
Within that used equipment sales result, we sold about $60 million -- excuse me, 60% of our revenue through the retail channel consistent with where we were in the first quarter and consistent with what we've been trying to do to focus much of our sales effort through the retail channel. So a solid used result in the quarter to get us started for the year.
On profitability, just real briefly on adjusted EBITDA, $584 million, was down $18 million or 3% versus last year, and the margin was 44.6%, that was down 120 basis points. The key components of that rate impact that we called out earlier cost us about $27 million compared to last year, but that was offset by the volume impact, which was a positive $18 million in the quarter.
Fleet inflation was a headwind of about $12 million. So the net effect of all of those was really driven by the rate result and inflation.
The ancillary revenue impact that I pointed out earlier was a benefit of about $2 million in the quarter. That offsets the used equipment sales result, which was a negative $2 million in the quarter compared to last year. Then we had our normal merit increase impact of about $6 million in the quarter and the mix and other benefit, primarily driven by that extra day, was a positive 9 in the quarter. So all of that nets to the $18 million year-over-year decline that we called out.
Sprinkled throughout that decline was about $3 million worth of headwind from the impact of currency that occurs in various lines here. So that $3 million was reflecting that $10 million decline in revenue that I talked about from currency.
Very briefly on adjusted EPS. We delivered $1.40 of EPS in the quarter, and that was $0.06 better than last year. And again, that overcame the impact of Canadian currency, which was about a $0.02 headwind compared to last year in the quarter. So a solid EPS result for us during the quarter as well.
On free cash flow, a good quarter there, $627 million in the first quarter, that's up $177 million versus last year. The key drivers there, obviously, the lower CapEx spend in the quarter was a benefit of about $223 million year-over-year. We also had lower interest expense of about $20 million. And offsetting those 2 benefits were really timing of working capital that cost us about $67 million versus last year and obviously, the adjusted EBITDA result decline of $18 million. So those are the key components of that $177 million improvement. I would caution against running too far with the overall result of $627 million in the quarter as you think about the full year free cash flow, the timing and some of the subsequent quarters will weigh that down. Still, we expect to deliver between $900 million and $1 billion worth of free cash flow over the full year.
On rental CapEx, you saw the $100 million in the quarter, down $223 million versus last year, and that's consistent with the approach that we've taken to rental CapEx this year, which was to give ourselves as much flexibility as we can early in the year and then decide as we go through the year, where it's appropriate to spend. So we still are expecting to spend $1.2 billion across the entire quarter for rental CapEx or -- excuse me, across the entire year for rental CapEx. The quarters will vary this year as we respond to demand.
On liquidity, real briefly. We spent -- we finished the quarter at $1.4 billion of liquidity, just over $1.4 billion, and that reflected about $1.2 billion in ABL capacity and another $200 million in cash on the balance sheet.
Let me just touch on the share repurchase program briefly. We purchased in the quarter, $153 million worth of shares, That resulted in about 2.7 million shares coming back to us. And if you look at the entire current authorization, the $1 billion authorization we're operating under, it -- we spent about $264 million through the end of the quarter against that program. So we're on the pace that we've talked about. As we think about the share repurchase program, our intention right now is to continue the way that we've said, steady purchases toward about $675 million or so worth of repurchases this year. And they'll be fairly steady throughout the month.
I've mentioned before the restricted payments limitations that we have to make sure we operate within from our debt covenants. As we finished the quarter, we had about $556 million worth of available capacity, either from RP baskets in the debt or from cash capacity at the holding company. So we're very well positioned to continue the share repurchase program without concern about those limitations slowing us down.
ROIC for the quarter was 8.7%. That was down 30 basis points from the prior year and clearly reflects the impact of the weaker rate environment after netting out the somewhat stronger demand environment and higher utilization.
Let me finish up with just a real brief comment on the updated outlook. You saw the numbers with rental -- excuse me, total revenue coming down to a range of $5.6 billion to $5.8 billion, and adjusted EBITDA coming down to a range of $2,650,000,000 to $2,750,000,000. Essentially, we adjusted both ranges down to reflect the renewed outlook on rate. It's impacted about $100 million, and so that was -- at midpoint, it was about $100 million. So that was the motivation for revising those components of the guidance downward. Our new view of rate is now for a decline of 3% to 4% over the course of the year and really, that reflects the experience that we've had early in the year. We can talk about the sequential rate performance that we had in the first 3 months of the year, but it's fair to say that those came in weaker than we expected and the new rate guidance for the full year essentially reflects that decline.
Our utilization is going the other way. We've had a stronger start to the year on utilization and on fleet on rent. And so we now expect our utilization for the year to be up about 100 basis points. That will bring us to in and around 68.3% for the full year.
No change to the CapEx plan as we've mentioned before. $1.2 billion is still the gross spend that we're targeting, which should net down to about $700 million after used sales proceeds. And again, no change to the free cash flow outlook, between $900 million and $1 billion.
Final comment is just regards April. We've got a lot of questions about how April has started. So we figured we'd offer up just a little bit more thought about that. On the rate front, it's fair to say that April has started slightly better than what we saw sequentially in March. We call April so far month-to-date at something like a sequential minus 5/10 [ph]. On utilization, it's also slightly better than where we finished out. As of yesterday, our utilization against last year was up 130 basis points. So we think it's important to understand how the early part of the year plays out, and as we think about the remainder of the year, we're optimistic, optimistic about our ability to put fleet on rent, about our ability to start realizing rate more effectively than we have. And as always, we're going to drive as hard as we can toward all of those objectives.
So with that, I'll ask the operator to open the call for questions and answers. Operator?"

So we're not here saying that there are going to be sequential declines every month going forward. We're saying that we want to make sure that we understand how our business looks if you don't get a significant turnaround in the short term.

I would say that the 2 are connected, but the strategy of trying to drive both rate improvement and time improvement has not changed. Our time utilization doing better than we had originally thought was mostly due to demand. And even overcoming some of the headwinds that Mike talked to in his prepared comments in Canada in oil and gas, we have some real strong end markets. I'd say 70% of our regions, and those are the ones that aren't touched by oil and gas, and you could think about it geographically as on the coast, have robust demand. And that's what we're taking advantage of. As far as what's that balance between rate, that's more of a supply dynamic. And we put a -- we added a slide on Slide 5 of our investor deck where you start to see where the absorption of the fleet coming in has been over the past year and where we're starting to see some improvement there.

I think it's important to recognize that obviously, we don't control pricing in the marketplace. We respond to a significant extent but at higher levels of utilization, we have more room to select those rental transactions that are most appealing from rate. And it gives people some confidence in being able to quote rates that are a little bit higher. So that dynamic we expect to play out as the year goes on, and that's why we are encouraged by our ability to improve our rate realization. When it gets to absolute sequential increases, we'll depend on things that are outside of our control, including the overall level of industry fleet and the level of utilization of that fleet in the industry. That's why we spend so much time talking about how industry fleet is being absorbed. You used the word confidence. It's a matter of confidence to say that you're going to start moving sequential rate higher several months down the road. Our experience recently has made us to be mindful of getting too aggressive and far out ahead of where the market actually is. And so that's way we put the rate forecast out there that we did. The key for us is to make sure that our management processes are focused on realizing as much rate as we can in the marketplace. And if we do that and if the industry absorbs more of our fleet that's out there and avoids bringing in a lot of excess fleet to compound the problem from here, then the rate we realize is going to be better than what we've got in that guidance range. But it's hard to put that down in black and white in a forecast as we sit right here."

Welcome, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on today's call. As you saw last night, our first quarter results were shaped by a market that is fundamentally positive, while presenting some of notable constraints. And",1263,"Thanks, operator. Welcome, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on today's call. As you saw last night, our first quarter results were shaped by a market that is fundamentally positive, while presenting some of notable constraints. And we delivered $584 million of adjusted EBITDA on $1.3 billion of revenue, with lower rental rates partially offset by higher volumes.
It was a solid performance, particularly in light of the challenges of oil and gas in Canada. In addition, we generated strong free cash flow of $627 million, and we're on track for free cash flow in the range of $900 million to $1 billion this year, in line with our outlook.
But behind the scenes, our results showed some encouraging momentum. While utilization was down 10 basis points for the quarter versus the prior year, it was up year-over-year, both February and March, driven by an increase in OEC on rent. The utilization in March increased by 100 basis points.
But taken in total, these numbers reflect a good quarter. The obvious disappointment was rate, and that's a major focus for us. In fact, we believe that we can improve our rate management in this year's operating environment even though there's still some uncertainty out there.
So I'll start by summarizing what we know, then what we don't know about 2016. We know that the cycle appears to be intact, volumes continue to be strong across a majority of our businesses. Secular penetration is still a tailwind and demand from nonresidential construction is on the rise. We also know that our industry added a lot of fleet last year. The new fleet combined with equipment coming out of Canada and the oil patch has created an oversupply in U.S. markets in the short term. However, our services are still earning premium pricing. Strategically, this is the right positioning for us in the long term.
Canada was a major constraint. The drag from our Canadian business was significant in the quarter. It accounted for almost a full point of rate decline, and we're managing through it by reducing fleet in weak markets, particularly in western provinces. So we're pleased to see that the Canadian government is taking steps to turn the economy around. And importantly, for us, the current plan includes an investment of more than $120 billion in Canadian infrastructure over 10 years, with $11 billion to be allocated immediately.
So let's talk about what we don't know. We don't know when supply and demand will achieve equilibrium. No single rental company controls that timing, but we do believe the market is moving in that direction. Independent data indicates that the growth in supply is now tracking below the growth in demand. Rouse reports that their absorption ratio hit an inflection point in March of last year. The timing makes sense when you think about the decline in oil and gas. Then the negative ratio hit bottom in November and has been improving ever since. Last month, the ratio was close to parity and it's the best it's been seen -- we've seen in a year.
If rental companies continue to show discipline with CapEx in 2016, excess fleet will be absorbed more quickly by the growth in demand. Oil and gas is another question mark, and there's plenty of speculation but no certainty about the future of the sector. We don't think upstream vertical has hit bottom yet. And finally, a change in the relative strength of the American dollar would affect the results we report from Canada, and that's a challenge to predict.
So it's been a series of puts and takes, but when you analyze all the various dynamics, it comes down on the side of market growth. And the cycle is still very much on track. And in our view, it will be several years before it reaches its peak. It's also the consensus of industry analysts that supports our -- supports that view as well as our customers.
Nevertheless, our experience tells us that pricing will be very difficult to predict in the short term. And while rate is just one component of our outlook, it underlies some of our other metrics. Consequently, we made some adjustments to our guidance as Bill will discuss in a moment.
Before I move on, I wanted to emphasize that our focus continues to be on managing our business for significant long-term value. And as a leader in our industry, we're not willing to be a bystander. We're taking every measure to ensure that we generate the highest possible returns on our capital over time, and that includes managing rates more effectively.
We're also being very diligent about taking cost out of the business. Our lean initiative is on track to reach an annual run rate of $100 million in savings by year-end, and we're committed to that target, and we see more room for improvement next year.
Now let's talk about CapEx. In the first quarter, our capital spend was down by 2/3 versus last year, and it gives us major flexibility in managing the balance of our CapEx spend in 2016. Last night, we reaffirmed our $1.2 billion CapEx target for the full year, and this is based on the substantial demand that we're seeing in many of our end markets.
So here's a quick snapshot of the quarter. Nonresidential construction in U.S. increased year-over-year by more than 11% through February, which is the latest data available. It drove up equipment rentals across our wide range verticals. We saw year-over-year revenue increases in some of our largest end markets such as infrastructure, chemicals and refinery. And we generated double-digit growth from verticals that are important targets for us. These include pharmaceuticals, entertainment and disaster recovery.
Our specialty rental operations are continuing to turn in a strong performance. Rental revenues were up 8.7% year-over-year for specialty with same-store growth being more than 6%. And the combined rental revenues from Trench Safety and Power HVAC, our 2 largest specialty businesses, increased by 12% year-over-year, again, largely on a same-store basis.
With our pump business, we're continuing to diversify our market base both in terms of verticals and geographies. In the first quarter, we opened cold-starts for pump in Tennessee and Minnesota.
Specialty is the area of our business that we're funding for growth again in 2016. We have a lot of investor interest in these operations. So I want to take this opportunity to invite you to our branch visit on May 5 in Tampa. We're taking investors to a co-located Trench Power -- Pump and Power branch starting at noon. It's a good opportunity to spend some time in the field with several of our key leaders, including Paul McDonnell, who runs our Specialty business. Space is limited, so please give Fred a call this week if you're interested in attending.
So in [indiscernible] and realistic about 2016. We've looked at this year from every angle, and the prospects for equipment rental in North America appear strong. Demand is building, and our fleet on rent is keeping pace. And our focus continues to be on many aspects of our business that are within our control. These include asset management, our cost structure and cash generation. And you will see us flex all these areas as conditions warrant, while strategically we'll stay the course in a year that offers significant opportunities to deliver for our shareholders.
And so with that, I'll hand it over to Bill who will go over the results with you. So Bill, over to you."
36005,330266285,961343,"United Rentals, Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2016",2016-04-21,"Earnings Calls","United Rentals, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mike, and good morning to everyone. As usual, I'll add some color to the numbers that you've already seen or heard from Mike just now. Starting with rental revenue, $1,117,000,000 of rental revenue in the quarter. That was down 7/10 of a percent o",1802,"Thanks, Mike, and good morning to everyone. As usual, I'll add some color to the numbers that you've already seen or heard from Mike just now. Starting with rental revenue, $1,117,000,000 of rental revenue in the quarter. That was down 7/10 of a percent or $8 million year-over-year, and the components are as follows: Re-rent and ancillary revenues netted out to an increase year-over-year of $2 million. Ancillary was up a little bit more, up $4 million, offset by re-rent coming down slightly. Within owned equipment revenue, the increase totaled -- excuse me, the decrease totaled about $10 million with rate accounting for about $28 million of decline on that 2.8% year-over-year rate decline that we reported, and that was almost exactly offset by volume being up pretty strongly. $28 million of volume contribution on the 2.7% increase in OEC on rent that we recorded [ph]. Netting against that is the replacement CapEx inflation for the quarter. That was about $20 million of year-over-year decline, reflecting about 2% impact from the inflation of the CapEx that we replaced.
Mix and other was a solid positive contributor this quarter, plus $10 million versus last year, and that very largely reflects the fact that there was an extra day in the reporting period this year. So net all that together was $10 million of decline in OER, as I said, and that totals the $8 million of decline that we saw overall.
Within that revenue decline, I'll point out that we did have an impact from the Canadian dollar. It's weaker this year by about $10 million worth of rental impact. So if you excluded that Canadian dollar currency impact, we actually would have reported an increase in our rental revenue of 0.3%.
While on Canada, I'd also point out that, that's just the Canadian dollar impact. If you just looked at the U.S.-only performance in rental revenue, our U.S.-only rental revenue was actually up 3% in the quarter, that's up 3% when you exclude Canada.
Time utilization performance in the quarter actually trended very nicely as you went through each month. The overall quarter, as you saw, was down 10 basis points but within that, we had a decline in January of about 150 basis points and then February, the utilization flipped to a positive 30 basis points, on its way to the 100 basis point year-over-year improvement that we reported in the earnings release. So we're on a pretty good positive trend in utilization in the quarter.
Moving briefly to used equipment sales, $115 million of proceeds from used this quarter was essentially flat with last year. The margin of 48.7% was down just over 2 basis points. And that's primarily driven by some of the discounting that we've done to move volume in the quarter at a little bit higher pace than we might otherwise have done. When you look at the margin overall, 48.7% adjusted gross margin is still a very high level of margin in absolute terms versus where margins have been historically.
Within that used equipment sales result, we sold about $60 million -- excuse me, 60% of our revenue through the retail channel consistent with where we were in the first quarter and consistent with what we've been trying to do to focus much of our sales effort through the retail channel. So a solid used result in the quarter to get us started for the year.
On profitability, just real briefly on adjusted EBITDA, $584 million, it was down $18 million or 3% versus last year and the margin was 44.6%, that was down 120 basis points. The key components of that rate impact that we called out earlier cost us about $27 million compared to last year, but that was offset by the volume impact, which was a positive $18 million in the quarter.
Fleet inflation was a headwind of about $12 million. So the net effect of all of those was really driven by the rate result and inflation.
The ancillary revenue impact that I pointed out earlier was a benefit of about $2 million in the quarter. That offsets the used equipment sales result, which was a negative $2 million in the quarter compared to last year. Then we had our normal merit increase impact of about $6 million in the quarter and the mix and other benefit, primarily driven by that extra day, was a positive $9 million [ph] in the quarter. So all of that nets to the $18 million year-over-year decline that we called out.
Sprinkled throughout that decline was about $3 million worth of headwind from the impact of currency that occurs in various lines here. So that $3 million was reflecting that $10 million decline in revenue that I talked about from currency.
Very briefly on adjusted EPS. We delivered $1.40 of EPS in the quarter, and that was $0.06 better than last year. And again, that overcame the impact of Canadian currency, which was about a $0.02 headwind compared to last year in the quarter. So a solid EPS result for us during the quarter as well.
On free cash flow, a good quarter there, $627 million in the first quarter, that's up $177 million versus last year. The key drivers there, obviously, the lower CapEx spend in the quarter was a benefit of about $223 million year-over-year. We also had lower interest expense of about $20 million. And offsetting those 2 benefits were really timing of working capital that cost us about $67 million versus last year and obviously, the adjusted EBITDA result, a decline of $18 million. So those are the key components of that $177 million improvement. I would caution against running too far with the overall result of $627 million in the quarter as you think about the full year free cash flow, the timing in some of the subsequent quarters will weigh that down. Still, we expect to deliver between $900 million and $1 billion worth of free cash flow over the full year.
On rental CapEx, you saw the $100 million in the quarter, down $223 million versus last year, and that's consistent with the approach that we've taken to rental CapEx this year, which was to give ourselves as much flexibility as we can early in the year and then decide as we go through the year, where it's appropriate to spend. So we still are expecting to spend $1.2 billion across the entire quarter for rental CapEx or -- excuse me, across the entire year for rental CapEx. The quarters will vary this year as we respond to demand.
On liquidity, real briefly. We spent -- we finished the quarter at $1.4 billion of liquidity, just over $1.4 billion, and that reflected about $1.2 billion in ABL capacity and another $200 million in cash on the balance sheet.
Let me just touch on the share repurchase program briefly. We purchased in the quarter $153 million worth of shares, That resulted in about 2.7 million shares coming back to us. And if you look at the entire current authorization, the $1 billion authorization we're operating under, it -- we've spent about $264 million through the end of the quarter against that program. So we're on the pace that we've talked about. As we think about the share repurchase program, our intention right now is to continue the way that we've said, steady purchases toward about $675 million or so worth of repurchases this year. And they'll be fairly steady throughout the month.
I've mentioned before the restricted payments limitations that we have to make sure we operate within from our debt covenants. As we finished the quarter, we had about $566 million worth of available capacity, either from RP baskets in the debt or from cash capacity at the holding company. So we're very well positioned to continue the share repurchase program without concern about those limitations slowing us down.
ROIC for the quarter was 8.7%. That was down 30 basis points from the prior year and clearly reflects the impact of the weaker rate environment after netting out the somewhat stronger demand environment and higher utilization.
Let me finish up with just a real brief comment on the updated outlook. You saw the numbers with rental -- excuse me, total revenue coming down to a range of $5.6 billion to $5.8 billion, and adjusted EBITDA coming down to a range of $2,650,000,000 to $2,750,000,000. Essentially, we adjusted both ranges down to reflect the renewed outlook on rate. Its impact is about $100 million, and so that was -- at midpoint, it was about $100 million. So that was the motivation for revising those components of the guidance downward. Our new view of rate is now for a decline of 3% to 4% over the course of the year and really, that reflects the experience that we've had early in the year. We can talk about the sequential rate performance that we had in the first 3 months of the year, but it's fair to say that those came in weaker than we expected and the new rate guidance for the full year essentially reflects that decline.
Our utilization is going the other way. We've had a stronger start to the year on utilization and on fleet on rent. And so we now expect our utilization for the year to be up about 100 basis points. That will bring us to in and around 68.3% for the full year.
No change to the CapEx plan as we've mentioned before. $1.2 billion is still the gross spend that we're targeting, which should net down to about $700 million after used sales proceeds. And again, no change to the free cash flow outlook, between $900 million and $1 billion.
Final comment is just in regards to April. We've got a lot of questions about how April has started. So we figured we'd offer up just a little bit more thought about that. On the rate front, it's fair to say that April has started slightly better than what we saw sequentially in March. We call April so far month-to-date at something like a sequential minus 5/10. On utilization, it's also slightly better than where we finished out. As of yesterday, our utilization against last year was up 130 basis points. So we think it's important to understand how the early part of the year plays out, and as we think about the remainder of the year, we're optimistic, optimistic about our ability to put fleet on rent, about our ability to start realizing rate more effectively than we have. And as always, we're going to drive as hard as we can toward all of those objectives.
So with that, I'll ask the operator to open the call for questions and answers. Operator?"

I'd say 70% of our regions, and those are the ones that aren't touched by oil and gas, and you could think about it geographically as on the coasts, have robust demand. And that's what we're taking advantage of. As far as what's that balance between rate, that's more of a supply dynamic.

But in that slide, you're saying you think there will be modest rate growth. So I'm just trying to think through -- if I'm going to raise CapEx that much in '17, I'm exiting '16 with a lot of negative carryover on rate. Obviously, I guess, the answer could be you're just that bullish on '17.

So we look at that, and we say, that's not insurmountable to overcome during the course of 2017 and get back to positive rate throughout the course of next year. So that's how we think about, sort of, what we'd have to overcome in order to get to modest rate increase next year. As for the CapEx, we gave a range, right? We said it could be $1.2 billion to $1.7 billion, I think, it was. And we're using that as a statement that we're going to be very focused on preserving flexibility and responding to the market, more so than just saying, hey, we're going to spend $1 billion -- it was $1.6 billion at the top end of that range.

So that dynamic we expect to play out as the year goes on, and that's why we are encouraged by our ability to improve our rate realization. When it gets to absolute sequential increases, it will depend on things that are outside of our control, including the overall level of industry fleet and the level of utilization of that fleet in the industry. That's why we spend so much time talking about how industry fleet is being absorbed. You used the word confidence. It's a matter of confidence to say that you're going to start moving sequential rate higher several months down the road. Our experience recently has made us be mindful of getting too aggressive and far out ahead of where the market actually is. And so that's why we put the rate forecast out there that we did. The key for us is to make sure that our management processes are focused on realizing as much rate as we can in the marketplace. And if we do that and if the industry absorbs more of the fleet that's out there and avoids bringing in a lot of excess fleet to compound the problem from here, then the rate we realize is going to be better than what we've got in that guidance range.

I'll begin my comments with our second quarter performance because it's a good reflection of our current operating environment. The market conditions are in our favor, especially",1450,"Well, thanks, operator, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to our call. I'll begin my comments with our second quarter performance because it's a good reflection of our current operating environment. The market conditions are in our favor, especially in the United States. And I'll talk about some of the initiatives we have underway to capitalize on the growth and demand. And then Bill will cover our results in more detail and then we'll spend the rest of the call on Q&A. 
So I will start with some of the highlights from our results. While total revenue was close to flat year-over-year, our earnings were up. Our adjusted EPS for the quarter was $2.06 per diluted share, compared to $1.95 a year ago. We generated $679 million of adjusted EBITDA at a margin of 47.8%. And it was another strong quarter for free cash flow. 
Now looking at the underlying metrics, time utilization increased 90 basis points year-over-year to 67.5%, which was good but a little softer than we expected. And we drove a 3% increase in volume and, which was partially offset by 2.4% increase in rental rates. It was a solid second quarter performance and it shows we're taking a balanced approach to managing the business. 
I want to spend a few minutes on rates because I know it's a point of interest. Our second quarter rates were better than anticipated. We still expect full year rate erosion but we now believe it may not be as deep as 4% but more likely scenario is in the 2% to 3% range. It's always difficult to forecast rate so it's gratifying that we drove sequential rate improvements of 0.5 a point or better in both May and June. In fact, May was our first sequential increase in 16 months. This comes from intense focus on rates, coupled with a deep dive into the data. We're analyzing transactions that fall outside of our rate criteria and had some success in turning that around. 
Furthermore, the improvement was widespread. In June, for example, all of our regions took rates higher from May. Now I'll remind you in something I've said many times; rates, utilization, volume and CapEx need to work together to generate returns. And when rates go up, utilization can be impacted vice versa. There's always a give and take between the metrics. 
And we also said recently we felt we could do better on rates. And in the second quarter, we did. 
Now turning to our operating conditions. From what we see and hear, the cycle is intact. We've made our statement in our last call, and we believe this still holds true. Conditions remain challenging in Canada but activity is strong in many of areas of our core U.S. markets. We believe the demand that we're goes beyond seasonality and shows that we're still in upcycle with an added benefit from secular penetration. Regionally, customer activity is robust in both the East and West coasts. The Northeast has a large number of multiyear construction projects underway. Massachusetts is a good example. We're on 2 casino projects and a rail cart facility. And work began in the second quarter and should ramp up in the coming months. In our Southeast region, rental revenue was up 12%, led by South Carolina and Florida. These 2 states had increases of over 20%. On the West Coast, commercial activity is stable to up in nearly every market. The technology and entertainment sectors are driving the bulk of the commercial activity right now and infrastructure spending is strong. And nationally, our customer survey showed that optimism is still on the rise. 
A key number of key market -- a number of key market indicators line up with our position. This include the ABI, which is 52.6 in June followed by another strong showing in May, the ABI is now have been above 50 for 5 straight months and nonresidential construction was up more than 7% year-over-year through May. Private nonres, which is our largest end markets, was up 9.2%. And contractors are reporting sizable backlogs of project work and in some cases, stretching out more than a year. The bigger backlogs with larger contractors where we have a competitive advantage. 
Specialty rentals continue to be another factor in our favor. In the second quarter, our rental revenue for specialty segment was up 8.4% in total. Now within that, our Power & HVAC business was up 15.7% and our Trench business was up 14.9%. The Power and Trench increases were almost entirely due to same-store growth. Another one of our specialty operations, Pump Solutions, was down 5% due to the headwinds from upstream oil and gas. Excluding that sector, rental revenue from our Pump was up 21%. So we're having good success at cross-selling our Pump lead to our current existing customer base with our generator [ph] customers and those who use our other specialty services that we offer. 
In the first 6 months of 2016, cross-selling revenue from Pump increased by almost 14% over the prior year. Now, of course, not everything is ideal. 
Industrial production is lackluster. Several of our industrial markets have been challenged by weak commodity prices and the impact of a strong U.S. dollar on exports. In the stated that came out last week suggest that, in the U.S., the supply of fleet in our industry is still growing faster than demand. Much of that imbalance is driven by heavy duty equipment which makes up a small percentage of our fleet. Nevertheless, we obviously would like to see the industry returning to equilibrium. 
Now in our business, we're being very disciplined with CapEx management. For the first 6 months of 2016, we invested $722 million of gross rental CapEx compared to over $1 billion in 2015 the same period. And we're making good on our promise at the start of the year and deploying our CapEx in a more measured pace. This gives us greater flexibility in the back half of the year. 
We're always mindful of the potential for macro volatility. The financial markets got a taste of that recently with the Brexit vote. The economy in Canada remains weak. And globally, there is a sense of economic uncertainty but we're not seeing any backlash in our markets from the macro. But if it comes to that, we're well prepared to manage through it. A company that navigate the macro best are the ones that can pivot quickly and we've shown that we're very good at that. 
In addition, our customer base is much more diversified than it was 10 years ago. We have a better balance between construction and industrial business and a broader verticals strategy that limits our reliance on any one end market. We've also diversified our specialty range and expanded these operations. This is accelerating our cross-selling, which leverages our broader base. And for the second quarter, rental revenue from cross-selling company-wide was up 14%. 
I also want to mention an announcement that will be coming out in the next few days about the expansion of our digital customer service platform. The launch of true e-commerce capability will give us more ways to connect to customers and engage in new markets. Our system is the first in North America to fully automate the rental transaction process end-to-end and the first offer online ordering to all commercial renters and consumers. We are always looking at ways that walk in our customer shoes. And while many of our customers want a consultative approach, there are always customers who know exactly what to order and prefer to operate in a more digital manner. And we're excited to give those customers a more streamlined way to transact with us. 
So in conclusion, our second quarter performance is an accurate presentation of where we believe we are in the cycle with significant amount of runway ahead. We have many levers inherent in our business model. We fine tune our operations everyday using CapEx, redeployment of assets, verticals strategies, cross-selling and used equipment sales and will continue to do that at every operating environment. And as we move through 2016, we're using the inflow data to inform the balance of the year. And that's why you saw some minor adjustments to our guidance last night. We want to be as accurate as possible in our communications with the investment community. And we believe our business is properly calibrated with the current market opportunity. And we see that opportunity expanding, and we continue to grow end market demand. So with that, I'll hand it over to Bill and so Bill can discuss the second quarter results for. Over to you, Bill."

As always, I'll add a little color in the numbers for the quarter and update our outlook toward the end. We'll start with rental revenue. $1,204,000,000 rental revenue in the quarter, that's down $17 million or",1794,"Thanks, Mike, and good morning to everyone. As always, I'll add a little color in the numbers for the quarter and update our outlook toward the end. We'll start with rental revenue. $1,204,000,000 rental revenue in the quarter, that's down $17 million or 1.3% compared to last year. The components of that really are driven by the owned equipment revenue items. Re-rent and ancillary net essentially to  zero on a year-over-year change basis. And within OER, the volume impact was the big positive. The 3% volume increase net at $33 million of year-over-year revenue benefit. That was offset by the 2.4% decline in rental rates, which was worth about $26 million of year-over-year rental rate revenue decline. Our CapEx inflation number was about $20 million of headwind this quarter. And then we have $4 million headwind from mix and other. And it's a net for a variety of different items. So those were the key components of that $17 million year-over-year decline. Mixed in all of that was the result of our change in the Canadian dollar. The currency impact in the quarter was about $5 million of headwind versus last year from currency strictly. 
Moving briefly to used equipment sales. $134 million of used equipment sales in the quarter was $10 million better than last year. And the adjusted gross margin in the quarter was 47.8% that was down slightly versus last year, primarily reflected slightly lower pricing for used equipment in the market overall, as well as a slightly greater in mix of lower margin channels in the quarter in particular somewhat more through the vendor channel than the same quarter last year. Those are the key revenue items I wanted to mention. 
Moving to profitability starting with the adjusted EBITDA. You saw $679 million or the quarter, that was down $27 million versus last year. The margin in the quarter of 47.8% was also down 1.6 percentage points in margin. And the key components were as follows: So for the $27 million year-over-year decline, $25 million was the impact of rental rates. That 2.4% rental rate impact clearly has a significant change on a year-over-year basis. Volume though offset $21 million of that $25 million rate decline. Fleet inflation cost is about $12 million. And our used equipment sales contributed an incremental $2 million positive over last year. We have a usual merit increase impact, it was about $6 million of decline this year. And then net of mix and all the other factors was a headwind of about $7 million. That included a little bit of negative adjustment for incentive comp, negative in the sense that it was a greater expense this year than last year, reflecting a little bit higher accrual balance for the incentive programs. I had a little bit of a year-over-year headwind from an insurance of accrual adjustment. But that was offset significantly bad debt improvement over last year. So those are the key components within that $7 million negative from mix and all other. 
Moving to  adjusted EPS. You saw $2.06 for the quarter, that was $0.11 better than last year and reflects all the factors that we talked up above, including a net impact of about $0.02 negative from the Canadian dollar. Our free cash flow, you saw that we delivered $792 million of free cash flow for the year-to-date through June 30, that's about $350 million better than last year. The primary drivers really were the lower spending on CapEx, lower spending and timing of CapEx spend was worth about $300 million of that year-over-year change. And the rest was driven by lower interest expense and timing on working capital and the year-over-year difference in operating cash flow. 
On rental gross CapEx, you saw the $22 million -- the $722 million rental gross CapEx spend in the quarter. That was again consistent with the guidance that we've given about how we want to approach rental CapEx this year. It's down from a comparable period last year. And it does build in that flexibility that Mike mentioned for our ability to spend in the back half of the year. The net rental CapEx for the year was $488 million and that compare to $569 million last year. 
ROIC in the quarter of 8.5% was down 50 basis points and again reflects the impact of all the factors that we talked to so far. 
Moving quickly to liquidity and capital structure. We finished the quarter with just over $1.3 billion of total liquidity. That includes $1 billion of ABL capacity that's available to us and $265 million of cash available on the balance sheet. We have a lot of activity on the capital structure and in particular on debt redemptions in the quarter. 
In May, we closed the redemption of our 7 3/8 and 8 1/4 notes as well as close the new debt issue that we used to finance them. And then you saw that we announced that we will redeem the remaining balance of the 7 3/8 note, the $200 million that remains outstanding in August that is when that will close. If you aggregate the impact of all those redemption action so far this year, we expect that we'll be at an annualized run rate save on interest expense of about $30 million. So some significant improvements of all of those redemption actions. 
We also took action to extend our ABL in the quarter so that now we have a that ABL maturing in 2021. And that is the first significant debt item that we have. Our debt maturities are very clear up until that point. 
Just a quick update on the share repurchase program. We bought a total of $171 million worth of shares in the quarter. That brought our year-to-date purchases to $324 million. And in fact, it brought the program-to-date purchases to this $1 billion authorization to $435 million since we started it late last year. So we're on the pace to continue to deliver share repurchases as we talked about recently. We're spending on a pace of about $670 million or so for this year. And we will continue to execute that on a fairly steady pace. 
Regarding the limitations on restricted payments that are inherent in some of our debt, we're still in very good shape there with about $560 million  of available capacity when you add both the baskets of restricted payment limitations from the debt and the cash capacity that's available at the parent URI. So well positioned to be able to continue the share repurchase program. 
A couple of points on our outlook for the remainder of the year. You saw that we did not change our revenue and adjusted EBITDA ranges for the year. Neither did we change our expectations for free cash flow or CapEx spend. On CapEx, I'll just note that we did put in a range around that $1.2 billion of CapEx that we're talking about. That was really done in response to the SEC's guidance to companies that they should be reconciling in a non-GAAP financial forecast that they make to the nearest GAAP indicator. The nearest GAAP indicator for free cash flow is cash from operations. And when we try to reconcile to the range that we put around free cash flow, we decided that we needed to put a range on CapEx. But it doesn't reflect any change in our thinking about spending on CapEx this year. We're still targeting the $1.2 billion that we had in our previous guidance. 
The 2 changes to our guidance revolve around rate and time utilization. You saw that we raised our rate range expected for the full year to down 2, to down 3. That's up from the down 3 to 4 that we had previously. At the same time, we lowered slightly our expectation for time utilization. We're now calling that approximately 68% [ph] for the year, which is about 70 basis point improvement over last year. And really, we raised the rate and adjusted the time to reflect the experience that we had in second quarter. And the approach that we're taking in managing those metrics and others for the remainder of the year. So those are the key parts of our outlook as I stand today. I know that the first question we get probably would be how's July going so far and that in finishing out the full year guidance that we are talking about so just a couple of key points there. 
On rate July has started out at a trend that looks like it will bring us at around flat sequentially for the month compared to June. And time utilization is up. And in fact, it's up a little bit more than what we experienced in June. So it looks like it it's up about 70 basis points. That's where we are today and that's a reasonable estimate for where we might end up for the year. So those are the key points on July. And again, the key points of our guidance for the remainder of this year. 
One last point. Regarding guidance in future periods. We've had a lot of discussion inside the company about what are the proper elements of guidance for us to put forth that will help us have as a useful conversation with all of you as investors as we can. And we've seen over the last several quarters the challenge that we have in forecasting individual items of guidance, whether it's rate or time utilization, those 2 items in particular, those are challenged to peg as individual elements of guidance. Why? Because we manage the company in a way that manages those 2 elements together. 
So in order to get us more focused on how we approach managing the company, we've decided that we're going to eliminate providing rate and time utilization guidance starting at the beginning of 2017. We'll finish the year out with the guidance that I just outlined. And then starting in the new year, we'll eliminate those 2 elements. We will continue to provide you the actual results for rate and time after each quarter is complete in our earnings calls. We'll also continue to provide financial guidance on revenue, EBITDA and free cash flow and our capital spend. We think this is the best way to go forward in order to have the kind of conversation that we think gives you the best insight about how we're approaching managing the business and allows us to manage the business in the way that optimizes everything that we're after. So those are the key comments I wanted to make. I'll ask the operator now to open up the call for questions and answers. Operator?"

If all of that happens, then we would go into next year with a carryover of about flat for 2017. So that's the high end of the rate range guidance. At the low end, it would take sequential declines of about 6/10, let's say each month from July to October in order for us to come in at the down 3% end of our rate guidance. If that happens, again, with a normal sort of November, December, we'd have a carryover going into '17 of about negative 1.5%.

So we give more credit to the opportunity that's out there and the customer demand for both of those. As far as what actions we took internally to drive May and June sequentially positive, it was really as we look at those 2 levers of rate and time, we came at a Q1 with rate performance set we didn't want to continue to absorb going forward and we had a little bit of head room on time. So we were almost myopically focused on rate to achieve that. To the point where we even achieved sequential positive rate in markets that have really tough macros like Canada. That was in June. That was a lot of putting to tail, so to speak, really getting rid of some of the anomalies and just a very rigorous focus to reset the baseline of where our rates needed to be for us to continue to serve our customers in a profitable manner."

We're not greater than what you achieve in the previous month or the last contract that just came off . There's a lot of inputs and then you have to think about different geographies and different customer sets so there's and there's different products. So I think to Bill's point about us, the ability and how difficult it is to forecast sequential rate on its own, is proven out by the ebb and flow of what we've seen here in the first half of the year. It's a very, very dynamic measure. But as we manage the business day-to-day, as each manager out in the field is looking at it, you're balancing your decisions on rate and time and is that a profitable customer, not just on that individual transaction but in the whole of our experience with that customer. So I would say, it's just putting a little more emphasis on, as I answered Scott's question, I little more emphasis on the rate than you normally would in a balanced environment to get the baseline back up to where it needed to be.

I think what we're seeing now at the Rouse is net new acquisitions or net new fleet being added to the mix. It's not unusual because typically, in the second quarter, our industry has the tendency to fleet up to capture the balance of the year. The answer is going to lie in what does the balance of the year look like. And good part of it is there is reports now that are out there that we can have better understanding of what is happening and make adjustments accordingly, and we have done that. That's #1. #2, I think, by order of magnitude, when you ask is everyone playing safe or playing right? I think that one of the things I took away from the Rouse report, I believe what was May, the report actually saw where the supply was below the demand, the demand was higher. So that would tell me that there are people are being good stewards in understanding the industry trends. The question is does it continue? That's everyone's question."

As we sit here today, our Canadian business is down over 11% but that's only 3.1% on fleet on rent volume. It's almost 8% on rate. So we think we've got the fleet rightsize in Canada.

How far up we would go in that total range? Hard to say right here and now. $1.7 billion is the max that we've ever spent. $1.6 billion would be a shade under.

I'll just emphasize that the ranges -- our ranges for a reason and don't anchor yourself too much to the midpoints of the ranges in guiding how you think about how you're going to do this year. Now that said, we are facing our environment where we expect rates to be down 2% to 3% that a significant headwind for a year to start out with. And utilization improvement is a great thing to try and offset that but rates are pretty powerful as you know. So that's a challenge that we are working to overcome. Will we overcome that or not, tune in later in the year and we'll see."

I'll begin my comments with our second quarter performance because it's a good reflection of our current operating environment.

I'll begin my comments with our second quarter performance because it's a good reflection of our current operating environment. The market conditions are in our favor, especially in the United States. And I'll talk about some of the initiatives we have underway to capitalize on the growth and demand. And then Bill will cover our results in detail and then we'll spend the rest of the call on Q&A.
So I'll start with some of the highlights from our results. While total revenue was close to flat year-over-year, our earnings were up. Our adjusted EPS for the quarter was $2.06 per diluted share compared to $1.95 a year ago. We generated $679 million of adjusted EBITDA at a margin of 47.8%, and it was another strong quarter for free cash flow.
Now looking at the underlying metrics, time utilization increased 90 basis points year-over-year to 67.5%, which was good but a little softer than we expected. Then we drove a 3% increase in volume, and -- which was partially offset by 2.4% decrease in rental rates. It was a solid second quarter performance, and it shows that we were taking a balanced approach to managing the business.
I want to spend a few minutes on rates because I know it's a point of interest. Our second quarter rates were better than anticipated. We still expect full year rate erosion, but we now believe it may not be as deep as 4% but more likely scenario is in the 2% to 3% range. It's always difficult to forecast rate, so it's gratifying that we drove sequential rate improvements of 0.5 point or better in both May and June. In fact, May was our first sequential increase in 16 months. This comes from intense focus on rates, coupled with a deep dive into the data. We're analyzing transactions that fall outside of our rate criteria and we've had some success in turning that around.
Furthermore, the improvement was widespread. In June, for example, all of our regions took rates higher from May. Now I'll remind you of something I've said many times: rates, utilization, volume and CapEx need to work together to generate returns. And when rates go up, utilization can be impacted and vice versa. There's always a give and take between the metrics. And we also said recently we felt we could do better on rates. And in the second quarter, we did.
Now turning to our operating conditions. From what we see and hear, the cycle is intact. We've made that statement on our last call, and we believe this still holds true. Conditions remain challenging in Canada but activity is strong in many areas of our core U.S. markets. We believe the demand that we're seeing goes beyond seasonality and it shows that we're still in upcycle with an added benefit from secular penetration.
Regionally, customer activity is robust on both the East and West Coasts. The Northeast has a large number of multiyear construction projects underway. Massachusetts is a good example. We're on 2 casino projects and a railcar facility, and work began in the second quarter and should ramp up in the coming months. In our Southeast region, rental revenue was up 12%, led by South Carolina and Florida. These 2 states had increases of over 20%. On the West Coast, commercial activity is stable to up in nearly every market. The technology and entertainment sectors are driving the bulk of the commercial activity right now and infrastructure spending is strong. And nationally, a customer survey showed that optimism is still on the rise.
A key number of key market -- a number of key market indicators line up with our position. These include the ABI, which is 52.6 in June followed by another strong showing in May. The ABI has now been above 50 for 5 straight months, and nonresidential construction was up more than 7% year-over-year through May. Private nonres, which is our largest end market, was up 9.2%. And contractors are reporting sizable backlogs of project work and in some cases, stretching out more than a year. The bigger backlogs are with larger contractors where we have a competitive advantage.
Specialty rentals continue to be another factor in our favor. In the second quarter, our rental revenue from specialty segment was up 8.4% in total. Now within that, our Power & HVAC business was up 15.7% and our Trench business was up 14.9%. The Power and Trench increases were almost entirely due to same-store growth. Another one of our specialty operations, Pump Solutions, was down 5% due to the headwinds from upstream oil and gas. Excluding that sector, rental revenue from our Pump was up 21%. So we're having good success at cross-selling our Pump fleet to our current existing customer base with our Gen Rent customers and those who use our other specialty services that we offer. In the first 6 months of 2016, cross-selling revenue from Pump increased by almost 14% over the prior year.
Now of course, not everything is ideal. Industrial production is lackluster. Several of our industrial markets have been challenged by weak commodity prices and the impact of the strong U.S. dollar on exports. In the amounts [ph] stated that came out last week suggest that, in the U.S., the supply of fleet in our industry is still growing faster than demand. Much of that imbalance is driven by heavy duty equipment, which makes up a small percentage of our fleet. But nevertheless, we obviously like to see the industry returning to  equilibrium.
In our own business, we're being very disciplined with CapEx management. For the first 6 months of 2016, we invested $722 million of gross rental CapEx compared to over $1 billion in 2015 in the same period. And we're making good on our promise at the start of the year and deploying our CapEx in a more measured pace. This gives us greater flexibility in the back half of the year.
We're always mindful of the potential for macro volatility. The financial markets got a taste of that recently with the Brexit vote. The economy in Canada remains weak, and globally, there's a sense of economic uncertainty. But we're not seeing any backlash in our markets from the macro. But if it comes to that, we'd be well prepared to manage through it as companies that navigate the macro best are the ones that can pivot quickly, and we've shown that we're very good at that.
In addition, our customer base is much more diversified than it was 10 years ago. We have a better balance between construction and industrial business and a broader verticals strategy that limits our reliance on any one end market. We've also diversified our specialty range and expanded these operations. This has accelerated our cross-selling, which leverages our broader base. And for the second quarter, rental revenue from cross-selling company wide was up 14%.
I also want to mention an announcement that will be coming out in the next few days about the expansion of our digital customer service platform. The launch of a true e-commerce capability will give us more ways to connect with customers and engage in new markets. Our system is the first in North America to fully automate the rental transaction process end-to-end and the first to offer online ordering to all commercial renters and consumers.
We're always looking at ways to walk in our customer shoes. And while many of our customers want a consultative approach, there are always customers who know exactly what to order and prefer to operate in a more digital manner. And we're excited to give those customers a more streamlined way to transact with us.
So in conclusion, our second quarter performance is an accurate presentation of where we believe we are in the cycle with significant amount of runway ahead. We have many levers inherent in our business model. We fine-tune our operations every day using CapEx, redeployment of assets, vertical strategies, cross-selling and used equipment sales and will continue to do that at every operating environment.
And as we move through 2016, we're using the inflow data to inform the balance of the year. And that's why you saw minor adjustments to our guidance last night. We want to be as accurate as possible in our communications with the investment community. And we believe our business is properly calibrated with the current market opportunity. And we see that opportunity expanding, and we're continuing to grow our end market demand.
So with that, I'll hand it over to Bill and so Bill can discuss the second quarter results. Over to you, Bill."

As always, I'll add a little color on the numbers for the quarter and update our outlook toward the end. We'll start with rental revenue. $1,204,000,000 rental revenue in the quarter, that's down $17 million or",1799,"Thanks, Mike, and good morning to everyone. As always, I'll add a little color on the numbers for the quarter and update our outlook toward the end. We'll start with rental revenue. $1,204,000,000 rental revenue in the quarter, that's down $17 million or 1.3% compared to last year. The components of that really are driven by the owned equipment revenue items. Re-rent and ancillary net essentially to 0 on a year-over-year change basis.
And within OER, the volume impact was the big positive. The 3% volume increase netted $33 million of year-over-year revenue benefit. That was offset by the 2.4% decline in rental rates, which was worth about $26 million of year-over-year rental rate revenue decline. Our CapEx inflation number was about $20 million of headwind this quarter. And then we had $4 million headwind from mix and other. And it's a net of a variety of different items. So those were the key components of that $17 million year-over-year decline. Mixed in with all of that was the result of our change in the Canadian dollar. The currency impact in the quarter was about $5 million of headwind versus last year from currency strictly.
Moving briefly to used equipment sales. $134 million of used equipment sales in the quarter was $10 million better than last year. And the adjusted gross margin in the quarter was 47.8%. That was down slightly versus last year, and it primarily reflected slightly lower pricing for used equipment in the market overall, as well as a slightly greater mix of lower margin channels in the quarter, in particular, somewhat more through the vendor channel than the same quarter last year. Those are the key revenue items I wanted to mention.
Moving to profitability, starting with adjusted EBITDA. You saw $679 million for the quarter, that was down $27 million versus last year. The margin in the quarter of 47.8% was also down 1.6 percentage points in margin. And the key components were as follows: so for the $27 million year-over-year decline, $25 million was the impact of rental rates. That 2.4% rental rate impact clearly has a significant change on a year-over-year basis. Volume though offset $21 million of that $25 million rate decline.
Fleet inflation cost is about $12 million, and our used equipment sales contributed an incremental $2 million positive over last year. We have a usual merit increase impact. It was about $6 million of decline this year. And then the net of mix and all the other factors was a headwind of about $7 million. That included a little bit of a negative adjustment for incentive comp, negative in the sense that it was a greater expense this year than last year, reflecting a little bit higher accrual balance for the incentive programs. Had a little bit of a year-over-year headwind from an insurance accrual adjustment. But that was offset significantly by bad debt improvement over last year. So those are the key components within that $7 million negative from mix and all other.
Moving to adjusted EPS. You saw $2.06 for the quarter. That was $0.11 better than last year and it reflects all the factors that we talked up above, including a net impact of about $0.02 negative from the Canadian dollar. On free cash flow, you saw that we delivered $792 million of free cash flow for the year-to-date through June 30. That's about $350 million better than last year. The primary drivers really were the lower spending on CapEx. Lower spending and timing of CapEx spend was worth about $300 million of that year-over-year change. And the rest was driven by lower interest expense and timing on working capital and the year-over-year difference in operating cash flow.
On rental gross CapEx, you saw the $22 million -- the $722 million rental gross CapEx spend in the quarter. That was again consistent with the guidance that we've given about how we want to approach rental CapEx this year. It's down from a comparable period last year. And it does build in that flexibility that Mike mentioned for our ability to spend in the back half of the year. The net rental CapEx for the year was $488 million and that compared to the $569 million last year. ROIC in the quarter of 8.5% was down 50 basis points and again reflects the impact of all the factors that we've talked to so far.
Moving quickly to liquidity and capital structure. We finished the quarter with just over $1.3 billion of total liquidity. That includes $1 billion of ABL capacity that's available to us and $265 million of cash available on the balance sheet. We have a lot of activity on the capital structure and in particular, on debt redemptions in the quarter.
In May, we closed the redemption of our 7 3/8% and 8 1/4% notes as well as closed the new debt issue that we used to finance them. And then you saw that we announced that we will redeem the remaining balance of the 7 3/8% note, the $200 million that remains outstanding in August, that is, when that will close. If you aggregate the impact of all those redemption actions so far this year, we expect that we'll be at an annualized run rate save on interest expense of about $30 million. So some significant improvements of all of those redemption actions.
We also took action to extend our ABL in the quarter so that now we have that ABL maturing in 2021. And that is the first significant debt item that we have. Our debt maturities are very clear up until that point.
Just a quick update on the share repurchase program. We bought a total of $171 million worth of shares in the quarter. That brought our year-to-date purchases to $324 million. And in fact, it brought the program-to-date purchases on this $1 billion authorization to $435 million since we've started it late last year. So we're on the pace to continue to deliver share repurchases as we've talked about recently. We're spending on a pace of about $670 million or so for this year, and we will continue to execute that on a fairly steady pace.
Regarding the limitations on restricted payments that are inherent in our -- in some of our debt, we're still in very good shape there with about $560 million of available capacity when you add both the baskets of restricted payment limitations from the debt and the cash capacity that's available at the parent URI. So well positioned to be able to continue the share repurchase program.
A couple of points on our outlook for the remainder of the year. You saw that we did not change our revenue and adjusted EBITDA ranges for the year. Neither did we change our expectations for free cash flow or CapEx spend. On CapEx, I'll just note that we did put in a range around the $1.2 billion of CapEx that we're talking about. That was really done in response to the SEC's guidance to companies that they should be reconciling in a non-GAAP financial forecast that they make to the nearest GAAP indicator. The nearest GAAP indicator for free cash flow is cash from operations. And when we try to reconcile to the range that we put around free cash flow, we decided that we needed to put a range on CapEx. But it doesn't reflect any change in our thinking about spending on CapEx this year. We're still targeting the $1.2 billion that we had in our previous guidance.
The 2 changes to our guidance revolve around rate and time utilization. You saw that we raised our rate range expected for the full year to down 2% to down 3%. That's up from the down 3% to 4% that we had previously. At the same time, we lowered slightly our expectation for time utilization. We're now calling that at approximately 68% for the year, which would be about a 70 basis point improvement over last year. And really, we raised the rate and adjusted the time to reflect the experience that we had in second quarter and the approach that we're taking in managing those metrics and others for the remainder of the year.
So those are the key points of our outlook as the stand today. I know that the first question we get probably would be, how's July going so far and that in finishing out the full year guidance that we're talking about, so just a couple of key points there.
On rate, July has started out at a trend that looks like it'll bring us at around flat sequentially for the month compared to June and time utilization is up. And in fact, it's up a little bit more than what we experienced in June. So it looks like it's up about 70 basis points. It's -- that's where we are today and that's a reasonable estimate for where we might end up for the year. So those are the key points on July and again, the key points of our guidance for the remainder of this year.
One last point. Regarding guidance in future periods. We've had a lot of discussion inside the company about what are the proper elements of guidance for us to put forth that will help us have as useful a conversation with all of you as investors as we can. And we've seen over the last several quarters the challenge that we have in forecasting individual items of guidance, whether it's rate or time utilization, those 2 items in particular, those are challenged to peg as individual elements of guidance. Why? Because we manage the company in a way that manages those 2 elements together.
So in order to get us more focused on how we approach managing the company, we've decided that we're going to eliminate providing rate and time utilization guidance starting at the beginning of 2017. We'll finish the year out with the guidance that I just outlined. And then starting in the new year, we'll eliminate those 2 elements. We will continue to provide you the actual results for rate and time after each quarter is complete in our earnings calls.
We'll also continue to provide financial guidance on revenue, EBITDA and free cash flow and our capital spend. We think this is the best way to go forward in order to have the kind of conversation that we think gives you the best insight about how we're approaching managing the business and allows us to manage the business in the way that optimizes everything that we're after.
So those are the key comments I wanted to make. I'll ask the operator now to open up the call for questions and answers."

If all of that happens, then we would go into next year with a carryover of about flat for 2017. So that's the high end of the rate range guidance. At the low end, it would take sequential declines of about 6/10, let's say, each month from July to October in order for us to come in at the down 3% end of our rate guidance. If that happens, again, with a normal sort of November, December, we'd have a carryover going into '17 of about negative 1.5%.

So we give more credit to the opportunity that's out there and the customer demand for both of those. As far as what actions we took internally to drive May and June sequentially positive, it was really -- as we look at those 2 levers of rate and time, we came at a Q1 with rate performance that we didn't want to continue to absorb going forward, and we had a little bit of headroom on time. So we were almost myopically focused on rate to achieve that, to a point where we even achieved sequential positive rates in markets that have really tough macros like Canada. That was in June. That was a lot of cutting the tail, so to speak, really getting rid of some of the anomalies and just a very rigorous focus to reset the baseline of where our rates needed to be for us to continue to serve our customers in a profitable manner."

We're not greater than what you achieve in the previous month or the last contract that just came off rent. So there's a lot of inputs and then you have to think about different geographies and different customer sets, so there's -- and different products. So I think that Bill's point about us, the ability and how difficult it is to forecast sequential rate on its own, is proven out by the ebb and flow of what we've seen here in the first half of the year. It's a very, very dynamic metric. But as we manage the business day to day, as each manager out in the field is looking at it, you're balancing your decisions on rate and time and is that a profitable customer, not just on that individual transaction, but in the whole of our experience with that customer. So I would say, it's just putting a little more emphasis on, as I answered Scott's question, a little more emphasis on the rate than you normally would in a balanced environment to get the baseline back up to where it needed to be.

It's not unusual because typically, in the second quarter, our industry, it has a tendency to fleet up to capture the balance of the year. The answer is going to lie in what does the balance of the year look like. And the good part of it is there is reports now that are out there that we can have a better understanding of what is happening and make adjustments accordingly and we have done that. That's number one. Number two, I think by order of magnitude, when you ask is everyone playing safe or playing right, I think that one of the things I took away from the Rouse report, I believe what was May, the report actually saw where the supply was below the demand, demand was higher. So that would tell me that their people are being good stewards in understanding of the industry trends. The question is, does it continue? That's everyone's question."

So I think that's really how to respond back right is that -- it's the interplay between the rate and time that we expect. We do expect to be able to continue to drive nice year-over-year improvement and time utilization. You saw 30 basis points in June that's below where we want to be and need to be. And so we expect that we'll be delivering a little bit more year-over-year improvement as we go in the back half of the year, and we're going to be focused on doing that."

I'll begin my comments with our second quarter performance because it's a good reflection of our current operating environment. The market conditions are in our favor, especially",1454,"Well, thanks operator, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to our call. I'll begin my comments with our second quarter performance because it's a good reflection of our current operating environment. The market conditions are in our favor, especially in the United States. And I'll talk about some of the initiatives we have underway to capitalize on the growth and demand. And then Bill will cover our results in detail and then we'll spend the rest of the call on Q&A.
So I'll start with some of the highlights from our results. While total revenue was close to flat year-over-year, our earnings were up. Our adjusted EPS for the quarter was $2.06 per diluted share compared to $1.95 a year ago. We generated $679 million of adjusted EBITDA at a margin of 47.8%, and it was another strong quarter for free cash flow.
Now looking at the underlying metrics, time utilization increased 90 basis points year-over-year to 67.5%, which was good but a little softer than we expected. Then we drove a 3% increase in volume, and -- which was partially offset by 2.4% decrease in rental rates. It was a solid second quarter performance, and it shows that we were taking a balanced approach to managing the business.
I want to spend a few minutes on rates because I know it's a point of interest. Our second quarter rates were better than anticipated. We still expect full year rate erosion, but we now believe it may not be as deep as 4% but more likely scenario is in the 2% to 3% range. It's always difficult to forecast rate, so it's gratifying that we drove sequential rate improvements of 0.5 point or better in both May and June. In fact, May was our first sequential increase in 16 months. This comes from intense focus on rates, coupled with a deep dive into the data. We're analyzing transactions that fall outside of our rate criteria and we've had some success in turning that around.
Furthermore, the improvement was widespread. In June, for example, all of our regions took rates higher from May. Now I'll remind you of something I've said many times: rates, utilization, volume and CapEx need to work together to generate returns. And when rates go up, utilization can be impacted and vice versa. There's always a give and take between the metrics. And we also said recently we felt we could do better on rates. And in the second quarter, we did.
Now turning to our operating conditions. From what we see and hear, this cycle is intact. We've made that statement on our last call, and we believe this still holds true. Conditions remain challenging in Canada but activity is strong in many areas of our core U.S. markets. We believe the demand that we're seeing goes beyond seasonality and it shows that we're still in upcycle with an added benefit from secular penetration.
Regionally, customer activity is robust on both the East and West Coasts. The Northeast has a large number of multiyear construction projects underway. Massachusetts is a good example. We're on 2 casino projects and a railcar facility, and work began in the second quarter and should ramp up in the coming months. In our Southeast region, rental revenue was up 12%, led by South Carolina and Florida. These 2 states had increases of over 20%. On the West Coast, commercial activity is stable to up in nearly every market. The technology and entertainment sectors are driving the bulk of the commercial activity right now and infrastructure spending is strong. And nationally, our customer surveys show that optimism is still on the rise.
A key number of key market -- a number of key market indicators line up with our position. These include the ABI, which was 52.6 in June followed by another strong showing in May. The ABI has now been above 50 for 5 straight months, and nonresidential construction was up more than 7% year-over-year through May. Private nonres, which is our largest end market, was up 9.2%. And contractors are reporting sizable backlogs of project work and in some cases, stretching out more than a year. The bigger backlogs are with larger contractors where we have a competitive advantage.
Specialty rentals continue to be another factor in our favor. In the second quarter, our rental revenue from specialty segment was up 8.4% in total. Now within that, our Power & HVAC business was up 15.7% and our Trench business was up 14.9%. The Power and Trench increases were almost entirely due to same-store growth. Another one of our specialty operations, Pump Solutions, was down 5% due to the headwinds from upstream oil and gas. Excluding that sector, rental revenue from our Pump was up 21%. So we're having good success at cross-selling our Pump fleet to our current existing customer base with our Gen Rent customers and those who use our other specialty services that we offer. In the first 6 months of 2016, cross-selling revenue from Pump increased by almost 14% over the prior year.
Now of course, not everything is ideal. Industrial production is lackluster. Several of our industrial markets have been challenged by weak commodity prices and the impact of the strong U.S. dollar on exports. And the Rouse data that came out last week suggests that, in the U.S., the supply of fleet in our industry is still growing faster than demand. Much of that imbalance is driven by heavy dirt equipment, which makes up a small percentage of our fleet. But nevertheless, we obviously like to see the industry returning to  equilibrium.
In our own business, we're being very disciplined with CapEx management. For the first 6 months of 2016, we invested $722 million of gross rental CapEx compared to over $1 billion in 2015 in the same period. And we're making good on our promise at the start of the year and deploying our CapEx in a more measured pace. This gives us greater flexibility in the back half of the year.
We're always mindful of the potential for macro volatility. The financial markets got a taste of that recently with the Brexit vote. The economy in Canada remains weak, and globally, there's a sense of economic uncertainty. But we're not seeing any backlash in our markets from the macro. But if it comes to that, we'd be well prepared to manage through it. The companies that navigate the macro best are the ones that can pivot quickly, and we've shown that we're very good at that.
In addition, our customer base is much more diversified than it was 10 years ago. We have a better balance between construction and industrial business and a broader verticals strategy that limits our reliance on any one end market. We've also diversified our specialty range and expanded these operations. This has accelerated our cross-selling, which leverages our broader base. And for the second quarter, rental revenue from cross-selling companywide was up 14%.
I also want to mention an announcement that will be coming out in the next few days about the expansion of our digital customer service platform. The launch of a true e-commerce capability will give us more ways to connect with customers and engage in new markets. Our system is the first in North America to fully automate the rental transaction process end-to-end and the first to offer online ordering to all commercial renters and consumers.
We're always looking at ways to walk in our customer shoes. And while many of our customers want a consultative approach, there are always customers who know exactly what to order and prefer to operate in a more digital manner. And we're excited to give those customers a more streamlined way to transact with us.
So in conclusion, our second quarter performance is an accurate representation of where we believe we are in the cycle with significant amount of runway ahead. We have many levers inherent in our business model. We fine-tune our operations every day using CapEx, redeployment of assets, vertical strategies, cross-selling and used equipment sales and will continue to do that at every operating environment.
And as we move through 2016, we're using the inflow data to inform the balance of the year. And that's why you saw minor adjustments to our guidance last night. We want to be as accurate as possible in our communications with the investment community. And we believe our business is properly calibrated for the current market opportunity. And we see that opportunity expanding, and we're continuing to grow our end market demand.
So with that, I'll hand it over to Bill and so Bill can discuss the second quarter results. Over to you, Bill."

As always, I'll add a little color on the numbers for the quarter and update our outlook toward the end. We'll start with rental revenue. $1,204,000,000 rental revenue in the quarter, that's down $17 million or",1799,"Thanks, Mike, and good morning to everyone. As always, I'll add a little color on the numbers for the quarter and update our outlook toward the end. We'll start with rental revenue. $1,204,000,000 rental revenue in the quarter, that's down $17 million or 1.3% compared to last year. The components of that really are driven by the owned equipment revenue items. Re-rent and ancillary net essentially to 0 on a year-over-year change basis.
And within OER, the volume impact was the big positive. The 3% volume increase netted $33 million of year-over-year revenue benefit. That was offset by the 2.4% decline in rental rates, which was worth about $26 million of year-over-year rental rate revenue decline. Our CapEx inflation number was about $20 million of headwind this quarter. And then we had $4 million headwind from mix and other, and it's a net of a variety of different items. So those were the key components of that $17 million year-over-year decline. Mixed in with all of that was the result of our change in the Canadian dollar. The currency impact in the quarter was about $5 million of headwind versus last year from currency strictly.
Moving briefly to used equipment sales. $134 million of used equipment sales in the quarter was $10 million better than last year. And the adjusted gross margin in the quarter was 47.8%. That was down slightly versus last year, and it primarily reflected slightly lower pricing for used equipment in the market overall, as well as a slightly greater mix of lower margin channels in the quarter, in particular, somewhat more through the vendor channel than the same quarter last year. Those are the key revenue items I wanted to mention.
Moving to profitability, starting with adjusted EBITDA. You saw $679 million for the quarter, that was down $27 million versus last year. The margin in the quarter of 47.8% was also down 1.6 percentage points in margin. And the key components were as follows: so for the $27 million year-over-year decline, $25 million was the impact of rental rates. That 2.4% rental rate impact clearly has a significant change on a year-over-year basis. Volume though offset $21 million of that $25 million rate decline.
Fleet inflation cost us about $12 million, and our used equipment sales contributed an incremental $2 million positive over last year. We have our usual merit increase impact. It was about $6 million of decline this year. And then the net of mix and all the other factors was a headwind of about $7 million. That included a little bit of a negative adjustment for incentive comp, negative in the sense that it was a greater expense this year than last year, reflecting a little bit higher accrual balance for the incentive programs. Had a little bit of a year-over-year headwind from an insurance accrual adjustment. But that was offset significantly by bad debt improvement over last year. So those are the key components within that $7 million negative from mix and all other.
Moving to adjusted EPS. You saw $2.06 for the quarter. That was $0.11 better than last year and it reflects all the factors that we talked up above, including a net impact of about $0.02 negative from the Canadian dollar. On free cash flow, you saw that we delivered $792 million of free cash flow for the year-to-date through June 30. That's about $350 million better than last year. The primary drivers really were the lower spending on CapEx. Lower spending and timing of CapEx spend was worth about $300 million of that year-over-year change. And the rest was driven by lower interest expense and timing on working capital and the year-over-year difference in operating cash flow.
On rental growth CapEx, you saw the $22 million -- the $722 million rental gross CapEx spend in the quarter. That was again consistent with the guidance that we've given about how we want to approach rental CapEx this year. It's down from a comparable period last year. And it does build in that flexibility that Mike mentioned for our ability to spend in the back half of the year. The net rental CapEx for the year was $488 million and that compared to the $569 million last year. ROIC in the quarter of 8.5% was down 50 basis points and again reflects the impact of all the factors that we've talked to so far.
Moving quickly to liquidity and capital structure. We finished the quarter with just over $1.3 billion of total liquidity. That includes $1 billion of ABL capacity that's available to us and $265 million of cash available on the balance sheet. 
We have a lot of activity on the capital structure and in particular, on debt redemptions in the quarter.  In May, we closed the redemption of our 7 3/8% and 8 1/4% notes as well as closed the new debt issue that we used to finance them. And then you saw that we announced that we will redeem the remaining balance of the 7 3/8% note, the $200 million that remains outstanding in August, that is when that will close. If you aggregate the impact of all those redemption actions so far this year, we expect that we'll be at an annualized run rate save on interest expense of about $30 million. So some significant improvements of all of those redemption actions.
We also took action to extend our ABL in the quarter so that now we have that ABL maturing in 2021. And that is the first significant debt item that we have. Our debt maturities are very clear up until that point.
Just a quick update on the share repurchase program. We bought a total of $171 million worth of shares in the quarter. That brought our year-to-date purchases to $324 million. And in fact, it brought the program-to-date purchases on this $1 billion authorization to $435 million since we've started it late last year. So we're on the pace to continue to deliver share repurchases as we've talked about recently. We're spending on a pace of about $670 million or so for this year, and we will continue to execute that on a fairly steady pace.
Regarding the limitations on restricted payments that are inherent in our -- in some of our debt, we're still in very good shape there with about $560 million of available capacity when you add both the baskets of restricted payments limitations from the debt and the cash capacity that's available at the parent URI. So well positioned to be able to continue the share repurchase program.
A couple of points on our outlook for the remainder of the year. You saw that we did not change our revenue and adjusted EBITDA ranges for the year. Neither did we change our expectations for free cash flow or CapEx spend. On CapEx, I'll just note that we did put in a range around the $1.2 billion of CapEx that we're talking about. That was really done in response to the SEC's guidance to companies that they should be reconciling any non-GAAP financial forecast that they make to the nearest GAAP indicator. The nearest GAAP indicator for free cash flow is cash from operations. And when we try to reconcile to the range that we put around free cash flow, we decided that we needed to put a range on CapEx. But it doesn't reflect any change in our thinking about spending on CapEx this year. We're still targeting the $1.2 billion that we had in our previous guidance.
The 2 changes to our guidance revolve around rate and time utilization. You saw that we raised our rate range expected for the full year to down 2% to down 3%. That's up from the down 3% to 4% that we had previously. At the same time, we lowered slightly our expectation for time utilization. We're now calling that at approximately 68% for the year, which would be about a 70 basis point improvement over last year. And really, we raised the rate and adjusted the time to reflect the experience that we had in second quarter and the approach that we're taking in managing those metrics and others for the remainder of the year.
So those are the key points of our outlook as the stand today. I know that the first question we get probably would be, how's July going so far and that in finishing out the full year guidance that we're talking about, so just a couple of key points there.
On rate, July has started out at a trend that looks like it'll bring us at around flat sequentially for the month compared to June and time utilization is up. And in fact, it's up a little bit more than what we experienced in June. So it looks like it's up about 70 basis points. It's -- that's where we are today and that's a reasonable estimate for where we might end up for the year. So those are the key points on July and again, the key points of our guidance for the remainder of this year.
One last point. Regarding guidance in future periods. We've had a lot of discussion inside the company about what are the proper elements of guidance for us to put forth that will help us have as useful a conversation with all of you as investors as we can. And we've seen over the last several quarters the challenge that we have in forecasting individual items of guidance, whether it's rate or time utilization, those 2 items in particular, those are a challenge to peg as individual elements of guidance. Why? Because we manage the company in a way that manages those 2 elements together.
So in order to get us more focused on how we approach managing the company, we've decided that we're going to eliminate providing rate and time utilization guidance starting at the beginning of 2017. We'll finish the year out with the guidance that I just outlined. And then starting in the new year, we'll eliminate those 2 elements. We will continue to provide you the actual results for rate and time after each quarter is complete in our earnings calls.
We'll also continue to provide financial guidance on revenue, EBITDA and free cash flow and our capital spend. We think this is the best way to go forward in order to have the kind of conversation that we think gives you the best insight about how we're approaching managing the business and allows us to manage the business in the way that optimizes everything that we're after.
So those are the key comments I wanted to make. I'll ask the operator now to open up the call for questions and answers."

So if you look at the range of rate guidance that we gave, if we were to deliver flat monthly sequentials for July through October.

If all of that happens, then we would go into next year with a carryover of about flat for 2017. So that's the high end of the rate range guidance. At the low end, it would take sequential declines of about 0.6%, let's say, each month from July to October in order for us to come in at the down 3% end of our rate guidance. If that happens, again, with a normal sort of November, December, we'd have a carryover going into '17 of about negative 1.5%.

So we give more credit to the opportunity that's out there and the customer demand for both of those. As far as what actions we took internally to drive May and June sequentially positive, it was really -- as we look at those 2 levers of rate and time, we came at a Q1 with rate performance that we didn't want to continue to absorb going forward, and we had a little bit of headroom on time. So we were almost myopically focused on rate to achieve that, to the point where we even achieved sequential positive rates in markets that have really tough macros like Canada. That was in June. That was a lot of cutting the tail, so to speak, really getting rid of some of the anomalies and just a very rigorous focus to reset the baseline of where our rates needed to be for us to continue to serve our customers in a profitable manner."

So there's a lot of inputs and then you have to think about different geographies and different customer sets, so there's -- and different products. So I think that Bill's point about us, the ability and how difficult it is to forecast sequential rate on its own, is proven out by the ebb and flow of what we've seen here in the first half of the year. It's a very, very dynamic metric. But as we manage the business day to day, as each manager out in the field is looking at it, you're balancing your decisions on rate and time and is that a profitable customer, not just on that individual transaction, but in the whole of our experience with that customer? So I would say, it's just putting a little more emphasis on, as I answered Scott's question, a little more emphasis on the rate than you normally would in a balanced environment to get the baseline back up to where it needed to be.

I think what we're seeing now out of the Rouse is net new acquisitions or net new fleet being added to the mix. It's not unusual because typically in the second quarter our industry it has a tendency to fleet up to capture the balance of the year. The answer is going to lie in what does the balance of the year look like. And the good part of it is there is reports now that are out there that we can have a better understanding of what is happening and make adjustments accordingly and we have done that. That's number one. Number two, I think by order of magnitude, when you ask is everyone playing safe or playing right, I think that one of the things I took away from the Rouse report, I believe it was in May, the report actually saw where the supply was below the demand, demand was higher. So that would tell me that they're -- people are being good stewards in understanding of the industry trends. The question is, does it continue? That's everyone's question."

So Bill, trying to get a little more granular here. If you're looking at flat rates for next year, where does that put you in that $1.2 billion to it $1.6 billion spectrum? Is that enough to go to the top end of that spectrum? And is -- if you're down 3% this year, do that bring you to the $1.2 billion?

Look, we will have much more conversation about it and answering a hypothetical is always a very dangerous game. What I would say is if we felt like we were carrying flat carryover into next year and if we were confident in the demand supporting that or better, then I think that you'd be -- we'd be more willing -- certainly more willing to spend more than the $1.2 billion we're doing this year. How far up we would go in that total range? Hard to say right here and now. $1.7 billion is the max that we've ever spent. $1.6 billion would be a shade under that. The question at the top end of the range is, ""Hey, would you have enough confidence in the environment to spend close to the max that you've ever spent?"" That would be a robust discussion. That said, it's on the table as we sit right here and now. More realistically, I think we're probably looking something more like what we spent last year, that $1.5 billion kind of number. Again, but that would be dependent on us saying, ""Yes, we've got a rate environment that's okay, and we've got a demand environment that looks like it's going to sustain."" And it's got to feel like it's going to sustain more than just calendar 2017, right? And so those are the kinds of things that we'd be discussing.

I'll begin my comments with our second quarter performance because it's a good reflection of our current operating environment. The market conditions are in our favor, especially",1454,"Well, thanks operator, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to our call. I'll begin my comments with our second quarter performance because it's a good reflection of our current operating environment. The market conditions are in our favor, especially in the United States. And I'll talk about some of the initiatives we have underway to capitalize on the growth and demand. And then Bill will cover our results in detail and then we'll spend the rest of the call on Q&A.
So I'll start with some of the highlights from our results. While total revenue was close to flat year-over-year, our earnings were up. Our adjusted EPS for the quarter was $2.06 per diluted share compared to $1.95 a year ago. We generated $679 million of adjusted EBITDA at a margin of 47.8%, and it was another strong quarter for free cash flow.
Now looking at the underlying metrics, time utilization increased 90 basis points year-over-year to 67.5%, which was good but a little softer than we expected. Then we drove a 3% increase in volume, and -- which was partially offset by 2.4% decrease in rental rates. It was a solid second quarter performance, and it shows that we were taking a balanced approach to managing the business.
I want to spend a few minutes on rates because I know it's a point of interest. Our second quarter rates were better than anticipated. We still expect full year rate erosion, but we now believe it may not be as deep as 4% but more likely scenario is in the 2% to 3% range. It's always difficult to forecast rate, so it's gratifying that we drove sequential rate improvements of 0.5 point or better in both May and June. In fact, May was our first sequential increase in 16 months. This comes from intense focus on rates, coupled with a deep dive into the data. We're analyzing transactions that fall outside of our rate criteria and we've had some success in turning that around.
Furthermore, the improvement was widespread. In June, for example, all of our regions took rates higher from May. Now I'll remind you of something I've said many times: rates, utilization, volume and CapEx need to work together to generate returns. And when rates go up, utilization can be impacted and vice versa. There's always a give and take between the metrics. And we also said recently we felt we could do better on rates. And in the second quarter, we did.
Now turning to our operating conditions. From what we see and hear, this cycle is intact. We've made that statement on our last call, and we believe this still holds true. Conditions remain challenging in Canada but activity is strong in many areas of our core U.S. markets. We believe the demand that we're seeing goes beyond seasonality and it shows that we're still in upcycle with an added benefit from secular penetration.
Regionally, customer activity is robust on both the East and West Coasts. The Northeast has a large number of multiyear construction projects underway. Massachusetts is a good example. We're on 2 casino projects and a railcar facility, and work began in the second quarter and should ramp up in the coming months. In our Southeast region, rental revenue was up 12%, led by South Carolina and Florida. These 2 states had increases of over 20%. On the West Coast, commercial activity is stable to up in nearly every market. The technology and entertainment sectors are driving the bulk of the commercial activity right now and infrastructure spending is strong. And nationally, our customer surveys show that optimism is still on the rise.
A key number of key market -- a number of key market indicators line up with our position. These include the ABI, which was 52.6 in June followed by another strong showing in May. The ABI has now been above 50 for 5 straight months, and nonresidential construction was up more than 7% year-over-year through May. Private nonres, which is our largest end market, was up 9.2%. And contractors are reporting sizable backlogs of project work and in some cases, stretching out more than a year. The bigger backlogs are with larger contractors where we have a competitive advantage.
Specialty rentals continue to be another factor in our favor. In the second quarter, our rental revenue from specialty segment was up 8.4% in total. Now within that, our Power & HVAC business was up 15.7% and our Trench business was up 14.9%. The Power and Trench increases were almost entirely due to same-store growth. Another one of our specialty operations, Pump Solutions, was down 5% due to the headwinds from upstream oil and gas. Excluding that sector, rental revenue from our Pump was up 21%. So we're having good success at cross-selling our Pump fleet to our current existing customer base with our Gen Rent customers and those who use our other specialty services that we offer. In the first 6 months of 2016, cross-selling revenue from Pump increased by almost 14% over the prior year.
Now of course, not everything is ideal. Industrial production is lackluster. Several of our industrial markets have been challenged by weak commodity prices and the impact of the strong U.S. dollar on exports. And the Rouse data that came out last week suggests that, in the U.S., the supply of fleet in our industry is still growing faster than demand. Much of that imbalance is driven by heavy dirt equipment, which makes up a small percentage of our fleet. But nevertheless, we obviously like to see the industry returning to  equilibrium.
In our own business, we're being very disciplined with CapEx management. For the first 6 months of 2016, we invested $722 million of gross rental CapEx compared to over $1 billion in 2015 in the same period. And we're making good on our promise at the start of the year and deploying our CapEx in a more measured pace. This gives us greater flexibility in the back half of the year.
We're always mindful of the potential for macro volatility. The financial markets got a taste of that recently with the Brexit vote. The economy in Canada remains weak, and globally, there's a sense of economic uncertainty. But we're not seeing any backlash in our markets from the macro. But if it comes to that, we'd be well prepared to manage through it. The companies that navigate the macro best are the ones that can pivot quickly, and we've shown that we're very good at that.
In addition, our customer base is much more diversified than it was 10 years ago. We have a better balance between construction and industrial business and a broader verticals strategy that limits our reliance on any one end market. We've also diversified our specialty range and expanded these operations. This has accelerated our cross-selling, which leverages our broader base. And for the second quarter, rental revenue from cross-selling companywide was up 14%.
I also want to mention an announcement that will be coming out in the next few days about the expansion of our digital customer service platform. The launch of a true e-commerce capability will give us more ways to connect with customers and engage in new markets. Our system is the first in North America to fully automate the rental transaction process end-to-end and the first to offer online ordering to all commercial renters and consumers.
We're always looking at ways to walk in our customer shoes. And while many of our customers want a consultative approach, there are always customers who know exactly what to order and prefer to operate in a more digital manner. And we're excited to give those customers a more streamlined way to transact with us.
So in conclusion, our second quarter performance is an accurate representation of where we believe we are in the cycle with significant amount of runway ahead. We have many levers inherent in our business model. We fine-tune our operations every day using CapEx, redeployment of assets, vertical strategies, cross-selling and used equipment sales and will continue to do that at every operating environment.
And as we move through 2016, we're using the inflow data to inform the balance of the year. And that's why you saw minor adjustments to our guidance last night. We want to be as accurate as possible in our communications with the investment community. And we believe our business is properly calibrated for the current market opportunity. And we see that opportunity expanding, and we're continuing to grow our end market demand.
So with that, I'll hand it over to Bill and so Bill can discuss the second quarter results. Over to you, Bill."
36005,372649692,1010171,"United Rentals, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 21, 2016",2016-07-21,"Earnings Calls","United Rentals, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mike, and good morning to everyone. As always, I'll add a little color on the numbers for the quarter and update our outlook toward the end. We'll start with rental revenue. $1,204,000,000 rental revenue in the quarter, that's down $17 million or",1799,"Thanks, Mike, and good morning to everyone. As always, I'll add a little color on the numbers for the quarter and update our outlook toward the end. We'll start with rental revenue. $1,204,000,000 rental revenue in the quarter, that's down $17 million or 1.3% compared to last year. The components of that really are driven by the owned equipment revenue items. Re-rent and ancillary net essentially to 0 on a year-over-year change basis.
And within OER, the volume impact was the big positive. The 3% volume increase netted $33 million of year-over-year revenue benefit. That was offset by the 2.4% decline in rental rates, which was worth about $26 million of year-over-year rental rate revenue decline. Our CapEx inflation number was about $20 million of headwind this quarter. And then we had $4 million headwind from mix and other, and it's a net of a variety of different items. So those were the key components of that $17 million year-over-year decline. Mixed in with all of that was the result of our change in the Canadian dollar. The currency impact in the quarter was about $5 million of headwind versus last year from currency strictly.
Moving briefly to used equipment sales. $134 million of used equipment sales in the quarter was $10 million better than last year. And the adjusted gross margin in the quarter was 47.8%. That was down slightly versus last year, and it primarily reflected slightly lower pricing for used equipment in the market overall, as well as a slightly greater mix of lower margin channels in the quarter, in particular, somewhat more through the vendor channel than the same quarter last year. Those are the key revenue items I wanted to mention.
Moving to profitability, starting with adjusted EBITDA. You saw $679 million for the quarter, that was down $27 million versus last year. The margin in the quarter of 47.8% was also down 1.6 percentage points in margin. And the key components were as follows: so for the $27 million year-over-year decline, $25 million was the impact of rental rates. That 2.4% rental rate impact clearly has a significant change on a year-over-year basis. Volume though offset $21 million of that $25 million rate decline.
Fleet inflation cost us about $12 million, and our used equipment sales contributed an incremental $2 million positive over last year. We have our usual merit increase impact. It was about $6 million of decline this year. And then the net of mix and all the other factors was a headwind of about $7 million. That included a little bit of a negative adjustment for incentive comp, negative in the sense that it was a greater expense this year than last year, reflecting a little bit higher accrual balance for the incentive programs. Had a little bit of a year-over-year headwind from an insurance accrual adjustment. But that was offset significantly by bad debt improvement over last year. So those are the key components within that $7 million negative from mix and all other.
Moving to adjusted EPS. You saw $2.06 for the quarter. That was $0.11 better than last year and it reflects all the factors that we talked up above, including a net impact of about $0.02 negative from the Canadian dollar. On free cash flow, you saw that we delivered $792 million of free cash flow for the year-to-date through June 30. That's about $350 million better than last year. The primary drivers really were the lower spending on CapEx. Lower spending and timing of CapEx spend was worth about $300 million of that year-over-year change. And the rest was driven by lower interest expense and timing on working capital and the year-over-year difference in operating cash flow.
On rental growth CapEx, you saw the $22 million -- the $722 million rental gross CapEx spend in the quarter. That was again consistent with the guidance that we've given about how we want to approach rental CapEx this year. It's down from a comparable period last year. And it does build in that flexibility that Mike mentioned for our ability to spend in the back half of the year. The net rental CapEx for the year was $488 million and that compared to the $569 million last year. ROIC in the quarter of 8.5% was down 50 basis points and again reflects the impact of all the factors that we've talked to so far.
Moving quickly to liquidity and capital structure. We finished the quarter with just over $1.3 billion of total liquidity. That includes $1 billion of ABL capacity that's available to us and $265 million of cash available on the balance sheet. 
We have a lot of activity on the capital structure and in particular, on debt redemptions in the quarter.  In May, we closed the redemption of our 7 3/8% and 8 1/4% notes as well as closed the new debt issue that we used to finance them. And then you saw that we announced that we will redeem the remaining balance of the 7 3/8% note, the $200 million that remains outstanding in August, that is when that will close. If you aggregate the impact of all those redemption actions so far this year, we expect that we'll be at an annualized run rate save on interest expense of about $30 million. So some significant improvements of all of those redemption actions.
We also took action to extend our ABL in the quarter so that now we have that ABL maturing in 2021. And that is the first significant debt item that we have. Our debt maturities are very clear up until that point.
Just a quick update on the share repurchase program. We bought a total of $171 million worth of shares in the quarter. That brought our year-to-date purchases to $324 million. And in fact, it brought the program-to-date purchases on this $1 billion authorization to $435 million since we've started it late last year. So we're on the pace to continue to deliver share repurchases as we've talked about recently. We're spending on a pace of about $670 million or so for this year, and we will continue to execute that on a fairly steady pace.
Regarding the limitations on restricted payments that are inherent in our -- in some of our debt, we're still in very good shape there with about $560 million of available capacity when you add both the baskets of restricted payments limitations from the debt and the cash capacity that's available at the parent URI. So well positioned to be able to continue the share repurchase program.
A couple of points on our outlook for the remainder of the year. You saw that we did not change our revenue and adjusted EBITDA ranges for the year. Neither did we change our expectations for free cash flow or CapEx spend. On CapEx, I'll just note that we did put in a range around the $1.2 billion of CapEx that we're talking about. That was really done in response to the SEC's guidance to companies that they should be reconciling any non-GAAP financial forecast that they make to the nearest GAAP indicator. The nearest GAAP indicator for free cash flow is cash from operations. And when we try to reconcile to the range that we put around free cash flow, we decided that we needed to put a range on CapEx. But it doesn't reflect any change in our thinking about spending on CapEx this year. We're still targeting the $1.2 billion that we had in our previous guidance.
The 2 changes to our guidance revolve around rate and time utilization. You saw that we raised our rate range expected for the full year to down 2% to down 3%. That's up from the down 3% to 4% that we had previously. At the same time, we lowered slightly our expectation for time utilization. We're now calling that at approximately 68% for the year, which would be about a 70 basis point improvement over last year. And really, we raised the rate and adjusted the time to reflect the experience that we had in second quarter and the approach that we're taking in managing those metrics and others for the remainder of the year.
So those are the key points of our outlook as the stand today. I know that the first question we get probably would be, how's July going so far and that in finishing out the full year guidance that we're talking about, so just a couple of key points there.
On rate, July has started out at a trend that looks like it'll bring us at around flat sequentially for the month compared to June and time utilization is up. And in fact, it's up a little bit more than what we experienced in June. So it looks like it's up about 70 basis points. It's -- that's where we are today and that's a reasonable estimate for where we might end up for the year. So those are the key points on July and again, the key points of our guidance for the remainder of this year.
One last point. Regarding guidance in future periods. We've had a lot of discussion inside the company about what are the proper elements of guidance for us to put forth that will help us have as useful a conversation with all of you as investors as we can. And we've seen over the last several quarters the challenge that we have in forecasting individual items of guidance, whether it's rate or time utilization, those 2 items in particular, those are a challenge to peg as individual elements of guidance. Why? Because we manage the company in a way that manages those 2 elements together.
So in order to get us more focused on how we approach managing the company, we've decided that we're going to eliminate providing rate and time utilization guidance starting at the beginning of 2017. We'll finish the year out with the guidance that I just outlined. And then starting in the new year, we'll eliminate those 2 elements. We will continue to provide you the actual results for rate and time after each quarter is complete in our earnings calls.
We'll also continue to provide financial guidance on revenue, EBITDA and free cash flow and our capital spend. We think this is the best way to go forward in order to have the kind of conversation that we think gives you the best insight about how we're approaching managing the business and allows us to manage the business in the way that optimizes everything that we're after.
So those are the key comments I wanted to make. I'll ask the operator now to open up the call for questions and answers."

So if you look at the range of rate guidance that we gave, if we were to deliver flat monthly sequentials for July through October. And then a normal kind of seasonal decline in November, December, that would put us to the minus 2% high end of our rate guidance. If all of that happens, then we would go into next year with a carryover of about flat for 2017. So that's the high end of the rate range guidance. At the low end, it would take sequential declines of about 0.6%, let's say, each month from July to October in order for us to come in at the down 3% end of our rate guidance. If that happens, again, with a normal sort of November, December, we'd have a carryover going into '17 of about negative 1.5%. So that gives you the 2 ends of the spectrum as to how we could finish out this year and what it means for next year. Hopefully, that's responsive. If not, ask another question."

So we give more credit to the opportunity that's out there and the customer demand for both of those. As far as what actions we took internally to drive May and June sequentially positive, it was really -- as we look at those 2 levers of rate and time, we came at a Q1 with rate performance that we didn't want to continue to absorb going forward, and we had a little bit of headroom on time. So we were almost myopically focused on rate to achieve that, to the point where we even achieved sequential positive rates in markets that have really tough macros like Canada. That was in June. That was a lot of cutting the tail, so to speak, really getting rid of some of the anomalies and just a very rigorous focus to reset the baseline of where our rates needed to be for us to continue to serve our customers in a profitable manner."

So there's a lot of inputs and then you have to think about different geographies and different customer sets, so there's -- and different products. So I think that Bill's point about us, the ability and how difficult it is to forecast sequential rate on its own, is proven out by the ebb and flow of what we've seen here in the first half of the year. It's a very, very dynamic metric. But as we manage the business day to day, as each manager out in the field is looking at it, you're balancing your decisions on rate and time and is that a profitable customer, not just on that individual transaction, but in the whole of our experience with that customer? So I would say, it's just putting a little more emphasis on, as I answered Scott's question, a little more emphasis on the rate than you normally would in a balanced environment to get the baseline back up to where it needed to be.

The answer is going to lie in what does the balance of the year look like. And the good part of it is there is reports now that are out there that we can have a better understanding of what is happening and make adjustments accordingly and we have done that. That's number one. Number two, I think by order of magnitude, when you ask is everyone playing safe or playing right, I think that one of the things I took away from the Rouse report, I believe it was in May, the report actually saw where the supply was below the demand, demand was higher.

And then just as a follow-up, I guess, can you just parse out which verticals are stronger, which ones are weaker and the end markets that got incrementally better or worse during the quarter?"

I mentioned the ABI, the Dodge Momentum Index is another one, nonres starts, contractor backlogs, the ISM, PMI, our own customer survey, these are -- these trend towards the positive. On the other side, we mentioned the Rouse nonres construction put in place, slowed a bit. The other part would be the construction deployment numbers that came down. One question we have to ask ourselves is how much that was due to projects related in and around the oil and also possibly some weather related price keeps on coming down here in the U.S. But when we look at our backlogs and we talk to our customers, when we look at their -- they are very optimistic and looking at -- out to next year of the projects they've got booked. I'm not going to go into details because I'm sure a lot of my competitors are on the phone too. But do I think that it will -- our overall construction would be tampered a little bit? Yes. Do I think -- has it gone down to a point where we're not going to see growth? No, I think that the fundamentals are still there as we see it today. And that's kind of how we're looking at it.

And some of the indicators that Mike pointed to, I think, would argue that we should continue to see nice growth. Maybe not quite as strong as what we saw sort of late last year, early this year in nonres, but still should be nice, right? Whether it's ABI, whether it's Dodge Momentum Index, some of the Reed starts data, backlogs that we've seen some from various industry groups, would support that, that nonres vertical should remain a solid base for us of growth. And then when you look in some of the other verticals, we've seen growth in our downstream oil and gas vertical in the most recent quarters that, that's encouraging to us. Upstream is still a challenge as you might imagine, but the refineries and some of the other related industries have been solid growth for us as well. Again, there's some timing items that flow through. But certainly, that's a nice platform for us that we think will continue to be a growth engine going forward.

And that will put us in a position so that we could spend anywhere in that range. The $1.2 billion that we're spending this year, I'll remind you, was heavily influenced by our desire to get our utilization up this year. We were down last year. We wanted to recapture that this year. And I think we're making real good progress in doing that this year. If we do what we want this year and if the market is still robust next year, which we expect, then we'll be talking about, ""Okay, what's the right number?"" and it will fall somewhere in that range.

What I would say is if we felt like we were carrying flat carryover into next year and if we were confident in the demand supporting that or better, then I think that you'd be -- we'd be more willing -- certainly more willing to spend more than the $1.2 billion we're doing this year. How far up we would go in that total range? Hard to say right here and now. $1.7 billion is the max that we've ever spent. $1.6 billion would be a shade under that. The question at the top end of the range is, ""Hey, would you have enough confidence in the environment to spend close to the max that you've ever spent?"" That would be a robust discussion. That said, it's on the table as we sit right here and now. More realistically, I think we're probably looking something more like what we spent last year, that $1.5 billion kind of number. Again, but that would be dependent on us saying, ""Yes, we've got a rate environment that's okay, and we've got a demand environment that looks like it's going to sustain.""

I'll begin my comments with our second quarter performance because it's a good reflection of our current operating environment. The market conditions are in our favor, especially in the United States. And I'll talk about some of the initiatives we have underway to capitalize on the growth and demand. And then Bill will cover our results in detail and then we'll spend the rest of the call on Q&A.
So I'll start with some of the highlights from our results. While total revenue was close to flat year-over-year, our earnings were up. Our adjusted EPS for the quarter was $2.06 per diluted share compared to $1.95 a year ago. We generated $679 million of adjusted EBITDA at a margin of 47.8%, and it was another strong quarter for free cash flow.
Now looking at the underlying metrics, time utilization increased 90 basis points year-over-year to 67.5%, which was good but a little softer than we expected. Then we drove a 3% increase in volume, and -- which was partially offset by 2.4% decrease in rental rates. It was a solid second quarter performance, and it shows that we were taking a balanced approach to managing the business.
I want to spend a few minutes on rates because I know it's a point of interest. Our second quarter rates were better than anticipated. We still expect full year rate erosion, but we now believe it may not be as deep as 4% but more likely scenario is in the 2% to 3% range. It's always difficult to forecast rate, so it's gratifying that we drove sequential rate improvements of 0.5 point or better in both May and June. In fact, May was our first sequential increase in 16 months. This comes from intense focus on rates, coupled with a deep dive into the data. We're analyzing transactions that fall outside of our rate criteria and we've had some success in turning that around.
Furthermore, the improvement was widespread. In June, for example, all of our regions took rates higher from May. Now I'll remind you of something I've said many times: rates, utilization, volume and CapEx need to work together to generate returns. And when rates go up, utilization can be impacted and vice versa. There's always a give and take between the metrics. And we also said recently we felt we could do better on rates. And in the second quarter, we did.
Now turning to our operating conditions. From what we see and hear, this cycle is intact. We've made that statement on our last call, and we believe this still holds true. Conditions remain challenging in Canada but activity is strong in many areas of our core U.S. markets. We believe the demand that we're seeing goes beyond seasonality and it shows that we're still in upcycle with an added benefit from secular penetration.
Regionally, customer activity is robust on both the East and West Coasts. The Northeast has a large number of multiyear construction projects underway. Massachusetts is a good example. We're on 2 casino projects and a railcar facility, and work began in the second quarter and should ramp up in the coming months. In our Southeast region, rental revenue was up 12%, led by South Carolina and Florida. These 2 states had increases of over 20%. On the West Coast, commercial activity is stable to up in nearly every market. The technology and entertainment sectors are driving the bulk of the commercial activity right now and infrastructure spending is strong. And nationally, our customer surveys show that optimism is still on the rise.
A key number of key market -- a number of key market indicators line up with our position. These include the ABI, which was 52.6 in June followed by another strong showing in May. The ABI has now been above 50 for 5 straight months, and nonresidential construction was up more than 7% year-over-year through May. Private nonres, which is our largest end market, was up 9.2%. And contractors are reporting sizable backlogs of project work and in some cases, stretching out more than a year. The bigger backlogs are with larger contractors where we have a competitive advantage.
Specialty rentals continue to be another factor in our favor. In the second quarter, our rental revenue from specialty segment was up 8.4% in total. Now within that, our Power & HVAC business was up 15.7% and our Trench business was up 14.9%. The Power and Trench increases were almost entirely due to same-store growth. Another one of our specialty operations, Pump Solutions, was down 5% due to the headwinds from upstream oil and gas. Excluding that sector, rental revenue from our Pump was up 21%. So we're having good success at cross-selling our Pump fleet to our current existing customer base with our Gen Rent customers and those who use our other specialty services that we offer. In the first 6 months of 2016, cross-selling revenue from Pump increased by almost 14% over the prior year.
Now of course, not everything is ideal. Industrial production is lackluster. Several of our industrial markets have been challenged by weak commodity prices and the impact of the strong U.S. dollar on exports. And the Rouse data that came out last week suggests that, in the U.S., the supply of fleet in our industry is still growing faster than demand. Much of that imbalance is driven by heavy dirt equipment, which makes up a small percentage of our fleet. But nevertheless, we obviously like to see the industry returning to  equilibrium.
In our own business, we're being very disciplined with CapEx management. For the first 6 months of 2016, we invested $722 million of gross rental CapEx compared to over $1 billion in 2015 in the same period. And we're making good on our promise at the start of the year and deploying our CapEx in a more measured pace. This gives us greater flexibility in the back half of the year.
We're always mindful of the potential for macro volatility. The financial markets got a taste of that recently with the Brexit vote. The economy in Canada remains weak, and globally, there's a sense of economic uncertainty. But we're not seeing any backlash in our markets from the macro. But if it comes to that, we'd be well prepared to manage through it. The companies that navigate the macro best are the ones that can pivot quickly, and we've shown that we're very good at that.
In addition, our customer base is much more diversified than it was 10 years ago. We have a better balance between construction and industrial business and a broader verticals strategy that limits our reliance on any one end market. We've also diversified our specialty range and expanded these operations. This has accelerated our cross-selling, which leverages our broader base. And for the second quarter, rental revenue from cross-selling companywide was up 14%.
I also want to mention an announcement that will be coming out in the next few days about the expansion of our digital customer service platform. The launch of a true e-commerce capability will give us more ways to connect with customers and engage in new markets. Our system is the first in North America to fully automate the rental transaction process end-to-end and the first to offer online ordering to all commercial renters and consumers.
We're always looking at ways to walk in our customer shoes. And while many of our customers want a consultative approach, there are always customers who know exactly what to order and prefer to operate in a more digital manner. And we're excited to give those customers a more streamlined way to transact with us.
So in conclusion, our second quarter performance is an accurate representation of where we believe we are in the cycle with significant amount of runway ahead. We have many levers inherent in our business model. We fine-tune our operations every day using CapEx, redeployment of assets, vertical strategies, cross-selling and used equipment sales and will continue to do that at every operating environment.
And as we move through 2016, we're using the inflow data to inform the balance of the year. And that's why you saw minor adjustments to our guidance last night. We want to be as accurate as possible in our communications with the investment community. And we believe our business is properly calibrated for the current market opportunity. And we see that opportunity expanding, and we're continuing to grow our end market demand.
So with that, I'll hand it over to Bill and so Bill can discuss the second quarter results. Over to you, Bill."
36005,372649692,1011132,"United Rentals, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 21, 2016",2016-07-21,"Earnings Calls","United Rentals, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mike, and good morning to everyone. As always, I'll add a little color on the numbers for the quarter and update our outlook toward the end. We'll start with rental revenue. $1,204,000,000 rental revenue in the quarter, that's down $17 million or",1799,"Thanks, Mike, and good morning to everyone. As always, I'll add a little color on the numbers for the quarter and update our outlook toward the end. We'll start with rental revenue. $1,204,000,000 rental revenue in the quarter, that's down $17 million or 1.3% compared to last year. The components of that really are driven by the owned equipment revenue items. Re-rent and ancillary net essentially to 0 on a year-over-year change basis.
And within OER, the volume impact was the big positive. The 3% volume increase netted $33 million of year-over-year revenue benefit. That was offset by the 2.4% decline in rental rates, which was worth about $26 million of year-over-year rental rate revenue decline. Our CapEx inflation number was about $20 million of headwind this quarter. And then we had $4 million headwind from mix and other, and it's a net of a variety of different items. So those were the key components of that $17 million year-over-year decline. Mixed in with all of that was the result of our change in the Canadian dollar. The currency impact in the quarter was about $5 million of headwind versus last year from currency strictly.
Moving briefly to used equipment sales. $134 million of used equipment sales in the quarter was $10 million better than last year. And the adjusted gross margin in the quarter was 47.8%. That was down slightly versus last year, and it primarily reflected slightly lower pricing for used equipment in the market overall, as well as a slightly greater mix of lower margin channels in the quarter, in particular, somewhat more through the vendor channel than the same quarter last year. Those are the key revenue items I wanted to mention.
Moving to profitability, starting with adjusted EBITDA. You saw $679 million for the quarter, that was down $27 million versus last year. The margin in the quarter of 47.8% was also down 1.6 percentage points in margin. And the key components were as follows: so for the $27 million year-over-year decline, $25 million was the impact of rental rates. That 2.4% rental rate impact clearly has a significant change on a year-over-year basis. Volume though offset $21 million of that $25 million rate decline.
Fleet inflation cost us about $12 million, and our used equipment sales contributed an incremental $2 million positive over last year. We have our usual merit increase impact. It was about $6 million of decline this year. And then the net of mix and all the other factors was a headwind of about $7 million. That included a little bit of a negative adjustment for incentive comp, negative in the sense that it was a greater expense this year than last year, reflecting a little bit higher accrual balance for the incentive programs. Had a little bit of a year-over-year headwind from an insurance accrual adjustment. But that was offset significantly by bad debt improvement over last year. So those are the key components within that $7 million negative from mix and all other.
Moving to adjusted EPS. You saw $2.06 for the quarter. That was $0.11 better than last year and it reflects all the factors that we talked up above, including a net impact of about $0.02 negative from the Canadian dollar. On free cash flow, you saw that we delivered $792 million of free cash flow for the year-to-date through June 30. That's about $350 million better than last year. The primary drivers really were the lower spending on CapEx. Lower spending and timing of CapEx spend was worth about $300 million of that year-over-year change. And the rest was driven by lower interest expense and timing on working capital and the year-over-year difference in operating cash flow.
On rental gross CapEx, you saw the $22 million -- the $722 million rental gross CapEx spend in the quarter. That was again consistent with the guidance that we've given about how we want to approach rental CapEx this year. It's down from a comparable period last year. And it does build in that flexibility that Mike mentioned for our ability to spend in the back half of the year. The net rental CapEx for the year was $488 million and that compared to the $569 million last year. ROIC in the quarter of 8.5% was down 50 basis points and again reflects the impact of all the factors that we've talked to so far.
Moving quickly to liquidity and capital structure. We finished the quarter with just over $1.3 billion of total liquidity. That includes $1 billion of ABL capacity that's available to us and $265 million of cash available on the balance sheet. 
We have a lot of activity on the capital structure and in particular, on debt redemptions in the quarter.  In May, we closed the redemption of our 7 3/8% and 8 1/4% notes as well as closed the new debt issue that we used to finance them. And then you saw that we announced that we will redeem the remaining balance of the 7 3/8% note, the $200 million that remains outstanding in August, that is when that will close. If you aggregate the impact of all those redemption actions so far this year, we expect that we'll be at an annualized run rate save on interest expense of about $30 million. So some significant improvements of all of those redemption actions.
We also took action to extend our ABL in the quarter so that now we have that ABL maturing in 2021. And that is the first significant debt item that we have. Our debt maturities are very clear up until that point.
Just a quick update on the share repurchase program. We bought a total of $171 million worth of shares in the quarter. That brought our year-to-date purchases to $324 million. And in fact, it brought the program-to-date purchases on this $1 billion authorization to $435 million since we've started it late last year. So we're on the pace to continue to deliver share repurchases as we've talked about recently. We're spending on a pace of about $670 million or so for this year, and we will continue to execute that on a fairly steady pace.
Regarding the limitations on restricted payments that are inherent in our -- in some of our debt, we're still in very good shape there with about $560 million of available capacity when you add both the baskets of restricted payments limitations from the debt and the cash capacity that's available at the parent URI. So well positioned to be able to continue the share repurchase program.
A couple of points on our outlook for the remainder of the year. You saw that we did not change our revenue and adjusted EBITDA ranges for the year. Neither did we change our expectations for free cash flow or CapEx spend. On CapEx, I'll just note that we did put in a range around the $1.2 billion of CapEx that we're talking about. That was really done in response to the SEC's guidance to companies that they should be reconciling any non-GAAP financial forecast that they make to the nearest GAAP indicator. The nearest GAAP indicator for free cash flow is cash from operations. And when we try to reconcile to the range that we put around free cash flow, we decided that we needed to put a range on CapEx. But it doesn't reflect any change in our thinking about spending on CapEx this year. We're still targeting the $1.2 billion that we had in our previous guidance.
The 2 changes to our guidance revolve around rate and time utilization. You saw that we raised our rate range expected for the full year to down 2% to down 3%. That's up from the down 3% to 4% that we had previously. At the same time, we lowered slightly our expectation for time utilization. We're now calling that at approximately 68% for the year, which would be about a 70 basis point improvement over last year. And really, we raised the rate and adjusted the time to reflect the experience that we had in second quarter and the approach that we're taking in managing those metrics and others for the remainder of the year.
So those are the key points of our outlook as the stand today. I know that the first question we get probably would be, how's July going so far and that in finishing out the full year guidance that we're talking about, so just a couple of key points there.
On rate, July has started out at a trend that looks like it'll bring us at around flat sequentially for the month compared to June and time utilization is up. And in fact, it's up a little bit more than what we experienced in June. So it looks like it's up about 70 basis points. It's -- that's where we are today and that's a reasonable estimate for where we might end up for the year. So those are the key points on July and again, the key points of our guidance for the remainder of this year.
One last point. Regarding guidance in future periods. We've had a lot of discussion inside the company about what are the proper elements of guidance for us to put forth that will help us have as useful a conversation with all of you as investors as we can. And we've seen over the last several quarters the challenge that we have in forecasting individual items of guidance, whether it's rate or time utilization, those 2 items in particular, those are a challenge to peg as individual elements of guidance. Why? Because we manage the company in a way that manages those 2 elements together.
So in order to get us more focused on how we approach managing the company, we've decided that we're going to eliminate providing rate and time utilization guidance starting at the beginning of 2017. We'll finish the year out with the guidance that I just outlined. And then starting in the new year, we'll eliminate those 2 elements. We will continue to provide you the actual results for rate and time after each quarter is complete in our earnings calls.
We'll also continue to provide financial guidance on revenue, EBITDA and free cash flow and our capital spend. We think this is the best way to go forward in order to have the kind of conversation that we think gives you the best insight about how we're approaching managing the business and allows us to manage the business in the way that optimizes everything that we're after.
So those are the key comments I wanted to make. I'll ask the operator now to open up the call for questions and answers."

So if you look at the range of rate guidance that we gave, if we were to deliver flat monthly sequentials for July through October. And then a normal kind of seasonal decline in November, December, that would put us to the minus 2% high end of our rate guidance. If all of that happens, then we would go into next year with a carryover of about flat for 2017. So that's the high end of the rate range guidance. At the low end, it would take sequential declines of about 0.6%, let's say, each month from July to October in order for us to come in at the down 3% end of our rate guidance. If that happens, again, with a normal sort of November, December, we'd have a carryover going into '17 of about negative 1.5%. So that gives you the 2 ends of the spectrum as to how we could finish out this year and what it means for next year. Hopefully, that's responsive. If not, ask another question."

As far as what actions we took internally to drive May and June sequentially positive, it was really -- as we look at those 2 levers of rate and time, we came at a Q1 with rate performance that we didn't want to continue to absorb going forward, and we had a little bit of headroom on time. So we were almost myopically focused on rate to achieve that, to the point where we even achieved sequential positive rates in markets that have really tough macros like Canada. That was in June. That was a lot of cutting the tail, so to speak, really getting rid of some of the anomalies and just a very rigorous focus to reset the baseline of where our rates needed to be for us to continue to serve our customers in a profitable manner."

So there's a lot of inputs and then you have to think about different geographies and different customer sets, so there's -- and different products. So I think that Bill's point about us, the ability and how difficult it is to forecast sequential rate on its own, is proven out by the ebb and flow of what we've seen here in the first half of the year. It's a very, very dynamic metric. But as we manage the business day to day, as each manager out in the field is looking at it, you're balancing your decisions on rate and time and is that a profitable customer, not just on that individual transaction, but in the whole of our experience with that customer? So I would say, it's just putting a little more emphasis on, as I answered Scott's question, a little more emphasis on the rate than you normally would in a balanced environment to get the baseline back up to where it needed to be.

It's not unusual because typically in the second quarter our industry it has a tendency to fleet up to capture the balance of the year. The answer is going to lie in what does the balance of the year look like. And the good part of it is there is reports now that are out there that we can have a better understanding of what is happening and make adjustments accordingly and we have done that. That's number one. Number two, I think by order of magnitude, when you ask is everyone playing safe or playing right, I think that one of the things I took away from the Rouse report, I believe it was in May, the report actually saw where the supply was below the demand, demand was higher. So that would tell me that they're -- people are being good stewards in understanding of the industry trends. The question is, does it continue? That's everyone's question."

And we take that leadership position very seriously. And there's always going to be, in any given market, somebody that wants what you have. That's nothing new, by the way.

As far as fleet movement, I think that we've pretty much moved the fleet out of Canada that we need to. As we sit here today, our Canadian business is down over 11%, but that's only 3.1% on fleet-on-rent volume. It's almost 8% on rate. So we think we've got the fleet rightsized in Canada. And I think most of our competitors have done the right thing as well and gotten their footprints and their headcount and their fleet rationalized to the current market conditions."

How far up we would go in that total range? Hard to say right here and now. $1.7 billion is the max that we've ever spent. $1.6 billion would be a shade under that. The question at the top end of the range is, ""Hey, would you have enough confidence in the environment to spend close to the max that you've ever spent?"" That would be a robust discussion. That said, it's on the table as we sit right here and now. More realistically, I think we're probably looking something more like what we spent last year, that $1.5 billion kind of number.

And maybe educate me, when you say Trench and other, how much is that capturing any of the specialty rental? I'm just surprised that the dollar ute's been that weak. It's actually been the weakest of your 4 major categories you provide us with the data."

Before I begin, I want to mention our upcoming Analyst Day, which will be held on Thursday, December 1, in New York. We hold this conference every 2 years, and the webcast is the most attended event. 
This time, I will talk -- we're taking a deep dive into different initiatives we have underway, including customer strategies, fleet management, process innovations and other areas that demonstrate how we're maximizing the value of our company for shareholders. Hope you [ph] join us.
Now let's go into the quarter. Our operating environment played out largely as we expected. Demand continued to trend up, driving an increase in volume of equipment on rent. Our specialty operations continued to outperform both the rental industry and our company as a whole, delivering solid benefits to revenue, margin and returns. And major initiatives such as cross-selling are ramping up nicely. The revenue contribution from cross-selling has increased sequentially throughout 2016. In the third quarter, cross-selling to National Accounts grew by a robust 14% year-over-year.
Now these gains were offset by 3 ongoing headwinds in our industry. They are the Canadian economy, upstream oil and gas and the current fleet imbalance. But overall, the market continues to move in our favor.
Against this backdrop, we did a good job with rental revenue. On a year-over-year basis, revenue was essentially flat despite softer rates. We are pleased to deliver adjusted EPS of $2.58 per diluted share, and as well as adjusted EBITDA of $747 million at a margin of 49.5%. And free cash flow continued to be a robust $846 million through September 1, while our CapEx spending stayed on plan.
Now based on this performance, and given the visibility into the fourth quarter, we've narrowed some of our guidance to help you model of our business. Now we now expect full year adjusted EBITDA to be at the top end of the range we've previously provided. We also feel confident that we can improve on our full year rate decline we forecasted earlier with no significant impact to time utilization. And we expect record free cash flow of more than $1 billion, which would exceed our original guidance. And as we consider the best way to service our large contract wins, we may buy up to an additional $50 million of fleet in the fourth quarter. So no surprises in terms of the cycle or our own performance. I would characterize this [ph] as being right on track.
Next I want to spend a few minutes on our operating environment. There are some positive indicators. Dodge has reported that new construction starts are up 22% sequentially in August, with the most meaningful gains coming from commercial and public construction. Nonresidential starts increased significantly, overall up 43% in August and another 5% in September. This is consistent with other U.S. construction data, which show that backlogs for large contractors hit a new high this year, and many of these jobs can take months or years to complete, which gives us added visibility into demand going forward.
Another key bellwether is our customer survey. Our customers felt good about their business prospects throughout the quarter. In fact, the August survey indicated the strongest optimism of the past 9 months. And the September employment report was also encouraging. It showed that jobs in the U.S. construction sector increased for the first time in months.
While there's some evidence of headwinds, such as a modest contraction in the Architectural Billings Index in August, overall, the market feels positive to us. So it's a lively marketplace for us in the U.S. with a strong pipeline of new projects breaking ground. 
Geographically, we're seeing the most growth on the East and West Coasts. On the West Coast, 1 of 4 [ph] major construction projects that will run through at least midyear 2017. Another 2 sites are starting up this quarter. Solar power and automotive are 2 key verticals, and government spending in California remains robust. 
In the Mid-Atlantic, our business is trending up from the past 2 quarters with a healthy mix of projects. These include power and pharmaceutical plants, a casino, hospital, airport renovation and retail malls.
Further south, a number of tourism projects are driving growth, and automotive plans are underway in South Carolina. The Metro -- the Southeast Metro areas overall continued to represent large opportunities for both our Gen Rent and specialty operations.
And I want to give a shout out to our employees in the Southeast, who have been working long hours in disaster recovery mode following Hurricane Matthew. Our people are doing a stellar job of helping hard-hit communities in Northern Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas, and the restoration in these states could take years to complete. That's the U.S. snapshot. 
By contrast, the Canadian economy is still a challenge, compounded by the energy sector in Western provinces. Rental revenue from Canada in the quarter declined by approximately 10%.
Now the [ph] fine line for us in this environment is to invest enough growth capital to serve our customers and grow our business without adding to the industry imbalance of fleet. So we're walking that line really well in 2016. We continued to use a balanced strategy of deploying our CapEx in a very informed manner while also relocating our existing fleet away from softer markets.
The major beneficiary to our growth CapEx, as we've noted before, is our specialty segment. In the third quarter, specialty had a strong showing. Rental revenue for this segment increased by more than 9% in the quarter versus 2015. Now within that segment, revenue from Power & HVAC was up 17% and Trench Safety was up over 5%. The largest tailwind behind these 2 increases was same-store growth. We also had a 5% revenue growth in pump, where our strategy of end-market diversification is paying off, and we seem to be at a turning point in neutralizing the drag for upstream oil and gas. 
And finally, I want to give you an update on our digital strategy. We've gone from 0 to over $1 million a month in online orders in just 12 weeks. So while this strategy is still very young, we've seen enough to know it's got legs. Some of the business is coming from our existing customers who want the digital convenience and some are from first-time customers. And we're achieving both of our objectives with e-commerce, which are to increase the stickiness with our current base and to capture more customers to win new channel.
So to recap the quarter. There were no surprises. The company is solidly on track, and we're continuing to focus on with the many levers within our control. Demand is also on track, based on what we saw in the quarter and what we hear from our customers, and we believe the cycle still has runway ahead.
And our full year results should be near the upper half of our prior guidance in a number of key metrics, and we expect free -- our free cash flow to be more than $1 billion this year. 
Naturally, we're mindful of the uncertainty that continues to be prevalent in the global economy, but I also want to remind you that we have considerable flexibility in operating our business to address any change in market dynamics. It gives us a great deal of confidence in managing the business for the strong full year performance we have reaffirmed today. 
So with that, I'll ask Bill to discuss the numbers, and then we'll take your questions. Over to you, Bill."
36005,404024657,1057690,"United Rentals, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 20, 2016",2016-10-20,"Earnings Calls","United Rentals, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mike, and good morning to everyone. As usual, we'll step through the highlights in the quarter and then update our outlook to finish up. So let's start with rental revenue. That was down $4 million year-over-year or 0.3%. Within that $4 million, r",1676,"Thanks, Mike, and good morning to everyone. As usual, we'll step through the highlights in the quarter and then update our outlook to finish up. So let's start with rental revenue. That was down $4 million year-over-year or 0.3%. Within that $4 million, re-rent and ancillary revenues in the quarter were actually up $5 million over the last year; as was the volume component, change in OEC on rent, which was a positive $26 million contribution from last year. 
The offsets to those were rental rates. That down 1.7% translates into about $19 million of year-over-year decline and our replacement CapEx inflation, which was worth about $18 million of year-over-year decline. The remainder was mix and other, which was a positive $2 million versus last year. So all of those net to the $4 million or 0.3% decline.
Within that rental revenue result, the Canadian currency impact this quarter was fairly minimal. The currency was basically unchanged from last year and so had no significant effect on the overall rental revenue performance. But if you look at the effect of the entirety of our Canadian operations, it still represented a headwind. Excluding Canada, our U.S. revenue -- U.S. only revenue would have been up 0.8%. So a significant impact from Canada, and we can touch more on the Q&A if there are questions. 
Our used equipment sales result for the quarter was $112 million of used equipment revenue. That was down $29 million or just under 21% compared to last year. That decrease was primarily driven by the high level of used sales that we had last year as we were moving equipment in response to the oil and gas challenge that we said it saw last year. So that decline in revenue we think was mitigated somewhat by the fact that we used our retail channel more significantly this year. 
In fact, you can see it in the adjusted gross margin result. Adjusted gross margin this quarter was 46.4%, and that was 2.4 percentage points better than last year. And certainly, that benefited from a much stronger use of the retail channel and much less use of auctions [ph] this year compared to last year. 
Moving quickly to adjusted EBITDA. The $747 million of adjusted EBITDA we reported was down $33 million versus last year, and that reflected the pressures that I -- or the puts and takes that I talked about in the rental revenue description. In particular, rental rates cost us about $19 million versus last year, but volume offset $17 million of that headwind during the quarter. But the inflation, however, cost us about $15 million compared to last year, and the used equipment result cost us another $12 million. Merit increases, we always call out, worth about $6 million year-over-year headwind, and then the mix and other was a $2 million positive impact. So those were the pieces of the $33 million year-over-year decline in adjusted EBITDA. 
Our adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter was 49.5%. That was down 80 basis points versus last year, and again, it reflects all the components that we talked about here previously. 
Just a quick update. Within that EBITDA performance was our Lean contribution for the year. Updating that progress, we ended the quarter at an annualized run rate of $96 million contribution from our Lean and other savings initiatives, and that compares to the $81 million we reported at the end of the second quarter. So making nice progress and, as all -- you all know, that we're targeting a $100 million run rate by the end of this year, and we still feel very comfortable about achieving that $100 million target by the end of December. 
On adjusted EPS, $2.58 for the quarter was up $0.01 versus last year. And again, it had de minimis impact from currency in the year. And obviously reflected the impact of the operational results that we talked about as well as the benefit of the share repurchase that I'll touch on a little bit later. 
Free cash flow during the quarter -- or excuse me, year-to-date period free cash flow was $846 million, and that was better by 300 -- almost $340 million compared to last year. And the primary drivers were lower rental CapEx spending. That was worth about $200 million -- $280 million compared to last year, right, for the year-to-date period. We also had lower cash taxes, roughly $41 million; and timing of working capital was a benefit versus last year of roughly $110 million. Those were the positives, and they offset, on a year-over-year basis, the decline in adjusted EBITDA that we've seen year-to-date. 
Our net debt finished the quarter at $7.7 billion, and that was down roughly $640 million compared to where it was in September of last year. Now a good portion of that change is timing, so don't extrapolate it to the year-end, but we're still going to finish the year with a very, very significant reduction in our overall net debt position. And I think that speaks to the cash flow benefits that we've been experiencing as well. 
On the CapEx front, our gross rental CapEx in the quarter was $423 million. That was up from last year about $15 million, and it brought our full year-to-date CapEx spend to $1.145 billion, on our way to that $1.2 billion to $1.250 billion range that we updated in our outlook, which, again, I'll again -- touch on again in a minute. Net rental CapEx for the quarter was $311 million. That's up from last year, and it primarily reflected the difference in used equipment sales as well as some timing effects. 
When you put it all together, our ROIC performance in the quarter was down 70 basis points to 8.3% in the quarter, obviously reflecting the impact of the operating measures, particularly rate, as we discussed previously. 
On liquidity, we finished the quarter with just under $1.1 billion of total liquidity, and that includes about $720 million so of -- or so of ABL capacity available to us as well as just under $300 million worth of cash on the balance sheet. 
The capital structure, just briefly, you all recall that, during the second quarter, we had some redemptions. We completed those actions during the course of the third quarter by redeeming the remaining $200 million of our 7 3/8% notes. We funded that redemption in Q3 by a draw on the ABL. So when you put all the actions on the capital structure together, for the year, we're at an annualized savings of about $30 million of interest for the future periods. 
So quick update on the share repurchase program. We bought $152 million worth of shares during the course of Q3. That brings our year-to-date total for share repurchase to $476 million. And if you extend the look back to the beginning of this current authorization, the $1 billion authorization, we've now spent $587 million of that $1 billion of authorization that we have. 
Our plan for the remainder of this year is to continue on the pace that we've been. We've been talking about a pace of spend of roughly $150 million, $160 million a quarter, and we plan to continue on that pace in Q4. We have the flexibility to be able to execute the share repurchase. 
Just an update on the covenant and cash position. We finished the quarter with about $560 million worth of capacity for share repurchases under our restricted [ph] payments limitation plus the cash on the balance sheet. 
Let me finish out [ph] with an update to our outlook for the full year and a quick comment on October. The outlook you've seen in the press release, but just to hit a couple of key points. We've narrowed the range of most of our outlook measures in order to reflect the fact that we've got 9 of the 12 months already in the books. And so our rental revenue is now within $100 million range of between $5.650 billion and $ billion -- excuse me, total revenue is within a range of $5.650 billion to $5.750 billion. 
EBITDA we narrowed to a $50 million, which a bottom of the range at $2.7 million, going up to $2.75 billion. And levels in the red our rate guidance we've narrowed that to 2.1% to 2.3% declines plans for the full year. I mentioned and Michael mentioned, our CapEx plant right now we're going and a range of $1.2 billion to $1.25 billion. With any incremental spend be in targeted at specific projects that we been's awarded and authority to spend in order to support those customer needs. 
And finally, we mentioned the Power improved outlook for free cash flow takes us to at least $1 billion, call it $1.1 billion -- excuse me, $1 billion to $1.1 billion of free cash flow over the course of the full year. 
Regards October. Our rate performance so far in October is trending toward to a flat to slightly down results for the full month of October on a sequential month basis. And if you look at where we are on the time utilization for the month of October, month to-date, our average is up about 80 basis points over where it was last year your and if you look at it just on a 1-day snap shot as of today, we're actually up 100 basis points over where we work on a comparable to last year. So that supports the trend in improvement in the utilization that we would need in order to deliver the time utilization outlook that we have for the full year. 
That full year outlook is approximately 67.8%, and we would be something like 80 basis points each month the remainder of the year in order to hit that time utilization guidance. So those are the key points that I wanted to make. I'll stop there and ask the operator to open up the call here for questions and answers. Operator?"

Our rental revenue for the quarter was down 10.7%. But most of that was rate, that was 5.3% rate decrease. But their volume, they're always see on rent only down ddone 4% and that's after report 8 over 8 fleet out of there. So we feel that we've privatized our business from the fleets headcount and footprint perspective without damaging our ability to participate in whatever they get some tailwinds at their backs. They've done a good job mitigating that 10% through the P&L without weakening our positioning. Hopefully next year, they get some tailwinds."

The remaining 3 months are going to be -- pretty hard to move that full year rate down significantly. Just to give you a specific set of numbers in order to get to that 2.1 decline in rental rates for the full year, October, November, December would all have to be down 2/10 each. That's not a ridiculous notion. But in order to get to the down 2.3 scenario for the full year, each of those months would have to be down 6/10 sequentially. I think it's highly unlikely that we're going to do that and certainly even more unlikely that it will be worse than that. So just look at the raw mathematics that would it would take another to come outside of the range of rates that we've given. That 2.1 to 2.3 seems pretty well assured and it's not ridiculous to think that could we see minus 2/10 each month for the remainder of the year? It's not completely ridiculous even if we didn't see minus 2/10 if we do something worse like November, December. We're still can end up in that pretty decent place within that 2.1 to 2.3 decline range. One other point is to react to the question that we may get from someone, our carryover for next year, if we keep the 2.1 scenario would be positive 1/10 for the full year, right? So if we finish the year, October, November, December, down 2/10 each month sequentially, that gives the full year 2.1 decline and carryover going to next year would actually be slightly positive. On the flip side, just to be fair, if we finish with the down 2.3 scenario, our carryover next year would be minus 9/10 of a percent. Not an incredible headwind to overcome in over to get the positive rate. But certainly in the current environment, that would be a tougher starting point but still 1 that doesn't make 2017 a complete awash. so that math is what gives me confidence, George, in saying we're going to be in that 2.1 to 2.3 range that we gave."

So we have been seeing some pricing pressure just on a raw basis year-over-year and that's been the case for a number of months. I think it's encouraging though that we can still move the equipment to the channels that are most attractive and still keep the margins at a pretty attractive level. If you look at pricing relative to the original equipment cost of the fleet that we sold in Q3, I do have that compared to Q2. It wasn't a significant change, right, on a sequential basis, price as a percent [indiscernible] of OEC that didn't change significantly Q2 to Q3.

Before I begin, I want to mention our upcoming Analyst Day, which will be held on Thursday, December 1, in New York. We hold this conference every 2 years, and the webcast is the most attended event. 
This time, I will talk -- we're taking a deep dive into different initiatives we have underway, including customer strategies, fleet management, process innovations and other areas that demonstrate how we're maximizing the value of our company for shareholders. Hope you'll join us.
Now let's go into the quarter. Our operating environment played out largely as we expected. Demand continued to trend up, driving an increase in volume of equipment on rent. Our specialty operations continued to outperform both the rental industry and our company as a whole, delivering solid benefits to revenue, margin and returns. And major initiatives such as cross-selling are ramping up nicely. The revenue contribution from cross-selling has increased sequentially throughout 2016. In the third quarter, cross-selling to National Accounts grew by a robust 14% year-over-year.
Now these gains were offset by 3 ongoing headwinds in our industry. They are the Canadian economy, upstream oil and gas and the current fleet imbalance. But overall, the market continues to move in our favor.
Against this backdrop, we did a good job with rental revenue. On a year-over-year basis, revenue was essentially flat despite softer rates. We are pleased to deliver adjusted EPS of $2.58 per diluted share, and as well as adjusted EBITDA of $747 million at a margin of 49.5%. And free cash flow continued to be a robust $846 million through September 1, while our CapEx spending stayed on plan.
Now based on this performance, and given the visibility into the fourth quarter, we've narrowed some of our guidance to help you model of our business. Now we now expect full year adjusted EBITDA to be at the top end of the range we've previously provided. We also feel confident that we can improve on our full year rate decline we forecasted earlier with no significant impact to time utilization. And we expect record free cash flow of more than $1 billion, which would exceed our original guidance. And as we consider the best way to service our large contract wins, we may buy up to an additional $50 million of fleet in the fourth quarter. So no surprises in terms of the cycle or our own performance, and I would characterize it as being right on track.
Next I want to spend a few minutes on our operating environment. There are some positive indicators. Dodge has reported that new construction starts are up 22% sequentially in August, with the most meaningful gains coming from commercial and public construction. Nonresidential starts increased significantly, overall up 43% in August and another 5% in September. This is consistent with other U.S. construction data, which show that backlogs for large contractors hit a new high this year, and many of these jobs can take months or years to complete, which gives us added visibility into demand going forward.
Another key bellwether is our customer survey. Our customers felt good about their business prospects throughout the quarter. In fact, the August survey indicated the strongest optimism of the past 9 months. And the September employment report was also encouraging. It showed that jobs in the U.S. construction sector increased for the first time in months.
While there's some evidence of headwinds, such as a modest contraction in the Architectural Billings Index in August, overall, the market feels positive to us. So it's a lively marketplace for us in the U.S. with a strong pipeline of new projects breaking ground. 
Geographically, we're seeing the most growth on the East and West Coasts. On the West Coast, we're on 4 major construction projects that will run through at least midyear 2017. Another 2 sites are starting up this quarter. Solar power and automotive are 2 key verticals, and government spending in California remains robust. 
In the Mid-Atlantic, our business is trending up from the past 2 quarters with a healthy mix of projects. These include power and pharmaceutical plants, a casino, hospital, airport renovation and retail malls.
Further south, a number of tourism projects are driving growth, and automotive plans are underway in South Carolina. The Metro -- the Southeast Metro areas overall continued to represent large opportunities for both our Gen Rent and specialty operations.
And I want to give a shout out to our employees in the Southeast, who have been working long hours in disaster recovery mode following Hurricane Matthew. Our people are doing a stellar job of helping hard-hit communities in Northern Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas, and the restoration in these states could take years to complete. That's the U.S. snapshot. 
By contrast, the Canadian economy is still a challenge, compounded by the energy sector in Western provinces. Rental revenue from Canada in the quarter declined by approximately 10%.
Now the fine line for us in this environment is to invest enough growth capital to serve our customers and grow our business without adding to the industry imbalance of fleet. So we're walking that line really well in 2016. We continued to use a balanced strategy of deploying our CapEx in a very informed manner while also relocating our existing fleet away from softer markets.
The major beneficiary to our growth CapEx, as we've noted before, is our specialty segment. In the third quarter, specialty had a strong showing. Rental revenue for this segment increased by more than 9% in the quarter versus 2015. Now within that segment, revenue from Power & HVAC was up 17% and Trench Safety was up over 5%. The largest tailwind behind these 2 increases was same-store growth. We also had a 5% revenue growth in pump, where our strategy of end-market diversification is paying off, and we seem to be at a turning point in neutralizing the drag for upstream oil and gas. 
And finally, I want to give you an update on our digital strategy. We've gone from 0 to over $1 million a month in online orders in just 12 weeks. So while this strategy is still very young, we've seen enough to know it's got legs. Some of the business is coming from our existing customers who want the digital convenience and some are from first-time customers. And we're achieving both of our objectives with e-commerce, which are to increase the stickiness with our current base and to capture more customers to win new channel.
So to recap the quarter. There were no surprises. The company is solidly on track, and we're continuing to focus on with the many levers within our control. Demand is also on track, based on what we saw in the quarter and what we hear from our customers, and we believe the cycle still has runway ahead.
And our full year results should be near the upper half of our prior guidance in a number of key metrics, and we expect free -- our free cash flow to be more than $1 billion this year. 
Naturally, we're mindful of the uncertainty that continues to be prevalent in the global economy, but I also want to remind you that we have considerable flexibility in operating our business to address any change in market dynamics. It gives us a great deal of confidence in managing the business for the strong full year performance we have reaffirmed today. 
So with that, I'll ask Bill to discuss the numbers, and then we'll take your questions. Over to you, Bill."

As usual, we'll step through the highlights in the quarter and then update our outlook to finish up. So let's start with rental revenue. That was down $4 million year-over-year or 0.3%. Within that $4 million, r",1671,"Thanks, Mike, and good morning to everyone. As usual, we'll step through the highlights in the quarter and then update our outlook to finish up. So let's start with rental revenue. That was down $4 million year-over-year or 0.3%. Within that $4 million, re-rent and ancillary revenues in the quarter were actually up $5 million over the last year; as was the volume component, change in OEC on rent, which was a positive $26 million contribution from last year. 
The offsets to those were rental rates. That down 1.7% translates into about $19 million of year-over-year decline and our replacement CapEx inflation, which was worth about $18 million of year-over-year decline. The remainder was mix and other, which was a positive $2 million versus last year. So all of those net to the $4 million or 0.3% decline.
Within that rental revenue result, the Canadian currency impact this quarter was fairly minimal. The currency was basically unchanged from last year and so had no significant effect on the overall rental revenue performance. But if you look at the effect of the entirety of our Canadian operations, it still represented a headwind. Excluding Canada, our U.S. revenue -- U.S. only revenue would have been up 0.8%. So a significant impact from Canada, and we can touch more on the Q&A if there are questions. 
Our used equipment sales result for the quarter was $112 million of used equipment revenue. That was down $29 million or just under 21% compared to last year. That decrease was primarily driven by the high level of used sales that we had last year as we were moving equipment in response to the oil and gas challenge that we said it saw last year. So that decline in revenue we think was mitigated somewhat by the fact that we used our retail channel more significantly this year. 
In fact, you can see it in the adjusted gross margin result. Adjusted gross margin this quarter was 46.4%, and that was 2.4 percentage points better than last year. And certainly, that benefited from a much stronger use of the retail channel and much less use of auctions this year compared to last year. 
Moving quickly to adjusted EBITDA. The $747 million of adjusted EBITDA we reported was down $33 million versus last year, and that reflected the pressures that I -- or the puts and takes that I talked about in the rental revenue description. In particular, rental rates cost us about $19 million versus last year, but volume offset $17 million of that headwind during the quarter. But the inflation, however, cost us about $15 million compared to last year, and the used equipment result cost us another $12 million. Merit increases, we always call out, worth about $6 million year-over-year headwind, and then the mix and other was a $2 million positive impact. So those were the pieces of the $33 million year-over-year decline in adjusted EBITDA. 
Our adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter was 49.5%. That was down 80 basis points versus last year, and again, it reflects all the components that we talked about here previously. 
Just a quick update. Within that EBITDA performance was our Lean contribution for the year. Updating that progress, we ended the quarter at an annualized run rate of $96 million contribution from our Lean and other savings initiatives, and that compares to the $81 million we reported at the end of the second quarter. So making nice progress and, as all -- you all know, that we're targeting a $100 million run rate by the end of this year, and we still feel very comfortable about achieving that $100 million target by the end of December. 
On adjusted EPS, $2.58 for the quarter was up $0.01 versus last year. And again, it had de minimis impact from currency in the year. And obviously reflected the impact of the operational results that we talked about as well as the benefit of the share repurchase that I'll touch on a little bit later. 
Free cash flow during the quarter -- or excuse me, year-to-date period free cash flow was $846 million, and that was better by 300 -- almost $340 million compared to last year. And the primary drivers were lower rental CapEx spending. That was worth about $200 million -- $280 million compared to last year, right, for the year-to-date period. We also had lower cash taxes, roughly $41 million; and timing of working capital was a benefit versus last year of roughly $110 million. Those were the positives, and they offset, on a year-over-year basis, the decline in adjusted EBITDA that we've seen year-to-date. 
Our net debt finished the quarter at $7.7 billion, and that was down roughly $640 million compared to where it was in September of last year. Now a good portion of that change is timing, so don't extrapolate it to the year-end, but we're still going to finish the year with a very, very significant reduction in our overall net debt position. And I think that speaks to the cash flow benefits that we've been experiencing as well. 
On the CapEx front, our gross rental CapEx in the quarter was $423 million. That was up from last year about $15 million, and it brought our full year-to-date CapEx spend to $1.145 billion, on our way to that $1.2 billion to $1.250 billion range that we updated in our outlook, which, again, I'll again -- touch on again in a minute. Net rental CapEx for the quarter was $311 million. That's up from last year, and it primarily reflected the difference in used equipment sales as well as some timing effects. 
When you put it all together, our ROIC performance in the quarter was down 70 basis points to 8.3% in the quarter, obviously reflecting the impact of the operating measures, particularly rate, as we discussed previously. 
On liquidity, we finished the quarter with just under $1.1 billion of total liquidity, and that includes about $720 million so of -- or so of ABL capacity available to us as well as just under $300 million worth of cash on the balance sheet. 
The capital structure, just briefly, you all recall that, during the second quarter, we had some redemptions. We completed those actions during the course of the third quarter by redeeming the remaining $200 million of our 7 3/8% notes. We funded that redemption in Q3 by a draw on the ABL. 
So when you put all the actions on the capital structure together, for the year, we are at an annualized savings of about $30 million of interest for the future periods. So quick update on the share repurchase program. We bought $152 million worth of shares during the course of Q3. That brings our year-to-date total for share repurchase to $476 million. And if you extend the look-back to the beginning of this current authorization, the $1 billion authorization, we've now spent $587 million of that $1 billion of authorization that we have. 
Our plan for the remainder of this year is to continue on the pace that we've been. We've been talking about a pace of spend of roughly $150 million, $160 million a quarter, and we plan to continue on that pace in Q4. We have the flexibility to be able to execute the share repurchase. 
Just an update on the covenant and cash position. We finished the quarter with about $560 million worth of capacity for share repurchases under our restricted payments limitation plus the cash on the balance sheet. 
Let me finish out with an update to our outlook for the full year and a quick comment on October. The outlook you've seen in the press release, but just to hit a couple of key points. We've narrowed the range of most of our outlook measures in order to reflect the fact that we've got 9 of the 12 months already in the books. And so our rental revenue is now within a $100 million range of between $5.650 billion and $ billion -- excuse me, total revenue is within a range of $5.650 billion to $5.750 billion. EBITDA, we narrowed to a $50 million range, with the bottom of the range at $2.7 billion going up to $2.75 billion. And you've all seen the rental rate guidance. We've narrowed that to 2.1% to 2.3% declines for the full year. 
I mentioned and Michael mentioned, our CapEx plan right now, we're calling in a range of $1.2 billion to $1.25 billion, with any incremental spend being targeted at specific projects that we've been awarded and our need to spend in order to support those customer needs. 
And finally, we mentioned that our improved outlook for free cash flow takes us to at least $1 billion, call it $1.1 billion to -- excuse me, $1 billion to $1.1 billion of free cash flow over the course of the full year. 
Regards October. Our rate performance, so far in October, is trending toward flat to slightly down result for the full month of October on a sequential month basis. And if you look at where we are on the time utilization for the month of October, month to-date, our average is up about 80 basis points over where it was last year, and if you look at it just on a 1-day snapshot as of today, we're actually up 100 basis points over where we were on a comparable date last year. So that supports the trend in improvement in utilization that we would need in order to deliver the time utilization outlook that we have for the full year. 
That full year outlook is approximately 67.8%, and we would need something like 80 basis points each month the remainder of the year in order to hit that new time utilization guidance. 
So those are the key points that I wanted to make. I'll stop there and ask the operator to open up the call here for questions and answers. Operator?"

But at the small de minimis market share that they're at, I'm not sure that drives the changes in the marketplace as much as the other 70% that we don't have visibility to. For the 25 years in this business that I've been in, any market I participated in has somebody trying to get some share for various different reasons. So this is part of being in the rental business. You're going to need to sometimes protect share, sometimes gain share. I'll tell you that what we're focused on, in making sure we're not just chasing the last dollar or revenue, but profitability remains our focus regardless of what anybody else is doing. And just to put in context, when you think about all of the local, regional and maybe some semi-national competitors, it's a competitive market, but there's a lot of demand. And we feel that the absorption is better off today than it was 6 months ago of the fleet in the industry, and we're encouraged by that."

The good news is we do feel it's bottomed out. And so we don't know -- we're not counting on much of an uptick in upstream right now, but we are positioned in case there is one. I think the surprising element that not everybody in the call may recognize is that refining is still a pretty robust end market for us. We're up almost 12% in refining on a year-over-year basis. So not oil and -- not all oil and gas is a challenge for us, just really the upstream. And we're encouraged by that, and we think, this fourth quarter, there'll be even more activity. A lot of turnaround activity that our customers are speaking of. So we feel pretty good about that sector."

The difference is we still have some -- I think we still have some more year-over-year headwinds in Canada than we do just strictly in upstream. But the team up there has actually fought pretty well to even gain some sequential positives in the last couple of months. It's just the year-over-year headwind is still significant. Our rent revenue for the quarter was down 10.7%. But most of that was rate, that was a 5.3% rate decrease. But their volume, their OEC on rent's only down 4%, and that's after we pulled 8 -- over 8% fleet out of there. So we feel we've rightsized our business from a fleet, headcount and footprint perspective without damaging our ability to participate in whenever they get some tailwinds at their back. So they've done a good job mitigating that 10% through the P&L without weakening our positioning. Hopefully next year, they get some tailwinds."

So it has been by moving fleet around. We exhausted our resources in looking at what is needed. And by the way, it's -- we said we would spend up to, and that's still yet to be determined, but I thought it was prudent to make sure that we communicated that to everybody. If there is an opportunity for us to be able to reposition fleet at that time to satisfy that, we'll do that.

So we're not seeing a tremendous amount of difference between our overall business rate performance and National Account. What we are seeing, and it's a big part of our focus strategically, is that our National Account growth in Q2 was higher than what our overall growth was as a company. So to your point, there is greater visibility into it. It's already such a big part of our business. We used to have such an established baseline. But I don't think there's a lot of headwind or tailwind by customer segment because they're pretty well established, but the growth and the demand is still there in that space and that remains a key focus.

So that continues. You also heard that our rates are flat to slightly down. I think the industry overall is being more responsible in the way in which they're managing it. The imbalance is continuing to get better and better. So I give the industry a lot of credit for being responsible. So that would be part of it. There's a -- going to be a necessity for the industry as a -- in total to try to achieve higher pricing or drive better efficiencies or manage their business much more efficiently. So that, to me, gives me a lot of -- it gives me confidence as I see that those trends play out, as we've seen over the course of the year.

The remaining 3 months are going to be -- will make it pretty hard to move that full year rate down significantly. Just to give you a specific set of numbers, in order to get to that 2.1% decline in rental rates for the full year, October, November, December would all have to be down 0.2% each. That's not a ridiculous notion. But in order to get to the down 2.3% scenario for the full year, each of those months would have to be down 0.6% sequentially. I think it's highly unlikely that we're going to do that, and certainly even more unlikely that it will be worse than that. So I just look at the raw mathematics of what it would take in order to come outside of the range of rates that we've given. That 2.1% to 2.3% seems pretty well assured, and it's not ridiculous to think that, could we see minus 0.2% each month for the remainder of the year? It's not completely ridiculous. Even if we didn't see minus 0.2%, if we saw something worse in like November or December, we're still going to end up in a pretty decent place within that 2.1% to 2.3% decline range. One other point, just to preempt a question that we may get from someone. Our carryover for next year, if we hit the 2.1% scenario, would be positive 0.10% for the full year, right? So if we finish the year October, November, December down 0.2% each month sequentially, that gives the full year 2.1% decline, and our carryover going into the next year would actually be slightly positive. On the flip side, just to be fair, if we finish with the down 2.3% scenario, our carryover next year would be minus 0.9%. Not an incredible headwind to overcome in order to get to positive rate, but certainly, in the current environment, that would be a tougher starting point, but still one that doesn't make 2017 a complete wash. So that math is what gives me confidence, George, in saying that we're going to be in that 2.1% to 2.3% range that we gave."

So I don't think it's exactly accurate to say that EBITDA guidance went up $50 million. But to try to be a little bit more helpful, of the $100 million or so increase in our free cash flow guidance, the bulk of it was driven by a refinement in our view of working capital uses during the course of the year and a reduction in our view about how much nonrental CapEx we're going to spend over the course of the year. That working capital is a contribution from accounts receivable, is a contribution from timing of payables, and the nonrental CapEx was just a refinement in our view about what is it that we're going to spend in the way of leasehold improvements and nonrental assets like delivery trucks and service trucks. So capital, working capital and nonrental CapEx were the primary drivers of that improvement."

So we have been seeing some pricing pressure just on a raw basis year-over-year, and that's been the case for a number of months. I think it's encouraging, though, that we can still move the equipment through the channels that are most attractive and still keep the margins that -- at a pretty attractive level.

Before I begin, I want to mention our upcoming Analyst Day, which will be held on Thursday, December 1, in New York. We hold this conference every 2 years, and the webcast is the most attended event. 
This time, I will talk -- we're taking a deep dive into different initiatives we have underway, including customer strategies, fleet management, process innovations and other areas that demonstrate how we're maximizing the value of our company for shareholders. Hope you'll join us.
Now let's go into the quarter. Our operating environment played out largely as we expected. Demand continued to trend up, driving an increase in volume of equipment on rent. Our specialty operations continued to outperform both the rental industry and our company as a whole, delivering solid benefits to revenue, margin and returns. And major initiatives such as cross-selling are ramping up nicely. The revenue contribution from cross-selling has increased sequentially throughout 2016. In the third quarter, cross-selling to National Accounts grew by a robust 14% year-over-year.
Now these gains were offset by 3 ongoing headwinds in our industry. They are the Canadian economy, upstream oil and gas and the current fleet imbalance. But overall, the market continues to move in our favor.
Against this backdrop, we did a good job with rental revenue. On a year-over-year basis, revenue was essentially flat despite softer rates. We are pleased to deliver adjusted EPS of $2.58 per diluted share, and as well as adjusted EBITDA of $747 million at a margin of 49.5%. And free cash flow continued to be a robust $846 million through September, while our CapEx spending stayed on plan.
Now based on this performance, and given the visibility into the fourth quarter, we've narrowed some of our guidance to help you model our business. Now -- we now expect full year adjusted EBITDA to be at the top end of the range we've previously provided. We also feel confident that we can improve on our full year rate decline we forecasted earlier with no significant impact to time utilization. And we expect record free cash flow of more than $1 billion, which would exceed our original guidance. And as we consider the best way to service our large contract wins, we may buy up to an additional $50 million of fleet in the fourth quarter. So no surprises in terms of the cycle or our own performance. I would characterize it as being right on track.
Next I want to spend a few minutes on our operating environment. There are some positive indicators. Dodge has reported that new construction starts are up 22% sequentially in August, with the most meaningful gains coming from commercial and public construction. Nonresidential starts increased significantly, overall up 43% in August and another 5% in September. This is consistent with other U.S. construction data, which show that backlogs for large contractors hit a new high this year, and many of these jobs can take months or years to complete, which gives us added visibility into demand going forward.
Another key bellwether is our customer survey. Our customers felt good about their business prospects throughout the quarter. In fact, the August survey indicated the strongest optimism of the past 9 months. And the September employment report was also encouraging. It showed that jobs in the U.S. construction sector increased for the first time in months.
While there's some evidence of headwinds, such as a modest contraction in the Architecture Billings Index in August, overall, the market feels positive to us. So it's a lively marketplace for us in the U.S. with a strong pipeline of new projects breaking ground. 
Geographically, we're seeing the most growth on the East and West Coasts. On the West Coast, we're on 4 major construction projects that will run through at least midyear 2017. Another 2 sites are starting up this quarter. Solar power and automotive are 2 key verticals, and government spending in California remains robust. 
In the Mid-Atlantic, our business is trending up from the past 2 quarters with a healthy mix of projects. These include power and pharmaceutical plants, a casino, hospital, airport renovation and retail malls.
Further south, a number of tourism projects are driving growth, and automotive plans are underway in South Carolina. The Metro -- the Southeast Metro areas overall continued to represent large opportunities for both our Gen Rent and specialty operations.
And I want to give a shout out to our employees in the Southeast, who have been working long hours in disaster recovery mode following Hurricane Matthew. Our people are doing a stellar job of helping hard-hit communities in Northern Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas, and the restoration in these states could take years to complete. That's the U.S. snapshot. 
By contrast, the Canadian economy is still a challenge, compounded by the energy sector in Western provinces. Rental revenue from Canada in the quarter declined by approximately 10%.
Now the fine line for us in this environment is to invest enough growth capital to serve our customers and grow our business without adding to the industry imbalance of fleet. So we're walking that line really well in 2016. We continued to use a balanced strategy of deploying our CapEx in a very informed manner while also relocating our existing fleet away from softer markets.
The major beneficiary to our growth CapEx, as we've noted before, is our specialty segment. In the third quarter, specialty had a strong showing. Rental revenue for this segment increased by more than 9% in the quarter versus 2015. Now within that segment, revenue from Power & HVAC was up 17% and Trench Safety was up over 5%. The largest tailwind behind these 2 increases was same-store growth. We also had a 5% revenue growth in pump, where our strategy of end-market diversification is paying off, and we seem to be at a turning point in neutralizing the drag for upstream oil and gas. 
And finally, I want to give you an update on our digital strategy. We've gone from 0 to over $1 million a month in online orders in just 12 weeks. So while this strategy is still very young, we've seen enough to know it's got legs. Some of the business is coming from our existing customers who want the digital convenience and some are from first-time customers. And we're achieving both of our objectives with e-commerce, which are to increase the stickiness with our current base and to capture more customers to win new channel.
So to recap the quarter. There were no surprises. The company is solidly on track, and we're continuing to focus on with the many levers within our control. Demand is also on track, based on what we saw in the quarter and what we hear from our customers, and we believe the cycle still has runway ahead.
And our full year results should be near the upper half of our prior guidance in a number of key metrics, and we expect free -- our free cash flow to be more than $1 billion this year. 
Naturally, we're mindful of the uncertainty that continues to be prevalent in the global economy, but I also want to remind you that we have considerable flexibility in operating our business to address any change in market dynamics. It gives us a great deal of confidence in managing the business for the strong full year performance we have reaffirmed today. 
So with that, I'll ask Bill to discuss the numbers, and then we'll take your questions. Over to you, Bill."
36005,404024657,1058128,"United Rentals, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 20, 2016",2016-10-20,"Earnings Calls","United Rentals, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mike, and good morning to everyone. As usual, we'll step through the highlights in the quarter and then update our outlook to finish up. So let's start with our revenue. That was down $4 million year-over-year or 0.3%.

So let's start with our revenue. That was down $4 million year-over-year or 0.3%. Within that $4 million, re-rent and ancillary revenues in the quarter were actually up $5 million over the last year; as was the volume component, change in OEC on rent, which was a positive $26 million contribution from last year. 
The offsets to those were rental rates. That down 1.7% translates into about $19 million of year-over-year decline and our replacement CapEx inflation, which was worth about $18 million of year-over-year decline. The remainder was mix and other, which was a positive $2 million versus last year. So all of those net to the $4 million or 0.3% decline.
Within that rental revenue result, the Canadian currency impact this quarter was fairly minimal. The currency was basically unchanged from last year and so had no significant effect on the overall rental revenue performance. But if you look at the effect of the entirety of our Canadian operations, it still represented a headwind. Excluding Canada, our U.S. revenue -- U.S. only revenue would have been up 0.8%. So a significant impact from Canada, and we can touch on that more in the Q&A if there are questions. 
Our used equipment sales result for the quarter was $112 million of used equipment revenue. That was down $29 million or just under 21% compared to last year. That decrease was primarily driven by the high level of used sales that we had last year as we were moving equipment in response to the oil and gas challenge that we said it saw last year. So that decline in revenue we think was mitigated somewhat by the fact that we used our retail channel more significantly this year. 
In fact, you can see it in the adjusted gross margin result. Adjusted gross margin this quarter was 46.4%, and that was 2.4 percentage points better than last year. And certainly, that benefited from a much stronger use of the retail channel and much less use of auctions this year compared to last year. 
Moving quickly to adjusted EBITDA. The $747 million of adjusted EBITDA we reported was down $33 million versus last year, and that reflected the pressures that I -- or the puts and takes that I talked about in the rental revenue description. In particular, rental rates cost us about $19 million versus last year, but volume offset $17 million of that headwind during the quarter. But the inflation, however, cost us about $15 million compared to last year, and the used equipment result cost us another $12 million. Merit increases, we always call out, worth about $6 million year-over-year headwind, and then the mix and other was a $2 million positive impact. So those were the pieces of the $33 million year-over-year decline in adjusted EBITDA. 
Our adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter was 49.5%. That was down 80 basis points versus last year, and again, it reflects all the components that we talked about here previously. 
Just a quick update. Within that EBITDA performance was our Lean contribution for the year. Updating that progress, we ended the quarter at an annualized run rate of $96 million contribution from our Lean and other savings initiatives, and that compares to the $81 million we reported at the end of the second quarter. So making nice progress and, as all -- you all know, that we're targeting a $100 million run rate by the end of this year, and we still feel very comfortable about achieving that $100 million target by the end of December. 
On adjusted EPS, $2.58 for the quarter was up $0.01 versus last year. And again, it had de minimis impact from currency in the year. And obviously reflected the impact of the operational results that we talked about as well as the benefit of the share repurchase that I'll touch on a little bit later. 
Free cash flow during the quarter -- or excuse me, year-to-date period free cash flow was $846 million, and that was better by 300 -- almost $340 million compared to last year. And the primary drivers were lower rental CapEx spending. That was worth about $200 million -- $280 million compared to last year, right, for the year-to-date period. We also had lower cash taxes, roughly $41 million; and timing of working capital was a benefit versus last year of roughly $110 million. Those were the positives, and they offset, on a year-over-year basis, the decline in adjusted EBITDA that we've seen year-to-date. 
Our net debt finished the quarter at $7.7 billion, and that was down roughly $640 million compared to where it was in September of last year. Now a good portion of that change is timing, so don't extrapolate it to the year-end, but we're still going to finish the year with a very, very significant reduction in our overall net debt position. And I think that speaks to the cash flow benefits that we've been experiencing as well. 
On the CapEx front, our gross rental CapEx in the quarter was $423 million. That was up from last year about $15 million, and it brought our full year-to-date CapEx spend to $1.145 billion, on our way to that $1.2 billion to $1.250 billion range that we updated in our outlook, which, again, I'll again -- touch on again in a minute. Net rental CapEx for the quarter was $311 million. That's up from last year, and it primarily reflected the difference in used equipment sales as well as some timing effects. 
When you put it all together, our ROIC performance in the quarter was down 70 basis points to 8.3% in the quarter, obviously reflecting the impact of the operating measures, particularly rate, as we discussed previously. 
On liquidity, we finished the quarter with just under $1.1 billion of total liquidity, and that includes about $720 million so of -- or so of ABL capacity available to us as well as just under $300 million worth of cash on the balance sheet. 
The capital structure, just briefly, you all recall that during the second quarter we had some redemptions. We completed those actions during the course of the third quarter by redeeming the remaining $200 million of our 7 3/8% notes. We funded that redemption in Q3 by a draw on the ABL. 
So when you put all the actions on the capital structure together, for the year, we're at an annualized savings of about $30 million of interest for the future periods. So quick update on the share repurchase program. We bought $152 million worth of shares during the course of Q3. That brings our year-to-date total for share repurchase to $476 million. And if you extend the look-back to the beginning of this current authorization, the $1 billion authorization, we've now spent $587 million of that $1 billion of authorization that we have. 
Our plan for the remainder of this year is to continue on the pace that we've been. We've been talking about a pace of spend of roughly $150 million, $160 million a quarter, and we plan to continue on that pace in Q4. We have the flexibility to be able to execute the share repurchase. 
Just an update on the covenant and cash position. We finished the quarter with about $560 million worth of capacity for share repurchases under our restricted payments limitation plus the cash on the balance sheet. 
Let me finish out with an update to our outlook for the full year and a quick comment on October. The outlook you've seen in the press release, but just to hit a couple of key points, we've narrowed the range of most of our outlook measures in order to reflect the fact that we've got 9 of the 12 months already in the books. And so our rental revenue is now within a $100 million range of between $5.650 billion and $5 billion -- excuse me, total revenue is within a range of $5.650 billion to $5.750 billion. EBITDA, we narrowed to a $50 million range, with the bottom of the range at $2.7 billion going up to $2.75 billion. And you've all seen the rental rate guidance. We've narrowed that to 2.1% to 2.3% declines for the full year. 
I mentioned and Michael mentioned, our CapEx plan right now, we're calling in a range of $1.2 billion to $1.25 billion, with any incremental spend being targeted at specific projects that we've been awarded and our need to spend in order to support those customer needs. 
And finally, we mentioned that our improved outlook for free cash flow takes us to at least $1 billion, call it $1.1 billion to $1 billion -- excuse me, $1 billion to $1.1 billion of free cash flow over the course of the full year. 
Regards October. Our rate performance, so far in October, is trending toward flat to slightly down result for the full month of October on a sequential month basis. And if you look at where we are on a time utilization for the month of October, month to-date, our average is up about 80 basis points over where it was last year, and if you look at it just on a 1-day snapshot, as of today, we're actually up 100 basis points over where we were on a comparable day last year. So that supports the trend in improvement in utilization that we would need in order to deliver the time utilization outlook that we have for the full year. 
That full year outlook is approximately 67.8%, and we would need something like 80 basis points each month the remainder of the year in order to hit that new time utilization guidance. 
So those are the key points that I wanted to make. I'll stop there and ask the operator to open up the call here for questions and answers. Operator?"

For the 25 years in this business that I've been in, any market I participated in has somebody trying to get some share for various different reasons. So this is part of being in the rental business. You're going to need to sometimes protect share, sometimes gain share. I'll tell you that what we're focused on, in making sure we're not just chasing the last dollar of revenue, but profitability remains our focus regardless of what anybody else is doing. And just to put in context, when you think about all of the local, regional and maybe some semi-national competitors, it's a competitive market, but there's a lot of demand.

But the team up there has actually fought pretty well to even gain some sequential positives in the last couple of months. It's just the year-over-year headwind is still significant. Our rent revenue for the quarter was down 10.7%. But most of that was rate, that was a 5.3% rate decrease. But their volume, their OEC on rent's only down 4%, and that's after we pulled 8 -- over 8% fleet out of there. So we feel we've rightsized our business from a fleet, headcount and footprint perspective without damaging our ability to participate in whenever they get some tailwinds at their back. So they've done a good job mitigating that 10% through the P&L without weakening our positioning. Hopefully next year, they get some tailwinds."

As Matt mentioned earlier, we've been very good about looking at our fleet, managing our fleet and if you -- just remind everybody that we really didn't put any growth capital in our core business at all this year. So it has been by moving fleet around. We exhausted our resources in looking at what is needed. And by the way, it's -- we said we would spend up to, and that's still yet to be determined, but I thought it was prudent to make sure that we communicated that to everybody. If there is an opportunity for us to be able to reposition fleet at that time to satisfy that, we'll do that. But right here and now, and as Bill mentioned about what we're seeing in October on the utilization, it's actually up year-to-date and, on average, for the month of October.

And then, also, how do you think about looking into the first half of '17? Is the utilization still growing on those accounts in first half '17 versus first half '16? Obviously, I'm trying to think about the fourth quarter. You feel pretty good about your utilization growing. I even think you said about 80 bps. Rates, obviously, seasonally are down November to December, but in general, rates are still a little bit of a struggle sequentially, as we saw in August and September.

Now admittedly, they're all coming off different baselines, so you could imagine that National Accounts are going to leverage that spend, but that's already built into the baseline. So we're not seeing a tremendous amount of difference between our overall business rate performance and National Account. What we are seeing, and it's a big part of our focus strategically, is that our National Account growth in Q2 was higher than what our overall growth was as a company. So to your point, there is greater visibility into it. It's already such a big part of our business and we still have such an established baseline. But I don't think there's a lot of headwind or tailwind by customer segment because they're pretty well established, but the growth and the demand is still there in that space and that remains a key focus.

The remaining 3 months are going to be -- will make it pretty hard to move that full year rate down significantly. Just to give you a specific set of numbers, in order to get to that 2.1% decline in rental rates for the full year, October, November, December would all have to be down 0.2% each. That's not a ridiculous notion. But in order to get to the down 2.3% scenario for the full year, each of those months would have to be down 0.6% sequentially. I think it's highly unlikely that we're going to do that, and certainly even more unlikely that it will be worse than that. So I just look at the raw mathematics of what it would take in order to come outside of the range of rates that we've given. That 2.1% to 2.3% seems pretty well assured, and it's not ridiculous to think that, could we see minus 0.2% each month for the remainder of the year? It's not completely ridiculous. Even if we didn't see minus 0.2%, if we saw something worse in like November or December, we're still going to end up in a pretty decent place within that 2.1% to 2.3% decline range. One other point, just to preempt the question that we may get from someone. Our carryover for next year, if we hit the 2.1% scenario, would be positive 0.10% for the full year, right? So if we finish the year, October, November, December, down 0.2% each month sequentially, that gives the full year 2.1% decline, and our carryover going into the next year would actually be slightly positive. On the flip side, just to be fair, if we finish with the down 2.3% scenario, our carryover next year would be minus 0.9%. Not an incredible headwind to overcome in order to get to positive rate, but certainly, in the current environment, that would be a tougher starting point, but still one that doesn't make 2017 a complete wash. So that math is what gives me confidence, George, in saying that we're going to be in that 2.1% to 2.3% range that we gave."

But to try to be a little bit more helpful, of the $100 million or so increase in our free cash flow guidance, the bulk of it was driven by a refinement in our view of working capital uses during the course of the year and a reduction in our view about how much nonrental CapEx we're going to spend over the course of the year. That working capital is a contribution from accounts receivable, is a contribution from timing of payables, and the nonrental CapEx was just a refinement in our view about what is it that we're going to spend in the way of leasehold improvements and nonrental assets like delivery trucks and service trucks.

So I don't have the data from Q2 right here to give you a number. I'd -- certainly, on a year-over-year basis, I talked about the adjusted margin experience being up. If you look at the pricing underneath that margin experience, on a year-over-year basis, it's certainly down a little bit from last year. Let's call it 3% on a comparable unit basis, maybe a touch -- 3% to 4%, let's say, on a year-over-year basis, right? So we have been seeing some pricing pressure just on a raw basis year-over-year, and that's been the case for a number of months. I think it's encouraging, though, that we can still move the equipment through the channels that are most attractive and still keep the margins at a pretty attractive level. If you look at pricing relative to the original equipment cost of the fleet that we sold in Q3, I do have that compared to Q2, it wasn't a significant change, right, on a sequential basis, price as a percent of OEC. That didn't change significantly Q2 to Q3. So that might give you a little bit of an indicator of a sequential experience that we had in the fleet. Does that help?"

Before I begin, I want to mention our upcoming Analyst Day, which will be held on Thursday, December 1, in New York. We hold this conference every 2 years, and the webcast is the most attended event. 
This time, I will talk -- we're taking a deep dive into different initiatives we have underway, including customer strategies, fleet management, process innovations and other areas that demonstrate how we're maximizing the value of our company for shareholders. Hope you'll join us.
Now let's go into the quarter. Our operating environment played out largely as we expected. Demand continued to trend up, driving an increase in volume of equipment on rent. Our specialty operations continued to outperform both the rental industry and our company as a whole, delivering solid benefits to revenue, margin and returns. And major initiatives such as cross-selling are ramping up nicely. The revenue contribution from cross-selling has increased sequentially throughout 2016. In the third quarter, cross-selling to National Accounts grew by a robust 14% year-over-year.
Now these gains were offset by 3 ongoing headwinds in our industry. They are the Canadian economy, upstream oil and gas and the current fleet imbalance. But overall, the market continues to move in our favor.
Against this backdrop, we did a good job with rental revenue. On a year-over-year basis, revenue was essentially flat despite softer rates. We are pleased to deliver adjusted EPS of $2.58 per diluted share, and as well as adjusted EBITDA of $747 million at a margin of 49.5%. And free cash flow continued to be a robust $846 million through September, while our CapEx spending stayed on plan.
Now based on this performance, and given the visibility into the fourth quarter, we've narrowed some of our guidance to help you model our business. Now -- we now expect full year adjusted EBITDA to be at the top end of the range we've previously provided. We also feel confident that we can improve on our full year rate decline we forecasted earlier with no significant impact to time utilization. And we expect record free cash flow of more than $1 billion, which would exceed our original guidance. And as we consider the best way to service our large contract wins, we may buy up to an additional $50 million of fleet in the fourth quarter. So no surprises in terms of the cycle or our own performance. I would characterize it as being right on track.
Next I want to spend a few minutes on our operating environment. There are some positive indicators. Dodge has reported that new construction starts are up 22% sequentially in August, with the most meaningful gains coming from commercial and public construction. Nonresidential starts increased significantly, overall up 43% in August and another 5% in September. This is consistent with other U.S. construction data, which show that backlogs for large contractors hit a new high this year, and many of these jobs can take months or years to complete, which gives us added visibility into demand going forward.
Another key bellwether is our customer survey. Our customers felt good about their business prospects throughout the quarter. In fact, the August survey indicated the strongest optimism of the past 9 months. And the September employment report was also encouraging. It showed that jobs in the U.S. construction sector increased for the first time in months.
While there's some evidence of headwinds, such as a modest contraction in the Architecture Billings Index in August, overall, the market feels positive to us. So it's a lively marketplace for us in the U.S. with a strong pipeline of new projects breaking ground. 
Geographically, we're seeing the most growth on the East and West Coasts. On the West Coast, we're on 4 major construction projects that will run through at least midyear 2017. Another 2 sites are starting up this quarter. Solar power and automotive are 2 key verticals, and government spending in California remains robust. 
In the Mid-Atlantic, our business is trending up from the past 2 quarters with a healthy mix of projects. These include power and pharmaceutical plants, a casino, hospital, airport renovation and retail malls.
Further south, a number of tourism projects are driving growth, and automotive plans are underway in South Carolina. The Metro -- the Southeast Metro areas overall continued to represent large opportunities for both our Gen Rent and specialty operations.
And I want to give a shout out to our employees in the Southeast, who have been working long hours in disaster recovery mode following Hurricane Matthew. Our people are doing a stellar job of helping hard-hit communities in Northern Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas, and the restoration in these states could take years to complete. That's the U.S. snapshot. 
By contrast, the Canadian economy is still a challenge, compounded by the energy sector in Western provinces. Rental revenue from Canada in the quarter declined by approximately 10%.
Now the fine line for us in this environment is to invest enough growth capital to serve our customers and grow our business without adding to the industry imbalance of fleet. So we're walking that line really well in 2016. We continued to use a balanced strategy of deploying our CapEx in a very informed manner while also relocating our existing fleet away from softer markets.
The major beneficiary to our growth CapEx, as we've noted before, is our specialty segment. In the third quarter, specialty had a strong showing. Rental revenue for this segment increased by more than 9% in the quarter versus 2015. Now within that segment, revenue from Power & HVAC was up 17% and Trench Safety was up over 5%. The largest tailwind behind these 2 increases was same-store growth. We also had a 5% revenue growth in pump, where our strategy of end-market diversification is paying off, and we seem to be at a turning point in neutralizing the drag for upstream oil and gas. 
And finally, I want to give you an update on our digital strategy. We've gone from 0 to over $1 million a month in online orders in just 12 weeks. So while this strategy is still very young, we've seen enough to know it's got legs. Some of the business is coming from our existing customers who want the digital convenience and some are from first-time customers. And we're achieving both of our objectives with e-commerce, which are to increase the stickiness with our current base and to capture more customers to win new channel.
So to recap the quarter. There were no surprises. The company is solidly on track, and we're continuing to focus on with the many levers within our control. Demand is also on track, based on what we saw in the quarter and what we hear from our customers, and we believe the cycle still has runway ahead.
And our full year results should be near the upper half of our prior guidance in a number of key metrics, and we expect free -- our free cash flow to be more than $1 billion this year. 
Naturally, we're mindful of the uncertainty that continues to be prevalent in the global economy, but I also want to remind you that we have considerable flexibility in operating our business to address any change in market dynamics. It gives us a great deal of confidence in managing the business for the strong full year performance we have reaffirmed today. 
So with that, I'll ask Bill to discuss the numbers, and then we'll take your questions. Over to you, Bill."
36005,404024657,1058613,"United Rentals, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 20, 2016",2016-10-20,"Earnings Calls","United Rentals, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mike, and good morning to everyone. As usual, we'll step through the highlights in the quarter and then update our outlook to finish up. So let's start with rental revenue. That was down $4 million year-over-year or 0.3%. Within that $4 million, r",1674,"Thanks, Mike, and good morning to everyone. As usual, we'll step through the highlights in the quarter and then update our outlook to finish up. So let's start with rental revenue. That was down $4 million year-over-year or 0.3%. Within that $4 million, re-rent and ancillary revenues in the quarter were actually up $5 million over the last year; as was the volume component, change in OEC on rent, which was a positive $26 million contribution from last year. 
The offsets to those were rental rates. That down 1.7% translates into about $19 million of year-over-year decline and our replacement CapEx inflation, which was worth about $18 million of year-over-year decline. The remainder was mix and other, which was a positive $2 million versus last year. So all of those net to the $4 million or 0.3% decline.
Within that rental revenue result, the Canadian currency impact this quarter was fairly minimal. The currency was basically unchanged from last year and so had no significant effect on the overall rental revenue performance. But if you look at the effect of the entirety of our Canadian operations, it still represented a headwind. Excluding Canada, our U.S. revenue -- U.S. only revenue would have been up 0.8%. So a significant impact from Canada, and we can touch on that more in the Q&A if there are questions. 
Our used equipment sales result for the quarter was $112 million of used equipment revenue. That was down $29 million or just under 21% compared to last year. That decrease was primarily driven by the high level of used sales that we had last year as we were moving equipment in response to the oil and gas challenge that we said it saw last year. So that decline in revenue we think was mitigated somewhat by the fact that we used our retail channel more significantly this year. 
In fact, you can see it in the adjusted gross margin result. Adjusted gross margin this quarter was 46.4%, and that was 2.4 percentage points better than last year. And certainly, that benefited from a much stronger use of the retail channel and much less use of auctions this year compared to last year. 
Moving quickly to adjusted EBITDA. The $747 million of adjusted EBITDA we reported was down $33 million versus last year, and that reflected the pressures that I -- or the puts and takes that I talked about in the rental revenue description. In particular, rental rates cost us about $19 million versus last year, but volume offset $17 million of that headwind during the quarter. But the inflation, however, cost us about $15 million compared to last year, and the used equipment result cost us another $12 million. Merit increases, we always call out, worth about $6 million year-over-year headwind, and then the mix and other was a $2 million positive impact. So those were the pieces of the $33 million year-over-year decline in adjusted EBITDA. 
Our adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter was 49.5%. That was down 80 basis points versus last year, and again, it reflects all the components that we talked about here previously. 
Just a quick update. Within that EBITDA performance was our Lean contribution for the year. Updating that progress, we ended the quarter at an annualized run rate of $96 million contribution from our Lean and other savings initiatives, and that compares to the $81 million we reported at the end of the second quarter. So making nice progress and, as all -- you all know, that we're targeting a $100 million run rate by the end of this year, and we still feel very comfortable about achieving that $100 million target by the end of December. 
On adjusted EPS, $2.58 for the quarter was up $0.01 versus last year. And again, it had de minimis impact from currency in the year. And obviously reflected the impact of the operational results that we talked about as well as the benefit of the share repurchase that I'll touch on a little bit later. 
Free cash flow during the quarter -- or excuse me, year-to-date period free cash flow was $846 million, and that was better by 300 -- almost $340 million compared to last year. And the primary drivers were lower rental CapEx spending. That was worth about $200 million -- $280 million compared to last year, right, for the year-to-date period. We also had lower cash taxes, roughly $41 million; and timing of working capital was a benefit versus last year of roughly $110 million. Those were the positives, and they offset, on a year-over-year basis, the decline in adjusted EBITDA that we've seen year-to-date. 
Our net debt finished the quarter at $7.7 billion, and that was down roughly $640 million compared to where it was in September of last year. Now a good portion of that change is timing, so don't extrapolate it to the year-end, but we're still going to finish the year with a very, very significant reduction in our overall net debt position. And I think that speaks to the cash flow benefits that we've been experiencing as well. 
On the CapEx front, our gross rental CapEx in the quarter was $423 million. That was up from last year about $15 million, and it brought our full year-to-date CapEx spend to $1.145 billion, on our way to that $1.2 billion to $1.250 billion range that we updated in our outlook, which, again, I'll again -- touch on again in a minute. Net rental CapEx for the quarter was $311 million. That's up from last year, and it primarily reflected the difference in used equipment sales as well as some timing effects. 
When you put it all together, our ROIC performance in the quarter was down 70 basis points to 8.3% in the quarter, obviously reflecting the impact of the operating measures, particularly rate, as we discussed previously. 
On liquidity, we finished the quarter with just under $1.1 billion of total liquidity, and that includes about $720 million so of -- or so of ABL capacity available to us as well as just under $300 million worth of cash on the balance sheet. 
The capital structure, just briefly, you all recall that during the second quarter we had some redemptions. We completed those actions during the course of the third quarter by redeeming the remaining $200 million of our 7 3/8% notes. We funded that redemption in Q3 by a draw on the ABL. 
So when you put all the actions on the capital structure together, for the year, we're at an annualized savings of about $30 million of interest for the future periods. So quick update on the share repurchase program. We bought $152 million worth of shares during the course of Q3. That brings our year-to-date total for share repurchase to $476 million. And if you extend the look-back to the beginning of this current authorization, the $1 billion authorization, we've now spent $587 million of that $1 billion of authorization that we have. 
Our plan for the remainder of this year is to continue on the pace that we've been. We've been talking about a pace of spend of roughly $150 million, $160 million a quarter, and we plan to continue on that pace in Q4. We have the flexibility to be able to execute the share repurchase. 
Just an update on the covenant and cash position. We finished the quarter with about $560 million worth of capacity for share repurchases under our restricted payments limitation plus the cash on the balance sheet. 
Let me finish out with an update to our outlook for the full year and a quick comment on October. The outlook you've seen in the press release, but just to hit a couple of key points, we've narrowed the range of most of our outlook measures in order to reflect the fact that we've got 9 of the 12 months already in the books. And so our rental revenue is now within a $100 million range of between $5.650 billion and $5 billion -- excuse me, total revenue is within a range of $5.650 billion to $5.750 billion. EBITDA, we narrowed to a $50 million range, with the bottom of the range at $2.7 billion going up to $2.75 billion. And you've all seen the rental rate guidance. We've narrowed that to 2.1% to 2.3% declines for the full year. 
I mentioned and Michael mentioned, our CapEx plan right now, we're calling in a range of $1.2 billion to $1.25 billion, with any incremental spend being targeted at specific projects that we've been awarded and our need to spend in order to support those customer needs. 
And finally, we mentioned that our improved outlook for free cash flow takes us to at least $1 billion, call it $1.1 billion to $1 billion -- excuse me, $1 billion to $1.1 billion of free cash flow over the course of the full year. 
Regards October. Our rate performance, so far in October, is trending toward flat to slightly down result for the full month of October on a sequential month basis. And if you look at where we are on a time utilization for the month of October, month to-date, our average is up about 80 basis points over where it was last year, and if you look at it just on a 1-day snapshot, as of today, we're actually up 100 basis points over where we were on a comparable day last year. So that supports the trend in improvement in utilization that we would need in order to deliver the time utilization outlook that we have for the full year. 
That full year outlook is approximately 67.8%, and we would need something like 80 basis points each month the remainder of the year in order to hit that new time utilization guidance. 
So those are the key points that I wanted to make. I'll stop there and ask the operator to open up the call here for questions and answers. Operator?"

But at the small de minimis market share that they're at, I'm not sure that drives the changes in the marketplace as much as the other 70% that we don't have visibility to. For the 25 years in this business that I've been in, any market I participated in has somebody trying to get some share for various different reasons. So this is part of being in the rental business. You're going to need to sometimes protect share, sometimes gain share. I'll tell you that what we're focused on, in making sure we're not just chasing the last dollar of revenue, but profitability remains our focus regardless of what anybody else is doing. And just to put in context, when you think about all of the local, regional and maybe some semi-national competitors, it's a competitive market, but there's a lot of demand. And we feel that the absorption is better off today than it was 6 months ago of the fleet in the industry, and we're encouraged by that."

The good news is we do feel it's bottomed out. And so we don't know -- we're not counting on much of an uptick in upstream right now, but we are positioned in case there is one. I think the surprising element that not everybody on the call may recognize is that refining is still a pretty robust end market for us. We're up almost 12% in refining on a year-over-year basis. So not oil and -- not all oil and gas is a challenge for us, just really the upstream. And we're encouraged by that, and we think, this fourth quarter, there'll be even more activity.

But the team up there has actually fought pretty well to even gain some sequential positives in the last couple of months. It's just the year-over-year headwind is still significant. Our rent revenue for the quarter was down 10.7%. But most of that was rate, that was a 5.3% rate decrease. But their volume, their OEC on rent's only down 4%, and that's after we pulled 8 -- over 8% fleet out of there. So we feel we've rightsized our business from a fleet, headcount and footprint perspective without damaging our ability to participate in whenever they get some tailwinds at their back. So they've done a good job mitigating that 10% through the P&L without weakening our positioning. Hopefully next year, they get some tailwinds."

So it has been by moving fleet around. We exhausted our resources in looking at what is needed. And by the way, it's -- we said we would spend up to, and that's still yet to be determined, but I thought it was prudent to make sure that we communicated that to everybody. If there is an opportunity for us to be able to reposition fleet at that time to satisfy that, we'll do that.

So we're not seeing a tremendous amount of difference between our overall business rate performance and National Account. What we are seeing, and it's a big part of our focus strategically, is that our National Account growth in Q2 was higher than what our overall growth was as a company. So to your point, there is greater visibility into it. It's already such a big part of our business and we still have such an established baseline. But I don't think there's a lot of headwind or tailwind by customer segment because they're pretty well established, but the growth and the demand is still there in that space and that remains a key focus.

So that, to me, gives me a lot of -- it gives me confidence as I see that -- those trends play out, as we've seen it over the course of the year.

The remaining 3 months are going to be -- will make it pretty hard to move that full year rate down significantly. Just to give you a specific set of numbers, in order to get to that 2.1% decline in rental rates for the full year, October, November, December would all have to be down 0.2% each. That's not a ridiculous notion. But in order to get to the down 2.3% scenario for the full year, each of those months would have to be down 0.6% sequentially. I think it's highly unlikely that we're going to do that, and certainly even more unlikely that it will be worse than that. So I just look at the raw mathematics of what it would take in order to come outside of the range of rates that we've given. That 2.1% to 2.3% seems pretty well assured, and it's not ridiculous to think that, could we see minus 0.2% each month for the remainder of the year? It's not completely ridiculous. Even if we didn't see minus 0.2%, if we saw something worse in like November or December, we're still going to end up in a pretty decent place within that 2.1% to 2.3% decline range. One other point, just to preempt the question that we may get from someone. Our carryover for next year, if we hit the 2.1% scenario, would be positive 0.10% for the full year, right? So if we finish the year, October, November, December, down 0.2% each month sequentially, that gives the full year 2.1% decline, and our carryover going into the next year would actually be slightly positive. On the flip side, just to be fair, if we finish with the down 2.3% scenario, our carryover next year would be minus 0.9%. Not an incredible headwind to overcome in order to get to positive rate, but certainly, in the current environment, that would be a tougher starting point, but still one that doesn't make 2017 a complete wash. So that math is what gives me confidence, George, in saying that we're going to be in that 2.1% to 2.3% range that we gave."

So I don't think it's exactly accurate to say the EBITDA guidance went up $50 million. But to try to be a little bit more helpful, of the $100 million or so increase in our free cash flow guidance, the bulk of it was driven by a refinement in our view of working capital uses during the course of the year and a reduction in our view about how much nonrental CapEx we're going to spend over the course of the year. That working capital is a contribution from accounts receivable, is a contribution from timing of payables, and the nonrental CapEx was just a refinement in our view about what is it that we're going to spend in the way of leasehold improvements and nonrental assets like delivery trucks and service trucks. So capital, working capital and nonrental CapEx were the primary drivers of that improvement."

So we have been seeing some pricing pressure just on a raw basis year-over-year, and that's been the case for a number of months. I think it's encouraging, though, that we can still move the equipment through the channels that are most attractive and still keep the margins at a pretty attractive level.

And just to add, I know the mix answer more mathematically, but I would say it's a good opportunity to remind everybody of the fact that, strategically, we're still very committed to growing those high-return projects in specialty and cross-selling those projects, not only for revenue reasons but also for service reasons to our customers. The more solutions we can provide for them, we just feel that makes us a better partner for them. And I'll take that mix opportunity to promote that strategic view."
